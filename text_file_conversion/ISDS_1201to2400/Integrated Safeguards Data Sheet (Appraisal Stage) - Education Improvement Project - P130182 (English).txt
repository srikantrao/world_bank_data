                            upper secondary schools, and support improved quality and relevance in higher education

                         3. Project Description
                         The proposed project aims at supporting the Government of Armenia in two main endeavors:
                         enhancing the quality of pre-primary and general education, and fostering the relevance of tertiary
                         education through mainstreaming the Competitive Innovation Fund, or expanding it from a pilot
                         program to one with full implementation.

                         The Project consists of 3 components:

                         Component 1: Enhancing the Quality of General Education

                         Subcomponent 1.1: Promotion of School Readiness and equal opportunities at the start of General
                         Education - The objective of this subcomponent is two fold: first, it will support the Governmentâ€™s
                         efforts to increase preschool enrollment, focusing on vulnerable populations, as a means of
                         improving the school readiness of five and six-year-old children entering primary education. By the
                         end of 2017, it is expected that 90 percent of five and six-year-olds would be enrolled in preschool
                         institutions. Second, this component will finance activities aimed at improving the quality of
                         preschool education offered by community-based initiatives. Establishment of sustainable,
                         community-based preschool education units will be supported under a competitive grant financing
                         scheme.

                         Subcomponent 1.2: Enrichment of Upper Secondary Schools - The objective of this subcomponent
                         is to strengthen the recently established network of high schools by supporting the rehabilitation of
                         selected facilities in poor physical condition and improvements in all high schools in teaching and
                         learning conditions, including the provision of contextualized digital learning materials in classrooms
                         and modern equipment. This subcomponent will support the rehabilitation and refurbishment of a
                         limited number of high schools recently designated by the Government.

                         Subcomponent 1.3: Strengthening key institutions for monitoring educational outcomes and
                         monitoring student learning in Armenia - This component will improve the capacity of the National
                         Center of Education Technology (NACET) to monitor schools in Armenia and provide them with
                         adequate ICT coverage. This subcomponent will also provide financing for the participation of the
                         country in large-scale international student assessment studies.

                         Subcomponent 1.4: Support to further improvements in the quality of education through curriculum
                         revisions - The objective of this subcomponent is to bring the National Curriculum Framework for
                         grades 1-12 into conformity with the requirements of the General Education and State General
                         Education Curriculum law approved by the Government Decree No. 1088, dated July 28, 2011.

                         Component 2: Mainstreaming of the Competitive Innovation Fund (CIF) for Higher Education
                         Institutions (HEI) into full implementation

                                                                      Page 2 of 7
                         The objective of this component is to support the roll-out of the competitive grant program for HEIs
                         that was developed and piloted under the Second Education Quality and Relevance Project (EQRP2).

                         The fund was designed to support the best proposals prepared by HEIs with the aim of improving the
                         quality, modernization and particularly the labor-market relevance of the academic programs and
                         increasing efficiency, equity and the development of new academic programs of HEIs. This
                         component will support the assessment of the piloting of the CIF implemented under EQRP2 and
                         reviewing the grant-financing scheme based on the findings of this assessment. Representatives of
                         HEIs will be encouraged to participate in the CIF program and would be trained on proposals
                         preparation, project and financial management, procurement, monitoring and evaluation.

                         Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

                         The objective of this component is to provide continued s upport for the management and monitoring
                         of project implementation activities and outcomes. This component would provide funds for
                         monitoring and evaluation studies and for audits of project financial statements and grants
                         implementation. The Center for EducationProjects (CEP) under the Ministry of Education, acting as
                         a project implementation unit, will provide day-to-day management of the project, including
                         procurement, disbursement, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation, and will be responsible for
                         reporting on the implementation progress.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The Project will be implemented country-wide. Beneficiary educational facilities are not pre-
                         identified and, therefore, their locations are not known at present. A Feasibility Study will be carried

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
Public Disclosure Copy




                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The Project will finance upgrading of the existing school premises, which is associated with
                              modest environmental and social risks limited to the construction period and to the construction
                              sites. An important principle for selecting school buildings and for preparing adequate design
                              documents for their upgrading will be to screen them against any structural damage and instability,
                              and to address these faults or drop buildings which are beyond repair of structural problems. If the
                              designed works imply replacement of damaged roofs, there is a high likelihood of encountering
                              asbestos-containing old roofing materials. Handling of such hazardous construction waste at the
                              work site and its disposal will require close supervision and control, in order to minimize exposure
                              of construction workers and avoid future risks to public health that may arise in case of improper
                              dumping. It would be preferable to schedule rehabilitation works during school breaks. However if
                              and where that is not doable and works will be undertaken in buildings where classes are being
                              held, there may be a risk of disruption of the teaching process and to the health and safety of
                              students and teachers. Therefore, proper planning will be required for the provision of alternative
                              temporary teaching space, and for preventing children's entrance to the area of ongoing works and
                              to the locations where construction materials and waste is being stored. Minor indoor repair works
                              may be undertaken in the premises of preschool institutions under sub-component 1.1, which are
                              not likely to have any measurable negative impacts on the natural and/or social environment. As
                              all civil works will be rehabilitation of existing buildings (within their existing footprint) and no
                              new construction is expected, no resettlement is expected under the project. Moreover, no civil
                              works will be permitted under the Competitive Innovation Fund grants program.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              Rehabilitation of school buildings is expected to have strong positive long term social impact and

                              to be neutral for the environment.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              Analysis of alternatives will be part of selecting schools for the Project support. This multi-criteria
                              selection process will include screening of buildings with significant structural damage and severe
                              seismic instability. If reasonable investment into school rehabilitation cannot eliminate risks of
                              instability, such building will be excluded from the Project's work program.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                              According to the Project design, civil works will be implemented in multiple locations to be
                              identified during at a late stage of the Project preparation and early into implementation. The
                              nature of works to be undertaken in all of these locations will be pretty similar, with generally well
                              known environmental and social impacts. Therefore, an Environmental and Social Management
                              Framework (ESMF) was developed as part of the Project preparation process, while the site-
                              specific EMPs will be worked out later on, as the beneficiary institutions get identified and
                              detailed designs for their rehabilitation become available. The simplified EMP Checklist for Small
                              Construction and Rehabilitation Activities will be used for the predominant number of
                              construction sites, while a fuller version of EMP may be required in an unlikely case of higher risk
                              Category B works. A template of monthly field monitoring report is also provided in the ESMF, as


                                                                          Page 5 of 7

                           The Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) is the implementing agency for the Project. CEP,
                           under the MoES, will act as the Project implementation unit responsible for day-to-day
                           management of the Project implementation, including procurement, disbursement, safeguards
                           application, and M&E. Although MoES and CEP have been involved in the implementation of the
                           Bank-supported project in the past and performed well in that capacity, their experience in the
                           application of safeguards policies is modest as in difference from the present Project, the previous
                           activities did not include civil works are were classified as environmental Category C. The Bank
                           team discussed with the CEP institutional arrangements to close the gap in human capacity for
                           safeguards application. It was agreed, that for the period of the Project preparation CEP
                           management will appoint one of the staff members as a focal point for overseeing required
                           safeguards compliance work, and will hire an environmental and social safeguard specialist once
                           the Project enters into operation and resources become available. The specialist should have
                           relevant experience and skills, and will receive on-the-job coaching from the Safeguards Specialist
                           of the World Bank Task Team promptly upon recruitment. Hiring and maintaining a safeguards
                           specialist in CEP throughout the period of civil works performance under the Project will be a
                           legally binding commitment of the Borrower.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Schools, targeted by the project for upgrading of their premises, are under the MoES and hence
                           this Ministry is the main recipient of the Project assistance. Administrations and personnel of the
                           schools selected for rehabilitation, as well as the students attending these schools will directly
                           benefit from the Project interventions.

                           The advanced draft of the ESMF document was disclosed in-country in Armenian and English
                           languages by posting on the web page of the MoES. It was published through the Bankâ€™s InfoShop

                           as well. A public consultation meeting on the draft ESMF was held in Yerevan on 12/10/2013.
                           The ESMF was then finalized and re-disclosed in-country and through the InfoShop. Site-specific
                           EMPs, once drafted, will also be disclosed nation-wide, with special emphasis on their
                           accessibility to project-affected local communities. Draft EMPs will be open for public feedback,
                           after which they will be finalized and get included into tender packages. EMPs will be attached to
                           contracts to be concluded with works providers, and become mandatory for implementation.
