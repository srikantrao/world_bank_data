                         The project development objectives are to strengthen the performance of the public financial
                         management system; and establish the foundations for effective and
                         fiscally sustainable payroll and human resource management in the core civil ser
                         vice.
                         3. Project Description
                         A. Improving public finance management system performance. The public expenditure and financial
                         accountability (PEFA) assessment conducted in 2007 showed that K
                         osovo had made considerable progress in improving the public financial managemen
                         t system. In particular, the automated treasury system produces reliable reports
                         in a timely manner. However, weaknesses remain. Budgeting still fails to reflec
                         t strategic directions and multi-annual planning, payroll administration is not
                         subject to effective controls, while public procurement often falls short of pro
                         viding value for money. Budget under-execution has also been a persistent proble
                         m in recent years, primarily due to capital under-spending. Though capital budge
                         t execution increased dramatically in 2008, overall low budget execution (around
                         85 percent) suggests that problems in realistic budget planning and timely exec ution remain.

                          This component would finance technical assistance for PFM reform primarily in two main areas.
                         The first is capacity building for financial management in key bud                                  get
                         organizations. The specific content of this technical assistance would refle
                         ct the priorities of the Government's PFM Reform Action Plan with emphasis likel
                         y to be placed on budget formulation, budget strategy development, multi-year co                sting,
                         budget execution planning, in-year management reporting, and budget revie                          w
                         practices. This assistance would be targeted at agencies that have been identi                 fied by
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the Government and have indicated a strong interest to participate in pr           oject activities.
                         Tentative candidates include the Ministries of Education; Heal       th; Agriculture, and Justice.
                         Technical assistance would be delivered using the PEMTAG approach of on-the-job-mentoring. The
                         second area is procurement reform.                            This would focus on: (i) implementing a
                         Quick Gains reform program based on the                            relevant diagnostic study conducted
                         in 2008; and (ii) upgrading the current e-pr ocurement system with new functionalities for e-
                         transactions and procurement cycle management.


                          B. Improving payroll administration and laying the foundations for a professional civil service. The
                         current legal framework for the civil service established u                        nder UNMIK does
                         not distinguish the civil service from public sector employment                          or provide
                         for a grading structure. As a result, there is no consistency among c                         ivil
                         servants' job titles, levels of responsibility, qualifications, and salarie                     s. The
                         absence of a pay and grading structure undermines payroll controls and ma
                         kes meaningful policy on civil service pay all but impossible. In addition, the
                         current framework fails to provide any job security, therefore leaving civil ser             vants
                         vulnerable to political pressure, while the lack of career structure de-mo          tivates staff and
                         contributes to high rates of turnover.



                                                                      Page 2 of 5
                            The Government has now drafted framework legislation on the civil service. This limits the scope of
                           the civil service to professional and administrative positio                          ns in central
                           government and municipal administrations, thereby excluding public

                           employees engaged in service delivery and law enforcement. Therefore the new ci
                           vil service legislation would establish a uniform pay and grading system for the core civil service
                           only. It would also strengthen civil servants' protection fr om political pressure by offering tenure,
                           conditional on satisfactory performanc e. These measures are expected to strengthen incentives for
                           staff to remain in t he civil service and improve their performance.

                            To support these reforms, this component would finance technical assistance and ICT investments
                           for the following activities: (i) technical support for implemen ting the pay and grading reform; (ii)
                           establishing a sustainable training progra m for civil servants on key human resource management
                           functions (recruitment, gr ading, and performance appraisal); and (iii) upgrading the civil service
                           registr y (HRMIS), including linkage of the payroll database and HRMIS to the Treasury s ystem.
