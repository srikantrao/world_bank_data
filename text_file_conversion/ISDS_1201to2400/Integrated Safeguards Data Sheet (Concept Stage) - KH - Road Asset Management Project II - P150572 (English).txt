                           B. Project Objectives
                           The PDO of RAMP-II would be to support road preservation works on priority national roads
                           selected to maximize economic benefits, and to strengthen MPWT road maintenance planning,
                           contracting and management.
                           C. Project Description
                         1.       The RAMP II is a Repeater Project, which builds on the tangible progress made to date by
                         RAMP and is no longer processed as an Additional Financing to the Existing KH- Road Asset
                         Management Project. The new project would build on the achievements of RAMP to ensure the

                         continued effective use of the rehabilitated national and provincial road network. In doing so, the
                         follow-on project would improve the climate resilience and longevity of about 319 km of National
                         Roads 3 and 7 through the strengthening, repair and maintenance (through three-year performance
                         based maintenance contracts) of road surfaces, and installation of about 67 km of side-drainage in
                         flood prone areas along the roads. The new project would support the planning and development of
                         the road maintenance program by further enhancing the capacity of MPWT to carry out data
                         collection, processing and analysis necessary for effective road asset management of the national and
                         provincial road networks. It would also provide ongoing support to community-based road safety
                         and HIV/AIDs and human trafficking awareness campaigns.
                         The project has two main components. These are Component 1: Road Asset Management (Periodic
                         maintenance and strengthening of about 319 km of existing bitumen-sealed roads with an overlay of
                         asphalt concrete, replacement of current pavement with concrete pavement at flood prone areas) and
                         Component 2: Capacity Development (social and environmental safeguards training and monitoring).

                         The project will be implemented using the existing Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC)
                         organizational structure and institutional arrangements, particularly within MPWT. The Project
                         Implementation Unit supervising the activities for RAMP will continue to be responsible for RAMP-
                         II investments. The Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) is the formal point of contact between
                         RGC and IDA on all financial and legal matters related to the Credit for the Project, and represents
                         RGC in discussions on these matters. The MPWT is responsible for overall technical supervision,
                         execution and management of the project. The General Department of Public Works (GDPW) will
                         be responsible for the day to-day implementation, supervision and operation of the project, including
                         contracting and direction of all consultants, and will be the employer for all civil works contracts.
                         The General Department of Administration and Planning (GDAP) will carry out the financial,
                         safeguards, capacity development, training and public disclosure matters on the project. The General

                         Department of Transport (GDT) will be responsible for Road Safety aspects.

                         The RAMP-II will be implemented for a period of 5 years, from 2015 to 2019.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will cover repair and maintenance investments of four sections (Packages) of the
                         National Road (NR) No 3 (NR3) located in the southern part of Cambodia from Kampot
                         municipality to Veal Rinh district, and of the National Road 7 (NR7) in Kampong Cham located in
                         the central region. The works will be under MPWT’s responsibility as detailed below:

                         �       Package 1: AC Overlay and side drainages of NR3 (Kampot – Veal Rinh). Length 54km
                         with performance based maintenance for 3 years

                         �     Package 2: Side drainages of NR7 (PK75 - PK136) 61km and AC Overlay and Drainage
                         (PK136-196)60km with performance based maintenance for 3 years

                         �      Package 3: AC Overlay and Drainage of NR7 (PK 196 - PK268) 72km length with
                         performance based maintenance for 3 years

                         �       Package 4: AC Overlay and Drainage of NR7 (PK 268 - PK 340) 72km with performance
                         based maintenance for 3 years

                         The road sections are located in flat area connecting a number of provincial and district towns (i.e.

                         Kampot and Veal Rinh districts on NR 3 and Skun, Chheung Prey, Prey Chhor, Kampong Cham,
                         Suong, Memot, and Snoul on NR7), in which rapid growth in economic developments and increasing
                         demand for in-land transport are observed. The project will focus on preservation of the existing
                         assets and will not involve any civil works or expansion beyond the current public rights of way.

                         The MPWT carried out environmental and social screening along the two (NRs), which are divided
                         into 4 packages of road sections in November 2013. During the field survey, the ministry also
                         conducted consultations with Project Affected Households (PAHs) along NR7 during November
                         10-13, 2013 and on NR 3 on November 15, 2013. Outcomes of the screening process documented in
                         the report dated November 20, 2013 reveals that no major environmental and social impacts are
                         envisaged because the proposed road maintenance sections will be carried out on the existing road
                         alignments and within Right of Way (ROW). Some inconveniences may occur during construction
                         such as dust, noise, construction debris and short term disturbance to the daily business activities,
                         which however can be mitigated by applying good construction practices and close supervision. The
                         safeguard screening also confirms that no physical resettlement would be required and no ethnic
                         groups of people were found in the project areas. Nevertheless, minor relocation of temporary
                         structures/assets exposed to the ROW such as shop roof, small tree branches, hawkers, and cement
                         mortar made-floors extended from small shops or stalls along the ROW are anticipated.

                         No ethnic minority people were identified among 919 potential PAHs visited during the screening.
                         However, it was decided that the Indigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF) developed
                         under the original project would remain applicable for RAMP-II for precautionary reasons. Ethnic
                         screening will be conducted for all road sections to be supported under the project during detail
                         survey and design and before civil works start. If ethnic minority groups are found to be present in
                         or have collective attachment to project areas, Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) will be
                         developed as per the updated IPPF.

                         Similarly, no un-exploded ordinance (UXO) was found during the original RAMP and risks due to
                         UXO in the project areas were mitigated through the previous road projects.

                         These findings were reviewed by the Bank safeguard mission conducted for the road sections under
                         the Package 1 from Kampot to Veal Rinh (54km), and part of the road section under Package 3
                         between Skun and Snoul (72 km) during December 9-13, 2013. The safeguard review mission
                         therefore suggests that the safeguard instruments applied for the original project namely Environment
                         and Social Safeguard Framework (ESSF) including generic Environmental Management Plan
                         (EMP), Indigenous People Development Framework (IPDF) and Compensation and Resettlement
                         Policy Framework (RCPF) would be relevant and applied for the RAMP-II. There are no new
                         safeguard policies triggered.

                         The said original safeguard documents have been slightly updated (title and nature of new RAMP II
                         has been modified that leads to ESSF updates; RAMP-II will be solely financed by the bank;
                         RAMP-II included Lessons Learned from the Original RAMP Implementation (point II in ESSF
                         updated); indicated outcomes of the screening process documented in the report dated November 20,
                         2013; indicated budget for safeguards implementation for (i) strengthening supervision and
                         monitoring of safeguard compliance, including reporting, and (ii) safeguard training for ESO and
                         IRC secretariat’s staff with focus on social and environmental screening, ESIA review, social and
                         economic impact assessment, monitoring and reporting and meaningful consultation with PAPs; and
                         highlighted the issues of road safety and traffic management and mitigation measures in EMP) to
                         reflect lessons learned from the original project implementation, experience from the Lao Road

                         Sector Project and the new Law on Expropriation, 2010 which is not conflicting with the Bank policy
                         OP. 4.12. RCPF and IPDF are also integrated into the ESSF to address potential impacts on land
                         acquisition or asset loss, or on ethnic minority groups. The tools will be applied during the RAMP-II
                         for effective consultation and public disclosure.

                         There was neither site specific EMPs or RAP and IPDP prepared under RAMP-I because the
                         rehabilitation activities were carried out within the existing road alignments and ROWs, and neither
                         IP or resettlement issues were identified during the project preparation and implementation.
                         However, since the listed 4 road sections' packages are known in terms of locations and impacts,
                         MPWT will prepare site-specific EMPs and abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for these
                         packages while developing detailed designs for road repair and maintenance which are expected to
                         be completed by August 2014. In addition to road repair and maintenance work, RAMP-II involves
                         the construction of side drainage in urban areas within the ROWs which requires specific safeguards
                         instruments to mitigate potential impacts. The site specific EMPs and abbreviated RAPs, to be
                         prepared in line with the updated ESSF, will be subjected to public consultation and disclosed before
                         RAMP-II appraisal.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         With extensive experience in road construction and rehabilitation with various donors supported
                         projects and especially with the original RAMP, the MPWT recognizes the importance of
                         environmental protection and has demonstrated firm commitments to mitigating potential
                         environmental and social impacts during the original project. During the RAMP-II project
                         preparation, MPWT (i) conducted environmental and social screening throughout the proposed road
                         sections and consultation with potentially affected households to identify potential impacts, inform
                         them of the project, and obtain their feedback; (ii) updated the existing safeguard policy frameworks
                         on resettlement and indigenous peoples applied by the original project; and (iii) updated the ESSF

                         describing the screening criteria, the EMP, the CRPF and IPDF for the project and Technical
                         Environmental Guidelines (TEG, approved on June 11 2010). The TEG comprises: (i) generic
                         environmental specification for contractors, (ii) specific requirements for activities carried out in the
                         protected and/or naturally/cultural sensitive areas, (iii) environmental guidelines for design and
                         construction works, and (iv) operation guideline for monitoring and reporting.

                         In response to the request from the MPWT, the RAMP-II project will continue its support for
                         strengthening capacity of Environmental and Social Office (ESO, formerly called Environmental and
                         Social Unit) under the MPWT to ensure effective implementation of safeguards to mitigate potential
                         negative impacts at all stages (planning and pre-construction, construction, operations). With the
                         limited number and frequent turnover of staff, a more holistic capacity development program will be
                         developed by SEO/MPWT, with the support from the World Bank and consultants, and
                         implemented based on practical experience from the original program and similar road maintenance
                         projects in neighboring countries such as Laos and Vietnam.
