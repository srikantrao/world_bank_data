                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed project development objectives (PDO) are to enhance budget credibility, transparency,
                           and financial reporting of central government finances.
                           C. Project Description
                           Building on ongoing PFM programs, this concept note proposes a project that focuses on 3
                           components to build a good foundation and an enabling environment for sustainable PFM
                           strengthening, enhance budget credibility and improve budget execution:
                         (a)      Strengthening the PFM Environment (US$2 million). The objective of this component is to
                         set the foundation and create an enabling environment for sound PFM. This component will have 4

                         subcomponents: (i) legislative and institutional framework for PFM; (ii) strengthened macro fiscal
                         framework; (iii) medium-term debt management; and (iv) strengthened PFM training capacity.

                         (i) Legislative and institutional framework for PFM (US$0.4 million). A number of stand-alone
                         pieces of legislation and sets of rules and regulations governing various aspects of PFM have been
                         introduced over recent years. This subcomponent will include a comprehensive review of such laws
                         and regulations to identify and recommend measures to remove inconsistencies and fill gaps in the
                         existing PFM regulatory framework.

                         (ii) Medium-term macro fiscal framework (US$0.4 million). The GoM recognizes the need to carry
                         out macro fiscal planning for credible budgeting. The proposed project will provide consultancy
                         support to strengthen the macro-fiscal unit; prepare and train staff on budget preparation guidelines;
                         and set up processes and techniques to prioritize capital projects. The project will also support fiscal
                         planning with necessary computer hardware and software, including interfacing budget preparation
                         with the PAS for a more efficient budget preparation process.

                         (iii) Strengthened debt management (US$0.4 million). Given the large borrowing requirements, there
                         is great need for an analytical strategy that is based on rigorous cost-risk considerations to support
                         authorities in meeting their financing gap at lower costs. This subcomponent will support medium-
                         term debt management via strengthening the debt management unit, updating its debt management
                         strategy, and building capacity in order to reduce the country’s vulnerability to financial shocks. This
                         subcomponent will fund consultancy support to:
                         •         Strengthen the newly created middle office of the Debt Management Department to carry out
                         risk management by identifying the required institutional structures, defining roles and
                         responsibilities of the staff and providing on the job training;
                         •         Update the debt management strategy that would set out the objectives for debt management

                         and the development of a domestic debt sector and provide on-the-job training to staff on preparation
                         of a medium-term debt management strategy; and
                         •         Train a team of staff, which includes members from Economic Policy Planning Section and
                         Debt Management Department of MoFT and Maldives Monitory Authority, on debt sustainability
                         analysis tools to analyze the evolution of debt over time and to assess risks to debt distress.

                         In addition, the project will also support debt management with necessary hardware and software,
                         including interfacing budget preparation with the PAS.

                         (iv) Strengthened PFM training capacity (US$0.8 million). The objective of this subcomponent is to
                         enhance in-country training facilities that produce trained PFM staff on a regular and systematic
                         basis. This subcomponent will institutionalize PFM training by strengthening existing training
                         institutions/universities to provide formal PFM courses, including procurement-related courses.
                         Consultancy support will be provided for course and curriculum development; training of trainers;
                         and twinning arrangements where relevant.

                         (b)     Strengthening Budget Execution (US$3.7 million). The objective of this component is to
                         strengthen budget execution by improving the efficiency of resource utilization and the credibility,
                         comprehensiveness, and timeliness of financial reporting. There will be 2 subcomponents: (i)
                         strengthening the public accounting system and (ii) enhancing the control environment.
                         (i) Strengthening the public accounting system (US$2.9 million). The public accounting system will
                         be strengthened to improve financial reporting practices to include timely production of budget
                         execution reports, project financial statements, and other financial reports providing relevant

                         information, for example, on arrears, commitments, and contingent liabilities. This will be achieved
                         through:
                         •        Development of an information technology master plan that will give a comprehensive
                         overview of the short- and medium-term changes necessary to develop the interfaces between the
                         various systems and indicate the sequencing of the technical improvements;
                         •        Consultancy support for functional upgrades of the SAP in line with the IT master plan and
                         to support strengthened business processes;

                         years of the project with a gradual phasing out.
                         (ii) Strengthening the control environment (US$0.8 million). Consultancy support will be provided
                         to:
                         •        Strengthen business processes by producing a financial management manual underpinned by
                         a comprehensive review of PFM processes;
                         •        Update the Financial Regulations in line with the improved legislative framework for PFM;
                         •        Improve payroll controls via integration of human resources and payroll data;
                         •        Develop national bidding documents, establish a database of awarded contracts that is
                         publicly accessible, set up a grievance redressal process, and provide on-the-job procurement
                         training; and
                         •        Strengthen internal audit and internal audit committees specifically to include audits of
                         budget realization reports utilizing the computer-assisted audit technique capabilities inherent in SAP
                         and thereby enhancing the quality of the budget realization reports.

                         (c) Project Management (US$0.8 million). This component will provide support to the MoFT for

                         coordination, administration, communication, financial management, and procurement of the project.
                         The Government will establish a project management unit (PMU) at the MoFT to act as a
                         coordinating unit and as a central point of contact. The MoFT Financial Controller will head the
                         PMU and will also be the project director. A senior project manager with international experience in
                         PFM and project management will be assigned to carry out day-to-day project coordinating work on
                         behalf of the project director. Adequate powers will be delegated to the project manager to carry out
                         these tasks. Additionally, the PMU will have an assigned FM specialist and a procurement specialist
                         considering that the bulk of FM and procurement activities will be centralized at the PMU. The
                         project will finance the salaries/allowances of the project manager, and FM and procurement
                         specialists. Champions from each of the key departments that have a key role in implementation will
                         be assigned to liaise with the project manager. Champions will be selected from existing staff in the
                         respective departments. A high-level project steering committee chaired by the Minister of Finance
                         and represented by a broad range of stakeholders, including heads from respective departments/units
                         of the MOFT, MMA, Civil Service Commission, Attorney General and Office of the Auditor
                         General, will be constituted to monitor progress of the project. The project will support
                         communication and change management that will cut across all of the above activities.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                           The project interventions will be focused in the Island of Male, the capital of the Maldives, located at
                           the southern edge of North Male Atoll. All project counterpart agencies are based on the Male Island

                           The Maldives, being an economy driven primarily by nature-based tourism and also greatly
                           susceptible to the risks of climate chant, is greatly dependent on the natural environment for
                           economic stability and the wellbeing of its population. In recognition of the fact that sound
                           environmental management is essential in ensuring that the economic growth and development is
                           continual, the GoM has an adequate institutional and regulatory framework in place. This is driven
                           towards ensuring a high level of environmental integrity in economic operations.

                           The Ministry of Environment, established in 2004, acts as the pivotal agency responsible for the
                           implementation of environmental safeguards in the Maldives. The National Environmental Agency
                           (NEA), established in 2008, holds the mandate of formulating policies, regulations and standards
                           needed for the implementation of The Environment Protection and Preservation Act (EPPA) of the
                           Maldives, which was enacted in 1993. A National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) and an update
                           to the EPPA were completed in 1999. Several NEAPs have been implemented and they have served
                           as the GoM’s comprehensive framework for ensuring environmental protection and sustainable
                           development during the years of implementation. Environment plays a key role in national
                           development articulated in the Strategic Action Plan as well. A specific set of regulations on the
                           Management of Solid Waste was developed and enforced in early 2013.

                           Even though the Maldives has an institutional and regulatory framework for the management of
                           environment in place, the institutional capacity for the effective enforcement and regulation of
                           management aspects is weak.
