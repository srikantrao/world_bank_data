2. Project Objectives: The Project Development Objective is to help increase the utilization of
essential health services by pregnant women and children (0 to 5 years of age) in targeted
districts, and enhance the readiness of delivery mechanisms of the social protection system.

3. Project Description: The proposed cash transfer (CT) pilot program aims to support human
capital development by providing cash to poor pregnant women and mothers of young children,
with co-responsibilities to improve child nutrition and development. The CT pilot (i.e. the
Project) intends to reach around 3,000 beneficiaries in two districts in its first phase (proposed
until April 2016). Phase II envisages a potential scale-up to provincial level with regional or
national coverage after 2016 through a potential follow-up operation. The project would also
help develop institutional capacity at various levels of government and will strengthen linkages
with existing public health and nutrition services (such as the Health Equity Fund) as well as
with existing mechanisms for identifying the poor (Ministry of Planning’s IDPoor).

The project comprises the following three components:
•      Component 1: Support to the National Social Protection Strategy ($100,000): This
component will be implemented by CARD. The component's main activities include: 1) updating
the National Social Protection Strategy, 2) developing a unique registry of beneficiaries of social
programs, 3) undertaking research activities, among them collaboration with the impact
evaluation of the CCT Pilot (to be financed through a Bank executed TF), and 4) coordinating
actors at the national level, including outreach events to disseminate information about the
program and its impact evaluation.

•       Component 2: Conditional cash transfer and bonuses ($530,000): This component will be
implemented by NCDD-S. The component’s main activities include: 1) basic cash transfers to
enrolled beneficiaries through a “third party? financial institution, 2) cash bonuses for
beneficiaries based on specific co-responsibilities relating to health service utilization and
attendance to learning workshops; 3) financial institution fees for cash transfers, and 4) provision
of nutrition and sanitation workshops for enrolled beneficiaries. A basic cash transfer of $5 per
month will be delivered regularly after enrolment to pregnant women or families with children
aged 0-5 years that are categorized as IDPoor 1 or 2. Enrolment of pregnant women will be
subject to establishing contact with the health center for antenatal care. Enrolment of children
will be subject to presenting a birth certificate or vaccination card.

•      Component 3: Strengthening of SP implementation systems ($220,000): Activities in this
component include: 1) strengthening NCDD-S’ management information system (MIS) to
support implementation and monitoring and process evaluation; 2) strengthening the capacity of
commune councils and district level staff to interact with service providers, respond to program
needs including grievance redress, and monitor program implementation; and 3) other project
administration costs.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The CT pilot project will be implemented in two districts: Srey Snam (Siem Reap province) and
Phnom Srok (Banteay Meanchey province). All communes within the selected districts will be
covered. The criteria used for district selection include the following: district to be covered by
MoP’s IDPoor Program; availability of supply-side health facilities (particularly the Health
Equity Funds); capacity and commitment of the district and communes to implement and
monitor the CT pilot and to facilitate the provision of supply-side services. The ethnic screening
of the two pilot districts included in the project did not find any ethnic minorities present. If this
project proves to be successful, a follow-on operation may be implemented to scale-up project
activities to additional districts and provinces. In the event that such a follow-on operation is to
be supported by the Bank, a safeguard review and ethnic screening will be conducted during the
preparation stage and due actions will be carried out to ensure all safeguard policies are complied
with.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

This grant triggers OP 4.01 Environment Assessment in order to address the issues related to
inclusion of vulnerable groups of people in project activities. OP 4.01 addresses social aspects of
environment which among others includes inclusion and vulnerability. Cash transfers, which in
fact intend to address vulnerabilities, benefit a wide range of people and should therefore ensure
inclusion of all in project activities.

Further, this grant triggers OP 4.10 on Indigenous People. This is triggered due to Component 1
that will support a National Social Protection Strategy, even though there are no IPs in the two
pilot districts of Srey Snam and Phnom Srok.

Because both OP 4.01 and OP4.10 are triggered, the project is categorized as “B?. However,
there are no separate instruments required, even if project categorization is “B?.

There are no environmental concerns around any component of the operational cycle. No large
scale, significant or irreversible social impacts are anticipated. The project would not require any
land acquisition since it would not finance any civil works, and it would not have any negative
impact on the livelihood of local population. The result of ethnic screening did not find an ethnic
minority in project areas. The project promotes social inclusion and human capital development
by providing cash to poor pregnant women and mothers of young children, with co-
responsibilities to improve child nutrition and development. By providing support to local
authorities for implementing the cash transfer and community-level activities to promote health
and nutrition, the project envisages direct local participation in communication and case
management strategies. Field work will seek to address remaining questions on appropriateness
of communication, case management and other implementation strategies. Complaints
mechanisms to be developed to ensure marginalized populations are not excluded. There are no
ethnic minorities in the two selected districts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

By improving access to public health services and strengthening the local capacity, the project is
likely to have a positive social impact. However, the following indirect social impact of the cash
transfer pilot can emerge: (i) The project would rely on the Ministry of Planning’s ID Poor to
target beneficiaries (the ID poor procedure involved local community in providing feedback and
making decision on the final list of poor families). In the absence of clear communication about
the eligibility criteria for the cash transfer, there may be a perception of unfairness in cash
transfers. (ii) There is a concern about cash transfers leading to dependency on public assistance.
(iii) The role of private transfers, including community support and remittances, has been very
important for managing risk. The cash transfer from the government may to some extent crowd
out non-public transfers, even though the cash transfer amount is not large. However, these
impacts are not large scale, significant or irreversible.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

No large scale, significant or irreversible social or environmental impacts are anticipated.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

A comprehensive communications campaign would be developed and a complaints handling
mechanism will be established in order to ensure that local people in project areas in particular
vulnerable population who are potentially eligible for the program are well aware of the project
and can express concerns that they may have. The National Social Protection Strategy to be
updated under the project will integrate basic elements of an IPP. The terms of reference of the
consultant who will carry out activities related to the updating of the Strategy will include free,
prior and informed consultation with indigenous peoples organizations and the provision of
culturally appropriate benefits to IP communities.


5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key stakeholders are NCDD-S (in charge of pilot implementation and coordination), SPCU
(in charge of overall coordination and monitoring of NSPS implementation), line ministries (in
line with their mandate and strategic direction), local authorities and residents in the pilot
districts, and development partners.
