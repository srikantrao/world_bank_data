                         Finance, will on-lend to the participating district heating (DH) companies. The DH companies will
                         be responsible for the implementation of their respective investment programs financed under the
                         Project. The Ministry of Regional Development, Construction, Housing and Communal Services
                         (Minregion), which oversees Ukrainian municipal sector, will be responsible for overall Project
                         implementation as well as for capacity building of participating DH companies.

                         The Project consists of two components: (i) energy efficiency investments component; and (ii)
                         technical assistance and capacity building component.

                         Component 1: Energy Efficiency Investments (US$ 376.5 million: US$ 326.5 IBRD and US$50
                         million CTF). This component will increase efficiency of participating utilities, reduce their costs,
                         enhance reliability of their services and improve quality of heat supply. This component will cover
                         rehabilitation of boiler houses; closing of redundant boiler houses; installation of mini-CHPs;
                         replacement of network pipes with pre-insulated pipes; installation of individual heat substations
                         (IHSs) in residential buildings; installation of building-level heat meters and installation of SCADA
                         management systems to optimize heat production and supply of participating DH companies. This
                         component includes CTF co-financing that will cover installation of IHSs (together with connecting
                         pipes) and building-level heat meters.

                         This Component will target DH companies in the following municipalities: Chernigiv,
                         Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kamâ€™yanets-Podilsky, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovograd,
                         Mykolaiv and Vinnyitsia. The participating DH companies and municipalities were selected
                         competitively. Selection was based on governance indicators and financial indicators. Governance
                         indicators included: availability of boiler-level gas and heat meters; prevalence of residential
                         consumption-based billing ; availability of IHSs and /or readiness to install IHSs. Financial indicators

                         included: cost recovery level of heating tariffs; collection rate. All the participating DH companies
                         have 100 per cent gas meters in their boiler houses; almost all boiler houses operated by participating
                         companies have boiler-level heat meters. The average cost recovery of the participating DH
                         companies is 70 per cent (compared to 60 per cent average in Ukraine).

                         The size and details of investment programs have been finalized for the following participating DH

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The types of activities to be implemented under the Project will have either minor or no adverse
                              environmental impacts. More over, they will provide significant environmental benefits: reduction
                              in local pollution (dust and sulfur dioxide emissions); decreased emissions of greenhouse gases
                              (carbon dioxide). There will be no serious irreversible environmental consequences resulting from
                              the Project implementation. Negative environmental impacts will be local and primarily associated
                              with construction activities (e.g. dust, noise and other minor impacts of construction). Those
                              impacts will be mitigated through good construction and site-keeping practices. No potential large
                              scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts have been identified/ expected.

                              Physical works on most of the Project sites will take place at existing industrial/ district heating
                              footprint. Based on previous experience with similar investments, the rehabilitation / replacement
                              works are not expected to generate any hazardous materials that will require special disposal.

                              The acquisition of the municipally-owned land for the Project purposes is likely and may cause
                              some economic displacement. The Project works related to the rehabilitation of networks may
                              cause temporary economic displacement of light trade pavilions and/or street markets. These
                              adverse effects will be mitigated by provision of alternative land and places for trade, assistance in
                              moving or compensation for lost income.

                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              N/A
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              N/A
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                              The Project is classified as Environmental Category B. Since the investment programs of
                              participating DH companies are similar, a Program-Level Environmental and Social Assessment
                              (PLESA) was prepared by the Client and disclosed in every participating municipality. PLESA
                              covers the whole investment program financed by the Project in participating DH companies.
                              PLESA contains description of potential environmental and social impacts as well as mitigation
                              measures to address those. PLESA also contains monitoring plan to oversee the implementation of
                              the proposed mitigation measures. The site-specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs )
                              will be prepared by each DH company as a part of works design documentation. The abbreviated
                              Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared in cases where any economic displacement is
                              caused by the Project. The Central Project Management Unit (CPMU) in Minregion will be in

                           implementation of Bank-financed municipal projects (e.g., Urban Infrastructure Project). The
                           CPMU has a designated safeguards specialist who will supervise implementation of the site-

                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The key project stakeholders are: participating DH companies, local authorities and local
                           communities in municipalities where participating DH companies are located. Draft PLESA has
                           been disclosed and is being discussed in all Project municipalities (public consultations in two
                           municipalities have been completed; in remaining four they have been scheduled; the public
                           consultations are expected to be completed by the end of December, 2013). Project
                           Implementation Units (PIUs) of participating DH companies and the CPMU are responsible for
                           organizing public consultations in every city. Special training session was conducted for the PIUs
                           and the CPMU on October 31, 2013, to ensure they have sufficient understanding and capacity to
                           organize the consultations process. Site-specific EMPs will be prepared for each project site and
                           disclosed before works start. Where relevant abbreviated RAPs will be prepared, publicly
                           consulted on and implemented before the Project works start.
