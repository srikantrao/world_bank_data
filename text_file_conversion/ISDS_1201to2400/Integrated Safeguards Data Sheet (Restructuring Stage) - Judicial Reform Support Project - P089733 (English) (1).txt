                         3. Project Description
                         The JRSP includes the following components:

                          A. Institutionalizing Judicial Transparency and Accountability. This component will finance: (i)
                         periodic surveys of users of judicial services on access, quality and satisfaction with judicial services
                         and enforcement of judicial decisions; and public dissemination of the survey results; (ii) the
                         creation, implementation and dissemination of a legal framework for transparency, publication,
                         openness and accessibility of judicial decisions, processes and practices, including obligatory
                         publication of judicial decisions; (iii) the creation, implementation and dissemination of a legal
                         framework for using information and communication technology (ICT) for the GAS
                         ✂❨ Pravosudiye✂❨ (the evolving CGJ ICT system for case management, judicial statistics, and
                         convictions) and regulating, as feasible, the interface between it and other national ICT systems so as
                         to integrate the CGJ into the common information space of the RF; (iv) the creation, implementation
                         and dissemination of common case management standards, guidelines and processes; and (v) the
                         development and piloting of criteria, indicators and a policy to assess and periodically report on the
                         effectiveness of the judicial system, and related capacity-building.

                          B. Harnessing ICT for Judicial Transparency and Effectiveness. Current ICT systems are
                         fragmented and deficient. They negatively impact the quality of judicial decisions, facilitate
                         corruption, impede case management and prevent access to information that should be freely

                         available. The objective is to harness the enabling power of ICT to leapfrog transparency and
                         effectiveness constraints. This component mainly finances (i) ICT systems support for the Supreme
                         Court, the Judicial Department, the CGJ (on a pilot basis), the SAC, 79 arbitration courts and the
                         Constitutional Court with a view to facilitate an eventual move to a unified judicial ICT system and
                         (ii) judicial electronic archive systems.

                          C. Strengthening Human Capital. With the establishment of the Academy of Justice in 1998, the
                         judiciary enhanced its human resource capability. During the last five years, about 3,000 judges and
                         10,000 staff have been trained each year in new laws and other court-related topics. This is a major
                         achievement upon which future programs should be built. However, the demand for professional
                         development and training outpaces supply by four to one. This component finances IT-related
                         training for judges and judicial officials.

                          D. Project Governance, Change Management, Communications and M&E. This component
                         finances: (i) logistical and secretarial support for the Coordinating Council, sub-project management
                         teams, and a designated Project Support and Services Unit; (ii) development and implementation of a
                         change management strategy for the judiciary and a communications strategy aimed at the public;
                         and (iii) development and implementation of a project results framework and M&E indicators.
