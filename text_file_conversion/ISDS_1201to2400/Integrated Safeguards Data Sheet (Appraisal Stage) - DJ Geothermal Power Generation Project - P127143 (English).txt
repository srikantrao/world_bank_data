                            The objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient in assessing the commercial viability of the
                            geothermal resource in Fiale Caldera within the Lake Assal region.
                            B. Global Environmental Objective(s)
                            Same as PDO.

                         3. Project Description
                         Project Components

                         The proposed project supports an exploratory well drilling program financed by multiple donors. The
                         drilling program will follow a pre-approved test protocol and yield certified results. Provided that the
                         geothermal resource is proven to be commercially viable for large-scale power generation, a follow
                         on project will be undertaken to competitively offer the geothermal resource to the international IPP
                         market. In the event that the resource is confirmed for large scale power generation, the follow on
                         project will finance the recruitment of a Transaction Advisor that will develop a prequalification
                         process pursuant to Bank procurement rules that will be intended to result in a Public Private
                         Partnership under which an IPP will develop, operate and maintain a power plant under a long term
                         power purchase agreement. In the event that the resource is confirmed for commercial power
                         generation but at a level below that which attracts international IPP attention, other means by which a
                         viable power project can be developed will be considered.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be located at the southern border of Tadjoura Region, some 80 km (50 miles) west
                         of Djibouti city and some 45 km (28 miles) from Tadjoura City, near the Assal Lake.

                         The study area is situated in the Assal Rift, the northernmost extension of the East African Rift
                         System. The Assal Rift is an active spreading zone, with an impressive accumulation of basaltic
                         magma, and seismically active although large earthquakes are not common. The geology is
                         characterized by flat lying lava flows which generally erupt through vents on an open fissure
                         (Hawaiian eruption). The active volcanic area is traversed by the graben of the active spreading rift.
                         The large faults of the rift run from the Gulf of Ghoubbet El Kharab in a north-westerly direction to
                         Lake Assal.

                         Based on field test data, the stakeholders have concluded that the Fiale (or “Lava Lake?) caldera is
                         the location most likely to provide the best geothermal drilling results. The Fiale is surrounded by a
                         steep, 20 to 30 meter high, 1 1/2 km diameter rim. It is connected to two adjacent, smaller calderas
                         all of which are believed to be fed by the same magmatic heat source at depth. All three calderas are
                         cut by a dense network of east/west to north/west striking open fissures and small normal faults.
                         Based on water flow characteristics of the region, it is anticipated that the Fiale will provide
                         geothermal fluids that will be less saline than those encountered in past drillings targeted west of the
                         Fiale.

                         The proposed operation will include building of access roads and drill pads, water supply
                         arrangements and drilling of four deep geothermal exploration wells. The drilling pads will be
                         located in an area between Lake Assal and the sea (Ghoubet gulf).

                         The project area is a rough terrain, covered by basaltic lavas, and sporadic lake sediments. No actual
                         soil cover is found, and vegetation is limited to thorn bushes, few and far between. The area is bound
                         in the south-east by the Ghoubbet El Khalab, Lake Assal in the north-west, and by high fault
                         escarpments in south-west and north-east. The area is very dry and hot, temperature reaching 50°C
                         during the hottest period. Rain is negligible and surface run-off therefore limited to short periods,
                         measured in hours. There is no fresh surface water in the area. The ground water of the Fiale area is
                         believed to be seawater that flows from the bay of Ghoubbet El Kharab to Lake Assal. The
                         vegetation at the proposed drilling sites in the Fiale area is rather drear as the region is dry and in
                         many areas covered with lava. Vegetation is made up primarily of scattered steppe herbs, acacia
                         shrubs and occasional palm trees often in connection with geothermal manifestations.

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The proposed operation includes construction of access roads and operation of a quarry,
                              installation of drill pads and drilling rigs, erection of temporary accommodations, seawater supply,
                              drilling fluids use and associated cuttings, testing phase (including geothermal fluid discharge),
                              management of solid waste potentially containing heavy metals, and power generation.

                             The potential environmental impacts during construction identified as being of critical or major
                             significance consist of the following: noise from site preparation, drilling and construction;
                             contamination from waste pond overflows or chemical and fuel spills; contamination of aquifers;
                             and soil contamination from drilling muds and cuttings. Geothermal fluids typically contain a
                             number of dissolved metals and gases. Wastewater effluents and gases will be re-injected into the
                             reservoir or its periphery to minimize the potential for groundwater contamination. There is one
                             potential impact of operation identified as critical to the operation: improperly handled drilling and
                             well testing might lead to contamination of the ground water and potential impact on Lake Assal.

                             Since the drilling muds and the geothermal fluid are expected to have a high concentration in
                             heavy metals, an uncontrolled discharge would have long term effects on the environment if
                             mitigation measures are not properly implemented. The risk associated with all of these potential
                             impacts can be mitigated to low levels through measures proposed in the project safeguard
                             documents.

                             This project proposes activities and works that will have some effect on the natural environment,
                             and therefore is subject to OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment, which is the authority
                             governing the preparation and application of the ESIAF and its successor documents as described
                             below. OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats is also triggered due to the proximity of the proposed
                             project site to the sensitive ecological zones of Lac Assal to the northwest, and the Ghoubet Gulf
                             to the southeast. Possible negative impacts on these bodies of water will be addressed through the
                             application of an Environmental and Social Management Plan prepared by the Drilling Services
                             Company once the design of the drilling program is finalized. No other safeguard policies are
                             expected to apply to this project.

                             Social Safeguards: Traditionally, the Assal Zone is not known as a permanent living habitat,
                             because of the extreme climate conditions, of the lack of water and the scarcity of green areas. The
                             preparation of the ESIAF by the counterpart included consultations with relevant stakeholders.
                             The ESIAF indicates that the project area, in particular, the proposed drilling sites and its


                                                                        Page 5 of 9
                          surroundings are on state owned land, which attribution is decided by administrative authorities.
                          For purposes of implementing project activities, there will not be involuntary acquisition of land,
                          leading to involuntary displacement of communities and/or loss of income sources, habitat and

                          other resources

                          The ESIAF indicates also that the project area, in particular the drilling site, is an unpopulated area
                          with very limited local use. The closest identified communities are between 5 and 7 km away.
                          There will not be any displacement of people for the purpose of implementing project activities.

                          In terms of potential economic impacts, a transhumance route crosses part of the selected project
                          area as well as a tourist pathway. Though both are not used on a continuous basis, initial
                          mitigation measures have been proposed in the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
                          Framework so as to maintain both the route and the pathway functional to the extent possible
                          during project implementation.

                           The future and more detailed ESIA will seek to document the magnitude of usage of the
                           transhumance corridor (i.e. estimated number of animals/heads crossing the route, frequency of
                           passage) in order to assess the potential impact on users’ livelihoods, should the corridor be
                           partially closed.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           None anticipated.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Overall site selection is determined by the presence of an exploitable geothermal resource, and
                           well locations are selected based on information on the characteristics of the resource. The
                           availability of multi-directional drilling technology is being used to minimize the drilling pad’s
                           footprint. An alternative site called “North Ghoubet? has been considered as an alternative drilling

                           site. The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment Framework confirmed that, from an
                           environmental and social point of view, potential impacts are minimized in the Fiale area.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           At the time of appraisal, the precise technologies to be employed and the precise locations of the
                           drilling sites are unknown and cannot be known until the detailed drilling program design is
                           complete. As a result, the exact nature of any impacts cannot be determined and exact mitigating
                           measures cannot be designed until that time. Due to this residual uncertainty, the PMU has
                           completed an environmental and social impact assessment framework (ESIAF) detailing the
                           process to be followed to manage the risks associated with the project. The ESIAF was disclosed
                           in Djibouti and in the World Bank Infoshop prior to project appraisal.

                          The ESIAF contains foundational research and constrained sets of options for risk management
                          approaches that will help shape the future environmental and social management of the project,
                          which will be codified in a future document, the environmental and social impact assessment
                          (ESIA). The preparation of the ESIA, which will contain a detailed environmental and social
                          management plan (ESMP), will be the responsibility of the drilling services company (DSC)
                          selected to execute the drilling program designed by the geothermal consulting company (GCC).
                          As such, all bidders for the drilling contract will be required to submit an ESIA as part of their bid


                                                                      Page 6 of 9
                          package, and the quality of ESIA submissions will be graded as part of the bid evaluation process.
                          In addition, the services of the GCC will be retained to help in monitoring the drilling company's
                          adherence to the final ESIA.

                          The objective of the ESIAF is to: (i) describe the relevant legal and regulatory context of the
                          project; (ii) the current state of the environment in the project area and surroundings; (iii) identify
                          the potential environmental and social impacts, both positive and negative as appropriate, of the
                          exploratory drilling activity, as far as they may be determined at this early stage with certain
                          important information still outstanding; (iv) alternative options considered; and (v) establish the
                          procedure and parameters for the preparation of the detailed ESIA and its associated ESMP.

                          The ESIAF provides indications on which data should be recorded, the consultation process to be
                          carried out, and the instructions for the ESMP will include the definition of potential mitigation,
                          monitoring, and institutional measures to be applied during the implementation of the project in
                          order to offset or reduce adverse environmental and social impacts. It details the institutional
                          arrangements as well as the capacity-strengthening measures needed to ensure proper follow-up of
                          the ESIAF. If needed, the ESIAF can be updated from time to time, in agreement with the World
                          Bank.

                          The project management unit will include two dedicated safeguards staff: an Environmental and a
                          Social Safeguards Specialist. These Safeguards Specialists will be responsible for ensuring that all
                          environment and social impact mitigation measures including occupational health and safety
                          guidelines are mainstreamed into the project design; monitored and supervised in accordance with
                          the provisions of the ESIA, and for making bi-annual reports on safeguards compliance to the
                          World Bank. The Social Safeguards Specialist will also be responsible for logging and tracking
                          grievances (each grievance will be given an identification number and followed through by
                          recording details and timing for their resolution and closing out).

                          The drilling company will have direct responsibility for implementation of the ESMP, including
Public Disclosure Copy




                          all Environment, Health and Safety measures during the drilling phase. Adequate budget, staff and
                          material support will be provided to the drilling company’s environmental and social safeguards
                          coordinator to assist him/her to implement this mandate. The drilling company’s Safeguards
                          Coordinator will have experience coordinating and implementing HSE policies during drilling
                          operations and will, inter alia, prepare a monthly Health, Safety and Environment report.

                          Given the limited experience of the client, it has been agreed that the project management unit
                          social safeguard specialist will be assisted by an independent Environmental Health and Safety
                          (EHS) Audit Consultant. The EHS Audit Consultant will provide an independent monitoring of
                          the implementation of the environmental and social management plan. The ESIA will describe the
                          complete institutional arrangement and will include the terms of reference of the EHS Audit
                          Consultant. The ESIA will be attached to the bidding documents and contracts financed by the
                          proposed operation.

                           OP 4.12 is not triggered however mitigation measures are proposed in order to attenuate the
                           potential impacts of the project on an existing transhumance route and a touristic pathway.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The Assal area has not been the site of large population settlements or extensive economic


                                                                      Page 7 of 9
                           activity. It is very hostile for human or animal activities, due to extreme weather conditions, lack
                           of water and vegetation. The main population centers are close to the Tadjourah-Lake Assal road
                           junction and by the old road construction camp site at the Tadjourah road.

                           While preparing the ESIAF required for compliance with OP 4.01, the project management unit
                           and its consultant held initial consultations in January 2012 in the affected area and reported the
                           results in the inception reports. Additional, more extensive consultations were held in May 2012 to
                           obtain stakeholder input on the final scope of the ESIAF studies.

                           The ESIAF includes a public disclosure and consultation plan that provides for ongoing liaison
                           with affected communities during construction and operation of the geothermal facilities, and a
                           grievance procedure to ensure that issues of concern to the public are properly addressed.
