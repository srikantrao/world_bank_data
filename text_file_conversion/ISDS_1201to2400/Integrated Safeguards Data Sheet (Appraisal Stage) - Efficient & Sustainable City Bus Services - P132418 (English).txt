                         This proposed project intends to fund the incremental activities aimed to enhance sustainability,
                         energy efficiency, and quality of city bus services, and therefore the potential for GHG emissions
                         reductions from the baseline project.

                         The project comprises the following components:

                         Component 1: Capacity building and Technical Assistance on Policy, Regulatory, Fiscal issues (GEF
                         US$ 0.7M, co-finance US$ 2.0M): As part of this component, policy, regulatory and fiscal
                         constraints will be reviewed at national, state and city levels to promote efficient and high quality
                         city bus services and policy notes developed for discussion and debate among key stakeholders.
                         Capacity building initiatives involving development of knowledge materials, training activities,
                         knowledge sharing through website/newsletters and cross learning events etc. in cutting edge areas
                         aimed at development of the overall urban bus sector in the country shall form part of this
                         component.

                         Component 2A: City Demonstration Projects (GEF US$ 6M, co-finance US$ 113 M): This
                         component shall support physical improvements targeted at modernizing the city bus services in
                         demonstration cities including (i) modern depot equipment for improved maintenance and life of
                         buses, (ii) modern Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Management Information Systems (MIS)
                         - to make the services more user friendly and for improved planning and management of operations
                         to enable optimal use of resources. Four cities have been selected as demonstration pilots. These are
                         Bhopal, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Mira Bhayandar.

                         Component 2B: Capacity Building & Technical Assistance to Demonstration Cities (GEF US$ 2.1m,
                         co-finance US$ 0.92m) : The capacity building and technical assistance component is targeted at
                         supporting the modernization efforts of selected demonstration cities. These shall include to the

                         following kinds of activities (i) institutional strengthening, capacity building and training, (ii)
                         business planning including route planning and rationalization for better utilization of buses, (iii)
                         marketing and branding, (iv) technical support with private sector participation including
                         mainstreaming of informal sector, (v) vehicle and driver performance management with a view to
                         improving fuel efficiency, (vi) incremental operational expenses.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The candidate cities for demonstration investments are Bhopal (population 1.7 million), Chandigarh
                         (1 million), Jaipur (3 million), and Mira-Bhayander (0.8 million). Mira-Bhayander is part of the
                         Mumbai Metropolitan Region on the west coast of India. Chandigarh is a federally administered high
                         income city that serves as a capital of two north Indian states â€“ Haryana and Punjab. Jaipur is the
                         capital of Rajasthan, the largest state in India. Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh in Central
                         India and is known for its lake system.

                         The physical improvements under component 2A, targeted at modernizing city bus services in
                         demonstration cities are largely planned to be executed in the existing bus depots and bus stops.
                         However, iIn some cases such physical improvements and installation may be proposed at new sites
                         for bus depots too. In such cases both existing and new sites when identified would require to be
                         screened for any possible impacts on surrounding natural resources as applicable as well as need for

                         resettlement and loss of livelihood etc. For Mira Bhayander, due to its proximity to the coast,
                         mangroves covered areas are located close to two currently identified candidate sites and would
                         require protection/ suitable management measures. In Jaipur, one of the sites has a school located

                         close to its entry where increased noise could be an issue to be handled. An environment and social
                         framework prepared for ongoing India Sustainable Urban Transport Project shall be updated to
                         reflect new cities, sub project level activities any additional issues based on the potential sites to be
                         identified during the project preparation.

                         Most of the proposed sites for depots are on land already available with local government. No
                         impacts linked to LA and R&R have been identified with respect to the sub projects (depot sites)
                         screened currently. The screening also confirmed non presence of scheduled tribes close to the sub
                         project locations. However, the likelihood of additional depot sites with impacts on non-titleholders
                         cannot be ruled out. In situations where impacts on non-title holders are anticipated may be identified
                         in future, an Entitlement Framework has been prepared as part of the ESMF to address the impacts.

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:


                                                                     Page 4 of 7
                           The significant adverse impacts of the project are likely to be confined to the areas close to the
                           proposed depot sites and mostly concentrated within the depot sites. The construction of the depots
                           will require consideration of drainage, and of construction safety. In addition, in locations close to
Public Disclosure Copy




                           or in populated areas can have traffic related issues that would be managed. For example, in one
                           location in Jaipur, the impact on a school close to one of the depot sites would need to be
                           minimized. Mitigation measures like shielding receptors, or redesigning the depot lay out would
                           be adequately considered and documented in the city specific plan. In Mira Bhayander, a city on
                           the west coast, there can be impacts on mangrove plantation close to the sea in some candidate
                           locations. These would be subject to more comprehensive assessment if and when sites are
                           included in the project, and adequate mitigation will be planned for the removal/damage to these.
                           No other large scale significant impacts are expected. There will be permanent change in land-use
                           and drainage patterns where new depots are proposed.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           Indirect impacts may occur in areas where new operated routes may lead to development of more
                           economic activity or expansion of residential activity. Long term impacts are likely to be positive
                           since the bus depots will have improved facilities to maintain buses at a higher efficiency than
                           without the project.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Several different sites were considered for development of depots and sites with limited and
                           manageable environmental and social impacts are being developed under the project. Some sites
                           have been pushed into later phases to ensure that the environmental and social impacts are
                           properly assessed and adequate management plans are prepared. Alternative sources of energy to
                           power the depot equipment were considered and in cities like Jaipur, where local conditions are
                           suitable, solar photovoltaic cell as source of electricity have been included in the project. In
                           addition, specification for power equipment includes consideration of energy efficiency, and life

                           cycle considerations rather than just capital cost.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The cities (will) have agreed to the ESMF and will be/are preparing their city-specific plans to
                           mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts. They have also carried out screening of the
                           candidate sites already identified to establish the extent of impacts in advance. JCTSL has shared a
                           draft EIA document for their proposed activities, which is currently being reviewed by the Bank
                           and will be finalized by the completion of appraisal and duly disclosed. Other cities are also
                           preparing the EIA/EMP documents based on the ESMF which will be reviewed by the Bank.

                           In line with the ESMF, each city will designate an environmental and social officer for the project
                           who will ensure the implementation of the ESMP and/or EMP/RAP where required. This officer,
                           along with other city officials, will be trained in line with the ESMF to familiarize them to the
                           potential issues. Some of the implementing agencies have prior experience of handling
                           construction, while others like Jaipur and Chandigarh intend to outsource supervision of
                           construction to the respective specialized agencies â€“ RSRTC and Chandigarh PWD respectively.
                           These agenciesâ€™ staff will also be briefed on the requirements of the ESMF through the
                           environmental and social officer.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.


                                                                      Page 5 of 7
                           The key stakeholders for the project are staff of the specialized agency responsible for providing
                           the bus service in each city and people located close to the proposed depot sites. The users of the
                           bus services, and general population of the city are also part of the wider stakeholder group.

                           Consultations (will) have be(en) organized in each city to inform the people about the project
                           proposals and their feedback sought on the proposed management measures. These have been
                           taken into account in finalizing the ESMF. In addition, a consultation framework to guide
                           consultations during the implementation phase is also included in the ESMF.
