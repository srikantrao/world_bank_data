                         3. Project Description
                         The Integrated Modern Agricultural Development Project (IMAD) would finance investments in 33
                         counties/prefectures/cities in the six participating provinces/regions/municipalities. An approach that
                         balances infrastructure improvement with the promotion of climate smart agriculture practices and
                         the strengthening of the involved institutions and their sustainability is contemplated. Interventions
                         would be tailored to the local conditions and will be determined in consultation with line bureau
                         staff, technical institutions, farmer groups, local private sector representatives and local government.
                         Project areas are selected based on specified criteria such as clustered arable land with adequate
                         water resources but with infrastructure and technology gaps, vulnerability to climate shocks,
                         potential for agricultural modernization with demonstrative impacts, access to markets, etc. The total

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Based on the social and environmental screening at PCN stage and confirmed through further
                              project safeguard instrument preparation, five safeguards policies are triggered namely: OP4.01
                              Environmental Assessment, Pest Management (OP4.09), Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37), OP4.10
                              Indigenous people, and Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12) .

                             Environmental Assessment (OP4.01). Environmental impacts of the proposed project are overall
                             positive. Project activities, which have been selected based on the agreed selection criteria, are in
                             compliance with relevant water resources management plans. The project would generate real
                             water saving in project areas each year through the improvement of irrigation and drainage
                             infrastructure, and through the development of high-efficiency irrigation systems. In addition, the
                             project, by its design, promotes enhanced climate-smart agricultural practices. It will bring
                             multiple environmental benefits, such as soil conservation, reuse of crop resides, reduction of the
                             use of pesticides and fertilizers through balanced fertilization application and integrated pest
                             management. Negative impacts are mainly related to small scale construction activities which are
                             limited to the rehabilitation and improvement of irrigated agriculture infrastructure. These impacts

                                                                        Page 6 of 12
                         (e.g. noise, wastewater, waste, and disturbance to local communities) will be temporary, limited
                         and local in nature.

                         Pest Management (OP4.09). The project will include promotion of integrated pest management
                         and production systems that meet green and non-polluted certification standards. No procurement
                         of chemical pesticides is envisaged. The improved irrigation facilities and diversification of crop
                         systems may induce some pesticides use. But the environmental and health risks are minor.

                         Dam Safety (OP 4.37). The project financed irrigation systems will draw water directly from
                         reservoirs formed by 44 dams, including 43 existing dams and one dam under construction (DUC).
                         Jiangxi, Hunan, Gansu and Chongqing Provinces/Municipality, will hire one or more independent
                         dam specialists to assist the Provincial PMOs, under the terms of references agreed by the World
                         Bank, to ensure the project is in compliance with the OP4.37. For Xinjiang and Liaoning
                         Provinces, the Bank dam safety expert will work together with the client to review the dam safety
                         status and ensure the project is in compliance with the OP4.37. Dam safety plans and emergency
                         preparedness plans have been prepared for all the existing dams and for the dam under
                         construction. Over the course of project implementation, the client will prepare Dam Safety Action
                         Plans following the recommendations of the dam safety experts. The PMOs at all levels would
                         also assign special staff to assist the Bank team to ensure the project is implemented in line with
                         the OP4.37.

                         Social safeguards

                         Indigenous People (OP 4.10). The project activities in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and
                         Liaoning Province would take place in some areas populated with ethnic minorities (such as
                         Yanqi, Bohu and Fukang counties in Xinjiang as well as Lingyuan and Zhangwu counties in
                         Liaoning), mostly Uygur, Kazak and Mongol who were identified to fall in the definition of
                         Indigenous Peoples (IP) as per OP4.10; and hence the IP policy is applicable to this project. A
                         Social Assessment (SA) was carried out to intensify free, prior and informed consultation among
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the ethnic minority communities; and based on their interests and enthusiasm to the project
                         activities, the Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP) was developed to steer project design
                         and implementation for equitable opportunities for participation of the ethnic minority
                         communities and adequate benefits to be shared with them as compatible to their local cultures.

                         Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). During project preparation, it was proved that this project
                         would not envisage land acquisition and resettlement in all the six participating provinces. Most of
                         the project activities on infrastructure construction would rehabilitate the existing facilities on their
                         original bases, and the rest new facilities would be established on the village level. All the
                         facilities belonged to village communities, and no land ownership and the related property rights
                         change hands. However, because the project irrigation construction may sometimes connect to
                         upstream facilities, civil work conducted beyond the village internal level could not be completely
                         ruled out. A resettlement policy framework (RPF) was hence prepared for the six project
                         provinces. This safeguard instrument was prepared just in case any land might be taken
                         involuntarily from certain project villages.

                         In addition, linkage possibility with ongoing or previous activities was also assessed. In Xinjiang
                         project area, Baiyanghe reservoir in Fukang County was under construction and was seen as linked
                         to this project. A due diligence review of land acquisition for the reservoir was prepared and
                         confirmed that the involuntary resettlement was in line with relevant Chinese laws and regulations

                                                                     Page 7 of 12
                           as well as the Bank policy OP/BP4.12. All affected people and herders felt satisfied with the
                           resettlement measures and results they experienced. The Task Team concluded that there was no
                           involuntary resettlement legacy issue. The due diligence review report was disclosed locally on

                           Sept 20, 2012 and subsequently by the Bank Infoshop on Oct 18, 2012.

                           An environmental due diligence investigation for Baiyanghe Reservoir was also conducted by the
                           Research Center for Eco-Environmental Science, Chinese Academy of Science. It confirmed that
                           the reservoir was managed in compliance with Chinese EA laws and regulations which are broadly
                           consistent with the Bank policy, and that there were no outstanding environmental issues.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The proposed project supports sustainable and climate resilient agricultural production systems. It
                           is envisioned that in the future these production systems will be replicated in more areas, bringing
                           multiple environmental benefits such as soil conservation, reuse of crop resides, reduction in the
                           use of pesticides and fertilizers through balanced fertilizer application and integrated pest
                           management.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           Environmental Assessment. The client has engaged an experienced consultant to prepare an EMP
                           for the project in accordance with the Bankâ€™s requirements for OP.4.01 and Chinese EA
                           regulations. The EMP specified mitigation measures, monitoring plan, institutional arrangement
                           and capacity building activities. As part of the EMP, Environmental Code of Practices (ECOPs)
                           for a typology of construction activities have been developed, including measures for
                           rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure; water-saving irrigation; rehabilitation and

                           electrification of pumping stations and existing tube wells; and farm and field access roads. Those
                           measures will be entered into bidding documents and civil works contracts.

                           Pest Management. Based on the survey and public consultation with local farmers and farmersâ€™
                           cooperatives, a Pest Management Plan has been developed for each province addressing pest
                           management issues. The PMP incorporates the existing good pest management practices from the
                           project provinces and proposes a number of activities such as: (i) promoting IPM to reduce the use
                           of toxic pesticides, e.g. improvement of pest forecasting, use of bait lamps, crops rotation, pest
                           resistant varieties, and balanced fertilization. Pesticides will be reduced due to certification of
                           green and non-polluted production farmland; (ii) training and capacity building for local farmers
                           and governmental agencies; (iii) introduce and promote biological and botanical pesticides; (iv)
                           strengthening monitoring; and (v) reinforcing regulatory aspects. Implementation of the PMP will
                           be undertaken by the County PMOs, and farmer communities, with assistance of consultants,
                           County Plant Protection Stations and County Agricultural Technology Extension Services
                           Stations.

                           Dam Safety. Dam safety plans and emergency preparedness plans have been prepared for all the
                           existing dams and for the dam under construction.

                           Social: The Central PMO has hired professional consultants to conduct social assessment and


                                                                     Page 8 of 12
                          prepare the ethnic minority development plans (EMDP) for Xinjiang and Liaoning project sites, as
                          well as the resettlement policy framework(RPFs) for six project provinces to handle ethnic
                          minority development, and future land taking if any. The task team will provide training and

                          guidance throughout the project cycle. The EMDP, RPFs and due diligence report were reviewed
                          by the World Bank team and deemed acceptable, and in line with the World Bank social
                          safeguards policy.

                          The RPFs set detailed principles and procedures as well as other crucial requirements for handling
                          involuntary resettlement. In the case of involuntary taking of land, the RPF will guide the project
                          component design and implementation with Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), and mandatory
                          compensation for land acquisition and livelihood restoration are required during project future
                          implementation.

                          The EMDP emphasizes participation and consultation with local ethnic minority peoples, and sets
                          key principles and measures to ensure ethnic peopleâ€™s development and benefits from the project
                          in their culturally acceptable ways. Based on detailed SA studies and extensive consultation
                          among the Uygur, Kazak, Hui, and Mongol ethnic minority communities in the project areas in
                          Xinjiang and Uygur Autonomous Region and Liaoning Province, the EMDP sets forth a
                          Participatory Framework for these ethnic minority groupsâ€™ continuous consultation and
                          participation in project implementation. In the meantime, closely combined with project activity
                          design and fulfillment, it also makes a further detailed Action Plan for each of the ethnic minority
                          communitiesâ€™ irrigation infrastructure development and participatory capacity building.

                          The due diligence review of the linked Baiyanghe Reservoir land requisition in Fukang County
                          concluded that there was no resettlement legacy issue and the livelihood restoration of affected
                          people would take a while and will be included as part of the whole project supervision as well as
                          monitoring and evaluation exercises during the project lifetime. In all, the implementation of these
                          safeguards instruments will be monitored periodically during the implementation stage of the
                          project.

                           The PMO (SOCAD) has a rich experience in implementing World Bank-supported projects and
                           has successfully handled ethnic minority development, land acquisition under World Bank
                           projects without receiving any complaints in the past. The PMO will assign a dedicated staff to
                           coordinate safeguards work together with the local counterparts responsible for ethnic minority
                           development and any possible land taking in their respective project sites.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The EA safeguards documents (EMP, PMP) were prepared through consultation (e.g. interview,
                           meetings) with key stakeholders such as local farmers, farmersâ€™ cooperatives. The PMPs and EMP
                           documents were locally disclosed on Sept 5, and Sept 6, 2012 respectively through announcements
                           published on the local website. These documents were disclosed at the Bank Info shop on October
                           17, 2012.

                          The projectâ€™s key stakeholders would be the local farmers and rural villages in the project areas of
                          the six provinces/region/municipality (Gansu, Hunan, Jiangxi, Liaoning provinces, Xinjiang
                          Autonomous region, and Chonqging municipality). During project preparation, the project
                          information dissemination campaign and repeated rounds of communication and consultation were
                          carried out by POCADs, COCADs and local practitioners among the villages in all project areas.


                                                                    Page 9 of 12
                           In particular, social assessment exercise with PRA measures was intensively conducted by the SA
                           team among the ethnic minority groups. Of a total of 24 ethnic minority communities concentrated
                           with Uygur, Kazak, Hui and Mongol populations in the project areas in Xinjiang and Liaoning

                           provinces, 12 were selected by the SA team for detailed sample surveys and fieldwork, including
                           11 village meetings, 28 focus groups, 109 household interviews with PRA methodologies of the
                           seasonal calendars, wealth ranking, community resources mapping, and problem trees.
                           Information and alternative options about the project, plan of civil works, proposed locations of
                           project activities were shared and solicited with the public and key stakeholders during
                           consultation. The EMDP report was disclosed locally on August 27, 2012 and by the Bank
                           Infoshop on September 3, 2012. The RPF report was disclosed locally on August 27, 2012, and by
                           the Bank Infoshop on September 4, 2012.
