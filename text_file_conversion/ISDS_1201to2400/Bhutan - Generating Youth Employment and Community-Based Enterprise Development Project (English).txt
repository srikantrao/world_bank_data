B. Project Objectives
The project's development objective is to generate new and more productive sources of income for poor
and vulnerable youth in selected dzongkhags in south-western and eastern Bhutan. The proposed
project will achieve this objective by promoting the establishment or upgrading of existing youth-led,
managed, and operated business enterprises that aim at generating employment for poor and
unprivileged youth. In achieving this objective, the project will contribute to the national goal of
enhancing economic opportunities for unemployed youth, alleviating rural poverty, and reducing the
vulnerability of the local population in the poor and remote areas of the country which also are the most
vulnerable to climate variability.


﻿C. Project Description
The proposed project aims at supporting a pro-poor, youth-led, locally-driven enterprise development
approach to generating new opportunities for youth employment in the south-western and eastern
regions of Bhutan. Taking into account local need and social dynamics, the project would: (a) empower
the poorest and most vulnerable communities through support for capacity building and investment in
youth-driven enterprise initiatives; (b) create jobs for poor and unemployed youth through agricultural
and natural resource based activities, and (c) improve the lines of communication between the local
government and private sector entities and the unemployed youth in the poorest and most vulnerable
communities, building local capacity, and raising awareness of employment options and opportunities.
The proposed JSDF project will consist of the following four components that will be implemented over
the course of a four-year period:
Component 1:     Support Structures to Facilitate Youth-Led Enterprise (YLE) Development
(US$150,000). The objective of this component is to establish specialized project technical support
teams and equip them with the necessary capacity to assist youth living in the targeted communities to
identify, develop, and lead new business enterprises in a sustainable manner. The teams will consist of
specialists who have skills and experience in the niche products and services that the new youth-led
enterprises are likely to pursue. A preliminary assessment identified the following potential niche
products and services as those that can be developed with a modest investment and improvement in
existing skills (see Annex 2 which presents a longer list of potential products and services as well as the
types of support needed):
*  Jams, juices, and syrups processed from local forest and cultivated fruits and berries;
dried wild and cultivated fruits, berries, and mushrooms;
*  Cottage products such as traditional art and crafts, soaps, aromatic oils and incense, hand-made
paper, yak and sheep wool products, pottery for cooking and gardening, cane and bamboo items,
and other similar niche products for the tourism and hospitality sector;
*  Dairy products such as cheese and yogurt for tourists and local consumption;
*  Community-based tourism with home stay and hospitality services;
*  Non-wood forest products (NWFP) such as fodder, fiber and flosses, medicinal plants
(exudates), natural dyes, ornaments, honey, and beeswax;
*  Organic vegetables and seed production; and
*  Briquette production, fresh water bottling, and small-scale furniture enterprises.
In working with the youth, the teams will ensure that new enterprises in any one community involve
production and promotion of no more than three niche products or services depending on local
conditions. This principal follows a community-based business development strategy known as "One
Village-One Product" which aims to ensure a consistently good quality of the products, sufficient
quantity of the products to be marketed at the national and even global levels, and the development of a
brand that reinforces informal efforts at the community level to maintain needed quality and quantity of
products. Another important reason to focus on a limited number of products is that it will facilitate
broad-based mobilization and engagement of youth and other community members into enterprises to
ensure economies of scale and efficient marketing. The aim is to select products that are part of Bhutan's
cultural and environmental heritage, have local importance, and can generate demand outside of the
specific regions and ultimately as potential exports. The project would also seek to identify special niche
market products that have potential for export.


﻿Through this component, the project also is expected to enhance self-reliance by substituting imported
products with the new products produced in the project communities, and strengthen the community's
social fabric and pride through collective activities such as the branding and marketing of community
products at the local and national levels. To the extent feasible, the selection of value chains for the
proposed project will be coordinated with RRCDP activities, especially in terms of its horticulture and
non-timber forest products development, particularly in the western dzongkhags. Thus, citrus and other
horticulture production supported by the RRCDP in target areas can be linked to post-harvest processing
of these fruits by the YLEs. The same links will occur with activities based on the processing of
non-timber forest products. Component I includes three sub-components. The following are all aimed
at supporting youth in developing new enterprises in the project dzongkhags.
(a) Rapid Market Assessment and Business Planning. The project will fund rapid economic and
technical studies that will assess an area and its natural resources' potential for community-based
enterprises, ecotourism, and development of value-added niche products through simple, yet green
and creative processing. These assessments will fornulate ways to increase benefits for local
communities from these enterprises and support services and products. Based on community
discussions and a participatory decision making process, no more than three value chains for niche
products or services for any one community will be selected and studied for technical and economic
feasibility. There will be a corresponding number of master business plans developed for each
selected value chain to be used as a foundation for each enterprise. The master plans will have two
elements: (i) a market analysis to confirm the viability of and demand for the niche
products/services, and (ii) a business plan that follows a generic template (the template will be a
guide for enterprises in developing their own specific business plans). Based on the stakeholder
consultations, Annex 4 presents a list of potential activities that could be supported in the 10 project
dzongkhags.
(b) Project Advisory Network Establishment. Based on the results of the rapid market studies, the PMU
will support the establishment of a project advisory network (PAN) that will include representatives
of relevant state agencies (for example, Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts, Tourism
Council of Bhutan), educational institutions, NGOs (for example, Youth Development Fund, Royal
Textile Academy, Loden Foundation, Tarayana Foundation), and the private sector (for example,
senior staff of major local travel agencies, BioBhutan). The objective of the PAN is to select the
business proposals that will receive funding and then provide independent technical support and
overall guidance to young entrepreneurs from the initial stage throughout the enterprise
development and operation. Specifically, the PAN will:
*  Review and approve selected value chain business plans and small grant proposals
submitted by Youth Led Enterprises (YLEs) after they are reviewed by the project
management to ensure that the proposal meets basic criteria (see description of Component
3, section b);
*  Advise on branding and standards for local cooperative associations when they are
established.
* Provide advice and guidance on business opportunities.
* Assist in the establishment of an association of YLEs to ensure coordination of capacity
building activities, exchange of experience, joint procurement, and brand marketing.
* Assist in identifying experts and trainers with specialized expertise and resources that will
become members of the mobile training and mentoring teams (see below).
(c) Mobile Training and Mentoring Team Formation. The project will create a mobile training and
mentoring team (MTMT) consisting of competitively selected experts/trainers on the following


﻿topics: (i) entrepreneurial skills; (ii) business management skills; (iii) technical skills along selected
value chains; and (iv) ICT skills. Depending on the selected products for the value chain, the project
will recruit international (or local, if available) experts to train and coach MTMTs, and assist in the
preparation of a capacity building and mentoring program tailored to the needs of specific
enterprises. Specifically, the MTMT will:
*  Provide awareness building and technical advice to YLEs in the preparation of small grant
funding proposals which would be submitted for consideration to the Project Advisory
Network (PAN);
*  Advise and guide in the preparation of business plans;
*  Support the setting up of YLEs in project target areas;
*  Provide training and capacity building to YLEs in entrepreneurial, business, technical, and
ICT skills; and
*  Implement a mentoring and coaching program.
Through the MTMT, the project will identify young people from the targeted project area who are
capable, motivated, and interested in developing their own small-scale enterprise. These motivated
youth could serve as a catalyst for encouraging and mobilizing other unemployed or under-employed
youth to explore the route of entrepreneurship. The project will identify potential young people through
broad campaigns, using Facebook and other social networks, mass media at the national level, village
meetings, and information dissemination at the community level. It is anticipated that many of these
individuals will be youth with connections to the RRCDP or other development project areas who are
now living in the dzongkhag centers or other urban areas, and seeking employment or business
development opportunities.
Component 2: Youth Capacity Building and Empowerment (US$21 0.000). This component will aim at
empowering youth to set up and meaningfully participate in community-based enterprises, and equip
them with entrepreneurial, organizational, business, and technical skills to generate sustainable jobs and
income. This will be achieved through training and mentoring programs, learning by doing, and
exchange of experiences through established horizontal networks supported by the MTMT. This
component will include three types of core training activities:
(a) Capacity Building for Youth Empowerment (Organizational Development and Life Skills). Youth
groups will be provided with tailored training on organizational development and on life skills that
will boost their ability to participate actively in society. This capacity building will equip the young
people with an ability to make decisions, leading to an increased feeling of self-worth and
confidence based on problem-solving through participatory and active learning. It is expected that
after the young people receive this training, they will have more confidence and be more likely to
want to engage in the businesses developed in their areas, and their capacity to do so will be
developed throughout the life of the project. The design of this training will build on the experience
of the Youth Development Fund (NGO).
(b) Business and Technical Training in Specific Skills and Product Development. A special training
program will be developed on business skills, business planning, financial and records management,
and production and marketing rules. Technical training also will be provided on topics related to
adding value to specific niche products. The latter will be tailored to the demands of the youth
enterprises and needs of the value chain program, and provided by a MTMT comprised of
competitively selected private service providers. Private and state agents providing technical
training on niche products' design, production, and marketing will be identified, and the training
will be provided by relevant international and local experts (for example, topics may include


﻿textiles, industrial design, small scale fruit and berry processing, small scale cheese production, and
community-based tourism). This approach to upgrading skills will benefit not only the youth
residing in the project dzongkhags, but will be open to youth from other areas, especially in and
around Thimphu, resulting in a ripple effect.
Training will be arranged to ensure that the MTMTs can provide the initial and follow-up training to
YLEs, coaching, and mentoring. It is important to link payment to MTMTs between the training and
mentoring services of the project beneficiaries. MTMTs will be paid on the basis of their
performance. The payments will be made in two parts: (a) the first payment will be made after the
submission of training completion report and the YLE verification report, and (b) the second
payment will be based on coaching, mentoring, and follow-up support provided to YLEs over a 6-12
month period after receiving training. Capacity building and coaching will be delivered using
modern communication technologies. The project will use mobile training approaches to ensure
quality, cost effectiveness, and outreach to geographically isolated areas. Existing community
centers, classrooms (after school hours), and other spaces would be used.
The MTMT will establish a mentoring system with the YLEs to provide ongoing support using such
ICT technologies as mobile phones and the internet. It is expected that even if young people drop out
of project activities, the skills and qualifications (including certificate provided at the end of the
trainings) will enable them to seek quality jobs elsewhere.
(c) ICT training and application: The project will use ICT extensively to overcome the remoteness of
the target areas, and contribute to establishing stronger brand identity for local products. A mobile
ICT team will provide marketing support as well as help to create and maintain websites linked to
markets outside of the target regions. It also will help YLEs and community-based groups to
maintain communications networks aimed at marketing products/services, handle basic
management functions such as accounting, and access knowledge and information through
web-based training. Thus, this component will finance the procurement of ICT support for the
YLEs and community-based groups (such as forestry enterprises) and related training for their
members. This capacity building will address the currently low ICT skills in the region, where a
rapid assessment indicated that there is almost no use of ICT other than mobile phones which are
rarely used for data transmission.
Component 3: Operationalization of YLEs (US$640,000). The objectives of this component are to (a)
build capacity for establishing YLE internal governance arrangements that will ensure the sustainability
of the YLEs, and (b) provide seed capital to operationalize the YLEs.
(a) Capacity Building for Established YLEs: Institutional development and internal governance
arrangements will be supported through the same MTMT involved in the first project year in
establishing the YLEs. Particular attention will be paid to business accounting, transparency, and
rules for members to join or leave the YLE, sharing arrangements for input and marketing efforts,
and contracting arrangements. It is expected that the YLEs will attract additional persons once they
are operational, requiring a nimble administrative structure. For example, if jam is the niche
product, then multiple YLEs should be open to pooling resources and outputs to form a producer
group of high quality jam producers to meet market demand. In addition, there will be the need to
guard against elite capture of the resources that would be made available through the project. Thus,
the project's Internal Auditor will conduct simple financial and performance audits, which would be
made publicly available to communities to provide information on internal governance
arrangements and the recommendations for management improvements. A significant negative
audit finding would bar the YLE from accessing further project financing.


﻿(b) Grants for New Enterprises. YLEs will be eligible to compete for small business grants after
completion of the capacity building and empowerment program, which is expected to take place
during the first nine months of the project. Eligibility criteria will include (i) establishment of a legal
entity, (ii) completion of mandatory training, (iii) involvement of an agreed minimum percentage of
youth and women, and (iv) submission of an acceptable business plan. The Grant Administrator
and PMU staff will carry out a preliminary review of proposed applications for a grant. If the
proposal meets the minimum eligibility criteria, it will be sent to the Project Advisory Network
(PAN), consisting of independent evaluators with relevant and known expertise in the sectors
covered by this project, which would review and recommend the best plans to the project
management unit for funding. It is expected that the YLEs will contribute cash and/or in-kind
contribution to complement the proposed grant funding (it is proposed that the contribution will be a
minimum of 20% of the investment cost). The most successful business plans will be awarded small
grants for start-up enterprises in the first round. Those remaining can strengthen their business plans
and apply for start-up grants in successive rounds. There will be three batches of competition, one in
the first year (PYI), and two in the second year (PY2), with completion of all external financing by
the end of the third year. The maximum amount of an individual grant would be $5,000 and the
amount of financing to be made available to an eligible YLE will be based on the amount of
contribution from the YLE itself and the number of youth to be involved in the proposed venture.
The grant plus the small amount of each YLE's contribution have the potential to generate
additional funds from other sources. Disbursement of funds will be in tranches and contingent on
reaching milestones in the implementation of the business plans. Adverse audit findings would
affect any future disbursements.
(c) Strengthening of Market Linkages. This activity is designed to facilitate the marketing of new
products outside the product area. The types of assistance to be provided will depend on the needs of
the enterprises and the products produced. In the case of handicrafts or other niche items (for
example, organic soaps), products are sold mainly to tourists either in Thimphu, Paro, or Punakha.
Thus, this sub-component will be used to facilitate the marketing of the products in these cities'
centralized bazaars, at the airport in Paro, or other special locations. In Thimphu, for example,
project funds could be used to support the planning of one or more craft bazaars where crafts
produced in the project areas can be exhibited and sold. Funds also can be used to support the
organization of craft fairs in association with the Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts
(APIC), Handicraft Association of Bhutan, Tarayana Foundation, and others. During project
appraisal, MoUs between selected private sector organizations and NGOs will be pursued where
appropriate. The final design of this activity will take into account the existing role of middle-men
to ensure that they will continue to function as needed to facilitate the local producers' access to
market, without compromising the sustainability of the new enterprise.
Component 4: Proicct Management. Monitoring and Evaluation, and Knowledge Dissemination
(US$250,000)
This component will cover project management costs; implementation of a comprehensive Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy and Plan, which will include community baseline and follow-up
surveys; and dissemination of project results and lessons learned in project implementation.
(a) Project Management and Implementation Arrangements: For the day-to-day administration of the
project, the RGoB would establish an Independent Project Management Unit (PMU) within the
MoAF that will be responsible for overall management of all project activities. The PMU will have
a team consisting of a dedicated project coordinator, procurement and financial management


﻿specialist/accountant, youth capacity building specialist, business development specialist, and grant
administrator that will be recruited and funded by the project. The PMU team will provide oversight,
technical support, and guidance to the grantees and other youth enterprises. In the course of project
implementation, the project management unit will recruit a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
specialist and additional local and international technical assistance based on needs in line with
results of the assessments carried out during the initial stage of project implementation. The PMU
will also have oversight and be responsible for management of project funding. Coordination of
the implementation of the JSDF and RRCDP will help maximize and ensure synergies and
complementarity of efforts, ensure cost-effectiveness of investments, provide opportunities for
experience and lesson sharing, and facilitate a more comprehensive and holistic approach to rural
development.
The Grant Administrator will be a competent person selected from a NGO or civil society
organization, with experience working with the poor. The Grant Administrator will have overall
responsibility for the grant component, including; (i) developing outreach and application materials
and procedures for the grant facility; (ii) working with the national, dzongkha, and geog authorities
to disseminate the material to youth and youth organizations; (iii) providing technical support to
grant proponents for the preparation and submission of the grant proposals; (iv) consolidating grant
proposals and submitting them to the Project Advisory Network (PAN) for review and approval; (v)
managing grant disbursements and providing technical support to the grantees for the
implementation of the approved initiatives; (f) mobilizing specialized expertise to provide technical
support to the grantees when needed for the implementation of the initiatives; and (g) receiving,
synthesizing, and preparing progress reports for the approved initiatives to the RGoB and World
Bank.
A Project Steering Committee would be established under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MO
synergies and complementality of efforts as well as ensure government buy-in and commitment to
scaling up and replication of successful models of youth employment and enterprise development. It
would approve annual work plans, review monitoring reports, and support the use of existing local,
district,and national funding to benefit the youth employment efforts.
(b) Monitoring and Evaluation. Through this sub-component, the project will include dynamic
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to track input, output, outcome, and impact indicators to measure
the performance and results obtained from the implementation of the proposed activities. The M&E
activities, which will be integrated into the existing M&E system established by the MoAF, will be
participatory in nature, involving engaged youth groups and target communities in assessing (i) the
functioning of the YLEs, (ii) outcomes on youth employment and income generation, and (iii) the
impact of the project on community-based economic growth and livelihoods. Specifically, the JSDF
component of the larger project M&E system will:
*      Carry out a comprehensive baseline survey to determine the skills and income levels of the
targeted beneficiaries by gender and by age;
*      Carry out a qualitative assessment of the aspirations of women and men of various age
groups, especially the most vulnerable, through focus group discussions, to solicit feedback
on the challenges being faced by them, their views on solutions and coping mechanisms,
culture conflict issues, and generational gap issues, as well as feedback on the training
programs and how they can be improved;
*      Monitor quantitatively as well as qualitatively the outputs, outcomes, and development
impacts of the training programs on behavioral changes and productivity, track new and

B. Project Objectives
The project's development objective is to generate new and more productive sources of income for poor
and vulnerable youth in selected dzongkhags in south-western and eastern Bhutan. The proposed
project will achieve this objective by promoting the establishment or upgrading of existing youth-led,
managed, and operated business enterprises that aim at generating employment for poor and
unprivileged youth. In achieving this objective, the project will contribute to the national goal of
enhancing economic opportunities for unemployed youth, alleviating rural poverty, and reducing the
vulnerability of the local population in the poor and remote areas of the country which also are the most
vulnerable to climate variability.


﻿C. Project Description
The proposed project aims at supporting a pro-poor, youth-led, locally-driven enterprise development
approach to generating new opportunities for youth employment in the south-western and eastern
regions of Bhutan. Taking into account local need and social dynamics, the project would: (a) empower
the poorest and most vulnerable communities through support for capacity building and investment in
youth-driven enterprise initiatives; (b) create jobs for poor and unemployed youth through agricultural
and natural resource based activities, and (c) improve the lines of communication between the local
government and private sector entities and the unemployed youth in the poorest and most vulnerable
communities, building local capacity, and raising awareness of employment options and opportunities.
The proposed JSDF project will consist of the following four components that will be implemented over
the course of a four-year period:
Component 1:     Support Structures to Facilitate Youth-Led Enterprise (YLE) Development
(US$150,000). The objective of this component is to establish specialized project technical support
teams and equip them with the necessary capacity to assist youth living in the targeted communities to
identify, develop, and lead new business enterprises in a sustainable manner. The teams will consist of
specialists who have skills and experience in the niche products and services that the new youth-led
enterprises are likely to pursue. A preliminary assessment identified the following potential niche
products and services as those that can be developed with a modest investment and improvement in
existing skills (see Annex 2 which presents a longer list of potential products and services as well as the
types of support needed):
*  Jams, juices, and syrups processed from local forest and cultivated fruits and berries;
dried wild and cultivated fruits, berries, and mushrooms;
*  Cottage products such as traditional art and crafts, soaps, aromatic oils and incense, hand-made
paper, yak and sheep wool products, pottery for cooking and gardening, cane and bamboo items,
and other similar niche products for the tourism and hospitality sector;
*   Dairy products such as cheese and yogurt for tourists and local consumption;
*  Community-based tourism with home stay and hospitality services;
*  Non-wood forest products (NWFP) such as fodder, fiber and flosses, medicinal plants
(exudates), natural dyes, ornaments, honey, and beeswax;
*  Organic vegetables and seed production; and
*  Briquette production, fresh water bottling, and small-scale furniture enterprises.
In working with the youth, the teams will ensure that new enterprises in any one community involve
production and promotion of no more than three niche products or services depending on local
conditions. This principal follows a community-based business development strategy known as "One
Village-One Product" which aims to ensure a consistently good quality of the products, sufficient
quantity of the products to be marketed at the national and even global levels, and the development of a
brand that reinforces informal efforts at the community level to maintain needed quality and quantity of

broad-based mobilization and engagement of youth and other community members into enterprises to
ensure economies of scale and efficient marketing. The aim is to select products that are part of Bhutan's
cultural and environmental heritage, have local importance, and can generate demand outside of the
specific regions and ultimately as potential exports. The project would also seek to identify special niche
market products that have potential for export.


﻿Through this component, the project also is expected to enhance self-reliance by substituting imported
products with the new products produced in the project communities, and strengthen the community's
social fabric and pride through collective activities such as the branding and marketing of community
products at the local and national levels. To the extent feasible, the selection of value chains for the
proposed project will be coordinated with RRCDP activities, especially in terms of its horticulture and
non-timber forest products development, particularly in the western dzongkhags. Thus, citrus and other
horticulture production supported by the RRCDP in target areas can be linked to post-harvest processing
of these fruits by the YLEs. The same links will occur with activities based on the processing of
non-timber forest products. Component I includes three sub-components. The following are all aimed
at supporting youth in developing new enterprises in the project dzongkhags.
(a) Rapid Market Assessment and Business Planning. The project will fund rapid economic and
technical studies that will assess an area and its natural resources' potential for community-based
enterprises, ecotourism, and development of value-added niche products through simple, yet green
and creative processing. These assessments will formulate ways to increase benefits for local
communities from these enterprises and support services and products. Based on community
discussions and a participatory decision making process, no more than three value chains for niche
products or services for any one community will be selected and studied for technical and economic
feasibility. There will be a corresponding number of master business plans developed for each
selected value chain to be used as a foundation for each enterprise. The master plans will have two
elements: (i) a market analysis to confirm the viability of and demand for the niche
products/services, and (ii) a business plan that follows a generic template (the template will be a
guide for enterprises in developing their own specific business plans). Based on the stakeholder
consultations, Annex 4 presents a list of potential activities that could be supported in the 10 project
dzongkhags.
(b) Project Advisory Network Establishment. Based on the results of the rapid market studies, the PMU
will support the establishment of a project advisory network (PAN) that will include representatives
of relevant state agencies (for example, Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts, Tourism
Council of Bhutan), educational institutions, NGOs (for example, Youth Development Fund, Royal
Textile Academy, Loden Foundation, Tarayana Foundation), and the private sector (for example,
senior staff of major local travel agencies, BioBhutan). The objective of the PAN is to select the
business proposals that will receive funding and then provide independent technical support and
overall guidance to young entrepreneurs from the initial stage throughout the enterprise
development and operation. Specifically, the PAN will:
*   Review and approve selected value chain business plans and small grant proposals
submitted by Youth Led Enterprises (YLEs) after they are reviewed by the project
management to ensure that the proposal meets basic criteria (see description of Component
3, section b);
*  Advise on branding and standards for local cooperative associations when they are
established.
* Provide advice and guidance on business opportunities.
* Assist in the establishment of an association of YLEs to ensure coordination of capacity
building activities, exchange of experience, joint procurement, and brand marketing.
* Assist in identifying experts and trainers with specialized expertise and resources that will
become members of the mobile training and mentoring teams (see below).
(c) Mobile Training and Mentoring Team Formation. The project will create a mobile training and
mentoring team (MTMT) consisting of competitively selected experts/trainers on the following


﻿topics: (i) entrepreneurial skills; (ii) business management skills; (iii) technical skills along selected
value chains; and (iv) ICT skills. Depending on the selected products for the value chain, the project
will recruit international (or local, if available) experts to train and coach MTMTs, and assist in the
preparation of a capacity building and mentoring program tailored to the needs of specific
enterprises. Specifically, the MTMT will:
*  Provide awareness building and technical advice to YLEs in the preparation of small grant
funding proposals which would be submitted for consideration to the Project Advisory
Network (PAN);
*  Advise and guide in the preparation of business plans;
*  Support the setting up of YLEs in project target areas;
*  Provide training and capacity building to YLEs in entrepreneurial, business, technical, and
ICT skills; and
*  Implement a mentoring and coaching program.
Through the MTMT, the project will identify young people from the targeted project area who are
capable, motivated, and interested in developing their own small-scale enterprise. These motivated
youth could serve as a catalyst for encouraging and mobilizing other unemployed or under-employed
youth to explore the route of entrepreneurship. The project will identify potential young people through
broad campaigns, using Facebook and other social networks, mass media at the national level, village
meetings, and information dissemination at the community level. It is anticipated that many of these
individuals will be youth with connections to the RRCDP or other development project areas who are
now living in the dzongkhag centers or other urban areas, and seeking employment or business
development opportunities.
Component 2: Youth Capacity Building and Empowerment (US$210.000). This component will aim at
empowering youth to set up and meaningfully participate in community-based enterprises, and equip
them with entrepreneurial, organizational, business, and technical skills to generate sustainable jobs and
income. This will be achieved through training and mentoring programs, learning by doing, and
exchange of experiences through established horizontal networks supported by the MTMT. This
component will include three types of core training activities:
(a) Capacity Building for Youth Empowerment (Organizational Development and Life Skills). Youth
groups will be provided with tailored training on organizational development and on life skills that
will boost their ability to participate actively in society. This capacity building will equip the young
people with an ability to make decisions, leading to an increased feeling of self-worth and
confidence based on problem-solving through participatory and active learning. It is expected that
after the young people receive this training, they will have more confidence and be more likely to
want to engage in the businesses developed in their areas, and their capacity to do so will be
developed throughout the life of the project. The design of this training will build on the experience
of the Youth Development Fund (NGO).
(b) Business and Technical Training in Specific Skills and Product Development. A special training
program will be developed on business skills, business planning, financial and records management,
and production and marketing rules. Technical training also will be provided on topics related to
adding value to specific niche products. The latter will be tailored to the demands of the youth
enterprises and needs of the value chain program, and provided by a MTMT comprised of
competitively selected private service providers. Private and state agents providing technical
training on niche products' design, production, and marketing will be identified, and the training
will be provided by relevant international and local experts (for example, topics may include


﻿textiles, industrial design, small scale fruit and berry processing, small scale cheese production, and
community-based tourism). This approach to upgrading skills will benefit not only the youth
residing in the project dzongkhags, but will be open to youth from other areas, especially in and
around Thimphu, resulting in a ripple effect.
Training will be arranged to ensure that the MTMTs can provide the initial and follow-up training to
YLEs, coaching, and mentoring. It is important to link payment to MTMTs between the training and
mentoring services of the project beneficiaries. MTMTs will be paid on the basis of their
performance. The payments will be made in two parts: (a) the first payment will be made after the
submission of training completion report and the YLE verification report, and (b) the second
payment will be based on coaching, mentoring, and follow-up support provided to YLEs over a 6-12
month period after receiving training. Capacity building and coaching will be delivered using
modern communication technologies. The project will use mobile training approaches to ensure
quality, cost effectiveness, and outreach to geographically isolated areas. Existing community
centers, classrooms (after school hours), and other spaces would be used.
The MTMT will establish a mentoring system with the YLEs to provide ongoing support using such
ICT technologies as mobile phones and the internet. It is expected that even if young people drop out
of project activities, the skills and qualifications (including certificate provided at the end of the
trainings) will enable them to seek quality jobs elsewhere.
(c) ICT training and application: The project will use ICT extensively to overcome the remoteness of
the target areas, and contribute to establishing stronger brand identity for local products. A mobile
ICT team will provide marketing support as well as help to create and maintain websites linked to
markets outside of the target regions. It also will help YLEs and community-based groups to
maintain communications networks aimed at marketing products/services, handle basic
management functions such as accounting, and access knowledge and information through
web-based training. Thus, this component will finance the procurement of ICT support for the
YLEs and community-based groups (such as forestry enterprises) and related training for their
members. This capacity building will address the currently low ICT skills in the region, where a
rapid assessment indicated that there is almost no use of ICT other than mobile phones which are
rarely used for data transmission.
Component 3: Operationalization of YLEs (US$640,000). The objectives of this component are to (a)
build capacity for establishing YLE internal governance arrangements that will ensure the sustainability
of the YLEs, and (b) provide seed capital to operationalize the YLEs.
(a) Capacity Building for Established YLEs: Institutional development and internal governance
arrangements will be supported through the same MTMT involved in the first project year in
establishing the YLEs. Particular attention will be paid to business accounting, transparency, and
rules for members to join or leave the YLE, sharing arrangements for input and marketing efforts,
and contracting arrangements. It is expected that the YLEs will attract additional persons once they
are operational, requiring a nimble administrative structure. For example, if jam is the niche
product, then multiple YLEs should be open to pooling resources and outputs to form a producer
group of high quality jam producers to meet market demand. In addition, there will be the need to
guard against elite capture of the resources that would be made available through the project. Thus,
the project's Internal Auditor will conduct simple financial and performance audits, which would be
made publicly available to communities to provide information on internal governance
arrangements and the recommendations for management improvements. A significant negative
audit finding would bar the YLE from accessing further project financing.


﻿(b) Grants for New Enterprises. YLEs will be eligible to compete for small business grants after
completion of the capacity building and empowerment program, which is expected to take place
during the first nine months of the project. Eligibility criteria will include (i) establishment of a legal
entity, (ii) completion of mandatory training, (iii) involvement of an agreed minimum percentage of
youth and women, and (iv) submission of an acceptable business plan. The Grant Administrator
and PMU staff will carry out a preliminary review of proposed applications for a grant. If the
proposal meets the minimum eligibility criteria, it will be sent to the Project Advisory Network
(PAN), consisting of independent evaluators with relevant and known expertise in the sectors
covered by this project, which would review and recommend the best plans to the project
management unit for funding. It is expected that the YLEs will contribute cash and/or in-kind
contribution to complement the proposed grant funding (it is proposed that the contribution will be a
minimum of 20% of the investment cost). The most successful business plans will be awarded small
grants for start-up enterprises in the first round. Those remaining can strengthen their business plans
and apply for start-up grants in successive rounds. There will be three batches of competition, one in
the first year (PYI), and two in the second year (PY2), with completion of all external financing by
the end of the third year. The maximum amount of an individual grant would be $5,000 and the
amount of financing to be made available to an eligible YLE will be based on the amount of
contribution from the YLE itself and the number of youth to be involved in the proposed venture.
The grant plus the small amount of each YLE's contribution have the potential to generate
additional funds from other sources. Disbursement of funds will be in tranches and contingent on
reaching milestones in the implementation of the business plans. Adverse audit findings would
affect any future disbursements.
(c) Strengthening of Market Linkages. This activity is designed to facilitate the marketing of new
products outside the product area. The types of assistance to be provided will depend on the needs of
the enterprises and the products produced. In the case of handicrafts or other niche items (for
example, organic soaps), products are sold mainly to tourists either in Thimphu, Paro, or Punakha.
Thus, this sub-component will be used to facilitate the marketing of the products in these cities'
centralized bazaars, at the airport in Paro, or other special locations. In Thimphu, for example,
project funds could be used to support the planning of one or more craft bazaars where crafts
produced in the project areas can be exhibited and sold. Funds also can be used to support the
organization of craft fairs in association with the Agency for Promotion of Indigenous Crafts
(APIC), Handicraft Association of Bhutan, Tarayana Foundation, and others. During project
appraisal, MoUs between selected private sector organizations and NGOs will be pursued where
appropriate. The final design of this activity will take into account the existing role of middle-men
to ensure that they will continue to function as needed to facilitate the local producers' access to
market, without compromising the sustainability of the new enterprise.
Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Knowledge Dissemination
(US$250,000)
This component will cover project management costs; implementation of a comprehensive Project
Monitoring and Evaluation Strategy and Plan, which will include community baseline and follow-up
surveys; and dissemination of project results and lessons learned in project implementation.
(a) Project Management and Implementation Arrangements: For the day-to-day administration of the
project, the RGoB would establish an Independent Project Management Unit (PMU) within the
MoAF that will be responsible for overall management of all project activities. The PMU will have
a team consisting of a dedicated project coordinator, procurement and financial management


﻿specialist/accountant, youth capacity building specialist, business development specialist, and grant
administrator that will be recruited and funded by the project. The PMU team will provide oversight,
technical support, and guidance to the grantees and other youth enterprises. In the course of project
implementation, the project management unit will recruit a monitoring and evaluation (M&E)
specialist and additional local and international technical assistance based on needs in line with
results of the assessments carried out during the initial stage of project implementation. The PMU
will also have oversight and be responsible for management of project funding. Coordination of
the implementation of the JSDF and RRCDP will help maximize and ensure synergies and
complementarity of efforts, ensure cost-effectiveness of investments, provide opportunities for
experience and lesson sharing, and facilitate a more comprehensive and holistic approach to rural
development.
The Grant Administrator will be a competent person selected from a NGO or civil society
organization, with experience working with the poor. The Grant Administrator will have overall
responsibility for the grant component, including; (i) developing outreach and application materials
and procedures for the grant facility; (ii) working with the national, dzongkha, and geog authorities
to disseminate the material to youth and youth organizations; (iii) providing technical support to
grant proponents for the preparation and submission of the grant proposals; (iv) consolidating grant
proposals and submitting them to the Project Advisory Network (PAN) for review and approval; (v)
managing grant disbursements and providing technical support to the grantees for the
implementation of the approved initiatives; (f) mobilizing specialized expertise to provide technical
support to the grantees when needed for the implementation of the initiatives; and (g) receiving,
synthesizing, and preparing progress reports for the approved initiatives to the RGoB and World
Bank.
A Project Steering Committee would be established under the chairmanship of the Secretary, MO
synergies and complementality of efforts as well as ensure government buy-in and commitment to
scaling up and replication of successful models of youth employment and enterprise development. It
would approve annual work plans, review monitoring reports, and support the use of existing local,
district,and national funding to benefit the youth employment efforts.
(b) Monitoring and Evaluation. Through this sub-component, the project will include dynamic
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to track input, output, outcome, and impact indicators to measure
the performance and results obtained from the implementation of the proposed activities. The M&E
activities, which will be integrated into the existing M&E system established by the MoAF, will be
participatory in nature, involving engaged youth groups and target communities in assessing (i) the
functioning of the YLEs, (ii) outcomes on youth employment and income generation, and (iii) the
impact of the project on community-based economic growth and livelihoods. Specifically, the JSDF
component of the larger project M&E system will;
*      Carry out a comprehensive baseline survey to determine the skills and income levels of the
targeted beneficiaries by gender and by age;
*      Carry out a qualitative assessment of the aspirations of women and men of various age
groups, especially the most vulnerable, through focus group discussions, to solicit feedback
on the challenges being faced by them, their views on solutions and coping mechanisms,
culture conflict issues, and generational gap issues, as well as feedback on the training
programs and how they can be improved;
*      Monitor quantitatively as well as qualitatively the outputs, outcomes, and development
impacts of the training programs on behavioral changes and productivity, track new and


﻿improved income levels at the local level and contribution to gross national happiness at an
individual and community level (if possible); track key success factors; and document
lessons learned and project performance indicators.
Carry out an independent evaluation, one at mid-term and the second one at the end of the
project period. Based on the results of the mid-term evaluation, the project team will
determine what steps, if any, may need to be introduced to improve performance or
maximize project benefits.
(c) Knowledge Dissemination. The project will support the preparation of knowledge notes on the
activities and conditions that made a significant difference in improving the livelihoods of the
vulnerable target group, and the interventions which may not have succeeded and the underlying
reasons to avoid such mistakes in the future. The notes will be disseminated as widely as possible
and used in the design of an expanded project for possible Bank or other sources of financing.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known)
The project area consists of selected dzongkhags located in the south-western, south, and eastern parts of
Bhutan (Samtse, Haa, Chukha, Trongsa, Dagana, and Wangdue in south western Bhutan and Pema
Gatshel, Sandrup Jongkhar, Trashigang, and Trashi Yangtse in eastern Bhutan). The area in the western
part of the project area includes 400 sq km covered by forest and 198 sq km of agriculture land. The
Jigme Singyc Wangehuck National Park is the only protected area in the proposed Project area. The
Phobjikha valley, adjacent to the northwestern boundary of Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park,
has been recognized as area of special conservation value. It is the most important winter habitat in the
country for the globally threatened black-necked crane. Some 200 of these cranes roost in the Phobjikha
valley every winter (October to March). Areas of Athang and Phobji (partly in buffer zone) in the
southeastern part of the Wangdue Dzongkhag fall inside the Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park.
The project will not undertake any construction activity and there will be no land acquisition.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Management
The Project Management Unit (PMU) will draw on expertise available with the Ministry of Agriculture
and Forests who are responsible for the implementation of the RRCDP including management of
environmental and social safeguards and for issuing environmental clearances to project activities, and
also carrying out periodic environmental compliance monitoring. MOAF has extensive capacity in
dealing with safeguard management issues on account of their prior experience in undertaking World
Bank projects (e.g. RCDP, Sustainable Land management Project and Diversified Rural Development
Projects) that necessitated the identification, avoidance and mitigation of safeguard issues. MoAF will
support the PMU in ensuring capacity development and implementation support for the ESMF, which
will be prepared once JSDF funding is assured for the project. The ESMF will serve as a major
Safeguard Policy and Plan. The ESMF will draw on lessons and experiences from the ongoing RRCDP.

﻿I. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies                     Triggered      Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01   X               Triggered, because the activities /interventions
proposed may have low impacts on natural
environment, human health, and safety. An
ESMF will be prepared to guide the
preparation and screening of
investment project proposals to ensure
that potential environmental impacts
from any waste generated and
resources utilized will be avoided,
minimized, and mitigated as pertinent.
Activities should ensure training and
health and safety equipment as well as
food safety protocols
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04            X              Triggered because it is expected that enterprises
might include community-based tourism with youth
engaged in guiding tours in forests and national
parks areas. It is also expected that youth led
enterprises will harvest and process forests' natural
resources. The ESMF would ensure that
endangered, threatened, or depleted
species would not be harvested or
adversely affected by the activity.
Forests OP/BP 4.36                    X               Triggered because proposed the project areas have
National Parks and Forests, and some economic
activities will include processing of non-timber
forest products. Enterprise activities will be
undertaken in well-defined areas and will follow
best forestry practices and management to be
included in the ESMF as indicated by the policy
for small-holder forestry activities.
This will ensure that forests and natural resources
are not affected. Project activities will not be
undertaken in protected areas or protected forests
Pest Management OP 4.09                               Not triggered because project interventions are not
expected to involve any significant applications of
pesticides and agro-chemicals
Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11  X             Triggered, as a precautionary measure, because there may
be cultural sites in the project area,

country.


﻿Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12               No land acquisition or related impact on assets,
infrastructure and livelihood. There will also be no
restriction of access to national parks.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37                         Not triggered because the project will not support
any activities in relation to dams
Projects on International Waterways               The project will not undertake any activity on any
OP/BP 7.50                                        water ways that will have an impact on international
waterways or rivers.
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60             Not triggered because the project is not located in
any internationally disputed areas
