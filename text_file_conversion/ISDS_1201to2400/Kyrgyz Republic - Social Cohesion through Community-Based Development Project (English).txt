            2. Project Objectives:

            The Project Development Objective is to identify, pilot, and build capacity for social cohesion
            mechanisms in COD approaches. The approach the project takes to achieve the PDQ includes: (i)
            identification of potentially successful approaches to promote social cohesion in community driven
            development; (ii) the subsequent piloting of such approaches through community-driven social
            mobilization and investment micro-projects; (iii) the rigorous tracking ofthe effectiveness of such
            ~pproaches through an evidence-driven monitoring and evaluation framework; and (iv) the
            strengthening of in-country research/operational capacities to support future integration of social
            cohesion approaches into development projects.

             3. Project Description:

             The project consists of two complementary and linked components: an identification research,



\
    \
        \
evaluative and capacity development component and an intervention component. The project will
aim to deliver interventions benefitting local communittes as quickly as possible while maintaining
the methodological rigor necessary to achieve robust learning on how social cohesion objectives can
be most effectively integrated into community-driven development interventions. Therefore, the
project will first undertake preparatory research and a baseline study, consisting of quantitative and
qualitative assessment of social cohesion. The preparatory research intends to. Identify effective
approaches for addressing social cohesion in Kyrgyzstan that the project can subsequently integrate
into the implementation of its COD micro-projects for community defined investments iri
infrastructure or services.

Component 1: Evidence-Driven Identification Research, Monitoring and Capacity Building
for Social Cohesion in Community Development. This component will first undertake
identification research through a survey arid qualitative assessment to identify potentially
successful social cohesion approaches that can be integrated into micro-project interventions under
Component 2. The component will also set up a rigorous, evidence-driven monitoring and tracking
system to assess ongoing social cohesion impacts from the pilot intervention activities. Finally, the
component will strengthen in-country research capacities to sustain attention to social cohesion
and community development beyond the life of the project.

Component 2: Piloting of Social Cohesion Approaches in Community Driven Social
Mobilization and Investment Micro-Projects. This component will pilot social cohesion
interventions within the cycle of micro-projects for community-driven investments in infrastructure
and services, beginning in year one of implementation. The identification research program will
generate pilot approaches with the potential to address social cohesion that would subsequently be
integrated into social mobilization, investment prioritization, and implementation that will become
part of the micro-project cycle for the targeted communities in Osh and Naryn Oblasts.              ·

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

Project expected locations include: In Osh oblast, the project will broadly target eight sub-districts
(45 villages) where 107,200 people live In Naryn oblast, 24,500 ethnic Kyrgyz (12,000 women)
living in seven sub-districts (l5 villages) will be targeted. Specific sites for physical investments
and their types (through the counterpart funds only) will be determined through research and
participatory activities that are part of the project design and are nof determined at this stage.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The proposed grant would support micro-projects for community-driven investments in infrastructure and
services, including: water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, roads and bridges rehabilitation,
rehabilitation of schools and kindergartens, as well as other demand driven and socially justifiable local
investments in services delivery, which might generate environmental and social impacts. While the
environmental issues associated with their implementation in rriost cases w_ill be minor, short-lived, and
primarily limited to the project sites (except for movement of equipment and materials to/from the site), it
is possible they might be also significant and would affect the environment and health of population.
These issues are primarily: dust, noise, water pollution, disposal of waste material and/or older
equipment, some traffic disruption (depending upon specific location), worker safety (e.g. welding
operations) etc. All these impacts can be addressed with good engineering and construction practices as
well as with preparing and implementing adequate mitigation measures. The project will also bring
positive social impacts as the proposed.activities would improve social conditions for the population and
would contribute to improving local population livelihoods.


 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
 the project area:

 No major potential indirect and/or long term impacts are foreseen.

 3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
.impacts: N/A                                                        ·

 4. Describe measures taken by_the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
 assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

 To address potential environmental and social issues the borrower have prepared an overall
 Environmental Management Plan Checklist which guides the EA process. The document covers typical
 preventive and mitigation approaches to common civil works contracts with localized impacts. For each
selected subproject the implementing entities will fill out a site specific EMP Checklist which will be
disclosed for public comments. The EMP Checklist will be part of the construction contracts.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Given the minimal nature of the expected environmental impacts and the fact that sites are not
yet chosen consultations were virtual.

The EMP was posted publically in Kyrgyzstan at http://donors.kg/en/ from August 26th until
September 9th, 2013 for the purposes of comments and consultation (as specific project areas
and sites are not yet selected). No comments or suggested changes to the EMP were received.
The EMP was subsequently disclosed as final on August 27,2013 at http://donors.kg/en/and
submitted to the World Bank for subsequent disclosure via the World Bank Infoshop ..
