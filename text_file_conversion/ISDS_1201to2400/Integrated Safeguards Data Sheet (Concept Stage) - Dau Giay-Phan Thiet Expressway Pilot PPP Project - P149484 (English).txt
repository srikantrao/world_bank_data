                           10.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support the GoV attract private sector
                           expertise and capital for the construction and operation of the Dau Giay-Phan Thiet Expressway.
                           This would be the first transaction under the GoV Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Pilot Program for
                           infrastructure investments.
                         C. Project Description
                         The Dau Giay-Phan Thiet Expressway (DPEP) will be Vietnam’s first major public-private
                         partnership (PPP) in the highway sector, and it will build the capacity of the Government of Vietnam

                         (GoV) to handle future PPP transactions and demonstrate to prospective investors the GoV’s
                         commitment to the PPP concept. The DPEP expressway will consist of a toll road of approximately
                         100 km, connecting Ho Chi Minh City to the south-central coastal city of Phan Thiet. It is anticipated
                         that, when completed, the expressway will significantly reduce travel time between the two cities,
                         and facilitate the development of new industrial areas, creating new employment opportunities.

                         Specifically, under the DPEP Project, the World Bank will:

                         (i)     support the GoV in designing and implementing a competitive process for determining the
                         asset value of the proposed expressway through the selection of private investors, who will
                         participate in forming the DPEP Project Company that will construct and operate the expressway as a
                         PPP;
                         (ii)    support the GoV in designing and implementing a transparent Viability Gap Financing
                         (VGF) mechanism to make the proposed expressway financially viable through the provision of IDA
                         resources which the GoV will provide to the DPEP Project Company as a non-refundable grant; and
                         (iii)   support the GoV in in providing long-term debt financing to the DPEP Project Company
                         through the GoV’s on-lending of the IBRD loan to the Project Company, which will be subsequently
                         be repaid in full by the Project Company.

                         This project builds upon work done under a previous project (P118848), which was commenced in
                         2009. The earlier project, which was originally known as the Vietnam Public Private Partnership
                         Pilots Project, arose from discussions between the World Bank and the GoV involving the
                         development of a PPP program, part of which involved assisting with selected pilot transactions. The
                         GoV proposed that the pilot transactions should involve projects where initial development work had
                         already taken place, thereby allowing the first transaction to proceed on an accelerated basis. Three

                         potential transactions were proposed by the GoV, and evaluated using criteria agreed upon by the
                         World Bank and the GoV .

                         It was agreed that the project should be selected with a view to demonstrating the following four key
                         concepts:

                         (i)     at least one private investor would be selected through public, competitive, bidding;
                         (ii)    the value of the infrastructure asset would be determined through the competitive bidding
                         process, i.e. based upon the winning bid by the investor selected through the public, competitive,
                         bidding process. Any other investor would have to be willing to accept the resulting market-
                         determined value of the asset;
                         (iii)   the pilot PPP would meet international standards of PPP project preparation, i.e. the project
                         would be prepared to the highest technical standards and all necessary clearances and approvals
                         would be obtained before it was put out for competitive bidding; and
                         (iv)    the financing structure of the pilot project, including the clearances provided, would
                         demonstrate how public monies (including concessional ODA) could be used to support well-
                         prepared PPPs that also utilize private sector financing.

                         One of the three potential transactions had significant unresolved design issues, and a second was
                         determined to be an inappropriate candidate in that it was being developed by a state-owned
                         enterprise. The third transaction was the proposed DPEP expressway, which met the selection criteria
                         and which was chosen for the pilot program. That expressway was being developed by the Bitexco
                         Group – a large and diversified Vietnamese private company.

                         During 2011 and 2012, international financial and technical consultants were engaged by the World
                         Bank (using funds provided by PPIAF and the Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) to
                         review the Bitexco feasibility study and develop th e transaction documents. On October 26, 2012,
                         the Government issued Prime Ministerial Decision 1597/QD-TTg, designating Bitexco as the “First
                         Investor” (which will hold 60% of the shares of the DPEP project company) and setting out the
                         procedures for the competitive selection of the Second Investor (which will hold the remaining 40%
                         of the shares of the DPEP Project Company). Decision 1597 also specified that the winning bidder
                         will be the firm or consortium proposing the lowest VGF grant, and that Bitexco will be bound by
                         the results of the bidding process. In addition, Decision 1597 indicated that the GoV would seek to
                         obtain IDA funding for the VGF grant, as well as an IBRD loan which would be on-lent to the
                         project company.

                         On July 2, 2013, the Government issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), inviting interested
                         parties to submit applications to participate in the competitive process for selecting the Second
                         Investor. The RFQ, which was cleared by the World Bank Regional Procurement Manager pursuant
                         to the Procurement Guidelines applicable to PPP transactions (i.e. Paragraph 3.14(a) of the
                         Procurement Guidelines), described the project and the proposed IDA and IBRD funding. A series of
                         Investor Conferences were then held, in Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore and Hanoi in July-September
                         2013, to introduce the project and the bidding process to potential investors. These conferences
                         attracted significant interest from internationally-recognized infrastructure companies. The applicants
                         were required to submit their detailed Statements of Qualifications by November 29, 2013.

                         On November 29, 2013, seven major firms/consortia submitted applications in response to the RFQ.
                         These applications were evaluated by the Government, against the criteria set out in the RFQ, and the
                         Evaluation Report recommended that six of the firms/consortia be designated as prequalified bidders.

                         The GoV’s Evaluation Report was submitted to the World Bank, with a request for a ‘no objection’
                         letter, on January 7, 2014.

                         Given that it has been four years since the initial concept was approved for the Vietnam Public
                         Private Partnership Pilots Project, and given that the focus is now specifically on the DPEP
                         transaction, with significant refinements made to the original concept parameters, this updated PCN
                         has been prepared to reflect, more precisely, the current nature of the project.

                         The project will consist of two components, as follows:

                         Component 1: Expressway Financing, consisting of (a) up to US $257 million of IDA funds to
                         provide Viability Gap Financing; and (b) up to US $348 million of IBRD funds to be on-lent by the
                         GoV to the DPEP Project Company.

                         Component 2: Capacity Building, consisting of US $20 million to enhance the capacity of the GoV
                         Ministry of Transport to manage and supervise the DPEP transaction and future PPP transactions.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         A new expressway (toll road) will be built from Ho Chi Minh city (Dong Nai Province) to the south-
                         central coastal city of Phan Thiet (Binh Thuan Province), to the point where it intersects with NH1A.
                         This will be known as the Dau Giay – Phan Thiet Expressway. The expressway will go through 15
                         communes (of 3 districts and one town) in Dong Nai Province, and 8 communes of 2 districts in Binh

                         Thuan Province. The total population of these 23 communes is approximately 260,380 persons from
                         55,004 households. The proposed Project consists of 9 interchanges with existing national and
                         provincial roads, which include HCM-Long Thanh-Dau Giay expressway, NH56, Road to Suoi Vong
                         Lake, Provincial Road 765, NH1A, Xuan Tam-Tran Tao Road, Provincial Road 720, NH55, and
                         Road to My Thanh/Ba Bau.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         In recognition of the unique implementation challenges associated with this first PPP project, the
                         Ministry of Transport (MOT) has established a special PPP Project Management Unit (PMU1),
                         which will coordinate the various elements of the DPEP. PMU1 is led by a Director General, and
                         will be supervised directly by the MOT Vice Minister. The MOT will also utilize a strengthened
                         Inter Ministerial Committee (IMC), which will be chaired by the MOT Vice Minister and ensure that
                         the final outputs of PMU1 are reviewed by the relevant GoV agencies before they are submitted to
                         the Minister of Transport for clearance. The PMU1 will have staff to look at environment and social
                         safeguards who will work with respective implementing agencies such as the District Resettlement
                         Committees to implement the plans.

                         Over the past four years, PMU1 has done extensive work -- including taking key decisions on the
                         competitive bidding process, the content and quality of the RFQ, preparation of social safeguards
                         documents, including social assessment, RPF, RAPs, EMDP, -- in close consultation with the World
                         Bank and the World Bank-retained international financial, technical and legal advisors, towards
                         preparing DPEP to international standards. PMU1 has also utilized the recipient-executed Australia
                         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade grant (facilitated by the World Bank) to recruit national
                         financial and procurement specialists, and national safeguards and legal advisors, to work with the
                         international advisors and help take the project preparation and implementation process forward.

                         It has been agreed that land acquisition will be completed by Government prior to the land being
                         handed over to the investors for commencement of the construction i.e. all resettlement activities will
                         be completed by Government during project preparation phase. The two investors – Bitexco as the
                         first investor, and the second investor (being identified) will obtain the concession for the
                         expressway on land that has already been acquired and cleared by Government for the purpose of the
                         project. All the costs related to compensation payment, assistance, livelihoods restoration have been
                         committed by the Government and have been made available.

                         While the implementing agencies at national, provincial and district level do have experience in
                         implementing social and environmental safeguard instruments, these agencies will need technical
                         support and training. Similarly, Bitexco (as well as other likely investors who will be selected
                         competitively in the future), have had limited involvement with WB funded projects. Appropriate
                         training and capacity enhancement measures will be identified for specific private and Government
                         agencies at national, provincial and district level to ensure that the identified impacts in the areas of
                         environment, involuntary resettlement, ethnic minorities and social development are addressed in a
                         sustainable manner. These efforts will commence from the preparation stage with the appropriate
                         studies and drafting of documents and continue into project implementation to ensure their
                         operational impacts.

                         such locations for the project, and (e) villages
                         that will be cut through by the expressway
                         alignment.
                         �        Analysis of Alternatives: The EIA will
                         document the evaluation of alternative
                         alignments and the basis for the selection of the
                         final alignment.
                         �        Rural Connectivity: The expressway
                         will cut across a dense network or rural roads
                         and paths used by communities in the area. The
                         EIA report will describe the situation and assess
                         the adequacy of the proposed system of fly-over
                         and underpasses to minimize social disruption,
                         community isolation and farmland connectivity.
                         These passes should be located at the existing
                         cross roads to minimize traffic disruptions and
                         at other selected locations in consultation with
                         the local authorities and the villagers.
                         �        Sensitive Resources: Construction
                         activities may negatively affect cultivated lands
                         and water quality from unmanaged run-off from
                         construction sites and inadequate waste
                         disposal. Impacts on cultivated lands need to be

                         properly managed specially during construction.
                         The EIA report should discuss this issue and
                         propose a series of mitigation measures to
                         control construction activities to minimize these
                         impacts. Special attention should be given to the
                         management of irrigation systems during
                         construction to ensure water connectivity to
                         irrigate fields.
                         �        Induced Impacts: The expressway will
                         facilitate additional industrial development
                         along the corridor. The EIA report should
                         identify the location and types of development
                         that are known or anticipated and discuss
                         environmental implications of this development.
                         The EIA should also discuss the zoning or
                         development plans that have been prepared (or
                         that will be needed) for the area along the
                         alignment of the expressway.
                         �        Construction Impacts: The construction
                         of the expressway will entail close contact with
                         small rural communities and the presence of
                         workers in the area with potential impacts on

                         health (STD). The EIA report should include the
                         potential impacts of the expressway on
                         communities during construction and operation:
                         traffic, traffic safety and communities. The
                         mitigation measures incorporated into the
                         design to address these impacts (as well as
                         along all access roads) should be specified in
                         the EMP. The reinstatement of the access roads
                         after construction needs to be included in
                         project cost estimation and this needs to be
                         reflected in the EA and EMP reports.
                         �         Access Roads: Access roads will be
                         required to provide access to the construction
                         sites, borrow pits, construction camps, waste
                         disposal areas, mix plants, casting yards, etc.
                         The environmental impacts of constructing such
                         roads will be part of the EIA, including an
                         analysis of necessary access roads to all key
                         points including major bridges and the Giang
                         Co Range. The EMP should develop proper
                         design standards and specifications for the
                         construction of such roads to ensure that they
                         are environmentally benign and properly
                         constructed, maintained and operated.

                         construction: The project warrants a dedicated
                         team of specialists supervising the
                         environmental aspects of construction. Terms of
                         reference, and a compliance framework to
                         enforcement should be included in the EMP.
                         �         Quarries/Borrow Pits/Disposal Sites:
                         Quarries, borrow pits and disposal sites
                         Disposal sites for excess materials need to be
                         identified in the EIA reports. Known sites need
                         to be screened for environmental and social
                         issues, against criteria such as: not near
                         communities, not in scenic areas, not on flood
                         plains, unstable areas, etc. Mitigation measures
                         should be identified for each site. A framework
                         for dealing with new quarries, borrow pits and
                         disposal sites identified in detailed design phase
                         and proposed during construction needs to be
                         included in the EMP (similar to access roads).

                         number of camps and their locations are not
                         known yet. The EMP should define criteria for
                         camp location and management. The EIA/EMP
Public Disclosure Copy




                         should include recommendations about where
                         not to locate the camps (scenic areas, sensitive
                         areas, near vulnerable communities, etc.) and
                         the type of facilities the camps must have
                         (adequate accommodations, proper water supply
                         and sanitation, proper cooking facilities, non-
                         use of wood for heating and cooking, etc.).
                         Environmental and social specifications for
                         camp management should also be part of the
                         EMP.
                         �         Slope Stabilization: Although this is
                         carried out as part of the engineering design, the
                         EIA/EMP should identify the areas with major
                         stabilization works such as the crossing of the
                         Giang Co Range of mountains. Minimization of
                         scenic impacts should be the guiding principle
                         for the design of stabilization works.
                         �         Safety Issues: The EIA report should
                         identify the special potential hotspots for safety
                         and make recommendations for their mitigation.
                         Special attention should be given to the junction
                         of the expressway with the 4 km, 4 lane road (to
                         be constructed as part of the project) that will
                         join the expressway with NH1, and the junction
                         of the 4 lane road with NH1.

                         �         Scenic and Landscape Design: The
                         project merits a stand-alone, detailed scenic and
                         landscape design to ensure minimization of this
                         type of impacts and to enhance the
                         environmental value of the roads. Restoration of
                         all affected areas, look out points, special signs,
                         re-vegetation along the corridor, rest areas, etc.
                         should all be part of this design.
                         Impacts during Operation: Impacts during
                         operations of the expressway are expected to be
                         mainly dust, noise and toxic gases relating to
                         traffic, solid and hazardous waste from the
                         management center, traffic safety, and changes
                         in hydrological patterns in upstream and

                         severely affected by the Project.

                         While project design has tried to minimize land
                         acquisition impacts, the project is estimated to
                         acquire 5,468,375 m2 of land, of which 99%
                         (5,433,375m2) will be permanently affected and
                         35,000m2 (0.6%) would be temporarily affected
                         (primarily during construction operations). This
                         would affect a total estimated 708 households,
                         of which 404 households (57%) would lose
                         more than 20% of their land. 207 households
                         (29%) will need to relocate and 54 (8%) will
                         need to re-organize their houses within their
                         existing residential plots.. It is noted that most
                         of the affected land (99.2%) is for agriculture.
                         The remaining is for residential purpose.

                         It is anticipated that all the land acquisition and
                         resettlement will occur prior to Board. A
                         meeting between TT, RSS and LEGES/LEGEN
                         will be held as soon as possible during project
                         preparation to determine on how to proceed as
                         resettlement is foreseen to be advanced or
                         completed by Board.
