2. Project Objectives:

   Original PDO: To align African agricultural institutions at the national, regional and
   continental levels with the principles and objectives of the Comprehensive African
   Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) – Pillar IV, for effective agricultural research,
   extension, technology adoption, and training and education.

   Revised PDO: To strengthen Africa’s capacity for agricultural innovation with purposefully
   determined outcomes, creating capacity for innovation and enabling environments for
   implementation.
3. Project Description:

FARA is a continent-wide umbrella organization bringing together and forming coalitions of
major stakeholders in agricultural research and development in Africa. The original MDTF
supports FARA’s medium-term operational plan (MTOP I) covering the period 2009-2013 and
has four components, the first three of which are recipient-executed and the last Bank-executed:

      Component 1:     Networking Support Functions (NSFs)
      Component 2:     Corporate Governance Reform Stream & Program Management
      Component 3:     Sub-grants for Sub-projects
      Component 4:     Management and Supervision of the Trust Fund (Bank-executed)

FARA plays advocacy and coordination roles for agricultural research for development and
supports the generation, dissemination and adoption of agricultural innovations. Through MTOP
I, FARA complemented the activities of national, international and sub-regional organizations
(SROs) to deliver more responsive and effective services to its stakeholders.

The additional financing will support FARA’s MTOP II, which builds on the
achievements of the 2009–2013 MTOP, however, whereas the previous MTOP focused on
the Networking Support Functions of its constituent members, the current MTOP seeks to
chart strategic directions that will enable the FARA Secretariat to position itself to respond
to the continental imperatives of the forum. In this regard, it will take on board the
emerging issues confronting the agricultural research and development community in
Africa. The services now demanded of FARA revolve around providing strategic
leadership and foresight, facilitating collective action on priority areas that require
regional solutions and strengthening the capacity of national programs to make them more
effective partners in solving regional issues. These roles attributed to FARA have been
distilled into three Strategic Priorities (SPs):

   a) Visioning Africa’s agricultural transformation – with foresight, strategic analysis and
      partnerships. The objective is to enable more productive engagement between the public
      and private sectors in all aspects of supply and value chains. This will lead to the
      ‘creation’ of an integral agricultural innovation system along with improved trade
      (especially intra-Africa trade) and marketing.

   b) Integrating capacities for change – by connecting and learning. The objective is to
      advocate, catalyze and facilitate the strategic reforms, processes and mechanisms that will
      connect and combine the capacities of actors within the knowledge system. This will also
      strengthen human, organizational and institutional capacities for agricultural innovation.

   c) Creating an enabling environment for implementation – by advocating and
      communicating. The objective for pro-agricultural development advocacy is to convince
      African governments that strong agricultural innovation systems are the linchpins of
      economic development and food security and they must invest more themselves and rely
      less on donors.
Additional financing activities will focus on the above SPs. Tracking emerging
opportunities and risks and providing foresight and guidance to agricultural research and
innovation will be one of the main activities of the AF. For this, FARA will host the
African Chapter of the Foresight Academy that will enable and encourage African
decision makers, organizations and experts to use foresight systematically as a strategic
tool. FARA will fulfill this mandate by continuing to spearhead and facilitate the Dublin
Process for developing the African science agenda for agriculture. In this process, it will
ensure that African regional institutions are brought into the science agenda and enabled to
contribute and build Africa’s self-reliance in agricultural sciences. FARA will also
continue to promote intra- and inter-continental platforms and partnerships, building on
experiences from the North–South and South–South partnerships that have developed over
the last ten years.

FARA will strengthen interactions and partnerships among farmers, research, education,
extension, and trade and agribusiness organizations. It will continue to support such
recently established regional organizations and encourage and foster links between these
organizations and others. It will also spearhead the identification and redefinition of skill
sets as demanded by public and private sector actors. FARA will support the development
of partnerships between countries, institutions and local programs as a means to enhance
capacity strengthening, while bringing together the critical mass needed to undertake
complex agricultural training and advisory tasks. Strengthening human, organizational and
institutional capacities for agricultural innovation will be one of its main activities through
the selection of supporting activities that exploit FARA’s continental perspective by
networking, coordinating and harnessing the strengths of its stakeholders.

Finally, FARA will promote networking and facilitate engagement among the economic research
community and policy makers concerning strategic policy issues affecting agricultural
development in Africa. It will also promote the exchange of economic policy research results and
the sharing of best practice policy options among policy research institutions, policy makers and
the broader community of CAADP stakeholders through several avenues, including workshops,
seminars, conferences and publications.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The FARA Secretariat is located in Accra, Ghana. No physical or civil works will be undertaken

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The original Environmental Assessment category of the Trust Fund was B, with the
Environmental Assessment, Pest Management, Forests and International Waterways policies
triggered. At the time of preparation of the original project, it was expected that FARA’s
Networking Support Functions would provide sub-grants for sub-projects that might trigger the
above safeguard policies. FARA prepared an Environmental Management Framework (EMF)
covering the requirements of all three of the policies triggered and it was approved by the Bank
on January 6, 2009. The EMF is linked to FARA’s Environmental Policy and Action Plan and is
posted on FARA’s website and in the Bank InfoShop. It identified procedures and
responsibilities necessary for the effective implementation of these applicable safeguards
policies. Over the past 4 years, FARA financed two sub-grants – one to the African Forum for
Agricultural Research in Africa (AFAAS) and the other to the Center for the Coordination of
Agricultural Research and Development in Southern Africa (CCARDESA). Both sub-grants
supported advocacy and networking activities, as well as operational costs of the two institutions.
During project implementation, the overall approach to sub-grants was not designed to finance
any research or civil works. Therefore, none of the three policies were triggered during the
current project implementation, which is due to close on December 31, 2013.

Under the additional financing, the support to be provided through sub-grants would be of the
same nature, so no safeguard policies are expected to be triggered. The project team therefore
requests that the Environmental Category be downgraded from B – Partial Assessment (original)
to Category C (additional financing).

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area: N/A
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts: N/A


4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: N/A


5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people: N/A
