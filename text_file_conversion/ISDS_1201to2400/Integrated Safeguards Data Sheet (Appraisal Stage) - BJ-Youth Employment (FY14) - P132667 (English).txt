                           The objective of the proposed project is to improve access to employment skills and employment
                           opportunities for underemployed youth in Benin.
                            3. Project Description
                           The project will have four components:



                                                                      Page 1 of 5
                         Component 1: Developing Skills through Apprenticeships ($10.0 million). This component will
                         support underemployed youth to access apprenticeships of improved quality in skilled trades, and
                         help the Government and private sector trade associations to expand and improve nationally
Public Disclosure Copy




                         recognized certification for skills learned in such apprenticeships. The project will support the
                         expansion of the Certificat de Qualification Professionnelle (CQP) and Certificat de Qualification
                         aux MÃ©tiers (CQM) to a new range of trades. Standardized lists of competences will be developed in
                         collaboration with artisanal trade associations, key Ministries, and local governments. National tests
                         will be designed for those new trades. For the CQP, the project will make funds available to equip
                         existing training centers for the new trades. The project will also support improved quality of the
                         apprenticeship system, and encourage girls to complete apprenticeships in trades with low levels of
                         women.

                         Component 2: Developing Small Business Skills ($5 million)

                         This component would support the ANPE to scale up and improve the quality of its existing
                         programs to assist underemployed youth to develop skills related to establishing and managing a
                         small business. It will also support the ANPE to strengthen its programs to make them better adapted
                         to a wider range of educational backgrounds. Entrants into the program could include CQP and CQM
                         graduates, as well as other underemployed youth seeking to launch household or small businesses.
                         New modules will be developed in two separate tracks depending on the literacy of participants (high
                         or low), including life skills training and business training, and business plan preparation training.
                         Completing those modules will be mandatory for being able to apply to start-up support (Component
                         3).

                         Component 3: Start-up Support ($15 million)

                         The skills developed under components 1 and 2 may not be sufficient by themselves for youth to
                         access improved labor market outcomes without complementary support to address other constraints
                         that they typically face. Therefore, the project aims to take a holistic approach that not only
Public Disclosure Copy




                         addresses skills constraints through components 1 and 2, but also capital, lack of information,
                         networking, and mentoring. The project will help beneficiaries to address capital constraints through
                         two windows: (i) a grant window funded by the project which will provide non-reimbursable start-up
                         funding for individuals and groups in fields with significant capital intensity; and (ii) providing a link
                         to a loan window funded by the Government through the FNPEEJ which will provide larger amounts
                         than under the grant window at a below market interest rate. Start-up support will be accompanied
                         with mentoring and follow-up.

                         Component 4: Institutional Capacity Building and Project Management ($5 million).

                         This component aims to (i) strengthen the capacity of private and public sector institutions to engage
                         in an informed policy dialogue on skills and employment on a regular basis, particularly on the
                         alignment of public sector training programs with private sector needs; (ii) support improved
                         coordination and reduced fragmentation of youth employment activities; and (iii) improve the
                         knowledge base on employment and skills.

                         A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                         1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
Public Disclosure Copy




                           and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                           The project is expected to have minimal or no adverse environmental and social impacts.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The project will finance training for selected youths who may be working with a master crafts
                           person or in a training center acquiring skills and work experience. This skill acquisition might
                           involve occupational health impacts to both the apprentices and the masters.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           None
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           A manual will be produced to outline safe occupational health and safety procedures. Business
                           plans prepared under component 2 will be screened to ensure that proposals with environmental
                           and social impacts are not financed under component 3.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The key stakeholders are youth in apprenticeships and youth interested in acquiring skills to start a
                           small business, as well as master artisans and artisanal trade associations. The manual on safe
                           occupational health and safety procedures will be prepared in consultation with trade associations
                           and relevant government agencies.
