                          3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The proposed operation supports the first phase of Government’s PFM modernization strategy
                         presented by the PFM Executive Reform Team (PFM-ERT) to the multi-development partner PFM
                         Working Group on 18th September 2013. The PFM-ERT has recognized that managing the transition
                         effectively and building the foundations for further reforms will require improvements in the PFM
                         system to be carefully sequenced over a sustained period – in the order of 8-12 years. The
                         government’s approach to sequencing is, in the short term, to improve the control and stability in
                         expenditure and revenue management processes, and to enhance the unity of the budget (through
                         capturing all revenues and expenditures on on-budget while beginning to make initial connections
                         between plans and budgets. In the medium term the government aims to have the base internal
                         capacities to provide, analyze and interpret more sophisticated financial management data for more
                         effective use of resources. And in the longer term to develop more sophisticated budget and
                         management systems.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed project will primarily finance office equipment (ICT and office equipment), technical
                         assistance and training in order to achieve its development objective. The project will only finance
                         micro/minor works like putting up white-boards in the PFM Academy, putting in non-permanent
                         partitions in the inside of the offices to have break-out group sessions, and small touch-up paint (if
                         needed). Any contract issued for supply and installation of goods will include provisions for the
                         supplier to include the standard health and safety precautions that apply for such minor/micro works
                         and to manage any noise level and disposal of packaging of goods to ensure that there are no adverse
                         environmental impacts. The project will not construct any structures or finance any external
                         modifications of any facilities. Since the project will work through existing government institutional
                         structures to achieve its goal, no adverse environmental impact is foreseen. Therefore, in view of

                         the limited minor/micro works envisaged, in accordance with the Association's operational
                         environmental assessments (OP 4.01) is not triggered. Therefore, the proposed project had been
                         placed in Category C and did not require an environmental assessment.
