                           B. Project Objectives
                           The Project Development Objective is to help improve selected aspects of Djibouti’s business
                           environment and support enterprises in selected sector/industries. The PDO’s related performance
                           indicators are (i) the improvement in the investment climate as measured by the reduction in time
                           required to create a company; and the reduction in time to pay taxes; (ii) the decrease in the average
                           number of days to settle commercial dispute; (iii) the improvement of the performance of SMEs
                           supported by the project as measured by the increase in their sales/turnover compared to a control
                           group. The ultimate beneficiaries would be SMEs, Government and private sector institutions in
                           charge of PPD and investment climate reform.

                           Component 2: Investment Promotion and enterprises development (US$1.5million of which US
                           $1million from IDA for the matching grant, US$0.5million from PPIAF for the PPP framework, and
                           US$0.5million from the FPD Competitive Industries Program for the ANPI and PPD).

                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The project, by the nature of its development objective, brings together a diverse group of
                           stakeholders and beneficiaries, consisting of investors, SMEs, business owners, with diverse and
                           sometime conflicting interests. As the project is primarily offering technical assistance and capacity
                           building, with no infrastructure, the social impacts of the project are largely expected to be positive.
                           The project is considered to be a Category C as it will primarily finance technical assistance and
                           capacity building activities.
