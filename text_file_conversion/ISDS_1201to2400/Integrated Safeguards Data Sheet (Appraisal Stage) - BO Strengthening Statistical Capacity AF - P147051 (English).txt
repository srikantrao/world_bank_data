2. Project Development Objective(s)
   A. Original Project Development Objectives – Parent
   The project development objective is to strengthen the statistical capacity and improve the
   informational base of the Recipient,inorder to provide quality information, as defined by its
   reliability, timeliness, accuracy and representativeness with the levelof disaggregation necessary
   to support systems for planning, designing, monitoring and evaluating public programs and
   policies.
   B. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent


   C. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)


3. Project Description
The Additional Financing will include the following six activities:

 1. Census of Economic Establishments (CEE): The census willprovide a complete listing of
economic establishments in cities of at least 10,000 inhabitants in th e sectors of manufacturing, trade
and services. Information ov er their productio n , sales, raw materials, income and expenditure, and
employm ent wil l be collect ed (Activity 2.2.)

 2. Agricultural Survey (AS): Following the 2013 National Agricultural Census, the agricultural
survey will provide updated information on agricultural producti                                on,
prices and destination, as well as access to credit and insurance of the agr
icultural units (Activity 2.3.).

 3. Consumer Price Index (CPI): On the basis of the information collected in the Household Budget
Survey as well as that of the Specification Survey (including                               in this
activity), the new baskets of goods and services for the calculation of
the new base year will be constructed (Activity 2.4.)

 4. Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)is a nationally representative survey on reproductive
health, fertility, nutrition and infant mortality to be used to ev
aluate health public policies and establish a baseline for new sectoral s trate
gi es, plans and programs. The previous DHS was carried out in 2008, and by inte
rna tional standards it is recommended to collect this kind of info rmat
ion every five years (Activity 3.3. )

 5. Household Budget Survey (HBS): Survey to update information on the living conditions and
structure of household consumption; becoming the main input for the
change inthe base yearof the             Consumer Price                               Index, the
updating of poverty lin     es, and     the household consumptio                               n
estimate for national accounts. The survey wil l berepresentative of the nin
e dep      artmental capital cities and El Alto (Activit y 3.4.)

 6. Modernization of the Plurinational Statistical System: The overall objective of the activity is to
redesign and update norms, methodologies,technologyand q u ality standards for strengthe ning the


                                              Page 2 of 8
PSS and its statistical units, which inc l udes ac     tivities to ensure wide
dissemination of results that aimto strengthen t hestat              istical
culture. To support the implementation of these activities, an additional compo
nent is added:
 • Cross-cutting Teams and Project Coordination: This component includes planning,monitoring and
evaluation of activities under the project, as well as dissemin                           ation,
unit for coordination and engagement with social organizations (includ in
g IP), logistics and sampling, training, IT, data consistency, and cartography .

 Due to the nature of these activities, this Additional Financing is considered Technical Assistance
(TA) in accordance with OP 8.40, which describes TA as “the             transfer, adaptation, mobilization,
and utilization of servic                                  es, skills, knowle dge, technology, and
engineering to build national capacity o                                     n a sustainable bas is.” More
specifically, the activities u                                 nder the AF will both “undertake analyt
i cal work necessary                                    to underpin reform or policy development”; and
“strengthen              th e                                  Borrower’s human and institutional
capacity for policy reform” as per OP 8.                                                   40.

 The proposed activities are fully aligned with the original Project DevelopmentObjective. No new
Safeguard Policies are triggered, and the lessons learned fro m
theoriginal Project in the application of OP 4.10 h ave influenced the approac
h for the activities under this AF as describedbelow.

 6. Safeguard Policies                Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
 Environmental Assessment OP/         No               Project activities will not have adverse
 BP 4.01                                               environmental impacts.
 Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04          No               Project activities will not affect natural habitats.

 Forests OP/BP 4.36                   No               Project activities will not affect forest areas.

 Pest Management OP 4.09              No               The project will not procure any pesticides, nor
                                                       will an increased use of pesticides result from the
                                                       project.
 Physical Cultural Resources OP/      No               The project will not affect sites with
 BP 4.11                                               archeological, paleontological, historical,
                                                       religious, or unique natural values.
 Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10        Yes              The Indigenous Peoples’ policy (OP/BP 4.10),
                                                       which was triggered under the parent project, will



                                               Page 3 of 8
        remain triggered under the AF as Indigenous
        Peoples (IPs) with unique and different cultures
        and governance systems will be amongst the
        sampled population and will likely be affected by
        the policies that may be informed by the results of
        the statistical operations.

        The application of the Indigenous Peoples’ policy
        will ensure that: (i) survey designs are culturally
        appropriate; (ii) field testing and field work takes
        into consideration cultural contexts (i.e. language
        and terminology); and (iii) data collection
        procedures are fully respectful of IPs rights,
        governance systems and cultural practices.

        The original Project was treated as an Indigenous
        Peoples Project, thus embedded the elements of
        an Indigenous Peoples Plan in the overall project
        design as described in the lessons learned in
        Section II below. Under the AF, it was deemed
        that the original Project’s approach in the
        application of OP 4.10 should be modified for
        two reasons. First, in the new activities to be
        financed under the AF Indigenous Peoples will
        not be the sole or the overwhelming majority of
        direct project beneficiaries. Second, as described
        above, the activities under the AF are technical
        assistance, and thus the Interim Guidelines on the
        Application of Safeguard Policies to Technical
        Assistance (TA) Activities in Bank-Financed
        Projects and Trust Funds Administered by the
        Bank from January 2014 are applicable.

        As per the Guidelines and in order to ensure that
        the survey questionnaires and overall design are
        culturally appropriate, that field work is culturally
        pertinent, and that data collection procedures fully
        respect Indigenous Peoples governance and
        cultural practices, the following approach was
        agreed to ensure that the TA activities under the
        AF are fully consistent with OP 4.10.

        The Government of Bolivia prepared a draft
        strategy for engaging with Indigenous Peoples
        that includes stakeholder consultations and
        strategic communication activities included in the
        Project’s Operational Manual to be updated

                                                       during the implementation of the AF activities, as
                                                       necessary. In addition, during implementation,
                                                       prior to any field work in the affected
                                                       communities, INE will consult with the affected
                                                       communities on the strategy for the engagement
                                                       with Indigenous Peoples, the specific survey
                                                       design and proposed field work plan. Relevant
                                                       feedback from these consultations will be
                                                       reflected in INE’s methodology for field work
                                                       and/or the enumerator manuals, as necessary. All
                                                       of the above will build on the methodology that
                                                       INE regularly applies in its statistical operations,
                                                       in order to inform its strategic work with
                                                       Indigenous Peoples.
   Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP      No              Project activities will not cause involuntary

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     The Additional Financing will allow collecting better data across the country and including data
     concerning indigenous peoples, which is critical for the develo
     pment of improved strategies and policy-making for addressing Indigenous
     Peoples’ ne eds. The data developed through the project could have an important
     impact on public policy decisions and o        utcomes, including those tha
     t impact Indigenous     Peoples.
   2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
     in the project area:
     As described above, the Additional Financing is for the provision of TA. As such, the activities are
     unlikely in themselves to havedirect social impact on Indig
     enous Peoples. However, the information generated by the planned activi
     ties maylater have significantdownstream social implications as it is likely to
     inform f uture public policy decisions wit h potential impacts on Indigenous P
     eoples. The Interim Guidelines on the Application of Safeguard Policies to Tec
     hnical Assista nce from January 2014 apply to the activitiesu nder this TA and support the appro
     ach.


                                               Page 5 of 8
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
  impacts.
  The evaluation of project alternatives is not relevant for this TA.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
  assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  As under the Parent Project, OP4.10 is triggered for the activities under the AF.

  The borrower has prepared a draft strategy for engaging with Indigenous Peoples, which will be
 updated and operationalized on the basis of additional consultati                    ons and participation
 processes. The implementing agency, the National Statist                    i             c al Institute
 (INE), understands the importance and is comm                    itted to ensuring co ns
 ultations and partic ipatory processes involving indigenous                     groups where and when
 relevant. INE has demonstrated this commit ment during the implementation of th e national
 population and agricultural censu ses conducted under the parent projec t INE carried out a
 wide     range o f activities to consult with IPs an d to ensure t               heir par ticipation in the
 field work. These activit ies have been duly documented .In add ition, for the dissemination of
 the re sults of the activities implemente d under the parent project (as well as under the AF), INE
 is developing strategi es and products to specifically reach rural                           and IP
 populations. The                   draft strategy for engaging with I                         ndigenous
 Peoples draws on the lessons learned during the implementation of the                                parent
 project, and affirms that involvin                       gc                   ommunity and local
 authorities in all th e stages of the statistical operation                                s has been key
 to ensure maximum coverage and quality of the                          data collected in b oth rural and
 urban settings. The original Project has show                       n the value of having socialization
 workshops where the objectives of the statis                       tical operat ions were presented and
 the questionnaires discussed with IP groups                       , adapting thetraining manual to local
 contexts, and having enumerators designa                       te d by the communities themselves.
 INE has created a Unit                for Coordination and Liaison with Social and Institutional
 Organizations (CEOSI) that has the responsibility to respond to de mands from IP and to identify
 the soci                                     al organizations with which the planned st atistical
 operations will be soci ali                                    zed and coordinated.

  The draft strategy analyzes potential impacts on indigenous groups. The general assessment is that
 IPs (called Naciones y Pueblos Indígenas Originarios Campesi nos in the Bolivian Constitu
 tion—NyPIOCs) and Afro-Bolivians do not constitute t                he
 target population of any of thestatistical operations of the AF, the probabi              lity of their
 inclusion is bas                                  ed onpopulation weight. As 115 different populati
 on groups were identifiedin the 2012 Population Census, rangi                          ng from two
 membe             r s to close to two million members, itis t                  echnically and
 methodologically impos s ible to create indicators that are repre                    sentative of all
 the groups. However, th e main indigenous groups (quechua, ayma                         ra, chiquitano
 and guaranís) will most li kely be represented in most instrument s;and there is also a strong
 likelihoo d t hat other large population groups are included among the sampled households (chi
 chas, mojeños, guarayos and afro-bol                                     ivianos). The Census of
 Economic Establ ishme nts will include all establishment                                      s in
 population centers of 10,000 inhabitants or more, and will thus include all

  disaggregated by these categories. In gen eral, for th        e surve y s, the statistics to be produced
  will be disaggreg ated and representat ive of th e population based on gender, age and other chara
  cteristics based on further a nalysis. The draft strategy outlines
  INEs approach and capacity to eng                             age with In digenous Peoples. Given that
  thespecifics of the components (suchas the data c ollection instrumentsand the sampling frame)
  are not yet known, the d raft stra t egy presents the scope and time line for each statistical
  operationo r activity, where relevant, taking into account activit                       ies to inform and
  consult NyPIOCs an d Afro-Bolivians about the objective of the                             activity; the
  adjustment of the data collection instruments; and, the plan for                        the wide
  dissemination of the results based on appropriate language, format and                            methods.
  For the dissemin ation of res ults mobile teams will beset upto ensure                          that the
  information is widely accessi ble at the community level. INE has demon                             strated
  good capacity in                       the parent pro ject to e                    ngage with IPs, and
  the draft strategy for engaging with          Indigenous Peo ples defines further activities to
  strengthen t                                    he capacity to co llect representa tive informa tion
  related to the smaller ethnic groups, specific          ally through the administrative records under
  the Modernization comp onent.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
  on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
  The strategy for engaging with Indigenous Peoples lays out the main participants, the scope and
  the time line for the engagement with the NyPIOCs and Afro-Boliv
  ians in each individual stat istical activity andoperation, as relevant, wh
  ich i nclu              des socialization                                    prior to any field work.
  The Unit for Coordination and Lia ison with Social                                           and Institution
  al Organizations (CEOSI) will support this work                                                   and

If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the
respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental Assessment/
Audit/or EMP.
If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please explain why:
A policy instrument is not required because the activities planned under the AF are technical
