                           rural workers) by: (a) strengthening their organizational, planning and management capacity to
                           achieve poverty-reduction goals; (b) improving their access to community infrastructure and services

                         Component 1: Capacity Development (US$13.83 million, of which: Government US$11.73 million
                         and IBRD US$2.10 million). This component would finance carrying out of capacity-building
                         activities for purposes of increasing the impact of development actions on targeted rural groups,
                         consisting of: (a) the provision of technical support to communities and organizations of small
                         producers, indigenous peoples and rural workers, aimed at improving their organizational, planning,
                         and management capacity; and (b) the provision of technical support to strengthen the capacity of
                         targeted rural groups through the preparation of studies, strategies and planning instruments for local
                         development.

                         Component 2: Rural Livelihood (US$43.0 million, of which: Beneficiaries US$4.00 million; and
                         IBRD US$39.00 million). This component would finance the carrying out of demand-driven
                         investments/activities (Rural Investment Subprojects ) aimed at improving the living conditions of
                         the targeted poor rural communities and consisting of, inter alia, small-scale investments such as the
                         rehabilitation or construction of rural community infrastructures, the provision of support aimed at
                         improving agricultural production and marketing, the carrying out of food-security activities and
                         natural resources management, and the construction or improvement of household water and
                         sanitation systems.
                         Financing would include both on-farm and household investments as well as infrastructure, goods,
                         and services for the community. Rural Investment Subprojects would be ranked based on social,
                         environmental and technical evaluations and be prioritized accordingly. Participating communities
                         would be expected to co-finance subprojects in cash, kind or labor for at least 10 percent of their total
                         cost. Financing for Rural Investment Subprojects would be limited to a maximum amount of US
                         $250,000, with a maximum of US$5,000 per beneficiary family. Thirty percent of the componentâ€™s
                         allocation will be earmarked for Indigenous People Subprojects.

                         Component 3: Access to Markets (US$14.77 million, of which: Government US$0.37 million;

                         Beneficiaries US$3.40 million; and IBRD US$11.00 million). This component would finance the
                         provision of support for the identification, formulation and implementation of business ventures
                         (Productive Alliances) between producer groups and market agents buyers) through (a) the carrying
                         out of activities for the promotion and preparation of Productive Alliance Subprojects, and (b) the
                         carrying out of alliance-driven investments/activities (such as small-scale civil works, improvement
                         of the production processes and quality standards of Producers Organizations) for the purpose of
                         developing sustainable access to markets for Producers Organizations. Financing of each Productive
                         Alliance Subproject would be tailored to achieve the specifications (quantity, quality, delivery
                         schedule, etc.) agreed between each producers group and the respective buyer. The focus of this
                         component is on the market opportunities for family producers rather than their needs (as it is for
                         Component 2).

                         Eligible expenses for the producer groups include goods and equipment, civil works, and technical
                         assistance, all of which could be at the individual farm and/or at the group level. Producer groups
                         would be required to co-finance a minimum of 30 percent of the total cost of each Productive
                         Alliance Subproject. Producers will be assisted in securing access to credit in order to support their
                         co-financing of the subproject. Reimbursement to buyers for technical assistance they provide to
                         producers, if any, would be limited to a maximum of 50 percent of the incremental operating costs
                         incurred by each buyer. Financing for each Productive Alliance Subprojects would be limited to a
                         maximum amount of US$300,000, with a maximum of US$10,000 per producer family.

                         IBRD US$0.27 million IBRD). This component would finance the provision of operational support

                         to assist the Borrower in the coordination, implementation, administration, monitoring and evaluation
                         of the Project. The component would support the costs of the technical units responsible for Project
                         coordination, administration, monitoring and evaluation, including inter alia incremental operating
                         costs; monitoring and evaluation system; technical and financial audits; management and oversight
                         of fiduciary activities; maintenance of offices; acquisition and maintenance of goods and equipment
                         needed for project activities.

                         analysis (if known)
                         Project Area. Consistent with the CPS, the Project area will include regions characterized by both
                         high levels of rural poverty and strong concentration of smallholder producers and/or indigenous
                         peoples. Accordingly, the initial area of intervention will comprise the regions of North-East
                         Argentina (Noreste Argentino NEA) and North-West Argentina (Noroeste Argentino â€“ NOA).
                         Component 3, because of its pilot nature, would be carried out only in NEA, based on the higher
                         concentration of transitional family producers as well as the variety and importance of the
                         agricultural value chains in which they are involved.
                         For components 1 and 2, Project resources would be allocated to participating provinces based on
                         their relative distribution of small producers and indigenous communities. Within each Participating
                         Province, Project resources would be allocated in priority to micro-regions that demonstrate above-
                         average presence (both in relative and absolute value) of target beneficiaries. The criteria for
                         allocation of resources by provinces and areas are spelled out in the Operational Manual.
