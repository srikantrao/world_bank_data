                           The Project Development Objective is to assist the Government of Vietnam to: (i) achieve the
                           revision of the curriculum and the restructuring of the assessment system for grades 1-12 and (ii)
                           implement the new curriculum and assessment system in an effective and timely manner.

                           Achieving this objective will, besides improving pedagogy and teacher effectiveness, contribute to
                         continued increases in learning achievement within Vietnamese primary and secondary schools in the
                         long run.
                         C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The proposed Project will be designed to help the GOV reach its highest goal in education: to
                         produce public school graduates who have strong general knowledge complemented by increased
                         capacities for critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving. The revised curriculum will be
                         compatible with the increased use of emerging pedagogical techniques—especially those piloted
                         under the Vietnam Escuela Nueva Project (VNEN)—that decrease the role of simple memorization-
                         based learning in Vietnamese schools.

                         An expanded national assessment system based on the revised curriculum will conduct valid and
                         reliable large-scale standardized examinations. The new assessment system will include nationally-
                         representative assessments in primary and lower secondary schools to complement the existing
                         exams in upper secondary schools.


                         Component 1: Support the development of new general education curriculum (25M USD)
                         This component will directly support the development and drafting process of the general curriculum
                         and subject-specific curricula for grades 1-12. It will directly support and finance aspects of the
                         MOET curriculum revision apparatus and continuously facilitate the provision of high-quality
                         technical inputs relevant to the revision process.
                         It will support the revision process itself, especially by supporting the creation and work of a Core
                         Technical Committee (CTC) for curriculum reform. The CTC will be a technical group under the
                         supervision and direction of the PMU that develops recommendations to the MOET and the GOV on
                         all aspects of the curriculum development process from beginning to final appraisal and
                         implementation, especially with respect to the writing of subject-specific standards and curricula.

                         This component will support the following activities: (i) capacity building for curriculum developers

                         and appraisers, (ii) organization of the development, consultations, and appraisal of the general
                         curriculum; (iii) revision of the general curriculum (if needed) during the implementation process;
                         (iv) organization of the development, consultations, and issuance of subject-specific curricula to
                         schools at all grades/levels of general education; (v) revision of the subject-specific curricula (as
                         needed) during the implementation and experimentation process.
                         The experimentation is only conducted on new content and teaching methods as compared to the
                         existing curriculum, and is carried out during the process of curriculum development by the
                         curriculum and textbook authors themselves under the guidance of the Ministry of Education and
                         Training. The experimentation will be implemented at educational institutions that are regional
                         representatives in order to draw experience and making adjustments before nationwide
                         implementation.

                         Component 2: Development and provision of pedagogical materials (textbooks and guidelines) based
                         on the new general education curriculum (30M USD)

                         This component will facilitate the development of pedagogical materials by, inter alia, providing
                         careful guidance to third-party textbook developers as well as in-house developers. In particular, this
                         component will support: (i) the creation of clear terms of reference and selection of prospective
                         developers of pedagogical materials and textbooks; (ii) the development, consultation, and appraisal
                         of pedagogical materials and textbooks, and (iii) the support for the provision of textbooks to schools
                         in geographic areas with difficult economic circumstances, ethnic minority students, and students
                         affected by natural disasters, and (iv) the pilot and revision of textbooks and guidelines after
                         consultation and appraisal.

                         The textbooks and pedagogical materials will be appraised by the authorities established by the
                         Ministry of Education and Training based on the technical advice of the CTC. The pedagogical
                         materials will be appraised by appropriate authorities within MOET based on the technical opinions
                         of the CTC. Guidelines for the appraisal process will be developed under this component during the
                         early stages of Project implementation. Guidelines will be developed using inputs from various
                         stakeholders (including teachers, administrators, and students) and in consultation with selected
                         international experts.

                         Component 3: Support the reform of the national examination system and assessment of general
                         education quality (20M USD)

                         This component will improve the coverage, technical quality, alignment, validity, and reliability of
                         the national assessment system, as well as improve how national assessment results are used. It will
                         promote the large-scale assessment of nationally-representative samples of student cohorts in
                         primary and lower secondary schools to complement the current assessments in upper secondary
                         schools. This component will support: (i) integration of curricula and assessment; (ii) closer
                         alignment of assessment with learning goals; (iii) training for educators and administrators at various
                         levels of the system to design and implement assessments and analyze and report the results; (iv)
                         creation of specialized expertise within MOET about continuously improving assessment capacity;
                         and (v) infrastructure development (including examination and appraisal database). At the same time,
                         this component will include institutional capacity-building for the assessment regime to strengthen
                         high-quality measurement and use of data on learning outcomes as a routine feature of Vietnam’s
                         education system.
                         This component will also support the general measurement of the success of the new curriculum and
                         assessment system. In particular, it will analyze reasons why some students learn more than others
                         under the new curriculum with a particular focus on the benefits that accrue to students from ethnic

                         minority backgrounds and/or the lowest 40 percent of the socioeconomic scale (based on household
                         income). In other words, this component will help maintain an iterated cycle of research to facilitate
                         effective implementation of the new curriculum.
                         To facilitate the research and measurement discussed above, the Project will support the development
                         of a joint National Curriculum Research and Development and Assessment center (with the main
                         office located in Hanoi and four other facilities located in four regions). This center will serve as a
                         think-tank for conducting ongoing research on curriculum and assessment in addition to the items
                         mentioned above. In addition, it will also be a training, conference and capacity building center for
                         curriculum and assessment researchers and developers and a facility for teachers and school
                         administrators training on the implementation of the new curriculum and the new assessment system.
                         The construction of two physical buildings on one site will facilitate knowledge-sharing, and enable
                         the center to operate in a way that allows for thorough, unbiased policy-informing research while still
                         maintaining a direct line of communication with the MOET and other parts of the Government of
                         Vietnam.
                         In addition, the Government is focused on foreign language teaching and learning in general
                         education schools. In order ensure the quality of foreign language teaching and learning, the Project
                         will also support the development of a Center for Foreign Languages (the main center is expected to
                         be located in Hanoi, with two satellites located in two other regions).
                         The main activities of this sub-component are: (i) new construction or rehabilitation of office space;
                         (ii) supply of equipment and furniture; (iii) provision of books and research materials; (iii)
                         professional development and training to enhance competencies of center staff and collaborators.

                         This component will support all aspects of project management in both the planning and
                         implementation phases. Examples of activities financed under this component are project monitoring
                         and evaluation and salaries for Project staff.
                         The proposed Project will be designed to help the GOV reach its highest goal in education: to
                         produce public school graduates who have strong general knowledge complemented by increased
                         capacities for critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving. The revised curriculum will be

                         This component will improve the coverage, technical quality, alignment, validity, and reliability of
                         the national assessment system, as well as improve how national assessment results are used. It will
                         promote the large-scale assessment of nationally-representative samples of student cohorts in
                         primary and lower secondary schools t o complement the current assessments in upper secondary
                         schools. This component will support: (i) integration of curricula and assessment; (ii) closer
                         alignment of assessment with learning goals; (iii) training for educators and administrators at various
                         levels of the system to design and implement assessments and analyze and report the results; (iv)
                         creation of specialized expertise within MOET about continuously improving assessment capacity;
                         and (v) infrastructure development (including examination and appraisal database). At the same time,
                         this component will include institutional capacity-building for the assessment regime to strengthen
                         high-quality measurement and use of data on learning outcomes as a routine feature of Vietnam’s
                         education system.
                         This component will also support the general measurement of the success of the new curriculum and

                         assessment system. In particular, it will analyze reasons why some students learn more than others
                         under the new curriculum with a particular focus on the benefits that accrue to students from ethnic
                         minority backgrounds and/or the lowest 40 percent of the socioeconomic scale (based on household
                         income). In other words, this component will help maintain an iterated cycle of research to facilitate
                         effective implementation of the new curriculum.
                         To facilitate the research and measurement discussed above, the Project will support the development
                         of a joint National Curriculum Research and Development and Assessment center (with the main
                         office located in Hanoi and four other facilities located in four regions). This center will serve as a
                         think-tank for conducting ongoing research on curriculum and assessment in addition to the items
                         mentioned above. In addition, it will also be a training, conference and capacity building center for
                         curriculum and assessment researchers and developers and a facility for teachers and school
                         administrators training on the implementation of the new curriculum and the new assessment system.
                         The construction of two physical buildings on one site will facilitate knowledge-sharing, and enable
                         the center to operate in a way that allows for thorough, unbiased policy-informing research while still
                         maintaining a direct line of communication with the MOET and other parts of the Government of
                         Vietnam.
                         In addition, the Government is focused on foreign language teaching and learning in general
                         education schools. In order ensure the quality of foreign language teaching and learning, the Project
                         will also support the development of a Center for Foreign Languages (the main center is expected to
                         be located in Hanoi, with two satellites located in two other regions).
                           The main activities of this sub-component are: (i) new construction or rehabilitation of office space;
                           (ii) supply of equipment and furniture; (iii) provision of books and research materials; (iii)
                           professional development and training to enhance competencies of center staff and collaborators.

                           This Project finances critical technical assistance that is, intellectual inputs into the curricular and
                           assessment design processes, which will be implemented national wide.

                           In addition, the Project will assist the development of a Center for Curriculum Research and
                           Assessment (with the main office located in Hanoi and four other facilities located in four regions)
                           and the development of a Center for Foreign Languages (the main center is expected to be located in
                           Hanoi, with two satellites located in two other regions). The exact locations of the main centers and
                           their satellites are still not yet determined, however, it is expected that these will be set within the
                           current premises of MOET and MOET’s universities.
