                           B. Project Objectives
                           The development objective of the Tax Administration Modernization Project (TAMP) is to increase
                           the effectiveness and efficiency of the tax system through strengthened voluntary compliance,
                           reduced compliance costs, enhanced professionalism and integrity of STI staff and the use of modern
                           technology.

                           The long-term vision is a tax administration with streamlined business processes supported by risk-
                         based compliance management, effective use of electronic communication with taxpayers, skilled
                         and professional staff, contributing to an efficient, client-oriented tax administration characterized by
                         fairness, honesty and transparency. The modernized tax administration will improve the business

                         environment and thereby increase country's competitiveness.

                         This project supports the Government of Moldova’s Tax Administration Reform Strategy for
                         2011-15. The strategy focuses on increasing voluntary compliance and improved service delivery to
                         taxpayers through modernization of institutional procedures and use of modern information
                         technology. The MoF leadership and STI top management requested the World Bank support for tax
                         administration reform. There continues to be a high level of demand for and commitment to tax
                         administration reform from the MoF, top management of the STI as well as buy-in from staff at the
                         STI.
                         C. Project Description
                         The proposed project seeks to modernize the working of the tax system in Moldova to benefit from
                         an integrated, highly automated, low-discretion, risk-based structure. The project will be
                         implemented over five years to help the GoM achieve its objectives stated in the Strategic Plan for
                         2011-2015. This will include organizational restructuring, business process improvement, human
                         resource management and training, and IT infrastructure changes necessary for optimal deployment
                         of an Integrated Tax Management systems (ITMS). The project would include financial and technical
                         support for improving revenue collection methodologies and procedures; information technology and
                         other technological infrastructure; training, and technical assistance to underpin STI’s organization
                         structure and management, and operational systems refinements. In addition, technical assistance
                         would be provided to the MoF to draft a new Tax Code to replace the significantly outdated Tax
                         Code 1998. Project components would include:

                         •        Component 1. Tax policy and analysis. This component will finance activities to provide
                         technical assistance for: (i) revising the Tax Code; (ii) building in-house capacity in STI for tax
                         modeling, revenue forecasting, and tax analysis; (iii) analyzing the levels of compliance of taxpayers;

                         (iii) evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the STI; (iv) recommending additional revenue
                         measures; and (v) building in-house capacity in STI for monitoring key performance indicators.

                         review and redesign of the organizational structure at headquarters, regional, and local offices based
                         on the Government’s regionalization plan ; (ii) implementation of the reorganization based on the
                         regionalization plan; (iii) strengthening of capacity for strategic management and performance
                         assessment within the STI; (iv) comprehensive review of HR policies, and development of revised
                         work flow analysis, workforce planning and strategy; (v) development of a training strategy and
                         curriculum for tax administration staff; (vi) purchase of technical and training equipment for the
                         training center and distance learning system; and (vii) building capacity of STI through study tours,
                         managerial/HR training, and language training.
                         •        Component 3. Operational Development. Strengthened compliance management is
                         considered to be the cornerstone of an efficient tax administration. This component will be based on
                         the re-engineered business processes that will be undertaken during project preparation. This will
                         make the self-assessment and risk management system work more effectively and will provide
                         further elaboration of business processes. The component will: (i) further elaborate on business
                         process re-engineering; (ii) strengthen skills of STI auditors, especially in the LTO, in the detection
                         of tax frauds; (iii) enhance staff capacity for enforced collection; (iv) improve internal control and
                         internal audit; (v) revamp taxpayer services to develop modern service delivery channels; (vi)

                           •        Component 4. IT Infrastructure and System Modernization. This component will: (i) acquire
                           and implement an ITMS; (ii) develop an integrated data management system; (iii) acquire required

                           hardware to support the ITMS and data warehouse; (iv) provide training in the use of the ITMS; (v)
                           establish a business continuity recovery system. The ITMS will unify IT support for all business
                           functions including: user management, registration, returns processing, accounting, payment
                           processing, enforcement, objections and appeals, audit, risk assessment, reporting, work flow, data
                           warehouse and business intelligence tools, a document management system and a portal interface.
                           The new system will provide for electronic interaction with the taxpayers. It will also provide a bi-
                           directional link to other systems that share data with the STI including Customs Service, CNAS, and
                           NHIF. The new system will be installed in the GoM’s e-Government Center and will have data
                           replication to a business continuity center.
                           •        Component 5. Project Management and Change Management: This component will
                           strengthen the STI capacity to provide timely and quality project implementation in accordance with
                           the World Bank guidelines. The component will finance (i) national and international consultants to
                           support procurement, financial management, project audit, and technical implementation; (ii)
