                         3. Project Description
                         Component 1: Forest-friendly and climate-resilient restoration of Gishwati-Mukura landscape

                         This Component will support the application of the landscape approach to forest restoration and
                         conservation for the improvement of ecosystem functions and services in the Gishwati forest area,
                         and possibly adjacent parts of the Nile-Congo Crest. It aims to arrest and eventually reverse the
                         ongoing land conversion in the area through forest restoration (to the extent feasible) and agro-
                         forestry approaches in a manner that will maximize ecological connectivity and hydrological
                         function in the landscape.

                         Sub-Component 1.a.: Upgrading and sustainable management of Gishwati-Mukura Protected Area

                         a.       The project will support the planned upgrading of the Gishwati core forest area (the remnant
                         natural forest areas within the former Gishwati Forest Reserve) and the Mukura Forest Reserve to a
                         single protected area. The 19 km stretch of hills between the two reserves is also densely populated
                         and mainly occupied by agricultural land (see Annex 2 for details on the challenges faced by the two
                         reserves).

                         b.      Investments in this protected area will complete the planning process, strengthen
                         management and accelerate ecological restoration in support of upgrading to national park status and
                         to improve the protection of two key biodiversity refugia within the Nile-Congo crest. Based on
                         consultations with RDB, it was agreed that the priority investments to be supported will focus on:

                         c.       Physical demarcation of the reserves. The boundaries of core forest areas and buffer zones

                         for the national park are proposed in a draft law. The vegetation, use and co-management structure of
                         the buffer zones will be discussed and agreed with local communities. The project will support
                         consultation meetings and costs of physical demarcation for completion of this process.

                         d.       Restoration of degraded natural habitats. In both reserves, assisted regeneration of degraded
                         portions will be carried out involving planting of native species, and where necessary removal of
                         exotics. In some limited areas where mining has taken place, there may also be needs for small-scale
                         works to fill excavations. Local labor will be used for restoration works.

                         e.        Development (and updating) of management plans. A management plan exists for Mukura,
                         but it is outdated. None exists yet for Gishwati. A plan will be developed for the management of both
                         areas as a single reserve. The management plan will address ongoing restoration and ecological
                         management needs, a protection plan based on identification of the most critical biodiversity
                         elements, and a strategy for eco-tourism development. Much of the plan, however, will address the
                         management of needs of the local population, in particular provision of substitutes for resources
                         which were previously accessed from the forest reserves, co-management and sustainable use
                         arrangements for the buffer zone, and to the extent possible, benefit-sharing arrangements, including
                         local participation in tourism development.        The management planning process is also expected
                         to result in the preparation of a Biosphere Reserve nomination to UNESCO for the Gishwati-Mukura
                         National Park and surrounding the landscape.


                                                                      Page 2 of 15
                         f.       Training and equipping of local eco-guards. After establishment of the National Park, the
                         cadre of existing eco-guards is expected to be extended to 12 persons each for the Gishwati and
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Mukura sections. The project will provide basic equipment to the guards, as well as training to
                         enhance their abilities to record systematic threat monitoring for the reserve, act as community
                         liaisons. In addition to the community-based activities of the eco-guards, the project will provide
                         resources to mobilize periodic spot-checks and support from local law enforcement agencies where
                         serious issues are involved, taking a sensitive and graduated app roach with local offenders.
                         Chimpanzee habituation and tourist guiding will also be supported. Should there be a delay in the
                         establishment of the national park, the Project may pay salaries of the existing eco-guards as an
                         interim measure.

                         g.      Installation of basic infrastructure. In accordance with the management plan, the project will
                         provide basic infrastructure, such as the construction of visitor centers, a park headquarters, viewing
                         platforms, signed nature trails, and patrol posts.

                         h.      Environmental education. An environmental education program targeting local communities
                         and environmental clubs in schools will be continued in the Gishwati area and extended to Mukura to
                         explain the need for biodiversity protection and the specific responsibilities of local residents.
                         Activities may also include creating literacy centers for adults as focal sites for environmental
                         education, as well as local exchanges with communities around Volcanoes National Park.

                         Sub-Component 1.b.: Forest restoration and land husbandry in the Gishwati landscape

                         Moving beyond the core forests, the project will work on management of the broader Gishwati-
                         Mukura landscape to enhance both production and watershed values, whilst capitalizing on
                         opportunities to increase the representation of native forest elements and therefore biodiversity
                         connectivity in the landscape. The project would finance planning at the landscape level and with
                         individual communities, and would support the implementation of tree-based landscape restoration

                         approaches through provision of training, seeds, materials, and through payment for local labor.

                         The priority investments will focus on:
                         a.       Sustainable land management with corridor communities. Establishment of a Gishwati-
                         Mukura forest corridor has been adopted as a national goal and is reflected in the National Land Use
                         Master Plan. However, the high population density and the almost complete agricultural conversion
                         of the putative corridor area mean that there is no realistic potential for re-establishment of a broad
                         swath of forest without major economic dislocation of local communities. The project will therefore
                         focus on increasing the representation of native forest elements in the landscape, enhancing
                         biological connectivity via an archipelago of ecological islands and soft boundaries. Set aside of
                         highly vulnerable ridge-tops, extreme slopes, and riparian buffers (in keeping with national
                         legislation that requires such buffers) and/or unproductive lands, combined with agroforestry
                         techniques which favor native species, offers the potential to greatly increase biological connectivity
                         whilst maintaining or enhancing the productive value of the landscape. Significant investments in
                         land use intensification would be offered to communities in return for restricting agriculture in the
                         most vulnerable lands and establishing protection forests. The project will pilot this approach through
                         participatory micro-watershed planning with local communities to identify sustainable land
                         management investments with a particular emphasis on the promotion of agroforestry techniques that
                         incorporate native species. The planning process would result in agreement on a set of watershed
                         rehabilitation actions, similar to those under other project, such as LWH, but with added emphasis on

                                                                      Page 3 of 15
                         identification of agroforestry potentials.

                         b.       Silvo-pastoralism in Gishwati rangelands. Within rangeland areas of the former Gishwati

                         Forest Reserve, the project will invest in establishment of silvo-pastoral techniques, emphasizing the
                         use of native species. This would include establishing trees on ridge-tops, extreme slopes, riparian
                         buffers, and as live fences, shelter belts and shade trees, through planting and managed natural
                         regrowth. Although this would involve a marginal loss in the area of pasture, silvo-pastoral
                         approaches are expected to improve the overall productivity of rangelands (in addition to enhancing
                         forest cover and biological connectivity) by protecting against land degradation, providing shelter for
                         animals from climatic extremes, and through provision of additional fodder and forest products.
                         Silvo-pastoral interventions would be accompanied, where necessary, with training on improved
                         livestock and pasture management.

                         c.       Agroforestry and forest restoration support to MINAGRI and Forests Department. The
                         Project may help finance the completion ongoing re-establishment of natural forest, ensuring the use
                         of an appropriate and diverse mix of native species. In agreement with the Department of Forests of
                         RNRA, the project may also finance the conversion of a portion of the production pine forests into
                         natural forest. Furthermore, within the areas of the former Gishwati Forest Reserve that are being
                         targeted for investment through LWH, the project would provide supplementary assistance in the
                         form of technical advice and seedlings for diversification (and where feasible intensification) of
                         agroforestry techniques.

                         d.      Joint land use planning for the Gishwati landscape. The project would work with the
                         Department of Lands in RNRA to establish a working group to revise and harmonize existing land
                         use planning for the landscape. This working group, with participation from relevant ministries,
                         agencies, and districts would agree on a land use planning framework within which LAFREC would
                         operate, maximizing potential synergies and avoiding unnecessary conflicts. An early task for the
                         working group will be to assign a task force to undertake a technical review of mining activities in
                         the Gishwati-Mukura area.

                         Sub-Component 1.c.: Sustainable and resilient livelihoods

                         This sub-component will support demand-driven income-generating activities in order to increase (i)
                         the breadth of the economic options and security of the livelihoods base of the population within the
                         Gishwati-Mukura landscape, thereby improving climate resilience; and (ii) the sustainability of land
                         and forest management investments within the landscape. Livelihoods support will be available to
                         communities surrounding the Gishwati core forest area and the Mukura Forest Reserve, within
                         targeted areas of the Gishwati-Mukura corridor, and involved in project re-forestation interventions
                         in the area of the forest Gishwati Forest Reserve. Support will preferentially be provided to
                         livelihood options which: (i) decrease dependency on unsustainable exploitation of forest resources,
                         through provision of alternatives for products from protected forest and increased energy efficiency;
                         (ii) depend directly on successful application of SLM technologies or management of resources; (iii)
                         add value to agricultural or forest products, justifying increased investments in sustainable land and
                         natural resources management; or (iv) provide additional income with negligible environmental
                         impact.

                         Building on what was achieved during project preparation, identification of livelihood potentials will

                         Identification of livelihood potentials will largely occur as an integral part of community-based
                         participatory planning activities in the course of the landscape restoration activities discussed above -
                         i.e. protected area and buffer zone management planning, micro-catchment planning in the corridor
                         area, and planning for rangeland management activities in the former Gishwati Forest Reserve. This
                         ground-up approach will also be complemented with top-down advisory services from an
                         agribusiness consultant/NGO that will organize trade fairs; and identify and support establishment of
                         production and marketing linkages with the private sector. This will take into account community
                         production strengths and opportunities in a limited number of value chains, identification of bottle

                         course of the project associated with ongoing regional development activities.

                         Development and start-up of alternative livelihoods will support capacity-building for farmer groups
                         and cooperatives, as well as training (including peer learning, local exchange visits and study tours),
                         initial inputs (e.g. seed) and tools in support of specific livelihood interventions. Within the project
                         area, farmer groups are already established, and many have significant capacity to manage group
                         activities and finances. Need for additional support to build organizational, technical, financial and
                         business capacities will be therefore be assessed in terms of past performance and current linkages to
                         other forms of support. Linkage to restoration activities will also be promoted in terms of piggy-
                         backing on the use of local labor for landscape restoration work.

                         Floods have had a great impact on human development, properties, infrastructures as well as the
                         environment in northwestern Rwanda. Steep slopes, soil instability, heavy rains, insufficient drainage
                         systems combine with inappropriate land management to create high vulnerability. This sub-
                         component aims to improve the technical capacity of flood forecasting institutions and complement
                         identified important milestones required to have a fully integrated Early Warning System (EWS) in
                         an effort to reduce economic losses and risks to life in pilot flood-prone watersheds.

                         LAFREC project will focus on establishing an EWS through the introduction of operational
                         precipitation and flood forecasting. This a is multi-sectoral activity which will be a joint effort of the
                         Rwanda Meteorology Agency (RMA, responsible for development of precipitation forecasts,
                         including utilization of data from a Doppler radar that will be installed soon, and issuing warnings to
                         authorized government and municipal authorities), RNRA (real time stream gauging, flood modeling
                         and forecasting), and MIDIMAR (issuing warnings to public, guiding mitigation activities) and local
                         authorities/communities. It is expected that this activity will be piloted in a few small/medium size
                         watershed with high risk of flooding.

                         Main activities in this sub-component will include: (i) a flood mitigation study in the selected pilot
                         watersheds to provide a clear analysis of the flood issues and highlight the existing gaps that should
                         be addressed within the scope of the sub-component; and (ii) technical assistance:

                         Component 2 – Research, monitoring and management

                         Sub-Component 2.a.: Applied research and impact monitoring
                         The project aims to demonstrate the potential and inform future implementation of forest-friendly
                         land rehabilitation approaches to leverage the much larger land husbandry investment programs
                         being led by the agriculture sector, as well as any potential future investment programs in the water
                         resources or forestry sectors that may also be interested in adopting the approach. To this end,
                         support for applied research and systematic impact evaluation that goes beyond the immediate needs
                         of the project is a sound investment.

                         Impact monitoring would support: (i) the establishment of a national modeling platform to map
                         indicators of landscape health, and identify landscape management priorities, based on hotspots of
                         degradation, and the feasibility and benefits of restoring lost environmental and economic functions;
                         and (ii) comparative field-based monitoring of a range of environmental and associated economic
                         functions, to demonstrate the effectiveness of land rehabilitation techniques.

                         Applied research would support the establishment of partnerships with key research and knowledge
                         institutions to improve management knowledge of the Gishwati-Mukura landscape, and to improve

                         restoration techniques, particularly in relation to scope for incorporation of native species.

                         A list of priority topics would include: (i) Biodiversity inventory and forest ecology for Mukura and
                         Gishwati reserves; (ii) Ecological investigations on the health, needs and constraints of the
                         chimpanzee population and other primates, with a view to developing a long-term recovery (and
                         potentially eco-tourism strategy); (iii) Forest restoration ecology; (iv) Propagation of native tree and
                         forest species; (v) Integration and productive use of native species within agroforestry systems; (vi)
                         Benefits of agroforestry techniques in rangeland and estate crop settings; (vii) Improved woodlot
                         management; (viii) Rural energy solutions.

                         Sub-Component 2.b.: Project management
                         Project management expenditures will cover routine administrative overheads, such as coordination
                         between project implementing partners, work-planning, procurement and contract management,
                         accounting and audit costs, field supervision, maintaining an internal project M&E system, and
                         reporting.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Rwanda is a small, landlocked and mountainous country. The westernmost fifth of the country lies
                         within the Congo basin, whereas the remainder is part of the Nile basin. The Nile-Congo Crest

                         divides these two catchments along a north-south line, and forms part of the Albertine Rift Montane
                         Forest Ecoregion, which hosts 52% of all bird species and 39% of all mammal species on the African
                         continent. Rwanda’s two most important forest protected areas lie at either end of the crest – to the

                         north the Volcanoes National Park, and Nyungwe National Park to the south. The ridge in between
                         had been largely deforested, but includes two forest reserves – Gishwati and Mukura – which have
                         been designated Key Biodiversity Areas for supporting population of eastern chimpanzee and an
                         endangered swamp warbler, respectively. The project target landscape includes the Gishwati Core
                         Forest (1439.72 ha) and the Mukura Forest Reserve (1987.74 ha) which are planned to be gazetted as
                         a single national park, a roughly 20km long corridor area between the two, and the area of the former
                         Gishwati Forest Reserve, which extends beyond the remaining Core Forest. Its forests were largely
                         intact in 1978, and substantial forest cover still remained in 1986 despite a significant decrease. But
                         by 2001, following the settlement in the area of refugees from the conflict in the mid- 90s, only a
                         small circular patch of native forest remained, and today the remaining forest is less than 1,000 ha
                         with some additional areas under natural regeneration. The remainder of the landscape is composed
                         of agricultural land, rangeland, tea plantations and pine plantations, and currently has little
                         biodiversity value.

                         Rainfall and topography are most severe in western Rwanda. Risks of flash floods and landslides are
                         highest where recent deforestation has occurred, such as within the former Gishwati Forest Reserve.
                         Deforestation is believed to have exacerbated local flooding, with one event in 2007 alone causing
                         more than a dozen deaths and leading to extensive crop and property damage. A study on the
                         Economics of Climate Change in Rwanda estimated that the direct economic costs of the 2007 flood
                         ranged from US$4 m to US$20 m in 2 districts alone. Landslides and erosion are estimated to cause
                         the loss of a million tons of soil per year, reducing local agricultural productivity and causing heavy
                         siltation of the Sebeya river, increasing water supply and hydropower maintenance costs. The
                         districts around Gishwati were identified as priority areas for disaster risk reduction and climate
                         adaptation in Rwanda's NAPA. The project aims to use an integrated landscape management
                         approach to both biodiversity and climate resilience functions in this important by vulnerable
                         landscape.

                         The target landscape is around 40,000 ha in total size and intersects cells with a total population of
                         224,533, around 15,000 of whom live in the immediate vicinity of the two remaining forest patches.
                         The local population mainly lives on agriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock rearing
                         (especially cattle in the rangelands of the former Gishwati Reserve). Their crops include tea, potatoes
                         (mainly Irish), maize and beans, etc. However, in addition to these main activities, people (especially
                         around Mukura) also derive income from small-scale mining, mainly practiced by young men and
                         focused on coltan, cassiterite and wolfram. Livelihood activities that adversely affect the remaining
                         forest areas include firewood collection, some illegal mining within the forest, and setting fires. The
                         fires were often started by people who wanted to expand grazing land, but the practice has now been
                         contained and monitored.

                         The Social Assessment (SA) identified several social groups in LAFREC area that are in a clearly
                         disadvantaged or vulnerable position. These include: the disabled, women headed households;
                         unemployed and landless youth, orphaned children, child family heads, elderly and single parents.
                         The SA indicates female-headed households as follows: Rutsiro District 28%, Ngororero District
                         34%, Nyabihu District 53.2%, and Rubavu District 30.1%. A significant proportion of female headed
                         households are made up of widows in childbearing age. Female headed households with smaller
                         family size but access to land face a shortage of labor. They depend on external labor, either through
                         renting or share cropping farming arrangements, leaving them only with partial benefits from their

                                                                      Page 7 of 15
                         farm lands. Women from poorest households as well as resource poor female headed households and
                         the elderly women are stuck in poverty, their main livelihood being charcoal and fire wood collection
                         and sale.

                         The project landscape includes areas from which the GoR resettled some 1,500 households in 2007,
                         as they were deemed to be highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This includes the relocation of 152
                         households from the Kinyenkanda area, which is now under forest regeneration as an extension of
                         the Gishwati core forest area.A report on this resettlement indicates that due to the small size of land
                         parcels in the resettlement sites the resettled households face a lack of economic opportunities to
                         meet their livelihoods, and also a sense of having lost their original homes. The Kinyenkanda
                         households will be eligible for livelihoods support through the project, given that they are amongst
                         the more vulnerable persons within the broader project area, and their traditional relationship with
                         the Gishwati forest.

                           Overall, the project is expected to provide significant environmental and social benefits, both on-
                           site and downstream. Nevertheless some of its activities may have (i) localized and/or temporary
                           small adverse environmental impacts; and/or (ii) involve some limited land acquisition, and/or
                           restrict access to some natural resources. For these reasons, the proposed project is classified as
                           Category B. No significant adverse environmental and social impacts that are sensitive, diverse,
                           unprecedented or irreversible are anticipated.

                           The main project activities are intended to improve the environment by restoring natural forests,
                           improving soil retention, watershed function and biodiversity in productive landscapes through
                           sustainable land management techniques focused on the use of agroforestry and silvo pastoralism,
                           and emphasizing the use of native species were possible. The project is anticipated to result in
                           increased empowerment of the people living in the Gishwati-Mukura landscape and the
                           improvement of their livelihoods, through systematic adoption of participatory natural resources
                           and environmental management approaches, and also implementation of livelihood improvement
                           activities. Therefore, the project’s planned social development outcomes of greater empowerment
                           and social inclusion are likely to be achieved. This is because priority watershed management
                           investments will be done in a participatory, transparent, and accountable manner. This implies
                           active participation in decision-making by key actors, including civil society and affected
                           communities. Similarly, gender and other concerns of most vulnerable groups, who are targeted
                           for improved watershed management, shall be addressed through the same participatory processes.

                           Nevertheless, LAFREC activities could potentially create negative environmental and social
                           impacts during the course of implementation if not appropriately managed. The possible negative
                           impacts include:
                           � Land rehabilitation works (e.g. terraces, anti-erosive ditches) could result in land-taking, loss of

                           natural habitats or changes in drainage if not well-planned.
                           � Changes in agricultural (including agroforestry) activities related to sustainable land
                           management could result in changes in the use of agrichemicals and/or introduction of invasive
                           species.
                           � The introduction of new livelihood activities could involve a range of negative impacts (e.g.
                           increasing pressure on natural resources, increasing use of agrichemicals) if not appropriately
                           screened and planned.
                           � Minor construction activities (e.g. guard posts or visitor center infrastructure for the Gishwati-
                           Mukura National Park, small-scale community structures such as storage or agri-processing
                           facilities related to livelihoods activities) could involve land-taking, loss of small areas of natural
                           habitats or local pollution if not appropriately planned and managed.
                           � Upgrading of the Gishwati and Mukura Forest Reserves to a National Park may involve stricter
                           enforcement of conservation regulations and therefore restriction of access to natural resources,
                           and some small incidences of land-taking from re-delineation and rehabilitation of the buffer zone.

                           Restoring a mixed use landscape involving agricultural, agroforestry, grazing, production forest
                           and protection forest elements can potentially result in land taking and/or restriction to forest
                           reserves. With the activities mentioned above under Component 1, there is a small chance of
                           physical resettlement and/or land acquisition related to project interventions as the buffer zones


                                                                      Page 10 of 15

                          Overall, the project is expected to provide significant environmental and social benefits, both
                          onsite and downstream. Nevertheless, some of its activities may have (i) localized and/or
                          temporary small adverse environmental impacts on human populations or environmentally
                          important areas - including wetlands, forests, grasslands, and other natural habitats; and/or (ii)
                          involve some limited land acquisition, and/or restrict access to some natural resources. As the
                          project is not likely to have significant adverse environmental and social impacts that are sensitive,
                          diverse, or unprecedented, the proposed project is classified as Category B.

                           Nonetheless, new or increased restrictions of access to natural resources in the reserves, such as
                           changes in zoning between buffer and core zone, or introduction of a new, buffer zone with
                           increased restrictions from the experimental zone, may be needed to ensure sustainability of the
                           reserves. In some cases, changes in zoning may adversely impact livelihoods. Increased
                           restriction of access cannot be ruled out until the management plans for LAFREC are developed
                           during implementation since core zones and buffer zones are yet to be properly and physically
                           demarcated. However, the nature of any proposed restrictions, as well as the type of measures
                           necessary to mitigate adverse impacts of those restrictions, would be determined in consultation
                           with the project-affected groups.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities

                           The project is instituting cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms for landscape planning that
                           should help to moderate future development or investment plans by ensuring that environmental
                           and social objectives are taken on board. The project is not expected to induce activities with
                           negative impacts, although in the longer run, successful landscape management may induce
                           tourism development that could have adverse impacts if not well managed. Longer term
                           safeguarding and appropriate management of the landscape is expected to be addressed through

                           development of an application (and related management plans) to UNESCO for the designation of
                           the landscape as a Biosphere Reserve.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           NGOs previously involved with conservation efforts in Gishwati had made plans to establish a
                           contiguous forest corridor between Gishwati and Mukura. However, that was considered
                           unfeasible due to the high competition for land uses in the corridor area. Instead, the project will
                           take a participatory approach to increasing the representation of natural forest elements through
                           micro-catchment rehabilitation activities that benefit both people and the environment.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The main project activities have substantive similarities with the watershed management activities
                           in the on–going Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP II). The project
                           therefore adopted the ESMF (with some revisions reflected the reduced scope of activities under
                           LAFREC in comparison to LVMEP, which includes sanitation infrastructure investments) and the
                           IPMP (which was already national in scope) developed under LVEMP. The ESMF proposes
                           mitigation measures and their monitoring plans an integral part of the project design and costs.
                           This includes the institutional responsibilities for the screening of activities and assigning an
                           environmental category, undertaking Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) in the

                         Mitigation measures under the Natural Habitats and Forests policies are covered under each
                         ESMF. The project will not finance interventions which destroy natural habitats or forests. Instead,

                         it will support those which reverse degraded natural habitats, such as overexploited wetlands.

                         The IPMP has: (a) identified the key pests of major crops and livestock (b) assessed the impact of
                         the current pest control methods in the; (c) analyzed the institutional, policy and legal frameworks
                         for pest control and management; (d) developed an IPM strategy and its monitoring framework;
                         and (e) identified key researchable areas in pest management. The IPMP will serve as a guidance/
                         reference document for the preparation of specific livelihood or land management interventions in
                         a manner consistent with good IPM practice.

                         Owing to the nature of the project, the exact location, nature and magnitude of all the interventions
                         to be financed by the project cannot yet be determined until full feasibility is undertaken and the
                         buffer zones are mapped and demarcated. The Resettlement Policy Framework & Process
                         Framework has been developed in line with (OP 4.12).

                         RPF provides guidelines on how the project activities will avoid, manage or mitigate potential
                         risks and the process by which Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared and implemented if the
                         occasion arises during the project implementation period. The RPF presents the objectives,
                         principles, organizational arrangements and funding mechanisms for any displacement and
                         resettlement that may be necessary during implementation of LAFREC as per the applicable
                         Rwanda laws and regulations and the World Bank safeguard Policy on Involuntary Resettlement
                         (OP 4.12). The RPF provides the basis for preparing Resettlement Action Plans for project
                         activities once their location and scope are known. Resettlement plans for specific activities
                         causing displacement due to LAFREC will be prepared using this RPF and submitted to the World
                         Bank for approval.

                         The Process Framework (PF) establishes the process for how to involve potentially affected

                         communities in planning and implementation of the project while at the same time it identifies
                         how affected communities will be assisted in restoring their livelihood, as a consequence of lost
                         access to traditional natural resources. The Process Framework outlines the criteria and procedures
                         as described in OP 4.12, which will be followed as part of the Project, in cases where project-
                         induced involuntary restriction of access to forest reserve resources results in adverse livelihood
                         impacts, to ensure that eligible, affected persons are assisted in their efforts to restore or improve
                         their livelihoods in a manner which maintains the environmental sustainability of the nature
                         reserve in question. More specifically, it describes: a) the criteria for eligibility of affected persons
                         will be determined; b) measures to assist the affected people in their efforts to improve or restore,
                         in real terms, to pre-displacement levels, their livelihoods (e.g., as appropriate, alternative grazing
                         areas, cultivation of non-timber forest products, or investments in community infrastructure) while
                         maintaining the sustainability of the identified reserves and (c) potential conflicts involving
                         affected people will be resolved. It also provides a description of the arrangements for
                         implementing and monitoring the process.

                         The project will undertake field appraisal of the planned project interventions, and the Bank will
                         approve all RAPs prior to commencement of the subprojects. Compensation for physical
                         resettlement and loss of land will be funded from government budget. The grievance mechanism
                         has been documented in RPF and the project will utilize the existing systems and structures from
                         the lowest levels through local governments.

                           and management of the environment per the Organic Law on Environmental Protection,
                           Conservation and Management. Rwanda Environmental Management Authority (REMA) was
                           established through Article 65 of this law. REMA is charged with a responsibility of ensuring
                           compliance with laid down environmental impact assessment procedures in planning and
                           execution of development projects. This Project will be executed by REMA.

                           REMA has adequate in-house capacity to supervise, monitor, and guide the implementation of
                           safeguard policies amongst the other implementing sectors. Furthermore, it has experience of
                           applying the ESMF for LVEMP, upon which that for LAFREC is based. Supervision of safeguard
                           work at district level will be carried out by district environment officers, supported by project field
                           staff. The project envisages strengthening the project implementing entities by providing training
                           for its operation officers mainly at district and community levels to ensure systematic
                           implementation and monitoring of environmental and social issues.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The safeguard documents were prepared in consultation with representatives from national and
                           local stakeholders, such as REMA, MINIRENA, the target districts, sector and cell staff, and local
                           communities. All safeguard documents were cleared by REMA and the Bank. They were then
                           disclosed at the World Bank’s Infoshop and in-country on June 5, 2014.

                           All safeguards documents (Social Assessment, Resettlement Policy Framework and Process
                           Framework) were prepared through participatory approaches. Interactive discussions were held
                           with relevant stakeholders and implementing partners including Interested and Affected Parties
                           who were identified during the stakeholder analysis process. These discussions are the basis for
