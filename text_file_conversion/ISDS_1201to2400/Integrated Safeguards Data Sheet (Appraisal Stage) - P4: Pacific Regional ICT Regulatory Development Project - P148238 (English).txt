                           The development objective of the Project is to strengthen the capacity of Pacific ICT Regulatory
                           institutions and enhance regional collaboration on regulatory issues.

                           The primary beneficiaries of the Project are the Pacific island regulatory institutions. Indirect
                           beneficiaries will include consumers, businesses (including telecommunications operators),

                                                                         Page 1 of 5

                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The proposed Project is an IDA regional grant of $4.5 million to the University of the South Pacific
                         (USP). USP is the region’s premier academic institution, established in 1968. During Project
                         identification, the World Bank confirmed that USP is a regional organization that meets the
                         eligibility requirements to receive IDA grants and that funds could be provided directly to USP. The
                         Project will finance: (a) knowledge dissemination and cooperation among regulators, including
                         training and capacity-building activities, collecting, analyzing and improving access to industry
                         statistics and data; and (b) regional advisory services which will be used to finance the procurement
                         of specialists who will advise regulators on issues with regional or multi-country spillover benefits—
                         issues on which two or more regulators in the region need and request advice.

                         Component 1: Regional ICT Capacity Building and Knowledge Management ($2.25 million) will
                         focus on enhancing knowledge sharing and cooperation among regulators, taking account of their
                         different levels of institutional maturity. It will support region-wide dissemination of knowledge
                         products on priority ICT topics, regulatory best practices, improve access to quality sector data and
                         provide a central mechanism (interactive portal/website) for sharing up to date knowledge and
                         experience throughout the region. This will also be done in collaboration with other partners, where
                         appropriate, including the International Telecommunications Union, regulatory institutions outside
                         the region (e.g. in Australia, New Zealand, East Asia, Caribbean). Outputs will include "best
                         practice" models such as: model regulations, policies, discussion papers, collections of industry
                         statistics and data on access and service level penetration, international connectivity, investment
                         levels, industry revenues, standard license terms, spectrum management, broadband service levels,
                         access prices, retail prices, quality of service (QoS), macroeconomic impacts of ICT development,
                         and gender-specific ICT access and issues. This will help to form the basis of a region-wide ICT
                         monitoring and evaluation framework. Component 1 will finance the following inputs: (a) a full-time
                         Project Director (consultant) responsible for: (i) liaison with regulator clients, external partners, USP

                         management, and the Steering Committee, (ii) development and implementation of the Project’s
                         work program and quality assurance—in consultation with the Steering Committee, and (iii)
                         management of the regional advisory services program under Component 2; (b) a full-time research
                         assistant (consultant); (c) consultants to provide advice to the Director, as needed, on specific issues
                         (e.g., economics, technical, legal, communications, and gender/social development specialists); (d)
                         website development and maintenance, including to design the advisory services application and
                         database which is needed for the delivery of component 2; (e) training and associated resources; and
                         (f) communications, outreach, and publications.

                         Component 2: Regional Advisory Services ($1.75 million) will provide financing for quick-response
                         advice delivered in the form of consultancies or specialized training to regulators on legal ,
                         economic, financial and technical issues in the ICT sector that have regional significance or offer a
                         regional learning experience for the immediate benefit of two or more regulators. The component
                         will support the provision of on-demand assistance where at lea st two regulators request assistance.
                         Based on the work plans of regional regulators and specific market demands and conditions the
                         scope is expected to include the following:

                         �       Regulatory human resource planning and skills development

                         Detailed Governance rules and administrative procedures will be developed by the Project Director,
                         in consultation with the Steering Committee, within six months from Project Effectiveness. The
                         mechanism for this assistance will be as follows: regulators seeking specialized advice will approach
                         the Project Director for support using an online application form. This supports more efficient
                         management and monitoring of requests and transparency of procedures. A key requirement is that
                         the same topic is also of interest to at least one other regulator in the region, and that at least two
                         regulators request formally support on this issue. The entire process will be managed online via the
                         Project website. Knowledge will be captured in an Advisory Services Database. The component will
                         finance: (a) specialist consultant services to deliver advisory services; and (b) training services. It is
                         envisaged that a co-financing contribution (totaling at least 20 percent of the total cost) will be
                         required from the requesting regulators for each assistance package delivered to increase the leverage
                         of the component, improve allocative efficiency and promote ownership of issues by regulators
                         accessing support. No single regulator may contribute more than 15 percent of the total cost of an
                         assignment.

                         Component 3: Project Administration ($0.5 million). This component will finance Project
                         administration, including financial management and procurement support, audit, and incremental
                         operating costs.
