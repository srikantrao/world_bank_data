2. Project Objectives:

The development objective is to support employment generation and increase household incomes
for targeted poor and vulnerable communities in the Kakheti and Imereti regions by helping them
to (i) start/grow micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism sector and (ii)
implement small works in the vicinity of cultural heritage sites.

3. Project Description:

The proposed grant project will have the following five components:

Component 1: Market Assessment and Gender assessment (US$ 82,680). This component
will be carried out with the objective of better understanding MSMEs and vulnerable groups’
role, including women, in the local economy. Baseline indicators will be drawn from these
analyses. This output will closely inform the design of components 2 and 3. Those assessments
are crucial to the proper design of the Technical Assistance and Capacity Building activities.
Component 2: Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (US$ 220,800). This will include
management and other skills development, advisory services, training on access to markets
(particularly tourism), and product development. The goal is to address the constraints of poor
and vulnerable groups in accessing networks and know-how to tap into the tourism sector
opportunities. Gender-sensitive training will be provided for women among the targeted
beneficiaries.

Component 3: Support to MSMEs (US$ 1,080,000). This component will fund (a) matching
grants to eligible beneficiaries to start or expand their businesses/enterprises. The matching grant
(average amount of US$2,000) will support the production of goods and services related to
cultural heritage for micro-entrepreneurs currently not targeted by the two RDP projects. This
may include agro-processed foods, guiding services, handicrafts, performing arts, and other
cultural industries. The grant will cover activities such as equipment, services, product
promotion, and the acquisition of technical and market information; (b) Support will be provided
to MSMEs to enhance their business development capacity, and build credit with local financial
institutions. This will include consultations, meetings, and workshops that will link entrepreneurs
with local business associations and financial institutions.

Component 4: Community Mobilization for Implementation of Small Works at Targeted
Cultural Heritage Sites (US$ 741,520). The project will support community mobilization and
small works at targeted cultural heritage sites. The grant facility will fund community driven
initiatives that engage neighborhood groups in protecting their own heritage and enhancing
tourist visitation through the improvement of the areas along the access routes and in the vicinity
of the sites, such as cleaning the area, improving access to sites, providing signage and
interpretation, etc. under the stewardship of the NCHPA. Those activities will be small scale
initiatives not currently financed under RDP and RDP II. The grantees will be required to
contribute up to 20% of project costs in cash or in kind. The size of the grant supporting the
community driven initiatives shall not exceed USD 60,000.

Component 5: Participatory Monitoring and Impact Evaluation and Project Management
and Administration (US$ 375,000). This component will support technical support and
training for Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E), knowledge dissemination, project management
and administration.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The Project will be implemented in various locations within Kakheti and Imereti regions of
Georgia, around the sites identified by RDP and RDP II1. These locations include Telavi,
Kvareli, and Tusheti and areas around improved cultural heritage sites in Kakheti, as well as
Tskaltubo, Vani, and areas around improved cultural heritage sites in Imereti.

5. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team:



1
 Since 2012, two Regional Development Projects (P126033 & P130421) have been under implementation in the
Kakheti and Imereti regions. Those projects aim to improve large scale infrastructure services and institutional
capacity to support the development of regional economies based on tourism and cultural heritage circuits

      Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.1) is triggered because the activities /interventions
       proposed include physical works that may have certain impacts on natural environment,
       human health, and safety. Environmental Management Frameworks (EMFs) developed
       and approved for the implementation of RDP and RDP II were used to produce an
       Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for purposes of JSDF grant-
       financed project;
      Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) is triggered because interventions are expected
       in the vicinity of historic and cultural monuments. EMSF includes provisions for the
       protection of the Physical Cultural Resources.
                                                 is triggered in light of possible temporary
       impacts of minor civil works associated to MSME development and small community
       grants for the beautification of the sites. Because the location and footprint of these
       investments will not be known until implementation, the Resettlement Policy Framework
       (RPF) prepared for RDP and RDP II was adapted for the purposes of JSDF-financed
       project and will be used for its implementation.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Impact on the environment. The project will issue small grants to MSMEs and communities
which will be used to improve the accessibility and hospitality of the sites supported by RDP and
RDP II. The JSDF investments are not expected to have significant impact on the environment,
however they will support physical works and hence OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment is
triggered and the project is classified as environmental Category B. The JSDF-financed
enterprise development activities and community-driven initiatives will follow safeguard
procedures outlined in the ESMF. When necessary, site-specific Environmental Management
Plans (EMPs) will be prepared for individual investments, disclosed, and discussed with the
stakeholders prior to commencement of works at each site.
                                                                                          EMSF
includes provisions for the protection of the Physical Cultural Resources.



                    due to particular land being used either temporarily or permanently for
project purposes or due to the temporary or permanent loss of access to land-based resources.




2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

The project is not expected to have any long-term impacts on the natural environment, while the
social impacts will be positive.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

EMFs are prepared and are being used by MDF for RDP and RDP II. These EMFs were used to
develop the ESMF for the purposes of implementing JSDF grant-financed activities. ESMF
carries detained guidance on the environmental and social screening of sub-projects as well as on
the developing of site-specific EMPs and tracking of their implementation.

RPF was prepared and is being used by MDF for RDP and RDP II. It was updated and will be
applied to the JSDF-financed project. Whenever required, RAPs will be produced and
implemented for the needs of the specific community and business initiatives.

A national NGO called Elkana will be an implementing agency for the JSDF-financed project
and, among other duties, will carry responsibility for applying the Bank’s safeguard policies to
the project-supported activities. Elkana will put in place, and will maintain throughout project
implementation, arrangements for safeguards supervision and reporting satisfactory to the Bank.
This would include special provisions for the technical supervision of works in proximity to the
sensitive natural and cultural receptors. Elkana has an extensive experience in implementing
projects aimed at improving rural livelihoods of Georgian farmers and fostering environmentally
sustainable farming practices. Also, Elkana has supported rural guesthouses in Georgia by
helping to upgrade their infrastructure and services. While administering those projects mostly
supported by donor institutions, Elkana had to adhere to the good international environmental
and social protection standards. Implemented projects had positive evaluation on donor’s behalf.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key stakeholders include (but are not necessarily limited to): beneficiaries of JSDF activities,
community members and small businesses, local government members and employees, and
NGOs/CBOs actively involved in working with the poor and the conservation of cultural
heritage in the project area.

The ESMF, drafted for the JSDF-financed project based on the EMFs of RDP and RDP II, was
disclosed on Elkana’s web page and discussed with stakeholders in the two consultation
meetings held on June 17th and 19th in the regions of Keheti and Imereti which are targeted for
the project interventions. Finalized ESMF will be re-disclosed on Elkana’s web page and
published through the Bank’s InfoShop. When necessary according to ESMF, site-specific EMPs
will be prepared for individual investments under JSDF-financed project, shared with the Bank,
disclosed, and discussed with the local communities prior to commencement of works at each
site.

The RPF, prepared for the JSDF-financed project following the sample RPF used for the ongoing
RDP and RDP II, was disclosed through Elkana’s web page and discussed in stakeholder
consultation meetings together with ESMF. Once finalized, the RPF will be re-disclosed through
Elkana’s web page and through the InfoShop. When necessary according to RPF, site-specific
RAPs will be prepared for community and private sub-projects JSDF-financed project, shared
with the Bank, disclosed, and discussed with the local communities prior to commencement of
works at each site.
