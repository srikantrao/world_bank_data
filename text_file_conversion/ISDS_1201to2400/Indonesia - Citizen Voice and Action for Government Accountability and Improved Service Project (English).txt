2. Project Objectives:

The Project Development Objective (PDO) of this grant is to improve governance and public
service delivery by enhancing transparency and accountability in maternal, newborn and child
health (MNCH) programs in selected disadvantaged areas oflndonesia.

3. Project Description:

The proposed intervention targets maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) systems in line
with Wahana Visi's strength in long-term health and education programming through
community awareness and community-driven development solutions. Wahana Visi is currently
collecting community feedback on health service facilities at sub Districts, covering a total
population of 478,176 people. This intervention covers 8 provinces, 43 districts, 150 sub-districts
and over 400 villages
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The targeted population to be supported by funding through the GPSA is 52,011 people across
36 villages in 11 sub-districts of the 3 Districts in Nusa Tenggara Timur province: Kupang,
Timor Tengah Utara, and Sikka.

There are already 9 sub-districts identified, they are: Takari and Fatuleu in Kupang District;
Miomaffo Tengah, Bikomi Selatan, Insana Barat in TTU District; Nelle, Koting, Kangae and
Alok Barat in SIKKA District. There will be two additional sub-districts selected during
implementation, in a discussion with the NTT local government. As the intervention targets the
facilities, direct beneficiaries are all users of the targeted Village Health Posts (Posyandu),
Community Health Centers (Puskesmas) and District hospitals.

For higher level District, Provincial and National lobbying the project will leverage the
experience of existing practitioners and community data across 3 provinces (NTT, Central
Sulawesi and Jakarta) covering 44 sub districts, 257 villages, and 478,176 people, currently
funded by World Vision Canada and European Union.

As these activities only involving administrative works and training or workshop, no salient
physical characteristics from these locations are relevant to the safeguard analysis.
