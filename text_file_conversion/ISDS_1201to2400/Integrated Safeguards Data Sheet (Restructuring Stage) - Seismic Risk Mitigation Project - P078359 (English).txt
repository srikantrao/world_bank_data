                         Component C: Enforcement of Building Code
                         The component supports innovative measures on a pilot basis for monitoring and improvement of
                         building codes and lan use plans enforcement through data collection on land use and building
                         inventory; data digitization and computer equipment to help district municipalities make the process
                         of issuing building permits more efficient and transparent and training/awareness raising for
                         municipal authorities and local communities on seismic risks and the need to take this into account in
                         land use planning and construction; training of engineers in new retro-fitting regulations, etc.

                           This Restructuring is suggesting the following changes to the Project: (i) twelve months extension of
                           the loan closing date until August 31, 2015, and (ii) change of the Project Implementing Agency
                           from recently abolished Istanbul Special Provincial Administration (ISPA) to the Istanbul
                           Governorâ€™s Office. Neither of these changes have impact on environmental and/or social safeguards
                           of the project.
                            4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project would be implemented within the Istanbul region. Since the exact locations of the
                           buildings to be retrofitted/reconstructed are not known by the appraisal of the project, an
                           environmental management plan (EMP) framework document has been prepared and disclosed
                           before Appraisal. Sub-project specific EMPs have been prepared for the sub-projects.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues



                                                                        Page 3 of 6
                         1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                           Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                             The project supports seismic retrofitting and few reconstruction works.Those interventions have

                           environmental impacts which are minor to moderate in scale, and which are very localized in their
                           extent. Impacts can be readily defined, mitigated and monitored. Potential physical impacts are:
                           emissions of particulate matter/dust to the air, sediment to sewerage systems, noise pollution,
                           proper disposal of demolition debris or wastes present in the buildings, etc. These are assessed in
                           details in the environmental management plan framework document which has been prepared and
                           disclosed in 2005. The framework document has been revised in 2010 to reflect the revised
                           national legislation on environment, and since then the framework document is implemented by
                           the PIU successfully. For each sub-project the PIU asks the consultant of the retrofitting/
                           reconstruction company to prepare project specific EMPs (by using the EMP checklists in the
                           framework document). These sub-project EMPs are made a part of the contractor contracts and the
                           implementation is monitored by the PIU and by Bank's supervision missions.

                           The project will not entail land acquisition or resettlement, as the retrofitting or reconstruction will
                           take place on existing sites and residential buildings are not in the scope of the project.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                             None are anticipated.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                             Not applicable.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             The Borrower has prepared an EMF for the proposed construction works that provides
                           environmental guidelines and outlines appropriate mitigation and monitoring measures during the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           proposed activities. The IPCU is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the Banks
                           safeguards policies and resulting environmental management and mitigation measures. IPCU
                           fulfills its responsibility related to environmental management of the project activities. IPCU also
                           has a dedicated staff for monitoring environmental compliance of the sub-projects. IPCU's staff
                           has participated in Bank's safeguard policies trainings. training events organized by the Bank.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             Consultations with key stakeholders government officials, municipality representatives, etc.,
                           were carried out during EMF preparation. Throughout the project, an independent consultancy
                           firm is hired for holding regular consultations with the affected public (parents of the kids going to
                           the schools which will be retrofitted, etc.). In order to minimize the possible disturbance for the
                           beneficiaries (facility users), the Borrower carefully prepares the work program and retrofits
                           schools during holidays to the extent possible, or identify temporary schools and hospitals to be
                           used during retrofitting works. The Borrower also informs all relevant parties beforehand on the
                           works to be carried out. This includes awareness raising activities for seismic mitigation.
                           Innovative actions have been taken to convey the message to the school children such as theatre
