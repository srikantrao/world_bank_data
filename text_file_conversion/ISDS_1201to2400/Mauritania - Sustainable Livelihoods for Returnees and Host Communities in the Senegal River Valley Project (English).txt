2. Project Development Objectives
   The overall PDO is to improve access to livelihood support for returnees and host communities as well
   as to enhance conflict prevention and risk management mechanisms in Brakna and Trarza in the Senegal
   River Valley area.

3. Project Description
   Component 1: Improved livelihood opportunities (US$2,370,000).
   This component with three sub-components aims to generate a more comprehensive and diversified set
   of rural income generating opportunities through selective interventions in key aspects of the value chain
   with an emphasis on women and youth.

    1.1 Reducing food insecurity through the provision of production inputs for 3,830 households
    (US$1,170,000):
    This sub-component entails:
    (a) Provision of small grants for livestock re-stocking, pest control, seeds (wheat, maize, millet, niébé,
    and market vegetable gardening seeds) and fertilizers. In addition to these inputs, light agricultural
    equipment such as hoes, watering cans, and rakes will be introduced in the agricultural input stores and


                                                         1
      will be sold at reasonable prices to producers. The pilot will collaborate with national research centers to
      support improved seeds’ production and cultivation of vegetables and fruit trees. In terms of the
      livestock re-stocking, the pilot will apply a traditional social mechanism locally known as habbanaye.
      (b) Facilitation of access to veterinary services and the establishment of livestock feeding centers.
      (c) Financing of small-scale community-based works to facilitate the utilization of solar energy for
      decentralized small-scale electrification, water/irrigation and cooking. This activity will be based on the
      Global Rural Electrification Program (PERG) principles and lessons learned from the work of NGO
      partners in the region.
      (d) A feasibility study on the sustainable use of bio-gas and commercial/mineral gas for cooking under
      market conditions.
      (e) Support of micro-irrigation initiatives that employ alternative sources of energy such as solar or wind
      to enhance the production of cash and traditional crops.

      1.2 Support to complementary vocational training and income-generating activities for women and
      youth for 1,500 households (US$530,000):
      This sub-component entails the provision of:
      (a) market gardening activities, enterprise and marketing, farm and non-farm activities focused on food
      processing methodologies and techniques as a means to promote agribusiness and small-scale markets;
      (b) small-scale start-up inputs; and
      (c) support for the establishment of facilities for access to funding including micro-credit mechanisms
      and community level ‘Savings for Change’ groups as well as the complementary capacity building to
      communities based on an assessment of options for communities’ access to funding.
      The pilot aims to create a minimum of one savings group per village with one year of weekly training
      support provided by existing local partner organizations. The pilot will, therefore, re-enforce and work
      with existing micro-finance and village savings mechanisms as well as provide training to village
      savings groups to increase their access to existing credit.

      1.3 Strengthening community structures in 22 communities including conflict and risk management
      (US$670,000):
      This sub- component will enhance capacities through the provision of sub-grants to 22 community based
      organizations/associations. Community Based Organizations (CBOs), in conjunction with communities,
      will develop projects to be financed with the grants. To this effect, the pilot will also provide CBOs with
      training on the setting up and management of associations, access to credit and commercialization, and
      complementary functional literacy and numeracy education when necessary. The organization of
      associations will take into account successful experiences in the country such as the establishment of
      community development associations (ADC) under the Rural Community Development Program
      (PDRC) (Government/World Bank). The pilot will also strengthen local communities’ ability to prevent
      and manage conflict by improving communication channels between stakeholders and intergroup
      relations through conflict resolution and training sessions to help stakeholders better understand rule of
      law and their participation in the development process of their communities. Under this sub-component,
      therefore, the pilot will develop local systems for the prevention and management of conflict as well as
      reduce social tension between the various ethnic groups.

      Component 2: Project Management and Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation1 (US$480,000).
      This component supports project management and administration, participatory project monitoring and
      evaluation, and the dissemination of results and lessons learned.

    The cost of this component would be shared with the SPF funds for the complementary project

                                                           2
    2.1 Project Management and Administration (US$240,000).
    This sub-component supports the establishment of a Project Support Unit (PSU) including a small
    management and technical team that will provide overall project coordination and oversight in
    collaboration with the Agence Nationale Tadamoun de Lutte contre les Séquelles de l'Esclavage, de
    l'Insertion et de Lutte contre la Pauvreté (AGENCE TADAMOUN) and existing institutional structures
    in order to enhance and mainstream project activities. Local and international NGO partners will be
    involved in the implementation of project activities to enhance ownership, sense of belonging and
    control of the target area’s development. A Steering Committee comprised of AGENCE TADAMOUN,
    UNHCR, local authorities, and a civil society representative will be established. The Steering
    Committee’s role is to ensure coordination of interventions, involvement of all key stakeholders
    (AGENCE TADAMOUN, relevant government institutions, etc.), and the pilot project’s ownership.

    2.2 Participatory Project Monitoring and Evaluation (US$240,000).
    This sub-component supports the establishment of a participatory community-based project monitoring
    and evaluation (M&E) system involving civil society and vulnerable groups in the performance
    assessment of grants in meeting their objectives and adhering to targeting and funding criteria. The M&E
    system will be based on objectively verifiable indicators and utilize Geographic Information Systems
    (GIS). M&E will be supported by the establishment of a baseline and AGENCE TADAMOUN’s data
    base. The proposed participatory M&E system will take into account the literacy and language levels of
    the beneficiary groups and is designed to track beneficiary and population-based data at various stages of
    implementation. The project will finance an impact evaluation which will include a comparison of
    villages that benefitted from pilot project interventions with villages that did not. The sub-component
    includes the dissemination of results and lessons learned from this pilot for a possible scale-up of
    interventions in other target areas.

4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known).
   The project will be implemented in 17 communities in Brakna including nine returnee communities
   (Donaye, Féthie M’Boyo, Tessem 1, Dar Salam Wodabé, Houdallaye, Woura Amadou Hawa Dia,
   Sénokouna, Bour and Goural) and eight host/neighboring communities (Donaye Village, Diattar, Tessem
   Village, Dar Salam Oulad Seydi, Carrefour, Goural village, Taiba and Leleiwa). Five returnee
   communities close to Ross town will be targeted in Trarza (Rosso Lycée, Medina Salam, Keur Madické,
   Tekess Coumba and PK6). The total target population including returnee and host/neighboring
   communities is approximately 15,700 people or 3,830 households with the returnee population
   representing 63% of the total target population. As there are no salient physical characteristics relevant
   to the application of safeguard policies in the project intervention area, the project is classified as
   category B.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
   describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
   The project is classified as environmental and social category B type due specifically to activities
   supported under Component 1, more precisely under Sub-component 1.1, which are site specific,
   relatively small in size, likely to induce minor negative effects and easily manageable. Most potential
   risks and impact arise from pest control activities in agriculture (small irrigation) and use of fertilizer,
   and specific income-generating activities which either require acquisition of land and/or use of natural
   resources (e.g. forestry products) or produce nuisances (e.g. waste). It is possible that inadequate
   selection and/or design of livelihood support activities could affect socio-economic and environmental
   sustainability. Likewise, insufficient support to community organizations and conflict mediation could
   jeopardize the implementation process/agenda. The impacts which could occur and that need to be
   prevented are: (i) acute/accidental intoxication due to inappropriate handling of chemical products
   (pesticide, fertilizer); (ii) degradation of natural vegetation; (iii) social conflicts in case of
   miscommunication and lack of participation of primary beneficiaries; and (iv) land and property
   right/security conflicts (i.e. acquisition of conflicting or unsuitable lands).

    Although land expropriation and restriction of access to natural resources are not expected during
    implementation, the fragility of the context requires good social and environmental safeguards
    mechanisms to be put in place throughout the lifecycle of the project.

    In light of the foreseen activities described in Component 1, the following three safeguard policies are
    triggered: OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.09 (Pest Management), and OP/BP 4.12
    (Involuntary Resettlement). No significant and irreversible impact is foreseen neither at this stage of
    project preparation nor during its implementation.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
   project area.
   Not applicable.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
   impacts.
   Not applicable.



                                                      4
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
   assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
   In compliance with the safeguards requirements, three existing safeguards documents of a project
   comprising similar activities (Additional Financing of PDIAIM-II) are being updated by the borrower:
   (i) the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (ii) the Pest and Pesticide
   Management Plan (PMP); and (iii) the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Once approved by both
   the Government and the World Bank, these three updated instruments will be re-disclosed
   simultaneously in-country (in a language understandable and at locations easily accessible by
   stakeholders) and at the InfoShop prior to appraisal. All parties involved will be made aware of the
   mitigating requirements which will be monitored and evaluated regularly.

    The preliminary assessment has enabled the identification of appropriate mechanisms for sustainable
    livelihood improvement interventions. During project preparation, the Government has undertaken
    extensive public participatory consultations on the project areas. Potential beneficiary communities
    including women, youth, the poor and most vulnerable groups have been fully engaged in all aspects of
    design. Beneficiary communities will continue to be involved and consulted throughout the development
    and implementation process of this project. Consultations with beneficiary communities as well as other
    stakeholders during project preparation provided the basis for the design of a participatory grievance
    redress mechanism that builds upon existing traditions.

    The Mauritanian regulatory framework on environmental and social assessment is still weak and the
    project implementing agency (AGENCE TADAMOUN) has no internal capacity for the implementation
    of the safeguards instruments under preparation. Provision has been made by the project to enhance the
    technical capacity of AGENCE TADAMOUN and ancillary agencies to ensure appropriate
    implementation and follow up of the social and environmental mitigation measures outlined in the
    ESMF, PMP and RPF.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
   safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
   The key stakeholders in the implementation of this project are: (i) the Project Support Unit (PSU)
   including a small management and technical team that will provide overall project coordination and
   oversight in collaboration with AGENCE TADAMOUN and existing institutional structures to enhance
   and mainstream project activities; (ii) the beneficiary communities including host and returnees
   communities; and (iii) civil society organizations to be involved in the activities’ implementation. These
   stakeholders will be consulted and their views fully taken into consideration in project design and
   implementation.
