                         pre-existing medical facilities, but the particular health centers are yet to be determined. In addition,
                         selected villages in the two provinces will benefit from small scale economic empowerment support.
                         The physical environment of the target provinces is characterized by forests savanna, and highlands/
                         mountains and hills (North and South Kivu, landslides are frequent). Accessibility of areas off the
                         main roads is a constant challenge. The provinces (North Kivu 59,483 km2, South Kivu 65,070 km2)
                         cover an area of about 124.000 km2; that is about the size of Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands
                         together.

                         The presence of indigenous people (Batwa) in North and South Kivu, was identified and confirmed
                         during project preparation. The Batwa constitute a vulnerable and marginalized group in the project
                         area. The risk of social exclusion of Batwa in the context of the project cannot be ignored, to ensure

                         established are currently well managed, especially in terms of medical waste generation, which is
                         treated in modern incinerators, which are installed in about 90 percent of the 42 current district

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The project is not expected to have large scale, significant, or irreversible environmental or social
                              impacts. Project activities are focused on delivery of an integrated package of short and medium
                              term assistance to survivors of SGBV at both the community and health facility level, as well as
                              providing high impact maternal and reproductive health services or vulnerable and poor women
                              (in Burundi and DRC). To ensure survivors of SGBV will be received in an adequate environment,

                              the project will support setting up in existing health centers special rooms and upgrade existing
                              ones.

                              Two types of activities have a potential to cause three types of adverse impacts that will need to be
                              minimized, mitigated and managed: (i) The civil works related to the small construction or
                              rehabilitation activities may cause noise, vibrations and emissions from vehicles and machinery,
                              generate construction waste and involve potential risks regarding workplace and community health
                              and safety. (ii) During the operation of the health facilities the generation of additional quantities
                              of medical waste will increase slightly over the current baseline. (iii) In addition, in DRC small
                              in-kind grants will be provided to CBOs in support of their ongoing activities, which may entail
                              tools for agricultural activities. However, all three types of anticipated impacts will be temporary,
                              site specific and localized, and limited in scope.

                              The presence of indigenous people (Batwa) in North and South Kivu, was identified and
                              confirmed during project preparation. Batwa constitute a vulnerable and marginalized group in the
                              project area. The risk of social exclusion of Batwa in the context of the project cannot be ignored,
                              to ensure that Batwa will benefit from the project, a OP/BP 4.10 has been triggered, and an
                              Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) focusing on outreach and inclusion will be prepared.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:


                                                                         Page 6 of 9
                           The planned project activities are not anticipated to have long-term or indirect negative social or
                           environmental impacts. The project is expected to increase social cohesion at the family and
                           community level by specifically addressing issues of stigmatization and rejection of survivors of

                           SGBV, as well as activities to promote gender equality and change negative attitudes and norms
                           towards women and girls. In addition, the project support will provide targeted communities with
                           better access to basic health service. Project investments may strengthen sound environmental and
                           social practices in the construction sector and around health facilities. The country annexes
                           provide details for the environmental and social safeguards for each respective country.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Not applicable.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           At national level, the three countries have legislative and regulatory frameworks which are
                           conducive to good environmental management. In addition, they have signed a number of
                           international treaties and conventions to ensure good environmental governance. At sector level,
                           the three countries already implement Bank safeguards policies in various sectors. At project level,
                           the three beneficiary countries have agreed to prepare and implement the safeguards policies
                           triggered by the project. In accordance with World Bank policy guidelines, the borrowers will
                           prepare: (i) Environmental Management Plans (EMPs), and (ii) Medical Waste Management Plans
                           (MWMPs). In addition, for DRC an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) will be developed which will
                           focus on outreach and inclusion.

                          The EMPs will ensure that any potential negative safeguard impacts would be detected and
                          mitigated, including through: (i) a checklist of potential environmental and social impacts of small
                          rehabilitation and construction in existing health facilities, (ii) relevant potential environmental
                          and social mitigation measures, and (iii) a screening form to detect potential negative social and
Public Disclosure Copy




                          environmental impacts of small in-kind grants for CBOs in DRC. The MWMPs will cover (a)
                          anticipated waste composition and quantity; (b) existing medical waste management system,
                          including free capacity, deviations from, and gaps to BAT, (c) existing regulatory framework and
                          supervision / monitoring arrangements; (d) plan for using the existing medical waste management
                          system, including any measures to upgrade or remedy identified gaps and deviations; and (e)
                          additional arrangements for supervision and monitoring of medical waste management. In DRC,
                          where indigenous people (Batwa) have been identified in the project area, the borrower will
                          prepare IPP and put in place mitigation mechanisms to ensure indigenous people benefit from the
                          project.

                          As the project is prepared under the special policy exceptions and considerations described in
                          paragraph 11 of OP 10.00 (namely, an emergency operation), the preparation of the safeguards
                          instruments has been deferred from the project preparation phase into the implementation phase.
                          Thus the EMPs, the MWMPs and the IPP will not be prepared before appraisal as would be
                          mandated under normal procedures, but will be finalized before actual physical works / footprints
                          occur during the project implementation phase. To develop, explain and commit to the production
                          and implementation of the required safeguards instruments, the Task Team has, in consultation
                          with the Recipient, prepared an environmental and social action plan (ESAP) addressing
                          applicable environmental and social policies during project implementation for every country.
                          This action plan has been annexed to the PAD.

                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The preparation of the project has relied on consultations with government officials at relevant

                           levels, provincial officials, donorsâ€™ community, implementation partners, community and civil
                           society groups, and direct beneficiaries of the project. The implementation of the project will
                           likewise rest on various consultations. The preparation of safeguards instruments (ESMPs,
                           MWMPs, and IPP) will include additional consultations, at local, provincial and national level.
                           Upon review and approval by the government, the MWMPs, EMPs, and IPP will be disclosed by
                           governments in local languages to project-affected groups and NGOs in publicly accessible places
                           for consultations, and by the World Bank, in the Infoshop.
