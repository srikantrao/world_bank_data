B. Project Objectives
11.    The proposed Development Objective is to enhance the country's resilience to natural
hazards, including its response capacity to adverse natural events. This would be achieved through
investments in resilient infrastructure, improved hazard data collection and monitoring systems to
better inform future investment decisions, and institutional strengthening for disaster risk
management.
C. Project Description


﻿The project components are a result of a participatory planning workshop held in early 2014,
involving 12 government agencies represented by over 40 people. The operation will continue to be
designed in this participatory manner, through consultations with multiple government agencies,
local governments, and other partners. The proposed project will finance six components, which will
be implemented over a period of six years
Component 1: Understanding Risk (~USD $6.5M). In order to improve the ability of government
officials to use hazard and risk information for decision making and policy development, this
*       component will finance activities relating to the generation and application of disaster risk
management data in the form of analysis, trainings, and expert advice. The sub-components and
activities to be financed under this component relate to:
1.1    Risk Information and Instrumentation: Spatial Data Infrastructure platform to influence
decision making relating to risk reduction and the national emergency protocols, communications
and information network/platform to enhance disaster preparedness and response; strengthening the
seismic and hydrometeorlogical monitoring network and associated protocol and communication
mediums for early warning systems (in concert with the Improving Climate Data and Information
Management Project, P129633).
1.2    Coastal Management: Coastal vulnerability studies.
1.3    Seismic Risk Assessments: Seismic risk assessment of critical infrastructure in the Kingston
Metropolitan Area and accompanying micro-zonation studies.
Component 2: Risk Reduction (~USD $36.2M): To reduce Jamaica's physical vulnerability to
adverse natural events, this component will finance structural mitigation measures. The sub-
components and activities to be financed under this component relate to:
2.1    Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of National Infrastructure: The GoJ has furnished to the Bank
a preliminary list of investments relating to urban drainage channels, shoreline protection, and
O
Q)      critical bridges.
2.2    Rehabilitation/Reconstruction of Critical Public Facilities: In order to increase the proportion
of public buildings in the Kingston Metropolitan Area that comply with Jamaica's Building Code,
investments for physical upgrading would be made in critical public facilities including, but not
limited to, police stations, fire stations, schools, and health centers. This would equally in-line with
the completed Rapid Visual Screening of Buildings for Potential Seismic Hazard, and the seismic
risk assessments to be carried out under Component 1.3.
2.3     Landslide Reduction: Preliminary technical assessments procured by the World Bank have
identified vulnerable sections along Jamaica's primary road network which would require a mixture
of slope stabilization, reforestation, terracing and/or meshing.
2.4    Coastal Protection: Coastal management measures through control of beach erosion and
beach restoration in priority areas for the tourism sector, strengthening coastal defenses through sea
walls, coral reef rehabilitation, artificial reef installation, and sea grass planting.
Component 3: Governance Enhancement (~USD $1.5M). The objective of this component is to
strengthen Jamaica's government entities and associated planning instruments for disaster risk
management, including, inter alia, policies, Acts, Codes, strategies, and guidelines. The sub-
components and activities to be financed under this component relate to:


﻿3.1    Policy Development for Disaster Risk Management: Support to the GoJ on advancement of
priority policy development relating to, amongst others; Watershed Management Policy, Beach
Control Act, Setback Limits Policy, Disaster Risk Management Act, Water Resources/Flood Control
Act, No Build Zone Legislation.
O
U       3.2     Building Code Enforcement: Development of a framework for an oversight and enforcement
mechanism relating to the proposed Building Code Bill, and the development and delivery of related
training for its implementation.
3.3    Preventative Resettlement: Preparation of a standardized strategy for the GoJ relating to
preventative resettlement for areas of high-risk that cannot be mitigated.
3.4    Preparation of Beach Restoration Guidelines: Development of these guidelines will
complement sub-activities 1.2 and 2.4.
Component 4: Financial Protection against Disasters (~USD $0.8M): To promote Jamaica's use of
available tools relating to disaster risk financing and insurance, this component aims to support the
design and implementation of financial protection measures to manage the fiscal shocks of disasters.
The sub-components and activities to be financed under this component relate to:
4.1 Identification and Understanding of Fiscal Risk to Disasters: Quantification of implicit and
explicit contingent liabilities of the state to disaster risk by assessing the associated economic and
fiscal impacts and analysis of legal responsibilities.
4.2 Financial Management of Disaster Risk and Use of Financial Instruments: Analysis of
approaches and tools to manage direct and indirect contingent liabilities to disasters, and preparation
of a national disaster risk financing and insurance strategy; identification of short-term resource gaps
to finance post-disaster emergency and early recovery as well as longer-term resource gaps to finance
post-disaster reconstruction.
4.3    Catastrophe Risk Insurance for Public Assets: Assessment of public infrastructure and
buildings relating to existing insurance policies, and property catastrophe risk insurance markets in
the country.
4.4     Contingent Emergency Response: The proposed operation will include a contingent
component, which in the event of a disaster will enable the government to reallocate project funds to
disaster response. This provisional "zero component" is designed as a mechanism that would allow
rapid access to project funds for response and recovery purposes under streamlined procedures
during an emergency. Following an adverse natural event, the Government's declaration of disaster
in accordance with national law, and subject to the Bank's activation policy, the contingent
a       component would be implemented according to the rapid response procedures governed by OP/BP
8.00. Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies.
Component 5: Project Administration (~USD $5M). This component will finance costs associated
with program management, including project-related audits, monitoring, mid-term and end-of-project
evaluation, equipment and training to strengthen the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), as well as
individual consultants and operating costs. This component will also finance workshops to promote
public awareness raising relating to disaster risk management. The component will also finance the
core professional and technical staff for project management, including a Program Manager,
Supervision Engineers and specialists in the areas of disaster risk management, safeguards
compliance, finance, procurement and related project management areas. Core staff will be recruited
on time-bound basis.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The exact project location will be defined during preparation. However, criteria for selecting project


﻿intervention areas will be identified using existing hazard information, socio-economic data, and
government records. Such criteria may include: communities, ecological systems, or infrastructure
systems with the greatest vulnerability to landslides, hurricanes, storm surge, flooding, drought, and
earthquakes. Other criteria may focus specifically on the number of low income and vulnerable
O
U       people exposed to hazards, the projected economic losses caused by damage to public sector
infrastructure or natural environment. Another type of criteria may be the recurrent cost to
government of fixing inadequately constructed or maintained infrastructure, or the support of parish
and local government for a sub-project and ability to sustain and maintain project results.
The types and characteristics of project works under consideration relate, but are not limited to, the
repair and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, possible new facility construction, roadworks for
slope stabilization and drainage, possibly construction or improvement of sea defense or river
defense structures to protect human settlement, and possible support for community-based small
mitigation works (slope stabilization, community drainage systems, etc.). Typically these works
would entail relatively minor construction works with limited potential environmental impacts during
construction which can be mitigated with standard methods, while more complex works or those in
sensitive areas could involve feasibility studies and additional assessment works once specific details
are known. During project preparation, additional information will be gained to assist in defining a
preliminary portfolio of the types of works being considered and designing the screening and
mitigation measures.
Jamaica shares similar disaster vulnerabilities with other Caribbean countries. Recently prepared
DVRP programs in Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Dominica share many
aspects of their hazard profiles for flooding, landslides, storm surge and coastal erosion. Lessons
learned from these related projects will be used to identify the environmental management programs
and practices relevant to the region for inclusion into the safeguard analysis and project development
in the Jamaica DVRP.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The institution responsible for the implementation of the project is the Jamaica Social Investment
Fund (JSIF) which was established in 1996 to reduce poverty and help create an environment for
sustainable development. JSIF is currently executing the first Inner Cities Basic Services Project
financed by the World Bank and the Government of Jamaica. Since inception, the JSIF has
completed over 1,000 sub projects in vulnerable communities and delivered these to some 1.6 million
under served beneficiaries.
The capacity of JSIF in terms of managing involuntary resettlement, and other social management
issues (such as grievance redress and conflict resolution) was rated highly during the implementation
of the Inner Cities Basic Services for the Poor Project. JSIF successfully applied the measures
specified in the resettlement policy framework to the mitigation of a number of minor cases of land
acquisition. Otherwise, JSIF pro-actively screened sub-project locations in order minimize potential
resettlement and land acquisition. Furthermore, JSIF is adequately staffed to manage social risks,
having six specialists primarily engaged in outreach and capacity building activities with project
beneficiaries, as a well as an agency lawyer responsible for conducting due diligence on land
acquisition and donations, and ensuring compliance with the resettlement policy framework.
JSIF's institutional capacity for environmental management is high and environmental aspects are
being diligently addressed in other World Bank projects, as evidenced by development and
application of JSIF's Environmental Management System (EMS) which has maintained ISO-14001


﻿certification for several years. Those projects typically have involved urban projects with small
quantities of construction materials being handled and limited scales of civil works, so JSIF's
existing management systems will need to be strengthened to address the larger infrastructure
projects being considered by the DVRP. JSIF has an excellent history with the involvement of
O
U       communities in planning and implementation, in the development and application of contracting
conditions, and in the screening, supervision and oversight by the contractor.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies          Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment    Yes         The project team proposes an environmental
OP/BP 4.01                              classification of B as per OP/BP 4.01. A program-
wide Environmental Assessment (EA) will be
prepared to include a preliminary program-wide
impacts assessment, benefitting from experience of
DVRP projects in other Caribbean countries. The
borrower will adapt and strengthen its existing
Environmental Management Framework (EMF)
since the specifics of program activities and projects
will not be identified at the time of project appraisal.
The EMF will reflect the types of projects/sub-
projects under specifically components 2 and 3,
which are expected to be small works with relatively
minor environmental impacts that can be readily
mitigated with standard construction environmental
mitigation and monitoring procedures. The EMF will
provide procedures for the application of Bank
safeguards including information on subproject
screening and categorization, and additional
assessment studies as necessary for subprojects such
as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). The
EMF would also include a section with clear
safeguard guidelines for emergency investments and
works, including types of activities as well as
responsibilities for screening, for environmental
management, and for preparation of any safeguard
studies prior to works (as pertinent under Special
Considerations under OP 10.00 and consistent with
the project category) that may be considered under
the Component 5.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04  Yes         The Project is not planning to carry out works in
natural habitats, however, the policy is triggered as a
precaution given that some civil works (e.g. slope
stabilization, waterline replacement, road


﻿realignment, bridges, river or coastal defenses) may
involve relatively large-scale works or could affect
forest areas, riparian zones, coastal zones, or other
sensitive habitat.
Forests OP/BP 4.36           TBD          There are no projects being considered that could
bring about changes in the management, protection,
or utilization of forests, or the harvesting or
conversion of forest resources, such as agro-forestry,
food security, or farmland soil stability interventions
on riverbanks or landslide areas. However, this will
be confirmed during preparation and it is
recommended that the policy remain TBD.
Pest Management OP 4.09      TBD          There are no plans presently to include subprojects
which involve the use the pesticides, herbicides or
activities relate to the management of pests, but this
will be verified during preparation. Minor uses of
pesticides such as building termite treatments or
vector control can be managed by requiring that only
licenses contractors be used.
Physical Cultural Resources  Yes          The project is unlikely to impact physical cultural
OP/BP 4.11                                resources, but given the possibility of affecting
historic buildings or encountering artifacts during
excavation or clearing, this policy has been triggered
as a precaution.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP     No           Although there are cultural minorities (such as
4.10                                      Maroons, Rastafarian and other groups) in Jamaica,
there are no groups that could be considered
indigenous people as defined in OP 4.10.
Involuntary Resettlement OP/  Yes         There is a possibility that land may be acquired, or
BP4.12                                    private assets affected, due to the implementation of
activities planned under the risk reduction
component. These activities include investments in
strengthening the disaster resilience of existing
infrastructure, or in infrastructure sub-projects that
address particular hazards. Some of these
investments will take place in vulnerable
communities characterized by high levels of informal
land use. Given that the project will finance
infrastructure rehabilitation, , that may require minor
land acquisition or relocation of informal land users,
the World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement
applies. It is possible that the land acquisition and
resettlement requirements of the sub-projects to be
financed will be identified during preparation. In this
case, the client will need to prepare site-specific
resettlement action plans. In addition, the existing


﻿resettlement policy framework currently in use by
JSIF can be adapted for the purposes of this project,
to cover possible impacts under component 4
contingent emergency response), in case additional
infrastructure be required as part of a recovery
process.
Another potential resettlement impact relates to the
possible downstream effects of technical assistance
provided under component one (under-standing risk)
of the project, which includes the preparation of
preventative resettlement strategies. Typically,
households occupying vulnerable sites are informal.
Preventative resettlement strategies will need to
ensure that households can at a minimum maintain
the same standard of living in new settlement sites,
as well as security of tenure, and access to viable
livelihood opportunities. The task team will ensure
that terms of reference and deliverables for the
preparation of these strategies will be consistent with
the requirements of OP 4.12, and good practice
guidance on preventative resettlement prepared by
GFDRR with the assistance of the development
social development anchor.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37      TBD           There are no projects under consideration that
address rehabilitation or construction of dams.
However, if subproject risk assessments and
investments will include infrastructure that depend
on existing dams (such as irrigation or other water
provision), this Policy should be triggered to also
assess the safety of the relevant dam. This is
particularly pertinent for seismic and extreme flood
events. If the Project is financing flood retention
basins, depending on the size and scope of the basin,
the Policy could also be applicable. The triggering of
this Policy can be determined during project
preparation based on the list of subprojects identified
for financing, as well as the types of subprojects to
be identified during implementation.
Projects on International      No            There are no projects under consideration that
Waterways OP/BP 7.50                         involve international waterways.
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No            There are no projects under consideration that
BP 7.60                                      involve disputed areas.
