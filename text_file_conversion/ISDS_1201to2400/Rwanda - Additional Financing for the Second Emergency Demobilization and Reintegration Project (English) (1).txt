2. Project Development Objectives
The PDO of the original project is to support the efforts of the Government of Rwanda
(GoR) to (i) Demobilize members of armed groups of Rwandan origin and members of
the Rwandan Defense Force (RDF); and (ii) Provide socioeconomic reintegration support
to said members following demobilization, with a particular focus on the provision of
such support to female, child, and disabled ex-combatants. The Project Development
Objective (PDO) remains valid under the Additional Financing. There is no change to the
original objectives, design or scope.
3. Project Description
The proposed Additional Financing would scale-up the development effectiveness of the
original project through extending demobilization and reintegration services for
additional ex-combatants from Armed Groups (AG) repatriating from eastern DRC.
Project activities under the proposed Additional Financing would remain the same as
under the original project, which would continue to support the GoR to demobilize and
reintegrate AG through the original 5 components of the project: (i) Demobilization, (ii)
Reinsertion, (iii) Social and Economic Reintegration, (iv) Mainstreaming, and (v)
Program Management. Under the Additional Financing there will however be no
construction of houses for disabled ex-combatants.
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will continue to be implemented at the national level. Demobilization will
continue to take place through one demobilization center and one children rehabilitation
center, already in operation for several years. Reintegration will take place throughout the
country, where ex-combatants choose to settle and implement individual small scale sub-
projects for income generation. Given the small amount of money provided for individual
sub-projects, potential negative environmental and social impacts are limited. As ex-
combatants supported under the program are both widely dispersed and a very small
portion of the overall population, no cumulative environmental impact is expected. Under
the Additional Financing, the project will continue to implement the ESMF developed
and adhered to under the original project. The ESMF includes detailed screening
mechanisms and mitigation measures for sub-projects.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The Additional Financing maintains the same PDO, project components and activities as
under the original project, except for the construction of houses for severely disabled ex-
combatants that will not be included in the Additional Financing. Under the Additional
Financing there will be no construction work, and no land acquisition; for that reason
OP/BP 4.12 triggered under the original project will not apply. No new safeguards
policies are triggered under the Additional Financing, and the project continues to be
rated Category B, as no large scale or significant irreversible impacts are anticipated
under the Additional Financing. The main activity relevant to safeguards is the provision
of Reintegration Grants to individual ex-combatants for the implementation of income
generating sub-projects. Given the small size of the grants, limited negative impacts are
expected. As ex-combatants supported under the program are both widely dispersed and a
very small portion of the overall population no cumulative environmental impacts are
expected.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

The components and the activities are the same as in the original project. There are no
foreseen potential long-term or indirect negative social and/or environmental impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

N/A.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.


The borrower has consistently adhered to safeguards requirements during the
implementation of the original project and compliance with safeguards has consistently
been rated satisfactory. The ESMF for the original project was disclosed in country on
02/01/2010. The borrower has also worked closely with the Rwanda Environmental
Management Authority, throughout implementation of the original project to ensure
compliance with environmental safeguards. Sub-projects have been screened for
environmental and social impacts following the screening process described in Section F
I. of the ESMF. Sub-projects were all found to be category C, and did not require the
preparation of ESMPs, but rather implementation of environmental and social measures,
per the ESMF. There was also no case of involuntary resettlement.
Under the Additional Financing, the project will continue to use standardized screening
tools and mitigation mechanisms described in the ESMF to manage the limited impacts
of individual sub-projects. In order to attenuate or eliminate social and/or environmental
impacts, sensitization of ex-combatants in the Demobilization Center concerning norms
and expectations of civilian life, gender relations, and conflict mitigation, as well as
HIV/Aids and reconciliation activities in communities of resettlement, will continue as
under the original project.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Consultation with government officials at relevant levels, local and international NGOs,
communities and civil society groups were undertaken during ESMF finalization. The
ESMF was disclosed on 02/01/2010 and includes, among others: (i) a summary of the
World Bank safeguards policies and relevant Rwandan laws and regulations; (ii) a
detailed environmental and social screening process for sub-projects; (iii) a review and
clearance process for sub-projects; (iv) adequate arrangements for the management of
human water, food or medical waste from the demobilization centers; (v) guidelines in
case of need to acquire any land for sub-projects; and (vi) a monitoring plan. The project
will continue to provide tailored support to vulnerable groups (children, women, and
disabled ex-combatants) which have been affected by the conflict and at risk of further
violence and exclusion.
