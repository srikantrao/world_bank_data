                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The proposed Project would consist of the following four components: (1) Prevention and
                         Adaptation Investments; (2) Capacity Building and Data Development, Hazard Risk Management
                         and Evaluation; (3) Natural Disaster Response Investments; and (4) Project Management and
                         Implementation Support.

                         Component 1: Prevention and Adaptation Investments. This component is designed to reduce
                         physical vulnerability and pilot adaptive measures to build resilience to current and future hydro-
                         meteorological shocks. Activities under this component would include a suite of civil works to
                         improve infrastructure resilience to disaster events and climate change adaptation measures. Sub-
                         projects to be financed under this component, through the provision of works, technical advisory
                         services, operating costs, and acquisition of goods, include: (a) Construction of water storage and
                         distribution infrastructure; (b) Slope stabilization interventions; (c) Climate resilient rehabilitation of
                         primary and secondary roads and bridges along the East coast and in the South; and (d) Improved
                         climate resilient drainage systems.

                         Component 2: Capacity Building and Data Development, Hazard Risk Management and Evaluation.
                         The Project would support building the capacity for analysis and assessment of risks from natural
                         hazards and climate change including the integration of this analysis in the development decision
                         making process. This component will support the creation of relevant core data and data collection
                         systems as well as the integration analytical tools to permit improved decision making and
                         engineering design for risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Core data systems to be
                         developed under this component include inter alia: (a) creation of a high resolution digital
                         topographic and bathymetric model for Dominica; (b) creation of a high resolution soils survey map
                         including chemical and physical characteristics for each soil unit; c) design and deployment of a
                         robust hydromet network to provide high resolution hydrologic data for use in a wide range of

                         activities to support, for example, engineering design, land use and coastal zone planning, disaster
                         management, roads construction practices and design, agricultural development and others; and (d)
                         district and community level hazard risk mapping and training on climate adaptation measures.

                         Component 3: Natural Disaster Response Investments. This provisional component under this Project
                         would allow for rapid reallocation of IDA funds during an emergency, under streamlined
                         procurement and disbursement procedures. The emergency component would be triggered following
                         an adverse natural event, by an official Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica declaration
                         of a national emergency. Under this component, expenditures on critical imports (imported or locally
                         manufactured) required by the public/private sectors, and reconstruction/rehabilitation (civil works,
                         goods, and services) of damaged infrastructure may be financed as per (OP/BP 10.00).

                         Component 4: Project Management and Implementation Support. Activities under this component
                         would support strengthening and developing the institutional capacity for Project management,
                         including: (a) financing the establishment of a new Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within the
                         Ministry of Environment, including staffing, training, and operating costs; (b) preparation for designs
                         and tender documents; (c) preparation of project reports; (d) processing of contracts and tender
                         evaluation; (e) coordination of participating line Ministries; (f) supervision of the quality of works;
                         (g) training of staff in project management and implementation support; (h) monitoring and
                         evaluation of project progress and results, and (i) related activities to support efficient project

                         of activities designed to improve resilience to disaster events and adapt to impacts relating to climate
                         change. Activities include comprehensive road rehabilitation and landslide and slope stabilization.
                         Works also include new construction activities in the water sector to improve supply and resilience to
                         drought events.

                             including for the preparation of any safeguards studies prior to works as pertinent under OP 10.00
                             (as may be considered under Component 3). Consideration would be given to internal/external
                             safeguards specialist review of activities proposed under Component 3 and applying the screening
                             measures in the EMF on an expedited basis.

                             The Natural Habitats policy (OP 4.04) is triggered as a precaution due to potential Project

                             activities which may occur in highland forest areas, river valleys, coastlines and / or marine areas.
                             The EA and EMF account for natural habitats when screening both known works and any future
                             activities currently undefined. Potential application of this policy is identified in the EA, while
                             screening of future subprojects would be described in the EMF to determine if additional
                             assessment and specialized mitigation measures would be required for these Projects, once
                             detailed designs are known during implementation. Scoping for well-preserved vegetation, intact
                             forest areas, rare or endangered species habitat, and other complex or sensitive ecosystems will be
                             conducted for projects of any considerable size or with potential impacts extending off-site to any
                             considerable extent (e.g., downstream areas, riverbeds, etc.).

                             The Forests policy (OP/BP 4.36) is triggered as a precaution. This is because limited forest
                             resource harvesting may be done, in the sense that incidental clearing of a very limited number of
                             trees may be required for the agroforestry pilot plots, which would also include planting of trees
                             for slope stabilization, erosion prevention, or planting of climate resilient crops. In addition, some
                             of the projects have implications for changes in forest management, as any lessons learned during
                             the pilot projects may inform future national policy, but this is not an expected output of the
                             project. There are new Land Use Policies being developed by the government, and given that 60%
                             of Dominicaâ€™s territory is forested (while 20% is officially protected), there will be effects on
                             forested areas and their use, therefore triggering of the Policy was deemed prudent.

                          The Physical Cultural Resources Policy (OP/BP 4.11) has been triggered as a precaution. The
                          EMF and EMP include a "chance-find" procedure, particularly during activities such as major
                          excavations, road realignments or similar works where such assets could be affected by clearing,

                          blading, excavation or trenching. Archaeological relics may also be encountered and a robust
                          chance-find procedure should be developed, for which interaction with the Carib Community may
                          be relevant, even for lands outside the designated Carib Territory. There is no formal body to
                          screen antiquities, except for Historic Buildings in Roseau; rather, the local practice is to consult
                          the islandâ€™s historian, if any items of interest are uncovered.

                          The Pest Management policy (OP/BP 4.09) has been triggered as a precaution. Works for
                          greenhouses, crop management, and others could involve the use of pesticides and herbicides.
                          Simple management procedures could be developed, since the quantities stored and used would
                          likely be small. Standard measures may be applied for incidental use of pesticides (e.g. termite
                          treatments for buildings, or safe use of pesticides for vector control), and will be built into a
                          generic standardized EMP. The EMF will screen for any significant pesticide use and will require
                          that a Pest Management Plan be developed if indicated by the Policy.


                          Social Safeguards:

                          Involuntary Resettlement: The project triggers the Involuntary Resettlement safeguard policy (OP/
                          BP 4.12) as the proposed civil works may entail both temporary and permanent involuntary land
                          acquisition The scale of any acquisition is likely to be small and the impacts relatively
                          insignificant.

                           Indigenous Peoples: The Indigenous Peoples safeguard (OP/BP 4.10) is triggered as subprojects
                           will be implemented in the Islandâ€™s Carib Territory. The Carib/Kalinago population has been
                           consulted during the course of project preparation and an Indigenous Peoples Plan with associated
                           Social Assessment and consultations has been prepared. The community has indicated its broad

                           support of the project during consultations held on February 5, 2014. An Indigenous Peoples Plan
                           has been prepared during project preparation to guide implementation and ensure consultation
                           with and involvement of the Carib/Kalinago community in the sub-projects to be implemented in
                           their territory. Project impacts are likely to be positive and significant/irreversible impacts u
                           nlikely.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The environmental and social impacts of the Project are likely to be positive and the project
                           beneficiaries would be the entire Dominican population, including the Islandâ€™s Indigenous
                           Population.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The PCU, once established, will be a new entity with predominantly fiduciary functions and will
                           be housed within the Ministry of Environment . As the project focal point, the Ministry of

                           Environment will take the lead in the hiring of key PCU staff and has taken the lead to mobilize
                           staff to prepare the safeguards instruments. As part of PCU staffing, an environmental specialist
                           would be mobilized; a Social Specialist will also be hired by the PCU on a full time basis to
                           implement the IPP and conduct regular consultations with the Carib/Kalinago population as well
                           as to handle the land acquisition aspects of the project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The key stakeholders are the residents of the Island of Dominica since the planned works and
                           activities will be conducted Island-wide and will have benefits for the entire population. In
                           addition, the Islandâ€™s Indigenous Population will benefit through activities specifically planned for
                           the Carib Territories. An Indigenous Peoples Plan with associated Social Assessment has been
                           prepared and consultations held with the Carib/Kalinago population. Consultations with the
                           general population and the Carib population more specifically will continue during project
                           implementation as the Resettlement Framework and Indigenous Peoples Plan are implemented.
                           All safeguards instruments, including the EA/EMF, the Resettlement Policy Framework and
                           Indigenous Peoples Plan have been consulted and publicly disclosed prior to project appraisal, as
                           per OP/BP 4.12 and OP/BP 4.10.
