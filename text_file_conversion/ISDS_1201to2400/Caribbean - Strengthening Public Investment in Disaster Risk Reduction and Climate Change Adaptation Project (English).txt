2. Project Development Objective(s)
The objective of this initiative is to strengthen the governments’ capacity to systematically account for
disaster loss, to identify hazards and develop risk assessments, as well as to use this information to
strengthen public investment in disaster risk reduction.


3. Project Description
The Eastern Caribbean countries addressed under this project undertake only a very limited
documentation of hazard impacts and associated costs on a systematic basis. This has impeded the
effective understanding and modeling of the spectrum of risks faced by the countries. Mainstreaming
of DRR will require countries to understand their level of risk, capture this in economic terms and
develop investment strategies to reduce risks. To create a comprehensive overview of the risks the
countries are facing, the analysis will involve all productive sectors as well as socio economic elements.
The project consists of three components:


1. Analytical assessments of catastrophic risk for at least two hazards (earthquake and hurricane).
   This may relate to already existing assessments such as the information produced for the
   CCRIF or, as required, to the creation of new hazard information using the CAPRA
   (Probabilistic Risk Assessment Program) methodology. The World Bank and the United
   Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UN-ISDR) will collaborate on the establishment
   of a standardized methodology for the catastrophic risk profiles. The database containing the
   resulting information should be handed over and managed by a relevant national institution that
   has responsibility for disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation or alternatively the
   development planning. It is expected that there will be close collaboration with the World Bank
   project ‘Caribbean Risk Information Programme to support the Integration of DRM Strategies
   in Critical Sectors’. This will include sharing of information, coordination of methodologies
   for risk estimation and assessment of catastrophic risk and subsequently in this focus of
   incorporating DRR into public investment.

2. Following the assessment of catastrophic risk, a review of existing investments in disaster risk
   reduction will be carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Finance and other related
   organisms. This shall form the basis to identify and develop ways such as policies, guidelines
   or other legal instruments to efficiently incorporate DRR into the country’s national public
   investment and development planning system, as well as the development of mechanisms to
   track DRR investments in the future. Throughout the whole process workshops will be carried
   out to engage the participating ministries and to build ownership of all involved stakeholders.

3. The results of the project will inform the 2015 Global Assessment Reports on DRR, and
   thereby fill the current risk information gap in the GAR as it relates to Caribbean small island
   states. The results would also inform a sub-Regional Assessment Report on Disaster Risk
   Reduction within the same period.

                                                         4.01 since there are no anticipated
                                                         significant environmental or social
                                                         negative impacts. The project requires
                                                         no additional assessment in addition to
                                                         the preliminary screening already
                                                         performed for this ISDS.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04               No             The project will not result in any
                                                         significant conversion or degradation of
                                                         critical natural habitats or natural
                                                         habitats.

                                                         academic institutions and not the general
                                                         public. In addition, the data generated
                                                         will be at a level of resolution not suitable
                                                         for disaggregation in relation to impacts

                                                         4.12). No land will be acquired under the
                                                         project and no infrastructure will be
                                                         constructed, and no impacts on assets will
                                                         be entailed.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37                 No             The Project will not support the
                                                         construction or rehabilitation of dams.
Projects on International Waterways OP/BP No              Project activities will not affect
7.50                                                     international waterways.
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/BP 7.60          No               The Project will not involve activities in
                                                                areas known to involve disputed areas.


Environment
The environmental safeguard policies are not triggered because the project activities will comprise
studies and capacity building exercises; no civil works or policy actions will be carried out which could
affect environmental resources or pose any significant environmental or social risks, and does not
require further assessment. Accordingly the project is assigned an Environmental Category of C.

Social
As noted above, no social safeguard policies are triggered by this project since the project is focusing on
the collection and systematization of information on past events, the creation of risk assessments, and
the integration of disaster risk reduction considerations into investments. These activities will be
accompanied by professional trainings, workshops and conferences. During project implementation
opportunities to include social risk assessments in analytical assessments of catastrophic risk, and the
subsequent development of policy guidance and associated training events, will be explored.


II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project will not create any safeguard issues since it is focusing on the creation of risk assessments,
and the integration of disaster risk reduction considerations into investments. These activities will be
accompanied by professional trainings, workshops and conferences.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
It is expected that the strengthening of the countries’ capacity to account for disaster loss, identify
hazards, assess risks and use this information to strengthen public investment in disaster risk reduction
will increase the resilience to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
N/A. No adverse impacts have to be expected and therefore no project alternatives are provided.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
N/A. No safeguards are triggered.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
N/A. No safeguards are triggered and therefore it is not required to put such mechanisms for
consultation and disclosure in place.
