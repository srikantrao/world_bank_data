                           The Project Development Objective is to enable the access of Honduras and Nicaragua to efficient
                           sovereign risk insurance associated with tropical cyclones, earthquakes, and/or excess rainfall.
                            3. Project Description
                           The Project will finance the entrance fee and the annual insurance premiums necessary for Honduras

                                                                      Page 1 of 5
                         and Nicaragua to participate in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF). Project
                         components have been designed in the context of the broader Central America and Caribbean
                         Catastrophe Risk Insurance Project (P149670) and fully complement its objectives and activities.

                         Component 1: Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF for Honduras and Nicaragua

                         The objective of this Component is to assist Honduras and Nicaragua to join the CCRIF by financing
                         their entrance fees. This fee is equivalent to the first yearâ€™s insurance premium for each of the two
                         participating countries.

                         Component 2: Payment of annual insurance premium to the CCRIF for Honduras and Nicaragua

                         The objective of this Component is to assist Honduras and Nicaragua to purchase the catastrophe
                         insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the initial four years of their membership. In the
                         event that individual countries choose to pay a portion of the annual premium payment, remaining
                         project finance would be used towards additional years of insurance premium payments. Risk
                         coverage could be associated with tropical cyclone (wind and storm surge) and/or earthquake risk in
                         the first years. Upon availability of an additional excess rainfall product offered by CCRIF, financing
                         may also be used towards coverage against excess rainfall. Every year, Honduras and Nicaragua will
                         have the choice of selecting the amount of insurance coverage per peril, depending on country risk
                         profile and priority needs.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed Project does not contemplate any direct physical investments, but rather will finance
                         entrance fees and annual insurance payments to the CCRIF for Honduras and Nicaragua. The
                         insurance funds will not be tied or tracked to any specific investments, and the Project therefore does
                         not have any safeguards implications.
