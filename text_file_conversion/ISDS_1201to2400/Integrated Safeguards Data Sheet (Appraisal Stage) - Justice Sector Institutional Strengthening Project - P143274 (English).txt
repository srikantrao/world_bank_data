                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve (a) the key legal arrangements governing
                           the relationship between the state and its businesses and citizens and (b) the efficiency and
                           transparency of, and access to, selected justice services.

                         The key entities relevant for the justice sector – and hence for the proposed JSISP - are the Supreme
                         Court (SC - which oversees the judiciary); the Ministry of Justice (MOJ); the Ministry of Economy

                         and Budget Preparation (MEBP) and the Institute of Justice (IJ). Kazakhstan’s authorities envisage
                         the proposed JSISP as a strategic instrument to strengthen the institutional capacity and performance
                         of the selected justice sector entities, and deliver measurable results.

                         The proposed project will provide technical assistance for capacity-building and M&E support to the
                         selected entities over a 5-year period. The focus of the assistance is to enhance the entities' service
                         provision and performance, supporting whenever possible the entities' own strategic/modernization
                         plans and programs. However, across the entities there are common threads to the proposed support,
                         e.g. an emphasis on capacity-building to (a) obtain periodic public feedback on agency performance
                         and service delivery; (b) conduct institutional self-assessments; (c) develop strategic plans and
                         programs based on (a) and (b); and (d) develop and/or strengthen agency performance indicators and
                         a management dashboard, and build/strengthen agency M&E capacity. In addition, there are agency-
                         specific capacity building priorities that the project will attempt to address.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         This is a technical assistance project with technical support mainly intended for entities based in
                         Astana. Technical support is also envisaged for offices and courts in other cities such as Almaty,
                         Pavlodar, Semey And Aktobe.
