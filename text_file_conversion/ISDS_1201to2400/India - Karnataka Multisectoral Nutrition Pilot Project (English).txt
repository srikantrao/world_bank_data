2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase utilization of nutrition-improving
services by under-three children, adolescent girls and pregnant and nursing women from poor
households in the target areas.

3. Project Description:
The project has three components to achieve the PDO, namely:

Component 1: Increase consumption of nutritious foods and improve household nutrition-
related knowledge and behaviors. This component will deliver direct support to under-three
children, adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating women from poor and vulnerable households in
the form of locally-sourced nutrition supplements coupled with support to encourage household
behaviors with a large impact on nutrition, notably breastfeeding, complementary feeding and
hygiene practices. Nutrition volunteers engaged under the project in each village will implement
the program at the village level with the support of grassroots groups, including women's self-
help groups and village health and sanitation committees.
Component 2: Improve access to multi-sectoral interventions with an impact on nutrition.
This component will aim to leverage interventions and services in several sectors that have an
impact on the nutritional status of poor families in the target areas. At the policy and
administrative levels, coordination will be strengthened between key programs. On the ground,
contracted non-governmental organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, and
village nutrition workers will facilitate access by poor families to programs in various sectors, so
that integrated support is offered to the targeted poor families.

Component 3: Project management and monitoring and evaluation. This component will
finance management capacity for implementation of the project, including the management costs
of the implementing NGOs and the development of an effective information, education and
communications (IEC) strategy which will be monitored for assessing behaviors change.
Rigorous monitoring and evaluation will be supported, including baseline and follow-up
household surveys to measure nutritional status, household knowledge and behaviors, and access
to services. This will provide the necessary evidence on program effectiveness to inform
decisions on potential scale-up.

The project will target and directly benefit 41,713 vulnerable and poor (Below the Poverty Line-
BPL) under 3 year-children, adolescent girls (11-18 years), pregnant and lactating mothers in
these two blocks. The project will be operational for a period of three years.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The project is proposed to be implemented in Chincholi block of Gulbarga district and
Devadurga block of Raichur district covering all 421 villages in these blocks. Both these blocks
are located in northern part of Karnataka. Agroclimatically, they are located in the North Eastern
Transition and Northern Dry Zone respectively. Tur dal, jowar, cotton and sugarcane in
Chincholi and paddy, cotton, jowar and chilli in Devadurag are the major crops grown.

Chincholi has a sizable Scheduled caste and Muslim population while Devadurga has a
predominantly Scheduled Tribe population.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

There are no significant environmental or social impacts flowing from the project interventions.
However, since energy dense food supplements would be produced and delivered to targeted
beneficiaries to consume, adequate care has to be taken at the production unit to maintain safety,
health, hygiene and sanitation quality.

Further, since the project area has sizeable tribal, marginalized and minority communities,
special effort will be required to ensure that project benefits flow to them equitably. However,
the project design would mitigate potential exclusion of such groups since the project aims to
cover a 100% of all eligible beneficiaries in the project area.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

No such impacts are anticipated.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

Not applicable.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The Borrower has carried out an Integrated Environment and Social Assessment (IESA) and
formulated an Environment and Social Management Plans (ESMP). The plans are simple and
well integrated in the project design itself. Due to such mainstreaming, the ESMP does not
require extra staff to implement. Since the project involves delivery of energy dense foods to
target beneficiaries, detailed guidance has been provided in the ESMP on health, hygiene and
sanitation measures to be implemented at the production unit. It covers various issues such as
siting of the production unit, layout and design issues, equipment to be used, facilities to be
provided, storage of raw materials, packaging, sanitation management of the plant, personal
hygiene of workers, etc.

Tribal communities in the project areas are well integrated into the mainstream society.
However, tribal and scheduled caste (SC) groups (Tribal & Vulnerable Groups- TVG) have very
poor development outcomes. The Human Development Report, 2005, for Karnataka states that
the development of Scheduled Tribes and Castes in 2004 was at the level that the rest of the
communities were in 1991. Therefore, a Tribal & Vulnerable Groups Development Plan (TVGD
Plan) has been prepared which details specific measures to be taken to ensure that development
outcomes from this project flow equitably and substantially to the TVGs. Measures include:
tailoring behavior change communication strategy based on consultations with these
communities to ensure that it addresses appropriate issues, adequate representation of TVGs in
social/community audits, preference to TVGs in hiring workers for the food supplement
production unit, priority to TVGs in ensuring leveraging of existing government programmes, a
project reporting system that provides disaggregated data to reveal progress of different social
groups, etc.

These plans (Environment Management Plan & the Tribal & Vulnerable Groups Development
Plan) will be made part of the deliverable in the contracts the Borrower will sign with partner
NGOs who will implement the project at the ground level. The Borrower has adequate capacity
to implement these plans.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key stakeholders are direct beneficiaries of the project, their families, ASHA and
Anganwadi workers, Village Nutrition Volunteers, and staff of other line departments in the
project area. As part of the IESA, stakeholder consultations were held in three Gram Panchayaths
each in Chincholi (February 19, 2014) and Devadurga (February 20, 2014) blocks to explain the
project components and World Bank safeguard policies, as well as receive their feedback on the
project design and components. Consultations were conducted at the village level and at a time
convenient to these stakeholders. The consultation process was photo-documented. All
communities welcomed the project and felt that it would be of benefit to them. They expressed
their willingness to participate in the project. A key feedback was non-acceptance of ragi as an
ingredient in the food supplement. Once the ESMP is finalized it will be made available at the
Taluk Panchayat Office for public access.
