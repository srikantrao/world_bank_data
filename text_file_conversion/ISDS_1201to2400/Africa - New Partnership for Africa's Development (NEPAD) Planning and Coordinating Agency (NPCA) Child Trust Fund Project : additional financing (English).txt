2. Project Development Objectivc(s)
  A. Current Project Development Objectives - Parent
  The CTF's current PDO is ro improve coordination, implementation and monitoring of
  CAADP processes at national, regional, and continental levels.

  B. Proposed Project Development Objectives- Additional Financing (AF)
  The proposed revised PDO is improved enabling environment for r!fi'ican agricultuml
  programs and policies at national, regional and continenfallevel.


3. Project Description

The proposed additional financing (AF) would help to continue providing support to NPCA,
under a CTF arrangement, to solidify gains achieved in previous years and expand support for
coordination of the CAAPD process; targeted technical assistance, policy dialogue and
programming at continental, regional and national levels; resource mobilization; and improving
accountability and governance structures. Specifically, the AF would help finance the costs
associated with a scale-up of CAADP activities implemented by NPCA. The CTF grant will
also be restructured under a Level 1 restructuring (approved at the RVP level) to modify the
Project Development O~jective (PDO) and associated Results Framework. This will be the first
AF and second restructuring to NPCA CTF.

There are no changes in the structure or the implementation arrangements modalities of the
CTF. The proposed AF will support the following:


   •      Support to CAADP's new agenda. As the CAADP process has evolved, new
          priorities have emerged that were unanticipated when NPCA's operational plan was
          first developed. With the mandate of technical leadership of CAADP, NPCA has
          been at the forefront in supporting these new and expanding initiatives. Additional
          financing in this area would suppm1 such initiatives as the formation of Joint
          Agricultural Sector Working groups (JAGs) ~ multi-stakeholder thematic groups
          supporting CAADP implementation; plans to launch a network of African
          think-tanks to generate and share knowledge and perspective on issues allecting
          African agriculture (including global issues and trends); and initiatives
          competitiveness and global integration.

   •      Strengthen the focus on results. NPCA is committed to fulfilling its mandate of
          monitoring the performance of CAADP. The scale and complexity of this task has
          become more apparent in the last two years. NPCA will use the additional time and
          resources to strengthen its capacity to establish and manage efficient and policy
          relevant results framework for CAADP.

   •      Improve knowledge and information systems under CAADP: NPCA and AUC arc
             in the process of re-thinking CAADP's approach to pillar and thematic technical
             knowledge management. The approach, which aims to improve knowledge
             management under CAADP, involves: (a) improving investment planning,
             institutional analysis and policy formulation; (b) strengthening communication with
             policymakers; and (c) supporting program implementation. Extension of the trust
             funds will provide more time required to develop these critical functions.


-t Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known)
The proposed AF will fund activities implemented at NPCA Headquarters, based in Pretoria,
South Africa, and continent-wide

II. Key S:tfegua1·d Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key S(!feguard b".wes
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
No new World Bank Safeguard policies are triggered by the proposed additional financing
(AF). The proposed AF is rated category C (not required) which is in line with the ratings of the
original CTF (P121914).

The activities funded by the CTF will be limited the above areas and the CTF cannot and will
not fund any on the ground agricultural activities or civil works, their engineering design (either
detailed or schematic) or their feasibility study either at NPCA Secretariat level or in Member
States. There will therefore be no adverse environmental or social impacts associated with the
CTF implementation.
2. Describe :my potential indirect and/or long term imtJacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
NIA
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid o1· minimize adverse
impacts.
NIA
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to ad<h·ess safeguard policy issues. Provide an
:1ssessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
NPCA has complied with World Bank safeguard policies since the CTF became effective in
2011; however as a category C no safeguards policies were triggered. The Bank Task Team will
continue to work closely with NPCA as it has been doing during CTF implementation to ensure
that the processes that the proposed AF will support includes evaluating member countries
environmental and social management systems.
