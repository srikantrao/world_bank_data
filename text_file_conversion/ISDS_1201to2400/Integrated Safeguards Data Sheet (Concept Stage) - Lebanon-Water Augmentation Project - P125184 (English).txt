                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objective is to increase the volume of water available to the Greater Beirut
                           and Mount Lebanon area.
                           C. Project Description
                           Despite its internal rivers and relatively large aquifers, freshwater availability in Lebanon is only
                         considered high when compared to its larger, arid neighbors. Effectively, despite investments in
                         infrastructure and a vision for institutional change, the Government of Lebanon (GoL) has not been
                         able to deliver to date on its national goal of improved water service and sustainable and integrated

                         water resources management. The ensuing development deficit in the water sector has largely been a
                         result of: (i) delayed implementation and cost of critical storage, distribution and treatment
                         infrastructure; (ii) lags in operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure; (iii) incomplete
                         implementation of Law 221 which precludes water establishments from providing sustainable access
                         to and quality of service; and (iv) the challenges inherent of reforming traditional irrigation practices.

                         As a result, per capita water availability in Lebanon is already 926 m3/year, and is thus already
                         defined as water scarce. Due to a lack of surface water storage and over 40 percent average losses
                         from the distribution system, areas that are serviced by the public water network receive as little as
                         three hours of water per day for over six months of the year. A large informal private sector
                         supplements the insufficient public water supply through thousands of unlicensed wells, the
                         construction and operation of which is largely unregulated by GoL.

                         In the GBML area alone, where over 2.3 million people live, the water supply deficit will reach an
                         estimated 350 million cubic meters (MCM) by 2035. Absent: (i) an increase in storage capacity to
                         capture seasonal surface water runoff; (ii) reduction in physical and commercial water losses; (iii)
                         regulation of groundwater use and (iv) the implementation of volumetric metering, chronic water
                         shortages will become endemic across Lebanon by as early as 2020.

                         Recognizing the need for urgent action, GoL examined the various alternatives for water supply
                         augmentation to GBML in the long term, by developing: (i) a detailed water balance and (ii) a
                         technical, economic, environmental and social evidenced-based review of nine different alternatives
                         for water supply augmentation. Based on thorough review of this work and extensive public
                         consultation, GoL committed to implementing the following infrastructure and reforms to close the
                         anticipated water supply deficit described above and meet the GBML’s medium and long term
                         demands for water:

                         �        Damour and Janna dams: which will provide up to 40 MCM/year and 15 MCM/year
                         respectively to the GBML;
                         �        The Greater Beirut Water Supply project (GBWSP), currently under implementation with
                         partial financing from the World Bank (SIL – 200M - P103063) and will provide an additional
                         50MCM/year to the GBML in the short term by: (i) conveying water from the existing Joun reservoir
                         through two underground tunnel; (ii) rehabilitating and/or replacing over 400 kilometers (km) of
                         distribution network; (iii) installing 200,000 water meters across the GBML area; and (iv) developing
                         the capacity of the Beirut Mount Lebanon Water Establishment (BMLWE) in utility operations.
                         �        Improved groundwater and surface water management: to sustainably mobilize
                         approximately 100 MCM/year to the GBML, detailed plans for which are being proposed as part of
                         the Groundwater Assessment and Database study
                         �        Demand management measures: including the introduction of volumetric tariffs, and
                         consumer awareness raising among other measures included in the NWSS and
                         �        The Bisri Dam which will provide an additional 125 MCM/year of water to the GBML.
                         Water stored at the Bisri dam will be conveyed, treated and distributed through the tunnel, water
                         treatment plant and distribution networks currently under implementation as part of the GBWSP.

                         The proposed Project components are thus:
                         Component 1 – Bisri Dam Infrastructure Works and Construction Supervision (Estimated cost US
                         $470 million including expropriation of lands). Under this component, the Islamic Development
                         Bank (IsDB), the Saudi Development Fund (SDF), and the World Bank will jointly finance the

                         construction and construction supervision of a water supply dam and associated infrastructure on the
                         Bisri river. Associated infrastructure is expected to include an access road, small hydropower plant
                         and transmission line and will be finalized as part of the ongoing detailed design. This component
                         will also finance: (i) construction supervision, (ii) environment and social panel of experts, (iii)
                         monitoring and evaluation of project implementation, and (iv) potential community development and
                         benefit sharing programs as appropriate.

                         Component 2 – Technical Assistance (Estimated cost US$10 million) This component will
                         strengthen and accelerate the implementation of GoL’s complementary components of the strategy
                         for increased water security in the GBML area namely: (i) strengthening the Ministry of Energy and
                         Water (MOEW) in the regulation and safety of all Lebanese dams; (ii) piloting various aquifer
                         recharge technologies and/or other groundwater management options as appropriate; (iii)
                         strengthening the capacity of the BMLWE in measures to improve cost recovery, dam operations,
                         wastewater management and optimizing its water supply network and (iv) supporting MOEW in
                         raising awareness and strengthening communications on water demand management measures.
                         Component 2 will also finance the implementation, monitoring and follow up of the environment and
                         social management plan (ESMP) for construction and operation, as well as the resettlement action
                         plan (RAP).
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed dam construction works will be a center core rockfill dam with 73 m in height, 790 m
                         in crest length, 125MCM in reservoir capacity, and 2,235 m3/s in spillway capacity. The potential for
                         hydropower generation (up to 4.5 Megawatts) is currently under review by the design engineers. The
                         proposed Bisri Dam site is about 15 km east of the coastal city of Saida and 35 km south of central
                         Beirut, at an elevation of 395 meters above sea level (masl). The reservoir extends for about 4 km

                         upstream of the dam axis and at maximum water level, 462 masl and the area expected to be
                         inundated is approximately 450 ha.

                         The upper catchment is characterized by the steep slopes and cliffs, with small traditional villages of
                         red-tiled houses perched on hilltops and cliff edges. The lower catchment downstream of Bisri
                         Village, beyond the ancient landslip, the river again occupies a narrow steep sided valley in which
                         agriculture is largely limited to tree-crops grown on terraced slopes. Despite the presence of
                         extensive agriculture, the Bisri Valley upstream of the dam site is very sparsely populated, with no
                         significant settlements or communities beyond family groups. The majority of land owners are
                         absentee landlords, and most of the families present are tenant farmers or seasonal labor. Throughout
                         the reservoir area there is a total absence of non-agricultural commercial or industrial activities.

                         The legal basis for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system is established in the
                         Environment Protection Law No. 444/2002 and Law No. 690/2005 on the reorganization of the
                         Ministry of Environment (MOE) and the EIA decree No. 8633/2012 and its annexes. The EIA decree
                         and its annexes include all the requirements for screening, preparation of the environmental
                         assessment and the supervision of the environmental assessment process including consultation and
                         disclosure. The EIA unit in the Ministry of Environment consists of three full-time staff and 20 part
                         time staff, of whom many are knowledgeable about the national EIA system and the World Bank
                         Safeguards for which they received substantial training. It is expected that the Council of
                           Development and Reconstruction (CDR) and the MOE will work together in meeting the project’s
                           safeguards deliverables especially in meeting in-country and the Bank policies.

                           The proposed project falls under the World Bank environmental category “A? classification due to
                           the potential adverse environmental and social impacts that could be sensitive, diverse or
                           unprecedented. Impacts associated with category A projects may affect areas broader than the sites or
                           facilities subject to physical works. The following safeguards policies are triggered by the project:
                           Environmental Assessment (OP.BP 4.01); Natural Habitat (OP/BP 4.04); Physical Cultural
                           Resources (OP/BP 4.11); Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), and Safety of Dams. The GoL has
                           prepared a draft ESIA and RAP that are currently under review by the Bank.

                           A panel of independent internationally-recognized environmental and social experts are in the
                           process of being appointed by GoL and will accompany and supervise project preparation and
                           implementation in line with best practice international standards and Bank safeguards policies. The
                           independent panel of experts on environmental and social aspects will comprise an environment
                           expert, a public health expert and a social expert. As the detailed design of the dam progresses, the
                           RAP and ESIA will continue to be developed in parallel and in full coordination with the detailed
                           design.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           CCDR will be responsible for project preparation and implementation. CDR has extensive
                           experience with managing and implementing projects financed by World Bank Grants and Loans
                           under World Bank Procurement and Safeguard Guidelines (including more recently the Greater
                           Beirut Water Supply Project and the Beirut Urban Transport Development Project for example).
                           CDR is familiar with the requirements of the safeguards policies of the Bank and its capacity on
                           safeguards has been strengthened through implementing previous projects.

                           With regard to the resettlement and land acquisition, the Government of Lebanon has well
                           established institutional arrangements for valuation of lost assets. The value of compensation to the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           lost assets is determined by an Expropriation Committee (EC), which is composed of a judge, an
                           engineer and an assessor. The affected persons, including the land owners, tenants (both legal and
                           illegal) and project entity (CDR), are consulted in the valuation process. Any land take (both
                           temporary and permanent) will be carried out in accordance with OP 4.12.

                           However, an assessment of CDR’s safeguards capacity relating specifically to dam construction will
                           need to be carried out as part of the ESIA and RAP preparation. Further, the Bank will undertake an
                           assessment of the proposed dam operator’s capacity for safeguards and E&S implementation.
                           Capacity building activities will need to be carried out according as an integrated part of the project
                           preparation and implementation. During preparation and implementation, the Government team will
                           also receive guidance from the Bank’s environmental and social specialists.
