   capacity of Teresina Municipal Government; and (ii) improve access to services of the low-
   income population of the Lagoas do Norte region of the city.
3. Project Description
Overall the structure of the project components remains the same and the activities proposed under
the additional financing loan were largely part of the Project’s original concept and design, which
had to be reduced via a restructuring as a result of the cost overruns/financing gap.

Component 1: Municipal Management Modernization, City Development and Project Management.

This component aims to strengthen the PMT’s management and technical capacity, through the
provision of technical assistance and equipment for, inter alia:

(i)      Consolidating and improving the efficiency of PMT’s financial and budget management and
planning capacity;
(ii)     Strengthening PMT’s environmental management capacity, including the introduction of an
environmental licensing and enforcement control system.
(iii)    Reviewing and implementing modifications to PMT’s new organizational structure to
support the current city service delivery and development needs.
(iv)     Preparation of a staff work plan for the PMT
(v)      Strengthening the PMT’s procurement management capacity.
(vi)     Strengthening PMT’s institutional capacity in the management of water supply, sanitation
and drainage, including preparation of procedures for works supervision as well as operation and
maintenance of infrastructure.
(vii)    Preparing engineering designs for works deemed strategic and priority for the PMT.
(viii) Carrying out Project management, monitoring and evaluation, to support the PMU to carry
out the procurement, financial management, environmental, social and other requirements of the
Project.

 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Lagoas do Norte region within the Municipality of Teresina, State of Piauí, Brazil. The Project
consists of a range of activities that benefit the municipality of Teresina as a whole, but with the bulk
of activities directly focused in the Lagoas do Norte region.

This area, located at the confluence of the Parnaiba and Poti rivers, consists of a floodplain with a
series of interlinked lagoons. This area’s unplanned and irregular occupation poses important human
health and environmental risks and cannot support a dynamic urban fabric endowed with the
necessary infrastructure. The area is currently occupied by a low-income population living in


                                              Page 3 of 13
precarious and insalubrious conditions, in homes that lack basic sanitation and at permanent risk of
being flooded out. The natural conditions of the area have deteriorated due to the irregular urban
occupation and the pollution of the waterways with wastewater and solid waste from local residents.
These are precisely the issues this project aims to tackle.

The first effort from the Municipal Government to face these issues was supported through the
implementation of the Lagoas do Norte Project (LNP – the parent project). The LNP –Phase I,
financed by the World Bank and approved in October 2008 is about to be completed. This proposed
Additional Finance (LNP – Phase II) provides continuity to the interventions already implemented in
the Lagoas do Norte region by the aforementioned LNP.

6. Safeguard Policies        Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment Yes                During the preparation of the parent project in 2006-07,
OP/BP 4.01                                  an environmental and social assessment (ESA) was
                                            undertaken for the actions planned in the areas 1, 2, 3
                                            and 4 in the region of Lagoas do Norte in Teresina. The
                                            ESA for the proposed additional financing represents an
                                            update/revision of the original ESA, to reflect the
                                            project adapted scope and new information available
                                            (conceptual design of the interventions), to incorporate
                                            lessons learned from the implementation of the parent
                                            project, and to describe an analysis of alternatives at
                                            concept stage for some of the key interventions initially
                                            planned. In this sense, the Project’s Environmental and
                                            Social Assessment report (and its Environmental and
                                            Social Management Plan - ESMP) was updated,
                                            complying with Bank guidelines for Project classified as
                                            category A.
                                            The ESA for this LNP – Phase II has already been made
                                            available to the public on October 23, 2014, and the
                                            consultations with the local community were undertaken
                                            on November 4, 2014.
Natural Habitats OP/BP       Yes            This policy remains triggered as the proposed additional
4.04                                        financing Loan includes interventions in the interlinked
                                            lagoons and river ecosystems (the group of lagoons and
                                            their areas of permanent preservation, APPs, protected
                                            by law). Some of the interventions will consist of
                                            activities to revitalize the natural environment, mainly
                                            by recovering the water quality of the heavily-polluted
                                            lagoons and re-establishing lagoon- and river-side flora.
                                            The ESMP contemplates an environmental control
                                            program to ensure that activities are undertaken in a way
                                            to secure maximum positive environmental impacts.

                                  Some measures include rescuing of fauna, clean-up and
                                  other procedures that may be complementary to the
                                  environmental recovery of the lagoons.
Forests OP/BP 4.36         No     This policy is not triggered given that the interventions
                                  will be implemented in urban areas and that any possible
                                  impacts are likely to be small scale. In addition, due to
                                  the nature of the interventions, they are unlikely to
                                  significantly affect the welfare of forest dependent
                                  communities and the management of forests per se.
Pest Management OP 4.09    No     This policy is not triggered as it is unlikely that the
                                  interventions would involve the procurement or use of
                                  environmentally significant amount of pesticides.
Physical Cultural Resources Yes   This policy remains triggered given that some
OP/BP 4.11                        interventions under the AF will require earthworks and
                                  excavation, although said works are not expected to
                                  interfere with any archeological site. The ESMP
                                  provides specific guidance on the chance finds
                                  procedures.

                                  Through this ESA, it has been proposed the construction
                                  of a suitable space of worship and celebration for Afro-
                                  Brazilians cults, given the rich cultural activities in the
                                  Lagoas do Norte region linked to the Afro-Brazilian
                                  culture.

                                  The cultural traditions of handicraft, both general and
                                  the ones produced with clay, will also be protected.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP No       This policy is not triggered as there are no indigenous
4.10                              peoples as characterized by the policy in the project
                                  area.
Involuntary Resettlement   Yes    This policy remains triggered for the AF. The
OP/BP 4.12                        Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) prepared for the
                                  Parent project has been updated for this AF and lessons
                                  learned from its implementation were included in this
                                  RPF. The RPF was publicly disclosed on October 24,
                                  2014 and consulted on November 4, 2014. Families
                                  living in APPs and in areas of permanent flood risk
                                  around the lagoons and alongside the rivers will be
                                  resettled – currently 1,730 properties (encompassing
                                  2,180 families).
                                  The RPF has as a main principle to keep the number of
                                  resettled families and businesses to a minimum, thus
                                  promoting the preservation of the network of social,
                                  cultural and economic relationships that exist in affected
                                  areas, and so that essential urban and social services are
                                  provided for the relocated families in the new areas.



                                  Page 5 of 13
                                               These resettlements will be needed especially for the
                                               interventions of macro drainage and recovery of APPs.
                                               In addition, some relocations will also be needed due to
                                               the upgrading of the road network in the study area,
                                               including the expansion from one line to two lines of
                                               Boa Esperança Avenue, which will require both
                                               resettlement of families and business compensation.
                                               There will be no resettlements in the first year of the
                                               implementation of this AF – during the first year the
                                               detailed engineering designs and their respective
                                               Involuntary Resettlement Plans will be prepared.
   Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37 Yes               This safeguard policy was triggered for the parent
                                               Project because of the existence of flood control dikes
                                               along the banks of the Parnaiba and Poti rivers in the
                                               Lagoas do Norte region. A safety assessment of the
                                               existing dikes was undertaken. The assessment, which
                                               studied their structural, geological and hydrological
                                               hydrodynamic safety, concluded that the slopes are
                                               stable and as such the risk s of rupture of the dikes are
                                               nonexistent.

                                               The proposed works on Boa Esperança Avenue – the
                                               flood control dike along the Parnaíba river in the Lagoas
                                               do Norte region, as well as the proposed implementation
                                               of a touristic hub where the Parnaíba and Poti rivers
                                               meet, will require special care to ensure that the works
                                               do not compromise the safety of the dike. A dam safety
                                               panel will be formed to review the detailed engineering
                                               designs before the commencement of the construction
                                               works.

                                               In addition the designs will incorporate features that will

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     The overall environmental and social impacts of the proposed project are considered to be
     substantially positive as the Project contemplates interventions related to (i) local urban and


                                              Page 6 of 13
 environmental renovation and (ii) actions to promote social development and environmental
 management capacity. The most significant adverse impact is related to involuntary resettlement.
 As such, the RPF has been undertaken so that the number of resettled families and businesses are
 kept to a minimum. Potential adverse environmental impacts are considered temporary in nature
 and directly associated with construction works, such as temporary road blockages, increased dust,
 noise, and limited interference with provision of some public services.

 The legal and institutional guidelines used to elaborate the environmental and social assessment of
 the Project interventions have included both the current national, regional and local legislation and
 the World Bank Safeguards Policies. This project is classified as Category A due to the nature and
 size of the proposed actions, to the proximity of the interventions to urban areas and
 environmentally protected areas.

 The ESA aims at integrating environmental and social aspects during the preparation and
 implementation of the project to help support better decision making and, ultimately, achieving
 sustainable development.

 The detailed designs for this AF have not been prepared yet; at this stage, only the conceptual
 designs of the interventions have been completed. As such, instead of using the traditional
 Environmental Impact Assessment process, which was designed for well-defined interventions/
 actions, this ESA was elaborated taking into consideration the strategic relationships among
 various proposed interventions so that the best alternative for the overall set of interventions could
 be defined.

  Both the RPF and ESA have been updated to reflect project scope and the new information
  available, and to incorporate lessons learned from the implementation of the parent project.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
  in the project area:
  The indirect and long-term environmental and social impacts of the Project are overwhelmingly
  positive in nature, as would be expected of a project whose main outcomes include: (i) the
  collection and treatment of 100% of the wastewater in the Lagoas do Norte region (areas 1, 2 and
  3); (ii) the improvement of the water quality of all of the lagoons in the Lagoas do Norte region
  (areas 1, 2 and 3) – reducing the wastewater, solid waste and sediment pollution loads entering the
  lagoons; (iii) the recuperation and optimization of the micro and macro drainage system in Lagoas
  do Norte such that flood events are minimized; (iv) the recuperation of natural vegetation along
  the banks of the lagoons and the adjacent rivers; (v) improving the immediate local environment of
  families through new housing and improvements to existing housing; and (vi) the recuperation and
  construction of green spaces, parks and other community leisure equipment in the region.

 In addition, the proposed interventions will promote extensive urban and environmental
 renovation in the region, which in turn will have significant positive social and economic impacts
 in both the study areas (Lagoas do Norte region) and the Municipality of Teresina itself.

  The environmental and social studies concluded that if the proposed investments are implemented
  adequately and they manage to properly integrate environmental and social aspects during its
  preparation and implementation, this AF will be capable of fulfilling its main objectives and have
  a significant positive environmental and social impact in the long term.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse


                                            Page 7 of 13
impacts.
The conception of the parent project (Phase 1) and its ESA undertaken in 2006, considered the
interventions of macro drainage, water supply, sewage, and urbanism – landscape design/project
and road system for the whole program area (areas 1, 2, 3 and 4).

Under this AF, the ESA also analyzed the technological and location alternatives of such
interventions at concept design stage. The alternatives analyzed are presented below:

Macro drainage: In 2014, Tucci and Souza, in a study entitled “Inundation Control and the
Maintenance of the levels of the Lagoas do Norte region: Hydrologic and hydraulic simulations of
the flooding scenarios”, have re-evaluated the macro drainage global system in the Lagoas do
Norte region. The study simulated and projected a 25-year time of recurrence risk of flooding
conditions in the drainage system in question. In this system many scenarios were studied, which
permitted the authors to obtain the maximum water levels of the lagoons to accommodate flooding
events with up to 50 years recurrence time. The study considered the operational pumping rule in
Oleiros Lagoons with levels of 53.5, 54 and 55 meters.

The maintenance of the 55 m level in Oleiros Lagoons is the most convenient operational scenario,
because it minimizes the resettlement conditions due to flooding and because it allows the level of
water to be maximized in the beginning of the dry season. The study has also verified the scenario
for a 50-year outflow during the period of high discharge, showing that the impacts are limited and
therefore ensuring both the objective and the results of the flooding control.

Aside from the scenarios studied predicting flooding situations, some scenarios that considered the
possibility of drought were also analyzed – considering the maintenance of permanent levels of
water in the lagoons. To some lagoons, the maintenance of the water levels is almost permanent
(about 95%) for the others if the operational rule is changed through the use of floodgates, it is
possible to increase the time of permanence of high water levels in the lagoons, making them
stable for a great part of the year.

Two additional alternatives have been analyzed for the Oleiros Lagoon:
1.       Maintaining water levels at 54 meters with the operation of water available in the system
of the lagoons. This alternative represents an area of 311,000 m2 covered with water. The area
projected to Oleiros lagoon if 405,659 m2. Therefore, there would be some days during the year in
which the lagoon will be lacking around 95,000 m2 of water;
2.       Maintaining water levels at 55 meters: to meet this demand it is necessary to pump water
for Parnaíba River to complete the necessary volume to keep the level at the aforementioned rate.

The Municipality of Teresina has opted for the alternative of maintaining the water levels at 55
meters, and thus, the pumping of water from Parnaíba River is required when levels are below the
established 55 meters. This decision is fundamentally based on the urban – landscape design/
project concept, due to the function proposed to the environmentally recovered lagoons, including
the implementation of a tourism cluster in the Northern part of the Lagoons along with Parque
Encontro das Águas. In addition to that, it is possible to verify that the flow rates required for
maintaining the desired water levels in the Oleiros lagoon can be considered insignificant
(maximum of 30.3 l/s to a minimum flow rate of 261,100 l/s from Parnaiba River).

Sewerage System - Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant: The preliminary conception of sewerage


                                          Page 8 of 13
system in areas 1, 2, 3 and 4, which are part of the original project, intended to:
�         Implement secondary and tertiary networks as well as pumping stations in Area 1 and a
redirection of the wastewater to the Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant;
�         Rehabilitation of the Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant to support the effluents of area 1;
�         Areas 2, 3 and 4 wastewater would be collected and the effluents redirected, through an
outfall, to a Wastewater Treatment Plant to be built outside of the area covered by the project –
more precisely in a site located at the right margin of Parnaíba River, about 7 km after its
confluence with Poti River.

As AGESPISA (the State’s water supply and sanitation utility) is implementing a Water Treatment
Plant in an area downstream to the area originally destined for the Northern Wastewater Treatment
Plant, this would require an enlargement of the outfall of areas 2, 3 and 4 to the downstream of the
Water Treatment Plant proposed. The team decided to analyze other alternatives to the final
destination of the effluent from the area; and the best solution was to expand the existing Pirajá
Wastewater Treatment Plant and after the analysis it was verified that:
�        The choice of the Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant (renovation and expansion)
eliminates the construction of a transmission line of long extension and of big diameter.
�        The transport of sewage to a new Wastewater Treatment Plant (located at the right side of
Poti River) would require the outfall to cross the Mariano Gaioso C. Branco Bridge, whose
structure would probably need some sort of reinforcement to sustain the new heavy load.
�        The construction of a new Wastewater Treatment Plant would need the expropriation of
the land;
�        The cost of electricity, when considering the sewage pumping, is much higher in the case
of the construction of a new Wastewater Treatment Plant; and
�        The cost of operation and maintenance are smaller to the operating Pirajá Wastewater
Treatment Plant, when compared to the construction of a new Wastewater Treatment Plant,
considering the significant increase in expenses with staffing;
�        The Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant is located in an urban area with consolidated
occupation, and a new Wastewater Treatment Plant would require environmental changes, with
extra costs on measures of environmental control;
�        The study of self-depuration of Parnaíba River (Tucci, 2014) proves the depuration
capacity of the river to the new flow rates resulting from the enlargement of the Pirajá Wastewater
Treatment Plant, without compromising the construction of the Water Treatment Plant.

So in this sense an alternative was adopted to conduct the sewage from areas 2, 3 and 4 to the
Pirajá Wastewater Treatment Plant - and its current enlargement to a secondary treatment of a flow
rate of 340 l/s and, in twenty years, to support a flow rate of 420 l/s.

Urban and landscape interventions in the margins of Lagoons (areas of permanent preservation):
two distinct scenarios were analyzed:
�        Renovation of the areas of permanent preservation of Lagoons with a buffer zone of 30
meters of width from the maximum normal level established in the Study of Maximum and
Minimum Levels of Lagoons, adding a 10 meter buffer zone to the implementation of sanitation
infrastructure, access by road etc. A Linear Park has been proposed to be implemented in this 40-
meter buffer zone.
�        Renovation of the areas of permanent preservation considering the existing an urban
design, allowing for the permanence of existing permanent/consolidated housing structures in
these protected areas. This would be made in accordance with the criteria presented in the
CONAMA Resolution n. 396/2006. Thus, the design of the urban and landscape intervention

                                           Page 9 of 13
 would be constructed respecting the conception of ‘landscape windows’, trying to minimize the
 need for resettlement without compromising the urban-environmental concept.

 The first scenario would comprehend the need to full resettlement of about 1,214 houses, with 65
 partial removals. In the second scenario, this resettlement would be reduced to 763 houses and
 around 131 partially removed (back side of the lot). These numbers are included in the overall
 estimate of 1,730 households to be resettled.

  As such, the second scenario has been determined to be the most adequate manner, especially
  when the significant reduction in the amount of resettlement from areas of permanent preservation
  is considered.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
  assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  As mentioned before, the safeguard instruments prepared aim at integrating environmental and
  social aspects during the preparation and implementation of the project to address safeguard policy
  issues, help make better decisions and, ultimately, achieving sustainable development. The ESMP
  contemplates the requirements established in the WB Safeguard Policies. This is based on the
  finding of the ESA process as well as the requirements established by the State Secretary of
  Environment and Water Resources (SEMAR) and by the Municipal Secretary of Environment
  (SEMAM), especially with regards to obtaining environmental licenses for the construction works.

 During the implementation of the parent project, the capacity of the Borrower (PMT) in dealing
 with themes of urban and environmental requalification, land management and resettlement has
 improved and allowed for the municipality to access financing from other funding programs
 promoted by the Federal Government. In fact, the PMT’s Project Management Unit has
 demonstrated adequate capacity to plan and implement the Project components as designed and
 the actions presented in the ESA, the related ESMP and the Resettlement Framework. The
 satisfactory performance of the resettlement process undertaken by the parent project is further
 evidence of Borrower’s capacity to comply with World Bank safeguard requirements. The project
 design includes strengthening of the PMT’s capacity for environmental management and issuance
 of environmental licenses for activities/interventions that are under Municipal jurisdiction.

 On the other hand, the improvement in PMT’s institutional capacity and the participatory process
 undertaken during the interventions of the program allowed for an improved and expanded level of
 environmental awareness in the urban space and of the importance of the lagoons as a public space
 with the main goal of flood management.

 The establishment of a Social Project Unit in the study area allowed the implementation of a
 diverse number of socio-environmental actions with active participation of the local community
 through a committee of representatives, thereby fostering follow up activities during construction
 works.

  The ESMP for this AF (LNP II) includes specific environmental and social programs and as well
  as measures for institutional strengthening, that aim both at mitigating the potential negative
  impacts and at maximizing the positive effects of project interventions.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
  on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
  The Municipality of Teresina undertook consultations with the local community to present and

                                           Page 10 of 13
  discuss the proposed interventions during project preparation for this AF

  A public consultation took place on November 4, with previous disclosure of ESA/ESMP to the
  population, in compliance with the WB Safeguard Policies. The following documents were
  prepared and provided:
  �       Executive Summary of Environmental and Social Assessment
  �       Environmental and Social Assessment Report (ESA) and Environmental and Social
  Management Plan (ESMP)
  �       Resettlement Policy Framework

  The document was posted and is available for download on the web-site of the city of Teresina, on
  October 23, 2014 (http://www.teresina.pi.gov.br/). The documents will be available on the website
  on a continuous basis.

  The Municipality widely promoted the public consultation with invitations sent to State and Local
  Public Agencies, Neighborhood Associations (about 100 associations), NGOs, etc.

  On the morning of November 4, 2014, a consultation took place to present the EA/ESMP to the
  Lagoas do Norte Forum, which represents the organized communities associations that live in
  Areas 1, 2, 3 and 4; representatives of 13 out of the 15 community organizations that are part of
  the Forum participated in the discussion. At night of the same day a public consultation was held
  with the public at large at 19:00 p.m. at the Teatro do Boi, with the following dynamics:
  �       Opening with presentation of the goals of consultation, information disclosure and access
  of documents produced.
  �       Introducing the concept of the program and its components;
  �       Disclosure of environmental and social studies (EA/ESMP), and their main conclusions;
  �       Reading and responding to the written questions submitted by the audience;
  �       Space for the audience to pose questions, statements, claims and debate;
  �       Closing.

  The organization team collected the attendance list, video-taped the Public Consultations and
  wrote the “Aide-memoire”. About 180 people attended the event in the evening.

  In general, in both the meeting and the consultation, the audience was very favorable to the
  Program and its components. The environment was positive, constructive and the issues raised had
  the purpose of clarification, suggestions for improvement, etc. The discussions were very
  interesting, with intense audience participation and overall "satisfaction" with the answers
  provided by the representatives from the Municipality.
