                           19.      The development objective of the project is to strengthen accountability and performance of
                           public finance in Sindh Province.

                         following 3 focus areas for which DLIs will be developed.

                         Enhancing Performance of PFM Systems

                         27.      The objective of this sub-component will be to strengthen PFM systems by improving
                         budget execution processes and oversight mechanisms. More specifically, it will aim to improve
                         budget execution and accounting processes by supporting the following activities: (i) update and
                         enforcement of the rules and regulations of the in-year budget adjustments and the use of
                         supplementary budgets; (ii) development and implementation of an internal audit framework and
                         establishment of an internal audit function; (iii) operationalization of commitment accounting and
                         reporting; (iv) expansion of the scope of commitment controls and bank reconciliations; and (v)
                         development of the object classification of the development budget to enable monitoring.

                         28.      The project will also strengthen accountability and oversight systems by (i) establishing
                         budgetary information disclosure mechanisms to strengthen citizen input into the budget process; and
                         (ii) improving the capacity of the Sindh Provincial Assembly to clear the backlog of review of audit
                         reports and prevent the build-up of any new backlogs. The Sindh Finance Department will be
                         supported to publicly disclose all the elements of financial information listed in PEFA such as annual
                         budget documentation, in-year budget execution reports, year-end financial statements, external audit
                         reports, contract awards and resources availability at primary service units. The project will support
                         investment in systems and capacity building within the Finance Department to ensure routine release
                         of up-to-date, accessible and user friendly budget information. In this regard, a key output will be
                         production of a ‘citizens’ budget guide’ explaining in easy terms what the budget is, the allocation
                         and rationale of resources in the current budget, and how citizens can participate in the budget
                         process. Finally, the project will support external academic and other relevant institutions to use this
                         data and provide citizens and government officials with effective analysis of budget information. In
Public Disclosure Copy




                         addition, the project will explore options for strengthening citizen input and feedback related to the
                         budget such as through the use of a citizen’s scorecard.

                         Strengthening of Public Procurement Performance

                         29.      This program is designed to create better data and more transparency and competition in
                         procurement processes through the establishment of an e-Government Procurement (“EGP”) system.
                         Toward this end, this project component involves the necessary analysis and planning to identify
                         required changes for the new technology to be effective, and the implementation of an e-GP Strategy.
                         Specifically, the project will involve a phased-in approach to the following activities: (i) a readiness
                         assessment; (ii) the design, development and commissioning of the e-GP system; (iii) an
                         implementation plan; and (iv) actual launch in 4 target agencies. The approach will be customized
                         and refined for the Sindh context. A brief description of each of the four subcomponents is included
                         in Annex VI. Four targeted agencies will be selected for implementation; and these will be volunteers
                         rather than conscripts, engaged by SPPRA. If possible, strong candidates would be agencies involved
                         in civil works, roads, water supplies, and education. Upon completion, an EGP System will be
                         launched in the targeted agencies.

                         Increasing Revenue Mobilization
                         30.      This area of reform is designed to increase revenues associated with collection of the
                         Services General Sales Tax (SGST) through broadening of the tax base and improving administrative
                         inefficiencies. The Services General Sales Tax has been targeted for reform because it has an up-to-
Public Disclosure Copy




                         date tax structure (more than any other provincial tax) and it is highly automated. Further, the Sindh
                         Revenue Board (“SRB”) is a new entity, and does not have the challenges of legacy institutions. It
                         has strong support of the provincial government and has proven itself as a high performing tax
                         collection agency, positioning itself to be an important change agent for transforming tax collection
                         in Sindh and, potentially, other provinces. Expansion of the SGST base affe cts businesses, not
                         individual tax payers, minimizing the political sensitivity of tax reform. Additionally, the SGST
                         involves no valuation issues or large exemptions, limiting reform complexity and political risk.

                         31.     Activities to be financed using a results-based financing approach include:

                         •        Economic, quantitative, legislative, and political analysis to evaluate tax policy options
                         including review of tax gaps, tax expenditure and exemptions, study of administrative efficiency and
                         identification of untapped revenue potential and enhanced coordination across the three tax entities;
                         •        Human and organizational capacity to support a Provincial Advisory Committee on Tax
                         (PACT) to address tax issues impacting other provinces and the federal government;
                         •        Efficiency analysis related to tax administration; and
                         •        Re-engineering related to reducing the stop filing rate.

                         Component 2: Technical Assistance (TA) to support capacity building and institutional
                         strengthening associated with achievement of eligible PSM reforms (US$5 million)

                         32.      Technical Assistance will be used to support achievement of results in all three eligible PSM
                         reform areas. TA will support capacity building and institutional strengthening activities related to
                         improvement of PFM, procurement, and tax collection. In particular, TA will fund activities to:
                         •        address administrative inefficiencies which limit tax revenue growth;
                         •        provide analytical (economic, quantitative, legislative, and political) and programmatic

                         support to establish a new Tax Policy Unit in the Finance Department which will develop revenue
                         goals and analysis required to support the decision-making process associated with SGST and other
                         tax policy reforms;
                         •        provide programmatic and analytical support to a newly formed Provincial Advisory
                         Committee on Tax (PACT) to enhance revenue mobilization through increased coordination with
                         other provinces and the federal government, as described in Annex VII;
                         •        strengthen monitoring and coordination mechanisms of PFM reform;
                         •        support change management activities to create broad consensus of key stakeholders and
                         identify incentives for successful implementation of this reform;
                         •        establish a dedicated information and communications unit in the lead implementing agency
                         (Finance Department) for donor, media, and civil society relations and engagement, complaints
                         management, and proactive, regular, and wide communication and consultation on the reform
                         agenda;
                         •        strengthen the capacity of the Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority; and
                         •        support achievement of project outcomes.
                         Efforts will be made to utilize an inclusive approach to capacity building and institutional
                         strengthening to ensure strong female representation.

                         33.      Component 2 will include a Rapid Response Facility which provides flexible disbursement
                         for defined eligible activities with the aim of achieving DLIs associated with Component 1. This
                           approach which has worked well in KP, FATA, and Balochistan will create an opportunity to address
                           public management constraints so that the Bank can respond quickly to changes in priorities and
                           policies which may occur during the life of the project. The Fund will have transparent selection

                           criteria; and all public entities will be able to submit proposals on a competitive basis. The entities
                           will be required to develop a brief concept note (CN) with the rationale, the proposed activities and
                           the expected results in terms of public sector management.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           Project activities will be located in Sindh province. Sindh is an urban area with dense population,
                           involving significant environmental and infrastructure footprints. The province is home to a number
                           of protected areas and critical natural habitats. No activity will be conducted inside or in the vicinity
                           of these areas.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           While the implementing agency has no prior experience of working on safeguards compliance, other
                           agencies of the Sindh government in the agriculture, water resources and education sector have been
                           developing and executing projects with extensive safeguards implications. As a result of capacity
                           building on these projects over the years, a cadre of well qualified professional consultants has
                           developed in the province who understand the safeguard policies as well as local environmental and
                           socioeconomic conditions. This resource can be utilized to ensure compliance with safeguards
                           policies if needed. Nomination of a safeguards focal person at the implementing agency and further
                           capacity building measures will be needed to ensure satisfactory compliance.
