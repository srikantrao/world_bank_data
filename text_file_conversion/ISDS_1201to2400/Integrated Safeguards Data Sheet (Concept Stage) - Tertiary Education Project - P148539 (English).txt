                         For Azerbaijan to keep growing, the economy needs a more highly-skilled, highly-educated
                         workforce. Azerbaijan’s economy has been rapidly growing since the mid-2000s, reaching USD
                         7,500 GDP per capita in 2013. International experience shows that as a country’s economy grows
                         over time, different types of jobs are demanded. For instance, the Korean economy was primarily
                         based on agriculture and fishery in the 1960s-1970s, and the majority of the employed were unskilled
                         and skilled craftsmen. As the economy gradually became industrialized in the 1980s to mid-1990s,
                         more technicians and engineers were needed. Since the mid-1990s, white-collar jobs requiring
                         higher-levels of skills and knowledge have been increasingly demanded in the economy. As the labor
                         market demand changes, countries also change their investment-focus in education. Prior to 1975, the
                         Korean government focused on investing in primary education. As the economy became
                         industrialized in the late 1970s-80s, they gradually expanded investment to secondary education.
                         Since the late 1990s, the government has invested more in improving the quality of higher education.
                         Another example is Vietnam. Vietnam’s strong primary education system has contributed to building
                         literacy and numeracy among its workforce. As their economy is shifting from agriculture-based
                         economy to more modern economy, Vietnam is investing more in higher levels of education to
                         develop higher cognitive and technical skills.

                         Key catalysts for the transformation of quality in the education system are higher education
                         institutions. Given the importance of higher education for the economic growth, the proposed Project
                         aims to contribute to meeting this urgent demand in the economy by creating a tertiary education
                         system that is closely linked with the labor market demand. The Project also aims to support the
                         strengthening regional tertiary education institutions to increase access to good quality tertiary
                         education for disadvantaged students in rural areas that is closely linked with the local labor market
                         demand. Such a focus is expected to contribute to sharing the prosperity of Azerbaijan's rapid
                         economic growth nationwide.

                         The Project consists of four components: (i) strengthening the higher education system; (ii) building
                         the capacity of higher education institutions; (iii) strengthening quality and access to tertiary
                         education in a selected region; and (iv) project management and monitoring and evaluation.

                         Component 1: Strengthening the Higher Education System (IBRD: USD 6.6 million)
                         This component supports the system-level capacity building for the Ministry of Education and other
                         relevant agencies dealing with higher education in improving the governance and regulatory
                         framework, strengthening the quality assurance mechanisms, and strengthening the use of higher
                         education financing as a policy instrument.

                         Sub-component 1.1: Improving Higher Education System Governance (IBRD: USD 1.3 million)

                         Vision: The capacity of the Ministry of Education and other relevant agencies dealing with higher
                         education is strengthened, in which autonomy and accountability are well-balanced and in alignment
                         with the Bologna Declaration and international practices.

                         This sub-component will support strengthening the capacities of the MOE and other agencies dealing
                         with higher education in improving the higher education governance framework to create an enabling
                         environment for higher education institutions (HEIs). Activities include:

                         ranking of higher education institutions); and
                         �        Conducting studies as needed by the MOE or other relevant agencies.


                         Sub-component 1.2: Enhancing the External Quality Assurance Mechanisms (IBRD: USD 3.9
                         million)

                         Vision: The higher education degrees and diplomas issued by Azerbaijani institutions are locally and
                         internationally recognized and credible, and offer valid representation of skills and competence.

                         This sub-component supports the establishment of a national quality assurance (QA) body that will
                         exercise the independent decision-making authority for quality assurance for higher education.

                         It is assumed that the MOE establishes a Quality Assurance unit under the MOE by the end of 2014
                         and the EU-funded twinning program will commence in early 2015 and start supporting the
                         development of contents of QA (e.g. Azerbaijan’s National Qualifications Framework (AzQF) for
                         initial and secondary vocational education and training and higher education, QA standards) during
                         2015. This sub-component is designed to build on these initial activities, focusing on the
                         development and implementation of detailed procedures and the provision of training. Activities to
                         be supported include:

                         program accreditation; and
                         �       Supporting the QA unit in being transformed into an independent agency outside the MOE
                         and obtaining a candidate status for the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher
                         Education (ENQA) membership.

                         Sub-component 1.3: Reforming Higher Education Financing (IBRD: USD 1.4 million)

                         Vision: The higher education system is financed at an adequate level through an appropriate mix of
                         public and private funds, in which public funding is utilized, to the extent possible, as a policy
                         instrument to support the Ministry’s strategic and policy objectives, including such things as
                         enhancing equity, improving quality, and enhancing efficiency.

                         The government introduced a per student financing system in 2010 to enhance the quality of higher
                         education. This sub-component supports the MOE in developing and implementing a comprehensive
                         short-term and medium-term higher education financing reform strategy. A reformed financing
                         model will be 1) aligned with the strategic and policy objectives of the MOE, 2) consistent with good
                         international practice, and 3) informed by stakeholders in Azerbaijan’s higher education system. The
                         reform strategy would addresses the following four elements:

                         Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (USD 2.1 million)

                         The MOE, supported by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), will ensure efficient and effective
                         implementation of the project to achieve project objectives, including monitoring and evaluation of
                         the impact of the investment.

                         Component 3 may include physical investments in the selected region to be financed by the
                         government, including campus rehabilitation or extension g and newly developing campus
                         infrastructure. No land acquisition or physical displacement of residents caused by this activity is
                         expected. Institutions for which the proposed Project will provide capacity building support will
                         verify that there is no dispute prior to the project implementation.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed Project will cover reforms of existing higher education institutions nationwide. No
                         land acquisition or physical displacement of residents is expected.
                         The government has planned to improve regional tertiary education institutions. The proposed
                           Project intends to complement to the government's planned investment in infrastructure by providing
                           soft components such as technical assistance to develop curriculum and programs. The location of
                           the region and the scope of infrastructure investment plan (rehabilitation, extension of existing

                           building, etc.) are not decided, but investments will be limited to existing sites. Thus the project will
                           only finance physical investments that do not involve land acquisition or resettlement, and
                           accordingly OP 4.12 would not be triggered.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
                                  The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                      The proposed Project will support the development of tertiary education institutions in a selected
                                      region which may require rehabilitation and/or extension of existing infrastructure, but will not
                                      support any physical works that would require land acquisition or cause involuntary resettlement.
                                      Sites visits and screening will ensure the exclusion of any sites with social safeguards risks.

                                      It has been agreed that potential regional institutions will be selected during project preparation
                                      period. Hence, as soon as the potential regional institutions are selected and the scope of potential
                                      rehabilitation works is identified, the team will request the government to prepare, disclose and
                                      consult site specific EMP checklists prior to the appraisal.
