                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project will have total investment of US $98 million, with US$50 million from the World Bank
                           loan and the other US$48 million from counterpart contributions. The Projectâ€™s Development
                           Objectives is: to improve the quality and relevance of project schools to produce skills that respond
                           to the labor market demand in Xinjiang. The objective will be achieved through project investment in
                           improving the schools overall capacity in delivering TVET, and in enhancing provincial governance
                           and more balanced development of TVET system.
                         C. Project Description
                         The project will have two main components: (i) school-based reform; and (ii) provincial level policy
                         development, school twining partnership, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and project

                         management. School level reforms will improve the quality, relevance of TVET provision in five
                         selected project schools and their respective partner schools through a set of innovations centering
                         around school-industry linkage and competence-based teaching and learning. Provincial level
                         activities will promote project management through knowledge sharing and monitoring and
                         evaluation, and enhance governance through policy making and school twining partnerships.

                         The primary beneficiaries of the project will be the students, especially those who are from poor
                         households in rural areas. As shown in Table 1, 71 percent of project school students are from rural
                         areas. About 60 percent of the students are from poor households who are eligible for subsidies from
                         the government. On average 43 percent of the total number of students are from minority ethnic
                         groups ranging from 30% to 98%. In Xinjiang Uygur Medical College most of the students are from
                         ethnic minority groups. These data shows that the proposed TVET project will meet the education
                         needs from students in poverty, and students from ethnic minority groups is a significant part of the
                         beneficiaries.

                         The students from poor households and ethnic groups will have better employment prospects and
                         higher wage incomes after graduation. Table 2 gives a summary of school-reported employment rates
                         for recent graduates. Therefore, the proposed project will help promote shared prosperity and
                         mitigate income inequality through providing the required skills for students from lower income
                         households and from ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang.

                         Ethnic minorities in the project area will benefit from the educational improvement of the vocational
                         colleges. As illustrated in Table 1 overall 71% of students will be from rural areas with 43% of them
                         part of ethnic groups. During the preparation stage, the task team will among other things discuss
                         with Xinjiang counterpart how to identify culturally sensitive and proper mitigating measures
                           catering to ethnic students like delivery TVET with local language and additional physical facility for
                           ethnic students. By doing so, the project will ensure the inclusion and promotion of ethnic minorities.

                           In particular, the inclusion of the Xinjiang Uygur Medical College into this project demonstrates the
                           project design emphasizes inclusiveness. The Xinjiang Uygur Medical College is the only institute in
                           China aiming at inheriting and developing the Uygur medicine and pharmacy through cultivation of
                           applied technical talents. Uygur m edicine and pharmacy had been recognized as national intangible
                           culture heritage in 2011 due to its long history, high effect, low cost, and wide outreach serving
                           minority people in remote and poor region. In addition to all school reform activities, the project will
                           support the College to translate and publicize some ancient Uygur medical literatures. Hence, the
                           local Uygur people will not only benefit from better health care services from more and higher
                           skilled graduates, but also enjoy the public goods produced by the project.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be carried out in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The project will include five
                           project schools, namely: Xinjiang Agricultural Vocational Technical College, Xinjiang institute of
                           Light Industry Technology; Xinjiang Institute of Engineering; Urumqi Vocational University and
                           Xinjiang Uygur Medical College. The Agriculture College locates at Changji city; the Uygur
                           Medical College locates at Hetian City; the other three colleges locate at Urumqi. The planned civil
                           works consist of the construction of a five or six- floor building for each school on the existing land
                           within the campuses of the 5 schools. The potential environmental impacts would be short-term, site
                           specific, and readily managed with mitigations measures. There are no families and ethnic minority
                           communities on the land and therefore there will be no persons affected by construction under the
                           project on these parcels of land. It is not anticipated that the Bank involuntary resettlement policy OP
                           4.12 would not be triggered for this project. However, a due diligence will be undertaken during
                           project preparation. The Indigenous People policy OP 4.10 is triggered as they represent an important
                           part of project beneficiaries as indicated in Table 1.

                           The World Bank has supported several projects in Xinjiang. However this is the first investment
                           project in education and vocational training there, therefore the institutional capacity for safeguard
                           policies is limited at present. The Project will be managed by the provincial Project Management
                           Office (PMO) established under Xinjiang Education Department. The PMO is staffed with 6 fulltime
                           staff; one staff will be responsible for safeguard-related work. Experienced professional consulting
                           teams will be hired to prepare the assessment of environmental implication of the project, as well as
                           the social study report for Xinjiang Uygur Medical College. The Bankâ€™s safeguards specialists will
                           make extraordinary efforts to help the client to complete the work in a satisfactory manner. Financing
                           will be available during implementation to contract relevant skills to build the capacity of the client
                           with respect to safeguard aspects.
