B. Project Objectives:

This ISDS is for the Kiribati Utility Services Reform Project. The objective of this project is to
assist the Government of the Republic of Kiribati in identifying utility services reform options to
achieve operationally and financially sustainable electricity, water and waste water services in
South Tarawa, Kiribati.

These reforms are aimed at: (a) promoting socio economic development of Kiribati, in
particular, to make available efficient, reliable and affordable utility services; and (b) creating an
operating environment and implementing a business model to encourage innovation and
investment, increase service levels, create jobs, retain skills and reduce costs to achieve
financially sustainable utility services. The refonns are expected to include improving
performance of the existing State Owned Enterprise (SOE), the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and
increasing opportunities for private participation in the delivery of utility services. The reform of
the utility services sector is a priority for the Govennnent of Kiribati (GoK).

C. Project Description:

Technical assistance

This project will be undertaken in two stages. Stage I of the project involves diagnostic analysis,
a performance improvement plan and considerations of preliminary institutional options. The
purpose of the Stage I is to obtain connnitment to the performance improvement plan and seek
guidance on institutional models for further analysis from the GoK. The performance
improvement plan will includes short term opportunities and a medium term plan to address
systemic issues and realize efficiencies to achieve sustainability. The preliminary assessment of
institutional models for the delivery of utility services will include but not be limited to options
for joint venture arrangements, management agreements with third parties, asset sale, or the
partial or full transfer of control to the private sector within the overall context of GoK's SOE
Reform Roadmap. This assessment will also include reconnnendations on options which the
GoK should endorse for detailed assessment.

Stage 2 of the project will involve detailed specification of institutional options, assessment and
reconnnendations. The purpose of Stage 2 is to assist'Govennnent in making a decision on utility
services reform to achieve operational and financial sustainability. The deliverable for Stage 2
will take into account transactional and implementation issues. In addition, Stage 2 will include
social (including gender) and environmental screening as part of the options specification and
recommendations.

D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to th,e safeguard analysis
(if known):

The project will be located on Tarawa Atoll, in Kiribati.

Environmental Assessment (OP!BP 4.01)                                 X

 Stage I report will provide guidance and plans to address systemic issues and realize efficiencies
 in the delivery of utility services. It will include a preliminary assessment of institutional models
 and options for delivering utility services and improving utility performance. It will make
 recommendations to the GoK on the most appropriate options (one for each utility) and seek
 GoK's endorsement for detailed assessment. Subject to agreement by the GoK, Stage 2 of the
 assignment will present detailed specification of institutional options and recommendations to
 assist the Government of Kiribati in making a decision on utility services reform.

 The policy is triggered since Stage 2 of the project will support the development of a
 performance improvement plan (one for each utility) that may lead to the identification and
 implementation of sub projects that may have environment and social impacts. The preparation
 of the performance plan will include screening of environmental and social impacts of priority
 investments included in the plan. The priority investments identified by the Plan and if later
 selected for investment, will be subject to more thorough and separate Environment and Social
 Impact Assessments (ESJA) as part of the detailed feasibility studies of these sub projects I
 investments.

 The proposed study will have no impact on the Tarawa atoll or its surrounding marine
 environment. Therefore the Natural Habitat Policy is not triggered. If, at a later date,
 investments are triggered, then separate environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA)
 will be carried out as part of the detailed feasibility work for these investments.
 Forests (OP!BP 4.36)                                                                X    I

 The Task Team will confirm the presence or absence of IP's in the project area (Tarawa).
 Involuntary Resettlement (OPIBP 4.12)                       I X                      I
  Given that this study may include guidance as to the assessment of feasibility, choice of plans or
  future investments with potential for environmental and social impacts, the Involuntary
  Resettlement policy will be triggered. The preparation of the peiformance plan will include
  screening of potential Involuntary Resettlement impacts of priority investments included in the
I plan and identify any additional assessments required for subsequent investment projects.

 III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

 A. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS: N/A- Technical Assistance
 Report to be prepared.

 B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be
 needed: (the specific studies and their timing should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS).

  The Tenns of Reference (TOR) for the development of the Technical Assistance through the
  Bank-executed project will include initial environment and social screening of options to ensure
  that environmental and social issues and other safeguard requirements fonn part of the criteria
  for inclusion in any recommended investment program. Future implementation of any of the
  recommended investments will require preparation of a more detailed Environmental and Social
· hnpact Assessment (ESIA) to identify and mitigate social and environmental impacts and
  appropriate safeguards instruments.
