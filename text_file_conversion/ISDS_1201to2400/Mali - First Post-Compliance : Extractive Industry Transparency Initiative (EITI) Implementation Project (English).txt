    B. Project Objectives

    1.      The project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of the Mali Extractive Industry
    Transparency Initiative (EITI) multi-stakeholder group and Secretariat to implement the initiative at the
    national and local level.

    C. Project Description

    2.      The recipient executed grant would be funded through the EITI MDTF ($350,000). The
    duration would be an estimated 10 months from the start of effectiveness, but closing date can be no later
    than December 31st, 2015, since this has to comply with the closing of the EITI MDTF.

    Project Components

    1. Component 1 - Strengthening capacity and governance of multi-stakeholder group ($80K):
       The objective of this sub-component is to strengthen the capacity and governance of the EITI
       Secretariat and the multi-stakeholder group. It will include training of EITI MSG members on legal
       and financial structures and mechanisms in Mali, and on internal governance mechanisms for the
       MSG itself. This will include monitoring and evaluation of the EITI process itself, and will aim to
       improve its overall transparency and efficiency. Specific activities will include: (a) developing a
       manual of administrative procedures for the governance and functioning of the MSG; (b) Training
       and study trips for MSG members; and (c) Developing a system to monitor results and analyze
       impact of EITI along the value chain.

    2. Component 2 - Support the implementation of EITI at the sub-national level ($120K): The
       objective of this sub-component is to expand EITI implementation to the sub-national level. This
       component will include the establishment of local EITI committees as well as training and
       awareness-raising at the local level in order to improve awareness, understanding, and use of EITI
       process and reports by local leaders and populations.

    3. Component 3 - Dissemination and communication ($120K): This component will include
       lobbying, media engagement and communications strategies to raise awareness and understanding
       of EITI and to ensure financial stability moving forward.

    4. Component 4 - Program management ($30K): this component will ensure smooth and effective
       implementation of the overall program, transparent and efficient fiduciary operations, and accuracy
       of records and compliance with regulations.

    D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    Project will provide only TA and there are no physical investments on the ground. Trainings will
    take place in Bamako and 5 mining regions with a broad set of stakeholders, including communities and
    civil society and community based organizations and mining companies.
.




    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Management
    The EITI is a global coalition of governments, companies and civil society organizations working
    together to improve openness and accountable management of revenues from natural resources.
    Mali EITI is considered as good practice and was declared compliant in 2013. The Mali EITI and the
    implementing agency (PCU-ESP) is aware of World Bank safeguards policies and is currently
    implementing another category C project (P149445).
