                         The objective of the Project is to promote private sector growth and investment in the non-oil sectors
                         in the Republic of Congo. Itwill focus in particular on SMEs and the Pointe
                         Noire-Brazzaville growth corridor, which is the most important and immediate sourceof economic

                         growth and diversification. Progress made towards the achievement of the Project
                         development objectives will be measured by the following main indicators:
                         (i) Total private investments in non oil sectors along the Pointe Noire # Brazzaville corridor
                         generated by enterprises supported by the project; and
                         (ii) Number of direct jobs created in non oil sectors by enterprises supportedby the project.
                         Proposed New PDO (from Restructuring Paper)
                         The objective of the project is to promote private investment in select non-oil value chain and to
                         support SME development.
                         3. Project Description
                         Component 1: Support to Investment Climate Reform

                         The goal is to help improve the Congoâ€™s business climate in order to attract more international and
                         domestic private investment in non-oil growth sectors. Specific activities will focus on helping
                         accelerate reforms related to the Ease of Doing Business. The country was ranked 183 out of 185
                         countries in the 2013 Doing Business report.

                         Sub-component 1.1: Support to Ease of Doing Business reform process
                         Sub-component 1.2: Institutional Capacity Building


                         Component 2: Support to Value Chain and SME Development

                         Two changes will take place in this component: (i) the initial design of the Matching Grant will
                         change to include small equipment purchases with grant proceeds; and (ii) a Business Plan

                         Competition will be added to promote entrepreneurship.

                         This component aims to promote the competitiveness of six value chains, support SME development
                         and promote entrepreneurship among youth and women in these value chains.

                         Sub-component 2.1: Promote Value Chain Development
                         Sub-component 2.2: Support to Entrepreneurship and SME Growth


                         Component 3: Support CFCO Reform

                         The changes taking place in this component consist of dropping all activities initially planned
                         because the borrower has already funded these activities.

                         Activities in this component included a technical assistance to implement a stabilization plan and
                         PPP strategy. Both had been fulfilled by the client using its own funding.

                         Component 4: Project Coordination and Implementation

                         Institutional arrangements for project coordination and implementation will change. The Ministry of

                                                                      Page 2 of 5
                           Industrial Development and Private Sector Promotion will become the implementing agency instead
                           of the Ministry of Planning as initially set up.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               The proposed project is limited to the provision of technical assistance and is not expected to
                              result in any direct negative environmental impacts.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:

                                                                       Page 3 of 5
                             Even if the project will not have a direct impact as such on the forest, some equipment will have
                           an impact in the timber supply chain.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
Public Disclosure Copy




                           impacts.
                             A negative list for the equipment that could be purchased with project funds will be prepared and
                           will be part of the Project Procedure Manual. The project should avoid purchasing equipment that
                           could serve for large scale logging.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             An Environmental and Social Audit for the railway company, CFCO, was carried out by the
                           Government for the original project, to identify all the key risks which need to be addressed,
                           including: degraded infrastructure (trains and buildings); lack of healthy and safety guidelines;
                           encroachment on the right-of-way; impact of HIV/AIDS on workers and local communities;
                           environmental impacts (air pollution, solid and liquid waste, etc.); certification of timber; and,
                           impacts on Indigenous Peoples and other vulnerable populations. The audit report proposed a
                           series of recommendations to be implemented in the short, medium and long term to mitigate the
                           identified risks, including preparation of an Environmental and Social Management Framework to
                           guide CFCO in its management of all environmental and social issues.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
