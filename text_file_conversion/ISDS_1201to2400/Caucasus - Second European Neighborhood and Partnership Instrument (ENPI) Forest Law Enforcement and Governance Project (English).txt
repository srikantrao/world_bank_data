2. Project Objectives:

The Project will support Georgia and Armenia to strengthen forest governance through
improving implementation of relevant international processes, enhancing their forest policy,
legislation and institutional arrangements, and developing, testing and evaluating sustainable
forest management models at the local level on a pilot basis for future replication.

The three specific Project Development Objectives are to:
   i)      implementation of the 2005 St. Petersburg FLEG Ministerial Declaration and
           ensuring continuation of the process launched in 2005 (regional level),
   ii)     formulation and implementation of sustainable forest sector policies, including legal
           and administrative reforms for sustainable forest management and protection
           (national level), and
   iii)    demonstration of best sustainable forest management practices in targeted areas for
           further replication (sub-national level).
3. Project Description:

Through promoting sustainable forest governance, management, and protection of forests in the
participating countries, the Project will help ensure the contribution of the country’s forests to
climate change adaptation and mitigation, to ecosystems and biodiversity protection, and to
sustainable livelihoods and income sources for local populations and national economies. The St.
Petersburg Declaration on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia,
endorsed by 44 governments and the European Commission in 2005, articulates governments’
commitments to these objectives.

The Project components include: strengthening forest governance through improving
implementation of relevant international processes; enhancing forest policy, legislation and
institutional arrangements; and developing, testing and evaluating sustainable forest management
models at the local level on a pilot basis.

Country specific activities will be designed based on demand and capacity in Georgia and
Armenia and developed during the inception phase (January to March 2014) through coordinated
efforts with other development partners active in the forestry sector, including ADA, Öbf
(Austrian Federal Forests) and GIZ (German Society for International Cooperation).

Specifically the Program activities will focus on:
        support for the development of policy and legislation in Georgia and Armenia
           (including Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment of the Georgian Forest
           Code; participatory processes and stakeholder consultations);
        forest inventory support in Georgia to assist the selected forestry unit in
           implementing the developed Sustainable Forest Management Plan;
        capacity building and training in Georgia and Armenia (including support to local
           administrations of the Agency of Protected Areas (APA) in sustainable management
           of APA forests through conducting forest-specific training for APA rangers; media
           tour and training of journalists);
        forest case studies in Georgia (e.g. assessment of different options for usage of
           sawdust aiming at reducing pressure on timber forest resources);
        pilot activities for sustainable forest management in Georgia and Armenia (including
           conducting forest restoration in sub-alpine mountain forests in the selected region
           (Ajara) in Georgia; conducting assessment of the usage of energy sources by local
           population with special focus on usage of firewood and its share in total energy
           consumption in Georgia; mapping, clarification of boundaries of the Ijevan sanctuary
           in Armenia; alternative livelihoods activities aimed at sustainable use of forests,
           including support to development and implementation of forest-based tourism and
           other projects in selected communities);
        public awareness and dissemination of results in Georgia and Armenia (including
           awareness raising campaign among local population on usage of energy sources; road
           shows in forest-dependent communities in Armenia).

In addition, the Project consists of:
     Overall Project Management by the Program Management Team
      Ensuring compliance with World Bank and ADA safeguard policies
      Quality control of Project deliverables
      Project reporting and monitoring of the results framework indicators
      Coordinating national work plans.

Gender aspects will be monitored as part of the World Bank core sector indicator on forest users
trained. Gender will also be taken into consideration through the SESAF process, which screens
for gender issues. The overall Project communications will include relevant gender issues as
applicable.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Activities to be supported under the Project are aimed at enhancing sustainability of forest use
and therefore, are expected to mainly have positive or in some instances a neutral impact on the
natural environment. While the new forestry legislation to be developed with Project support
could have a wide range of indirect and long term social and environmental impacts, both
positive and negative, the proposed pilot activities may generate some direct site specific and
mostly temporary by nature environmental impacts related to biodiversity loss, water pollution,
waste management, etc.
Taking these potential impacts into account, the Project was assigned to Category B.
The project triggers a series of the WB OPs and in particular the following: (a) OP 4.01 - as it
might generate a series of direct and indirect social and environmental impacts specified above;
(b) OP 4.09 - as the new forestry legislation might specify new requirements related to Pest
Management. Furthermore, the pilot activities might require purchasing or use of agrochemicals
for forestry and nursery activities; (c) OP 4.11 - as the new forestry legislation to be developed
and/or pilot activities can touch upon the issues of Physical Cultural Resources; (d) OP 4.36 - as
the new legislation would include a series of issues provided in this OP and in particular with
regard to wood harvesting; (e) OP 4.04 – as the forestry legislation to be developed alogn with
the pilot activities most probably would relate to and might generate some direct and indirect
impacts on Natural Habitats; and (f) OP 4.12 – as designing new forestry legislation or
implementing pilot activities on the ground might include provisions and/or restrict access of the
local population to forestry resources or other involuntary resettlement issues.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

The indirect and long term impacts of this Project are all expected to be positive, stemming from
improved National Forest Management Systems and improved Forest Governance and Law
Enforcement in Georgia and Armenia.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

To address safeguards issues, a Strategic Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
Framework (SESAF) was developed for the purposes of implementing the EC-funded FLEG II
Program, which will be fully applied to the ADA-funded Project. The SESAF: (1) identifies the
types of environmental and social issues that are likely to be associated with the policy
documents supported by the Project and (2) provides guidance on how these aspects should be
integrated in to the analytical and decision-making processes, including guidelines for strong and
effective stakeholder participation. The overall SESAF objective is that all policy documents that
are supported under this Project will be environmentally and socially sound and sustainable,
consistent with the WB safeguard policies. The SESAF document provides main provisions of
all triggered WB OPs (see section A1 above) and recommendations for integrating their
requirements into the policy documents to be supported.

For the purpose of the Environmental Assessment (EA) of pilot projects an Environmental
Assessment and Management Framework (EAMF) outlines: (i) procedures to assess the potential
environmental impacts of the Project activities, as well as the corresponding mitigation
requirements; (ii) details on procedures, criteria, and responsibilities for activities’ screening;
(iii) requirements for the preparation of the EIA and/or EMP, where applicable; and (iv) roles
and responsibilities with regard to EMF implementation and reporting. A special focus of the
EAMF is on potential impacts of the pilot activities on natural habitats, on the health of forests
and physical cultural resources and what are the necessary measures for identifying them as well
as mitigation and monitoring activities. The EAMF also provides the requirements with regard to
EA disclosure and public consultation.

While the project triggers the OP 4.09 it doesn’t require a special Pest Management Plan as at
this stage it is not known if activities to be supported will relate to its issues. Instead the EAMF
includes main provisions of this OP and requirements for such PMP in the case needed.
Similarly, while the OP 4.36 is triggered, the project doesn’t include a special sector-wide
analysis of policy and institutional issues and constraints of the forestry sectors in participating
countries as at this stage of the project development it is not know which concrete activities will
be supported. At the same time the EAMF provides main requirements for such analysis as well
as relevant recommendations with regard to what should be reflected in the SEA document.

In addition, a Process Framework (PF) for potential access restrictions guides the mitigation of
potential negative impacts on the livelihoods on population’s resident near and/or within the
location of implementation of certain activities under the Project.
The SESAF, EAMF and PF are mandatory documents for WWF and IUCN under the proposed
grants, which will be applied when conducting the environmental and social assessment.
Responsibility for ensuring that the SESAF and EAMF are implemented correctly will lie with
the National Program Advisory Committee. The Bank, IUCN and WWF will employ safeguards
/ Quality Control Specialist in Georgia and Armenia to review terms of reference, screen all
outputs for both quality and potential safeguards issues, and ensure that appropriate mitigation
measures are followed when necessary. These Specialists will provide guidance and will
conduct the formal review of policy and legal documents prepared under the Project, then submit
the documents and his/her recommendations to the NPACs in Georgia and Armenia for their
final review and acceptance. The specialists will also be responsible for reporting to the Bank on
the SESAF and EAMF implementation and on the outcomes of the review process. Special
training has been given to IUCN and WWF Safeguards / Quality Control Specialists and to
selected NPAC members in Georgia and Armenia, to build capacity with regard to safeguards
issues.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The SESAF, EAMF and PF are freestanding documents that have been disclosed and consulted
at National Program Advisory Committee (NPAC) meetings, which have civil society
representation, within Georgia and Armenia. The documents are available in English on IUCN’s
website at http://www.iucn.org/about/union/secretariat/offices/europe/work/?4363/ENPI-FLEG-
Program and WWF’s website at
http://wwf.panda.org/what_we_do/where_we_work/black_sea_basin/caucasus/projects/enpi_fleg
_caucasus/ and in the WB Infoshop.
