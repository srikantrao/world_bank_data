                           11.     The objective of the Project will be to improve efficiency in the financing and delivery of
                           health services through greater integration of the health care delivery system.
                           C. Project Description
                           The hospital information system (HIS) already exist in half of all aimag and regional hospitals, which
                           use the Mongolian language and are appropriate in the Mongolian context. The proposed Project
                           seeks to build on the existing situation, while taking advantage of innovative, cloud-based
                         technologies, through the “wrapping? of the existing systems with appropriate middleware to enable
                         them to communicate in a single language with an interface layer. A major innovation will involve
                         the creation of a Health Information Exchange Cloud, where a directory of hospital episodes and

                         information will be chronicled for access by other institutions in a highly controlled and confidential
                         manner.

                         Component 1: Health Information Standards. This component seeks to contribute to the standards
                         through the completion of the Health Data Dictionary (HDD), since any effort to foster
                         communication and interoperability between different components of health information systems
                         needs for the components to speak a “common language?. Work on developing the HDD has already
                         begun under a World Bank grant for e-health development; the proposed Project will continue to
                         develop this under the Project. The task of maintaining and enforcing the use of the HDD and
                         certifying systems as “Mongolia HDD compliant? will be an ongoing activity supported under this
                         component.

                         Component 2: Health Information Exchange Platform (HIEP). Using the language developed under
                         Component 1, the proposed Project will support the building of an integration platform which will
                         allow various HIS to communicate with each other. Two key elements of Component 2 are (a) the
                         messaging platform; and (b) a shared clinical summary profile. The former will provide a common
                         interface layer to improve communication regarding referrals, order diagnostic tests between
                         facilities and send diagnostic test results back to the ordering provider, send statistical reports to H-
                         Info, and report quality related information to MOH. The platform would also facilitate the
                         exchange of key clinical data between facilities involved in the care of the same patient, or when
                         patients present themselves at a facility. The platform will use web-based, and cloud-based
                         technologies. After successful testing of the system, it will be piloted in three sub-systems: (a) Khan
                         Uul District in Ulaanbaatar connecting the District General Hospital and its Family Health Centers
                         and Maternal Hospital No. 1; (b) Songinohairkhan District in Ulaanbaatar, connecting the new
                         general hospital currently under construction, the District Public Health Center, its polyclinic
                         (ambulatory center #4) and its Family Health Centers; and (c) Orkhon aimag, connecting the

                         Regional Diagnostic and Treatment Centre and two soum hospitals. The feasibility of expanding the
                         coverage will be explored during implementation.

                         Component 3: National Health Information Center (NHIC). Component 3 will support the
                         establishment and operational support of a semi-autonomous center, which oversees all aspects of e-
                         health and health information in Mongolia, and creates an environment conducive for training and
                         research. The NHIC is expected to become the focal point for: the procurement, implementation,
                         training, research, maintenance and support of Mongolia’s e-health system, the ownership and
                         maintenance of the HDD, and other standards-based artifacts, and potential regulatory changes which
                         will be needed.

                         Component 4: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. This component will build the
                         necessary human capacity for the successful implementation and institutionalization of e-health in
                         Mongolia. Financing will be provided for improving the computer literacy of health services
                         providers through training in a variety of subjects. Support for the consultants necessary for Project
                         management, and incremental operating costs associated with the Project are also provided under this
                         Component. Preliminary technical assistance needs anticipated include areas such as procurement,
                         financial management, and monitoring and evaluation.

                               This will be the first World Bank project in the health sector in Mongolia, and the Project
                               Management Office (PMO) is obviously not familiar with World Bank Safeguard Policies. The team
                               will assist the PMO to engage qualified staff and provide relevant training to enable smooth
                               safeguard preparation and implementation, if necessary.
