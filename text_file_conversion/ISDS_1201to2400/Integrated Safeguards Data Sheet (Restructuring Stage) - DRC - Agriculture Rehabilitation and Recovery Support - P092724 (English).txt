﻿2. Current Project Development Objectives
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase agricultural productivity and improve
marketing of crops, and animal products by smallholder farmers in t
argeted areas.
Proposed New PDO (from Restructuring Paper)
O
The project development objective (PDO) is to increase agricultural productivity and improve
marketing of crops, and animal products by smallholder farmers in t
argeted areas.
3. Project Description
The project includes three components focusing on activities to: (i) improving agricultural and
animal production; (ii) marketing infrastructure improvement; an                   d
(iii) capacity building support of the Ministry of Agriculture (MinAgri) and M
inistry of Rural Development (MDR) to deliver key services at central and provin
cial levels, and project management.
Component 1 seeks to address efficiency bottlenecks in on-farm and off-farm production activities
and enhance the productive capacity of participating household
farmers in farming and product processing. It will also support government in t
he formulation of new strategies for promoting agro-industries, as well as devel
op the capacities of producers organizations;
Component 2 supports rehabilitation of the irrigation infrastructure in the Pool Malebo for rice
production and rehabilitation or construction of feeder roads a                  nd
markets in Equateur province to connect agricultural production zones to mark
ets; and
Component 3 provides for selected support to the ministry of agriculture restructuring program in
complement to other financing as well as institutional support                   to the
ministry of rural development and project management and monitoring and
O
evaluation.
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The project area covers primarily the portion of the Equateur Province located north of the Congo
River, and comprising nine territories within three districts.                 In
addition, the project includes irrigation activities at Pool Malebo, a seaso
nal swamp area located in the vicinity of Kinshasa. The choice of Equateur Provi
nce as the core project area was the result of (i) findings from the Bank's Agri
cultural Sector Review that considers this province among the country's five are
as with high agricultural potential, high population density, and high market ac
cess; and (ii) a strong request from authorities to restore the productive capac
ity of this area which has good potential for export crops development such as r
ubber, and cacao, but has been underserved by donors compared to other
provinces

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
0
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
O
The investments to be supported by this project have been screened for safeguards. The proposed
project is rated category B and is not expected to induce signif
icant adverse environmental and social impacts. While the physical works will be
limited to rehabilitation of existing roads, markets, and irrigable perimeters,
it is possible that there are some encroachments, which may require compensatio
n under (OP/BP 4.12). Because of this, an Involuntary Resettlement Framework has
been prepared. Cultural resources such as sacred trees, sacred grooves are like
ly to be encountered and be adversely affected in the project areas inhabited by
the Bambenga indigenous people, that is an additional rational that triggering
the Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) policy.
Also, the project will use limited agro-pesticides for which a Pesticide Management Framework
has been prepared. The project will not support activities inside
the national parcs, but may support some activities around them. Since the proje
ct supports rehabilitation of irrigable perimeters on a small basin that is floo
ded annually by the Congo River, OP 7.50 applies and is triggered. However, an e xception to the
notification requirement is applied as provided for under paragr aph 7(a) of the Policy for projects
involving additions or alterations of ongoin g schemes that in the judgment of the Bank will not

﻿adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to other riparians, and will not be
adversely affect ed by other riparians possible water use. OP/BP 4.04 on natural habits is not tr
iggered because the wetlands at Pool Malebo do not have characteristics consiste nt with critical
natural habitats and are already under cultivation.
O
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:
0
None
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
None
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Ministry of Agriculture prepared four safeguards instruments (frameworks): (a) the
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF); (b) the Pesticide Man
agement Plan; (c) the Resettlement Policy Framework(RPF); and (d) the Indigenou
s Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF).
The capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture to address safeguards issues is non-existent. Given
that, safeguards issues are the exclusive domain of the Ministry                    of
Environment. Accordingly, compliance with project safeguards requirements wi
11 be ensured by staff from the Ministry of Environment, through the Groupe d'Et
udes Environementales du Congo (GEEC). Supervision will be ensured by a safeguar
d specialist to be posted in one of the decentralized project coordination unit
and the delegated management contractor meant to manage the infrastructure compo
nent to be recruited by the project. The safeguard specialist and the firm will
provide regular supervision of the implementation of agreed mitigation measures
and provide technical assistance as needed. In addition, the Minsitry of Agricul
ture, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environement, will prepare and make
public on an annual basis, a brief summary report that describes how it is "perf orming" with
respect to addressing the environmental and social issues raised by the project.
O
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are the agricultural households and the pygmies in the northern Equateur
province and the Pool Malebo, local governments, community based o
rganizations (CBOs) and the NGOs that will work with the project. The design of
the ARRSP project was participatory at several levels: at national, donor commun
ity, regional, local government,and local community levels. The focus of the con
sultations was to assess the viability of the project, identify potential areas
of conflict between stakeholders, and define areas of collaboration.
