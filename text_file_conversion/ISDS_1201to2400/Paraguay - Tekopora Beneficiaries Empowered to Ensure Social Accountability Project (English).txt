II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary ofKey Safeguard Issues
 I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project will not finance any physical activities. No risks related to environmental or social
safeguards policies are anticipated during implementation of project activities. Targeted areas
have some presence of Indigenous Peoples; however, these families are not targeted directly by
the CCT program (Tekopora). The Government has another social protection program that
includes conditional cash transfers for indigenous population ("Plan Integral para los Pueblos
Indigenas"). If households with presence of indigenous population are included in the sample,
CIRD has agreed to ensure that all relevant documentation and information will be translated to
Guarani to facilitate the participation of these households, including the use of Guarani speaking
surveyors.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
 N/A

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
 NIA

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of bmTower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:




                                                3
This project is not expected to trigger any safeguards policies as the project screening identified
minimal environmental or social risks related to project activities. Hence the project is assigned
the Environmental Category C, requiring no further environmental and social assessment.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The Project's direct beneficiaries include: 88,000 extreme poor households, in 15 of the 17
provinces, in 90 out of the 240 existing municipalities in the country. These households are
already part ofTekopora CCT Program and will benefit from the immediate improvements in the
program and from better understanding their responsibilities regarding the compliance of
conditions.

The Project's indirect beneficiaries include: (I) Paraguayan citizens, who will benefit from
success of the program as it will increase the socio-economic opportunities of 200,000 extreme
poor families, enabling them to better contribute to the overall development of Paraguay; (2)
SAS, who will benefit from the information as it will help to strengthen the management of the
program; deliver better results; increase support for the expansion of the program; and provide
sound information for budget allocation and negotiation; (3) MEC and the MSPBS, who will
benefit from better understanding the gaps in the supply side of the program, to better allocate
budget and improve policy decisions; (4) Ministry of Finance and government agencies, who
will use the information to improve budget allocation and to better monitor the use of funds
linked to Tekopora.
