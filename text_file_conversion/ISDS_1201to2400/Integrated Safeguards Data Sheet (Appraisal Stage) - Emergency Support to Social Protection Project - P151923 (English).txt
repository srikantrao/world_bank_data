                         The proposed Emergency Support to Social Protection Project (ESSPP) will finance cash assistance
                         to poor families in Yemen through the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) cash transfer program. The
                         project has two components: (i) Support to SWF Cash Transfer Program; and (ii) Project
                         Management and Monitoring. The total estimated cost for the proposed project is US$140.47 million
                         equivalent. IDA will provide US$110 million equivalent under an IDA grant-based Investment
                         Project Financing (IPF) instrument. There will be additional funding of US$ 28.47 million from the
                         United States (U.S.) Treasury and US$2 million government co-financing. The IDA and U.S.
                         Treasury funds will be fully fungible in so far as they are used for cash transfers to the poor, for
                         which 100 percent of the latter will be used. The Government financing will be used for the
                         recertification survey. The project will be implemented over a period of 18 months.
