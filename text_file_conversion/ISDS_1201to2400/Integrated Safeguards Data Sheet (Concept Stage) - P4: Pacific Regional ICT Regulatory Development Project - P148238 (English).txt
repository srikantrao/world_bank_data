                           10.     The development objective of the Project is to strengthen the capacity of the Pacific ICT
                           Regulatory Resource Centre (PIRRC) to deliver timely and relevant knowledge and technical
                           expertise to Pacific regulatory institutions and enhance regional collaboration on regulatory issues.
                           11.     The direct beneficiaries of the Project will be the PIRRC and its members, the regulatory
                           agencies in the Pacific region with responsibility for the ICT sector. Indirect beneficiaries will
                         include individuals, businesses (including telecommunications operators), government agencies and
                         remote communities who will receive improved ICT services as a result of enhanced regulatory
                         outcomes.

                         C. Project Description
                         The proposed Project is an IDA regional grant of US$4.5 million to the University of the South
                         Pacific (USP) to manage a Pacific ICT Regulatory Resource Centre. USP is the region’s premier
                         academic institution, established in 1968. During Project identification the World Bank confirmed
                         that USP is a regional organization that meets the eligibility requirements to receive IDA grants and
                         that funds could be provided directly to USP. The Project will support the transition from PIRRC as a
                         Bank-executed TA activity to a Recipient-executed knowledge institution. The Project will finance
                         (a) the operation and management of the PIRRC; (b) knowledge dissemination and coordination
                         among regulators, including training and capacity-building activities, collecting, analyzing and
                         improving access to industry statistics and data; and (c) the establishment and disbursement of an
                         advisory services fund which will be used to help regulators access specialist assistance on issues
                         with a regional dimension. National regulators will join PIRRC for modest annual membership fees.
                                  1. Description
                         Component 1. PIRRC Operations, Knowledge Management and Capacity-Building (US$2.5
                         million). This component will finance:
                         (a) a Centre Director over a five year period. The Director will have deep sector/regulatory
                         knowledge and be responsible for development and supervision of annual work plans, preparation of
                         annual reports, providing a discussion forum for regulators, coordination with USP and the Steering
                         Committee, stakeholder outreach, and managing the PIRRC technical and administrative staff/
                         consultants. The Director will also be responsible for leading regulatory knowledge management,
                         managing the Advisory Services Fund and ensuring that its outputs are broadly disseminated and
                         translated into best practice statements.
                         (b) short-term technical specialists (economic, legal, engineering) to support the Center Director,
                         especially in delivering core knowledge advisory services, training and development, including:
                         preparation of "best practice" models; collecting, analyzing and publishing industry statistics and

                         data (e.g., access and service level penetration, international connectivity, investment levels, industry
                         revenues, standard license terms, spectrum management, broadband service levels, access prices,
                         retail prices, quality of service).
                         Component 2. Advisory Services Fund (US$1.5 million). This will provide financing for quick-
                         response advice in the form of short-term consultancy or training to regulators on legal, economic,
                         financial and technical issues in the ICT sector that have regional significance or offer a regional
                         learning experience. The Fund will be available to support the provision of this on-demand assistance
                         to any two or more regulators. It is envisaged that a small co-contribution (approximately 10 percent)
                         may be required from regulators to increase the leverage of the fund and promote ownership of issues
                         by regulators accessing the fund. The fund may not be used to help finance the procurement of
                         technical assistance in relation to any litigation.
                         Component 3. Project Administration (US$0.5 million). This component will finance staff to
                         undertake day to day Project administration, including procurement, financial management,
                         communications and outreach and audit.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The Project will be located at the offices of the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji.
