                         Sub-component 1.1: Rehabilitation of Ashnak substation of High Voltage Electric Networks
                         (HVEN). This sub-component will help reducing the number of equipment failures caused by
                         technical reasons, and, thus, improve the reliability of power transmission network. This 220/110/10
                         kV substation is essential for ensuring reliable power supply to consumers in Eastern and North-
                         Eastern parts of Armenia, including a large dairy products company, an asphalt plant, and a diamond
                         polishing and jewelry production factory, which employ around 3,500 people.

                         This sub-component will finance replacement of all key plant and equipment in the substation,
                         including, but not limited to: complete rehabilitation of 220 kV OSY and 110 kV OSY; replacement
                         of main transformers; complete rehabilitation of 10 kV cubicles and the associated building;
                         installation of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA) and replacement of
                         protection relays, replacement of house transformers; and construction of a new building for control
                         rooms. HVEN will implement this sub-component.

                         Sub-component 1.2: Rehabilitation of YTPCâ€™s substation. This sub-component will help reducing the
                         incidence of equipment failures at 220/110/35 kV YTPC substation. The substation is used for
                         evacuation of electricity from the modern and efficient CCGT plant with 240 MW of installed
                         capacity. The existing CCGT plant at YTPC accounts for 20 percent of the total annual electricity
                         generation in the country. Therefore, it is essential for ensuring adequate and low-cost electricity
                         supply to all of the 1,040,000 electricity consumers in the country.

                         This sub-component will finance replacement of all key plant and equipment in the substation,
                         including, but not limited to: rehabilitation and expansion of 220 kV Open Switchyard (OSY) and
                         rehabilitation of 110 kV OSY; installation of new main transformers; installation of SCADA and

                         replacement of protection relays; construction of a new building for control rooms in OSY;
                         reconnection of disconnected OTLs required for evacuation of power from YTPC. YTPC will
                         implement this sub-component

                         Sub-component 1.3: Project implementation support to HVEN. This will include support in technical
                         supervision of rehabilitation works at Ashnak substation.

                         Sub-component 1.4: Project implementation support to YTPC. This will include support in technical
                         supervision and safeguards compliance of rehabilitation works at YTPC substation.

                         Component 2: Improvement of the power system management. This component will finance:

                         Sub-component 2.1: Establishment of a back-up dispatch center. Establishment of a back-up dispatch
                         center will allow improving the management of the power system. Specifically, it is important for
                         ensuring continuous management and control of the power system in case the primary dispatch
                         center (located in down-town Yerevan) fails due to technical or other reasons. In 2012-2014, the
                         primary dispatch power system was down an average of 22 minutes per year.

                         The back-up dispatch center will allow to immediately restoring the control and management of the
                         power system in case of such failure. If the operation and management of the system is not restored,


                                                                     Page 2 of 8
                         then it may jeopardize reliability of power system operation, which may cause electricity supply
                         outages. The proposed back-up dispatch center will be located in an existing building owned by the
                         MENR.

                         This sub-component will finance renovation of the interior space, procurement and installation of the
                         mimic board, primary and back-up servers, fiber-optic connection with the nearest Haghtanak
                         substation, and other civil works and equipment required for a back-up dispatch center. HVEN will
                         implement this sub-component.

                         Sub-component 2.2: Construction of a new administrative building for HVEN. Construction of a new
                         administrative building will enable HVEN to improve the efficiency of its operations because current
                         administrative building has a very limited space with an average office area of 5 square meters per
                         person (no overstaffing at HVEN) and limited space for transmission system control and
                         management systems. This results in overcrowded offices and low productivity, which impacts the
                         efficiency of operations.

                         The construction of administrative building will be done on an existing land plot belonging to HVEN
                         nearby the existing administrative building. It will include construction of 3-4 story building to
                         provide enough space for staff, equipment, and other functions. HVEN will implement this sub-
                         component. Specifically, HVEN will finance from its own funds preparation of the design, bills of
                         quantities, and bidding documents for the works. The loan proceeds will be used to finance only the
                         construction works and purchase of office equipment and accessories.

                         Component 3: Preparation of a new electricity generation project. This component will finance:

                         Sub-component 3.1: Preparation of a new CCGT project. The power system will need around 500
                         MW of new gas-fired generation capacity to preclude the emergence of a supply capacity gap by
                         2020. The new CCGT is part of the Governmentâ€™s least-cost power supply plan until 2030. The
                         Government plans to construct the new CCGT with private sector involvement, which will require a

                         number of preparatory activities for which no financing is available.

                         This sub-component will include support for preparation of a bankable feasibility study,
                         environmental and social impact assessment, transaction advisory and other technical assistance
                         required for preparation of a new CCGT project. YTPC will implement this sub-component.

                         Sub-component 3.2: Project audit. This will include financing of project audits. HVEN will be
                         responsible for the selection of the auditor. Consolidation of the project annual financial statements
                         to be audited will be made by HVEN based on inputs provided by YTPC.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
Public Disclosure Copy




                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The project is not expected to have significant irreversible impact on the natural environment and
                              is therefore classified as environmental Category B. All proposed works will be undertaken within
                              the footprint of the existing infrastructure. Rehabilitation of substations may result in generation of
                              hazardous waste, such as replaced acid batteries and used transformer oils potentially containing
                              PCBs. Waste disposal is a generally challenging task in Armenia due to lack of adequate
                              infrastructure and effective control mechanisms. Some types of hazardous waste, including
                              replaced acid batteries and transformer oils, are being put in storage until the Government finds
                              acceptable and affordable solutions for their permanent disposal. Site-specific Environmental
                              Management Plans (EMPs) developed for works at the beneficiary substations provide detailed
                              information on the conditions of the allocated on-site storage facilities and lay out instructions for
                              safe storage.

                              Small scale civil works for the arrangement of premises for the back-up dispatch center of EPSO
                              and construction of an administrative building for HVEN will be undertaken within fenced plots
                              belonging to beneficiary institutions which urban setting, with minimal likelihood of any
                              environmental and social impacts that will be addressed by adhering to simplified checklist EMPs
                              prepared for these works and by applying general good construction practice.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities

                                                                          Page 5 of 8
                           in the project area:
                           The social impact of this project is positive as it will improve the reliability of electricity supply in
                           the country, enhance power system management, and support the Government efforts in ensuring

                           adequate electricity supply. The project will create benefits for all energy consumers in the
                           country, including vulnerable and impoverished households. Temporary positive impacts will also
                           include economic benefits through the employment of local people during construction work. It
                           should be noted that improvement of electricity supply reliability will be especially beneficial for
                           people who spend most of their time at home such as the elderly, children and women as well as
                           those who have the primary responsibility for cooking and cleaning, typically women.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           HVEN developed EMPs for works planned at the Ashank substation, YTPC substation,
                           administrative building of HVEN and establishment of back-up dispatch center. The project will
                           be implemented by HVEN (works at the Ashnak substation) and by YTPC (works at the YTPC
                           substation). HVEN is an implementing agency for the ongoing Electricity Supply Reliability
                           Project (ESRP), under which it will receive capacity-building on managing environmental and
                           social aspects of its activities. HVEN uses consultant services for day-to-day supervision of
                           safeguards under ESRP, and will use services of a hired safeguards specialist for the purposes of
                           ETNIP. TOR for the consultant was shared with the Bank. YTPC has not been previously involved
                           in implementation of Bank-supported projects and has no in-house capacity to manage application
                           of safeguard policies. Administration of YTPC will be obligated to hire and maintain an
                           environmental consultant of with the background and skills adequate for ensuring good
                           environmental performance during works at the substation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure

                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           HVEN, administrations of individual power substations, and all electricity consumers in Armenia
                           supplied with substations targeted under ETNIP are key beneficiaries and stakeholders of the
                           project.

                           The project will support widespread stakeholder information-sharing and consultation. The project
                           activities and potential risks will be communicated in a transparent manner. The project will
                           promote gender-sensitive consultation mechanisms at all stages. A grievance redress mechanism
                           will also be in place to support citizen engagement with the project. This GRM will be operated by
                           HVEN for both substations and allow project affected people and other interested stakeholders to
                           submit all types of complaints, suggestions, or questions related to the project.

                           All EMPs drafted during the project preparation were disclosed in Armenian and English
                           languages through sending hard copies to communities and posting on the web-site of HVEN and
                           MENR. EMPs for the rehabilitation of power substations and for construction of the back-up
                           dispatch center and administrative building of HVEN were open for the feedback from potentially
                           affected communities by advertising locations for accessing hard copies of these documents and
                           contact information for submitting questions and comments. Finalized versions of all safeguard
                           documents were re-disclosed on January 30, 2015 along with documentation on public
                           consultation process.
