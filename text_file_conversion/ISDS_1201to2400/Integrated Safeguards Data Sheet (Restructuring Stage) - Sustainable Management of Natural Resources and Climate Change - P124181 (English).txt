                         MGAP is promoting an innovative approach to management of natural resources and reduced impact
                         of climate variability in agriculture while improving agricultural competitiveness. Without such
                         integrated approach, climate change in the anthropogenic impacts on the country's natural resources
                         could result in accelerated degradation. The project intends to make agriculture in Uruguay more
                         productive                                    and more sustainable as a key to achieve a "green
                         growth" path and contribute to its climate change adaptation and mitigation priorities. The proposed
                         components would support policies and actions that make the environment a potential source of
                         growth from efficiency, innovation, and resilience to climate variability and change. In addition, the
                         proposed project will support the deployment of a #Climate Smart Agriculture# approach, which is a
                         core component of such growth, by promoting agricultural systems that can enhance productivity,
                         improve sustainable development and resilience, and support low carbon growth. The Project will
                         undertake a holistic landscape approach to land and water management, forestry, pastures, livestock,
                         ecosystem services and adaptation to climate change. Accordingly, the project will represent a
                         pioneering pilot approach and a unique opportunity to disseminate lessons and share country
                         experiences and information on emerging applications in the areas of climate-smart agriculture and
                         risk management in the Latin America region.

                         The project objective would be achieved through the following four components:

                          Component 1: Establishment of an Agricultural Information and Decision Support System (IDSS)
                         (Total cost $6.5 million of which $5.2m would be financed by IBRD and the balance by GOU). This
                         component would finance the creation of an online agriculture and climate information platform,
                         namely the Agricultural Information and Decision Support System (IDSS) that will integrate,
                         synthesize, and generate critical and timely information in relation to natural resource management,
                         short and medium term climate forecast as well as potential long term changes and impacts. Key

                         outcomes of this component are: a) integrated climate and agriculture information and decision
                         support systems accessible to different users; b) expanded overall sector information to enable
                         MGAP to improve the targeting of it s future programs, including activities financed under
                         Component 2 of the project; c) identification of vulnerabilities and potential opportunities for natural
                         resources management and agricultural production systems due to climate variability; d)
                         quantification of uncertainties in climate information to increase confidence in the use of that
                         information; e) identification of technologies and methodologies that enhance the outcomes of on-
                         farm investments and reduce vulnerabilities to extreme climatic events; f) wider use of insurance to
                         cover climatic risks; g) identification of climate smart interventions and best practices, and h)
                         improved exchange of Uruguayan experience related to climate change mitigation and adaptation
                         measures with other countries, mainly through South-South exchanges.

                          Component 2: On Farm Investments for "Climate-Smart" Agriculture and Livestock Management
                         (Total cost $32.2 million of which $30.9 million would be financed by IBRD, and $1.3 million by
                         counterpart funds. This component would be implemented by MGAP's Rural Development
                         Directorate (DGDR) and would finance demand-driven subprojects presented by family producers
                         and medium-size farmers, with emphasis on on-farm investment proposals that would: a) reduce
                         farm vulnerability to extreme climatic events; b) improve farm productivity and sustainability; c)
                         increase the availability of water resources for irrigation and livestock consumption ; d) promote
                         adoption of an integrated approach to natural resources management practices in agriculture and

                                                                       Page 2 of 7

                         of beneficiary and subproject eligibility criteria to screen investment proposals have been developed
                         and included in the Project Manual, a condition for Negotiations. In addition to technical assistance,
                         the project would provide training to farmers, regardless of their size, and to rural workers engaged
                         in natural resources management activities. Farmers# organization would receive institutional
                         strengthening to enhance their capabilities to assist their membership in the implementation of
                         natural resources management and climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Key
                         outcomes of this component are: (i) the adoption of integrated natural resources management
                         practices and adaptation measures, with particular emphasis on increased on-farm availability of
                         water and improve d water resources management, to improve the long-term sustainability of farmers
                         # production systems as well as their resilience to extreme climatic events; (ii ) the implementation of
                         pilot investments aimed at mitigating emissions and increasing utilization of biomass for energy
                         generation; and (iii) by promoting investments that internalize the extreme climatic variability, the
                         project would minimize long term costs, enhance farm productivity, and reduce overall vulnerability.

                          Component 3: Capacity Building and Training (Total cost of $11.1 million, of which $9.3 million
                         would be financed by IBRD and $1.8 million by GOU). This component would finance activities
                         aimed at strengthening the capacity of farmers to address integrated natural resource and water
                         management approaches, as well as the institutional capacity of MGAP, specifically of its Natural
                         Resources Directorate (RENARE), to implement its natural resources management programs and
                         climate change strategy in the agricultural sector. Key outcomes of this component are: a) The
                         development and utilization of modern cartographic information integrated climate and agriculture
                         information and decision support systems accessible to different users; b) the updating of the
                         country's soil use maps; c) The improvement and integration of the existing GIS system in RENARE,

                          Component 4: Project Management and M&E (Total cost of $4.1million, of which $3.6m would be
                         financed by IBRD and $1.2 million would be financed by GOU). This component would provide the
                         funds required for the efficient coordination and management of the project, including the
                         implementation of the entire subproject cycle, as well as financial management and procurement, In
                         addition, the component                  would include activities that cut across all project
                         components, including the operation of the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) System, the
                         organization of the training program described in Component 3, and the design and implementation
                         of a communication strategy to disseminate results and lessons learned within the country and the
                         region.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
Public Disclosure Copy




                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                The proposed project is not expected to have negative impact on the environment. No large or
                              significant impact is envisaged. Given the nature of the project, most project-financed
                              interventions are expected to be small investments at the farm level, with a substantial positive
                              impact on the environment as a result of better practices on natural resource management being
                              incorporated into the main production systems, especially on-farm soil and water management.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                                Due to the fact that improved natural resources management is a key outcome of the project,
                              potential indirect and/or long-term impacts would be positive.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                                Given the nature of the project, no alternatives relevant to safeguards were considered.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                                In the context of a comprehensive ESMP prepared as part of project preparation, a detailed
                              assessment of environmental and social aspects was conducted, resulting in specific sections of a
                              detailed Project Manual, that includes environmental screening procedures, provisions to address
                              exceptional cases that could involve unforeseen safeguard issues, a restrictive list of investments
                              not financed by the project, training activities, and an M&E system that includes indicators and
                              targets relevant to safeguards. As part of the implementation of the ongoing Bank-financed
                              project, the PEU, as well as the Natural Resources Management staff of MGAPs Regional Offices,
                              have received training in EIA methodology and other safeguard-related matters, and therefore are

                              well qualified to contract environmental specialist to assist in various phases of the sub-project
                              cycle. MGAPs capacity in GIS and EIA would continue to be strengthened, and an adequately
                              staffed PEU would be established to support MGAP in project implementation, including
                              safeguards.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                              on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                                Key stakeholders are Uruguay's family and medium farmers. The main project features, including
                              eligibility criteria, investments to be supported and restricted, and screening /mitigation
                              mechanisms were presented and extensively discussed with individual farmers, area- and
                              production-based farmer organizations, service providers, as well as social entities (NGOs, Mesas
                              de Desarrollo Rural) through an extensive consultation process, mainly supported by the network
                              established by MGAP's Directorate of Rural Development (DGDR) and the highly decentralized
                              structure of the ongoing PPR project. The feedback obtained was duly processed, incorporated into
                              project design, and reflected in the Project Manual.

                           Comments: Originally, the GoU had prepared and in-country-disclosed a PMP on the project
                                         website in December 2013. However, and based on additional guidance by the
                                         Bank's Pest Management Safeguards Specialist for LAC, the PMP was later
                                         incorportaed in the ESMF. The revised ESMF has now being disclosed for in-
                                         country consultations, the results of which will be incorporated into the final version.
                         If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the
                         respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental Assessment/
                         Audit/or EMP.
