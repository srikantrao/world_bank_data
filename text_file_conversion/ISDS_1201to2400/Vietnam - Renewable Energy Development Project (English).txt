2. Project Objectives:

The objective of the proposed project (which does not change with the project restructuring) is to
increase the supply of electricity to the national grid from renewable energy sources on a
commercially, environmentally and socially sustainable basis.

3. Project Description:

As originally approved, the parent project comprises three components outlined below:
Component 1: Renewable Energy Investment
Subcomponent J: Credit to Support Renewable Energy Investments (total financing $235.SS
million, of which IDA $149.2 million). This sub-component will provide a refinancing facility to
participating commercial banks (PBs) for loans to eligible renewables-based projects not
exceeding JOMW developed by private sponsors. The facility would refinance up to 80 percent
of the loans made by PBs to eligible projects.

Subcomponent 2: Technical Assistance for Investment Project Implementation (total financing
$2.43 ·million, of which $2 million from IDA). This sub-component will provide technical
assistance for application review and project management by MOIT and for building the capacity
of participating banks and project sponsors to prepare, appraise, finance, and implement
renewables-based projects according to international best practices.

Compon,ent·2: Regulatory De,,elopment (Total financing $1.02 million equivalent of which
$0.8 million from IDA and AUS0.35 million co-financed by TF). This component will provide ·
technical assistance for developing the regulatory infrastructure and building the requisite
capacities of MOIT, the Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam and other relevant
government agencies for renewable energy development particularly for grid-connected
    . generation projects not exceeding 30 MW.
electricity

Component 3: Pipeline Dnelopment (Total financing $3.32 million equivalent of which
AU$3.15 million financed by TF). This component will support activities to facilitate the
development of further renewable energy projects contributing directly to building a pipeline of
renewable energy projects.

Scope of the Project Restructuring:

The project is proposed for restructuring to (i) allow the project being fully complied with the
Bank safeguard policies; and (ii) enable project to fully meet its development objective.

The proposed changes include: (i) triggering of an additional safeguard policy> the Bank's policy
on Projects on International Waterways (OP 7.50); (ii) a two year extension to the project closing
date, to June 30, 2016; (iii) changes of applicable procurement guidelines and removal of
thresholds for application of procurement and consultant selection methods and thresholds for
the Bank's prior review;(iv) a reallocation of funds between the expenditure categories under the
Grant; and (v) other minor changes in project implementation arrangements.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

Except for few subprojects selected upfront, all renewable energy subprojects will be identified
dwing implementation. Majority of the subprojects would be small hydropower plants (SHPP)
which are typically located in hilly or mountainous areas in the Northern and Central regions.
Biomass subprojects would be located in the Southern delta areas while wind subprojects are
likely situated in Central coastal areas.
The nine SHPP subprojects selected to date for implementatio~ of which two were completed,
are located in Lao Cai, Son La, Hoa Binh provinces of the Northern Mountainous Region and in
Oak Nong and Quang Ngai provinces of the Central Highland.

n. Key Safeguard PoUcy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary ofKey Safeguard Issues
1. Deseribe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed projeet. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or inevenible impaets:

The project restructuring does not result in a change to the project activities and hence not posing
a change in the overall project risks or in the original environmental categori:zation. However, it
warrants triggering of a new safeguard policy, the policy on Project on International Waterways
(OP/BP 7 .50). In the project design stage, it was determined that the project would not trigger
OP 7.SO, and the screening criteria were developed to exclude the subprojects that would trigger
this policy. However, during implementation, three small HPP subprojects, Nam Hoa 1, Nam
Hoa 2, and Hoa Phu, which would play an important role in fulfilling the project development
objectives,. are considered to be located on a tnl>utary of an international waterway. Therefore,
the new safeguards policy OP.7SO is triggered.

 The two small nm-of-river HP sub-projects, the ongoing Nam Hoa 2 and the pipeline Nam Hoa
 1, are located on the Nam Hoa River. which is a tributary of the Ma River, an international
 waterway. However, given the fact that (1) the Nam Hoa runs exclusively within Vietnam, (2)
·Vietnam is the lowest downstream riparian of the Ma River, and (3) the subproject investments .
 are unlikely to cause significant hann to the other riparians, an exception to the riparian
notification requirements under paragraph 7(c) is justifiable for these two subprojects. In
addition, given that Nam Hoa 2 is ongoing, the exception under paragraph 7(a) is justified
because die proposed works (i) would not adversely change the quality or quantity of water
flows to the other riparians; and (ii) would not be adversely affected by the other riparians'
possible water use. The Hoa Phu subproject, located on the Srepok River shared by Vietnam and
Cambodia and a tributary to the Mekong River, is also an ongoing activity, and as in the case of
Nam Hoa 2, the exception under paragraph 7(a) is justified because the proposed works (i) would
not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) would
not be adversely affected by the other riparians' possible water use. The RVP's approval on
exception to the riparian notification requirements was obtained on April 18, 2014.

The project would provide additional energy to the grid to improve the quality and availability of
power, especially in rural remote areas, where they are generally located. Hence, the project
leads to improvements of local productive capacity, business environment as well as social,
educational and cultural life. Construction and operation of renewable energy (RE) facilities are
likely to generate employment opportunities and improve access of rural communities.

The small-scale hydropower subprojects under the REDP would require building of temporary
and permanent access roads, small barrage for storing water, delivering water through canals to
the power generation point, installation of power generation plant, offices and other temporary
structures, roads for connecting these associated structures, and security perimeter along the
transmission lines and surrounding areas of tower foundations. Land requirements for these
structures, including water reservoir area may require temporary or permanent acquisition of
forest, residential, agricultural and tree-crop land in extent depending upon the scale of the
proposed operation.

The subprojects under the REDP can also give rise to a variety of environmental impacts. The
potential environmental impacts can be associated with the power production facilities as well as
ancillary infrastructure including construction work camps; tempo~ and permanent access
roads; offices and other temporary structures; substations and transmission lines. Potential
environmental impacts of such infrastructure include those associated with land clearing and
construction activities; those associated with land conversion to a reservoir or changing
downstream environmental flows; downstream impacts to water quality and aquatic biodiversity,
~sthetic impacts of wind turbines; impacts associated with sourcing, collecting transporting and
storing biomass for fuel; land use conflicts over production of biomass or construction of
reserv()irs and operational impacts such as noise and waste management.

The experience in project implementation to date shows that of special concern are the impacts
on water quality, stream hydrology, and safety associated construction of the access road and the
dams. Large scale displacement of population has not been experienced nor foreseen to take
place in any of the subprojects. The loss of agriculturaJ and tree crop land and sources of
incomes of some households residing in the area is small to moderate. In most cases, the scale of
impacts is likely to be marginal. Other adverse impacts related to dust, noise, vtl>ration, waste
generation during the construction phase are moderate and manageable with implementation of
the mitigation measures included in the subproject safeguards instruments.
safeguard and technical requirements. To date, the overall environmental and social perfonnance
of the project can be assessed as moderately satisfactory.

The DSP has provided valuable inputs in reviewing and verifying all technical aspects of the
subprojects including hydrology, geology analysis, and technical design of the dams to ensure
that the dam designs are safe. It has also conducted regular supervision with hands-on technical
support to the developers. This helps enhance capacity of the developers in preparing dam safety
plans,dam    technical designs, and in ensuring proper supervision of dam construction and safety
measures. Generally, the dams under the project are considered safe, and construction quality
varies from site to site but at acceptable standards. The PMB and DSP continue their close
supervisio.n, identify technical risks and provide technical advices to the developers and their
contractors.

The recommended actions of the CIA undertaken during implementation, which will be
considered in the future investments, include: i) fish ladders; ii) fish breeding program; iii)
corridors for wildlife migration; iv) enforcement of hunting rules; v) reconsideration of further
small-hydropower development planning; and vi) corporate sustainability program of
hydropower owner. Findings and recommendations of the study were shared with different
stakeholders at a national workshop and will be taken into consideration during implementation
of the restructuring project.

The lessons learned, which will be applied to the restructured project, indicate that even though
the EMPs are of good quality close monitoring and supervision are of utmost importance.
Safeguards supervision needs to identify problems in a timely manner, and immediate corrective
actions must be developed, and implemented with closer monitoring and supervision. The task
teams and the client should be creative in mobilizing available resources for addressing emerging
safeguards problems.

The Administrative Unit (AU), a unit of the PMB established in the parent project and
responsible for administration of the refinancing facility of the investment component of REDP,
review of refinancing applications to make sure subprojects for which refinancing is requested
meet all refinancing requirements and an oversight role in regard to subproject environmental
and social commitments. However, given its ineffective support, enhanced capacity of the PMB,
and effective support from the independent environmental and social monitoring consultants,
MoIT requested for removing the AU from the project implementation ammgement.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for coasaltation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key stakeholders are developers, participating banks, affected communities and NGOs, relevant
district, provincial· and central governments. Consultation on the parent project design and
requirements with the key stakeholders bas been carried out during preparation. Consultation
workshop for dam safety framework was held in October 2007. Consultation workshop for social
and environment policy frameworks was held in November, 2008. The frameworks were
circulated for comments among concerned ministries before they were approved by MOIT.
compliance has been established and will be kept for the whole project life. The DSP reviewed
and verified all dam safety technical aspects of all the proposed subprojects during prepantion to
ensure that the dam designs are safe. During constructi~ the DSP carried out periodic site
supervision to monitor the quality of construction and safety measures undertaken by devel~
identify risks, and to provide technical advice to developers and PBs. MOIT has hired
consultants to carry out independent monitoring of RPs, EMDPs and EMPs implementation for
all subprojects financed by the projecL

 All the subprojects are required to prepare Resettlement Plans (RP) and if there are ethnic
 minority people present in the project area, to prepare Ethnic Minority Development Plans
 (EMDP). The RP and EMP will have to be in full compliance with relevant national laws and
 re~ations as well as the project RFP and EMPF. All subprojects requiring an BIA under the
 national EA regulations will require that the developer prepare an Environmental Management
·Plan (EMP) in compliance with ~e updated ESF. The EMP consists of a set of mitigatio~
 monitoring and institutional measures to be taken during construction and operation in order to
 minimize, reduce and/or eliminate any potential adverse environmental impacts to acceptable
 levels. It includes the entire subproject scope and impacts. All subprojects require public
 consultations on RP, EMDP and EMP and the results of the consultations require documentation
 in the RP, EMDP and EMP.

The EIAs, EMPs, RPs, and EMDPs of the two on-going subprojects, Nam Hoa 2 and Hoa Phu
SHP plants, were prepared in compliance with the project ESF, RPF, and EMPF, reviewed by
the Bank, and disclosed locally and at the Bank's lnfoShop. The EMP, RP, and EMDP for the
pipeline. Nam Hoa 1 SHP, are being prepared by the developer.

During the implementation of the REDP, close safeguards supervision has been maintained by
PMB, the PBs, and the Bank. Subproject EIAs, EMPs, EMDPs, and RPs were prepared and
implemented in accordance with the guidance given in the project ESF, RPF, and EMPF. Some
EMP non-compliance issues related to sedimentation and erosio~ management of workei: camps,
and safety ·in construction of access roads and dam sites was identified in 2011 and 2012, and the
project safeguards was rated as Unsatisfactory. The underlying reason for non-comliance is the
weak capacity of MolT PMU, the PBs, and the developers in fulfilling the Bank's safeguards
requirements during implementation. Immediate corrective actions were taken by the MoIT, the
Bank, and the developers, including capacity building for the implementing agency, the PBs, and
the developers; mobilization of external international and national ~ engineering consultants
to provide technical support and training to the developers; preparation and implementation of
detailed corrective action plans by the developers to address environmental and social safeguard
issues; and enhanced implementation supervision missions by the Bank, MolT, and PBs.
Training on safeguards and consultant support were provided to the PMB, PBs, and the
developers to help strengthen their capacity in managing the subproject impacts. Compensation
for affected land/assets and supports for displaced people were implemented and found
satisfactory. Safeguard compliance has improved over the last two years due·to close sub-project
supervision by MoIT, PBs, and the World Bank team. The overall safeguards compliance has
been consistently rated as Moderately Satisfactory in the last four ISRs. The Hoa Phu sub-project
can be considered as best practice small hydropower development, fully complying with all
At subproject level, public consultation with potentially affected people on social and
environment impacts of each subproject is mandatory for all participating developers as an
important requirement of the safeguard frameworks. The consultation results are required to be
documented in the RP, EMDP and EMPs, which will be checked by PBs and PMB. The
developers will also be responsible for disclosing the EMPs, RPs and EMDPs at a public location
near the subproject sites and in the offices of the Provincial OONRE and/or over the Internet. If
the subproject is located in more than one province, the documents shall be disclosed at public
locations nearest the subproject site in each province and at the local offices of DONRE.

All safeguard frameworks ESF, RPF, EMPF, and subproject EIAs/BMPs of the parent project             ·
were properly consulted and disclosed at the subproject sites, at the Vietnam Development
lnfonnation Center (VDIC), and in the lnfoShop, on November 20, ~008 and January 6, 2009,
respectively. The updated ESF was locally disclosed in the country and at the lnfoShop on
March 26, 2014 prior to appraisal. All subproject safeguard instruments under the restructuring
project are also required to follow the Bank policy on access to infonnation in public
consultation and disclosure of infonnation.
