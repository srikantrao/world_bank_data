2. Project Objectives

The Project Development Objective (PDO) for this operation is to increase the capacity of key
sector experts in the Pacific region to conduct disaster damage, loss and needs assessments.


3. Project Description
Given the high-frequency of disasters in the Pacific region most Paeific Island Countries and
Territories (PICTs) have well established rapid initial damage assessment procedures. However,
many PICTS have expressed a need for higher capability in conducting more complex and
comprehensive Damage and Loss Assessment (DALA) and Post Disaster Needs Assessment
(PDNA). A sub-regional workshop conducted in March 2011 identified that while considerable
interest in increasing capability in DALAIPDNA exists in the region, effectively training and
maintaining country-based teams may not be practical for some PICTs, especially those with low
disaster return rates. The Economic Assessment of Disasters in the Pacific project (EADP)
addresses this gap by providing technical assistance to the region in the use of the DALA/PDNA.
This regional approach will be based on i) developing a regional solution to in-country capacity
needs; ii) combining training with field testing, and; iii) supporting a mechanism for 'training of
trainers'. The project has the following components:

Component 1: Establishment of a Regional Pool of Experts in DALAIPDNA application
(US$344.400 of which Bank financed US$227,600)
         This component will develop a regional technical backstopping facility to support
         national governments in the event of a disaster. The experts will also act as future
         trainers in DALAIPDNA for the region. It will achieve this through the following
         sub-components:

           Sub-component 1.1: Identification and recruitment of experts: Criteria (core skills)
           will be developed for the selection of experts to provide technical assistance in
           DALA/PDNA application. At least 16 experts from key sectors in participating PICTs
           will be identified through consultation with national, regional and international
           agencies. Up to 4 additional experts from regional, international and non-
           governmental organisations will also be identified.

           Sub-component 1.2: Developing Pacific training materials: Existing training materials
           for DALAIPDNA are not tailored to the Pacific hazard, socio-economic and
           geographical context. A small team from the sector expert pool identified in C 1.1,
           assisted by an international expert, will work to tailor existing_ training materials,
           exercises and case studies to a form that better reflects the ability of PICTs to absorb
           and apply a DALA. Training materials provided by the Global Facility for Disaster
           Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) will form the foundation of Pacific materials.

           Sub-component 1.3: Training.sector experts in DALA/PDNA application: Utilizing
           the Pacific training materials developed· in C 1.2, the full pool of up to 20 key sector
           experts recruited will receive formal training in DALA/PDNA to advanced level.
           Training will be conducted by up to two international experts.

           Sub-component 1.4: Technical assistance in DALAIPDNA application: The
           subcomponent will provide trained experts with practical hands-on experience in
           conducting assessments by supporting the delivery of DALAs/PDNAs in disaster
           affected countries. In particular, it will i) mobilize up to two international experts in
           DALA/PDNA application (likely from the GFDRR) to guide disaster assessment in
           Pacific island countries, and; ii) mobili?e up to five regional experts to contribute to
           disaster assessment in up to three disaster events or simulations (in the case that there
           are no significant disaster events during the three year period of the project). Overlap
           will be provided to ensure that at least one of the sector experts from the team
           selected to support an in-country assessment will attend the next asse~sment to
           provide the benefit of their experience from a Pacific perspective. Through this
           support, regional experts will eventually be able to themselves lead assessments. This
           activity would also make use of the rapid damage estimation component of the
           Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment' and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) phase 3.
           This activity would model potential direct damage to buildings, major infrastructure
           and cash crops and provide sector assessments of estimated losses which would be
           used to inform the initial phases of the DALAIPDNA exercise .. Conversely, the
           actual figures from the completed DALA assessments would assist to calibrate
           PCRAFI loss functions.

Component 2: Knowledge Sharing (US$549,500 of which Bank fmanced US$327,000)

           Sub-component 2.1: Develop Pacific guidance manuals for DALAIPDNA:
           Experiences and state-of-the-art case studies conducted through C 1.4 will be
           incorporated into training materials developed in C 1.2 to develop a Pacific-specific
           handbook for conducting DALAIPDNA and other associated knowledge products.
           The work will be conducted through face to face planning sessions between the
           international expert(s) guiding training/application and a small selection of the sector
           experts involved in the project.                  ·

           Sub-component 2.2: Training of trainers: This component will support trained experts
           to become trainers themselves. Materials generated in C2.1 will be used to train
           relevant newly qualified sector experts in how to train others to apply DALAIPDNA
           in practice (with guidance). This training will be conducted in tandem with trained
           pedagogues from The Asia Foundation program hosted at SPC that already provides
           disaster risk management training. The pool of trained trainers will then be used to
           supplement the regional pool of experts and eventually replace them as these experts
           move out of the region. Trained experts in the Pacific move onto other jobs
           continuously. One-off training is therefore not sufficient to ensure sustainability of
           the regional backstopping mechanism or sustained understanding by host. agencies of
           the value and application of DALAIPDNA for recovery and DRR purposes. To
           replenish the expert pool and reinforce capacity, training o.f experts in DALAIPDNA
           and training of trainers will be repeated so that these individuals can ensure a future
           supply.

Component 3: Operations and Administration (US$60,400)

           Project implementation and oversight functions will be provided by the Applied Geo-
           Science and Technology Division (SOPAC) of the Secretariat of the Pacific
           Community (SPC). SPC-SOPAC has the regional mandate for capacity development
           of PICTs for DRR. This component will fund the acquisition of hardware to support
           the design and delivery of training, delivery of in-field assessments and monitoring
           and evaluation.


4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if
known)

The project is a technical assistance grant focused on capacity building and the development of a
regional training program tailored to the pacific context based on established Bank procedures.
It will be executed by SPC in Fiji, and no safeguards issues are expected. Any training materials
or methods for assessing and responding to disasters will encompass the principles of the Bank's
safeguards policies.
