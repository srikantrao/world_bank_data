B. Project Objectives:
The main Development Objective is to support the Government in establishing countrywide
communities of practice (COPs) and using these COPs to increase capacity of local budget
officers, elected heads of LSG units and local council members through innovative peer-to-peer
learning approach.

C. Project Description:

       Component 1: Project management, including Community of Practice building
       activities. This component will fund the following activities: (i) Establishing a Project
       Management Unit (PMU) through hiring of consultants and capacity building; (ii)
       Contracting out the fiduciary oversight, which includes both - procurement and financial
       management functions will be undertaken by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
       under the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance; (iii) Coordination of all project activities, i.e. PTP
       event for Recourse Persons and rayon level PTP events; (iv) Activities related to project
       oversight by the Steering Committee (SC), e.g. providing SC members with at least semi-
       annual activity updates, organization of SC meetings, etc.

       Component 2: Organization and delivery of learning events to the Resource
       Persons. This component will fund logistical and administrative arrangements related to
       organization and delivery of PTP learning and training events for 40 rayon level
       Resource Persons (RPs) in each COP that will help improve their understanding of Public
       Finance Management (PFM) at the local level and help them be effective leaders and
       resource persons of rayon-level communities of practice and to sustain COP at the rayon
       level. It is expected that the training for 40 rayon level RPs in each COP will be
       conducted at least once in three months.

       Component 3: Organization and delivery of PTP learning at rayon level. This
       component will fund rayon level PTP learning for all 40 rayons of the country- both
       formal events and advice provided to the COP members by rayon level RPs. It is
       expected that formal PTP events at rayon level will be held at least once in three months
       and will include relevant participants (financial officers, local council members working
       in budget committee) from each Ayil Okmotu (LSG units) in that rayon (therefore, all
       453 rural LSG units will be covered). Organization and conduct of the PTP evens will be
       a shared responsibility of the PMU and rayon RP (for each COP). It is also expected that
       the formal PTP events when and if possible would be aligned with the relevant rayon
       level meetings COP members supposed to attend as a part of their work responsibilities.

       Component 4: Evaluation. This component will fund baseline and end-of-project data
       collection and benchmarking and end of project evaluation. It is expected that evaluation
       will be done by an independent entity that was not a part of project implementation. This
       component will also fund an independent end-of-project audit.

D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known):
The project will be implemented countrywide, involving representatives from all rayons of
Kyrgyz republic.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies:
The project will be implemented by the State Agency for Local Self-Government and Interethnic
Relations under the Kyrgyz Government with the support of the Project Management Unit -
Secretariat. The institution doesn’t have experience in implementing safeguards issues.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                          X
The proposed grant would support only TA activities, including consulting services and training
and will not have any environmental or social impacts. The TA to be financed does not include
support for preparation or design of any physical investments that would trigger the SG policies.
Thus this OP is not triggered.
