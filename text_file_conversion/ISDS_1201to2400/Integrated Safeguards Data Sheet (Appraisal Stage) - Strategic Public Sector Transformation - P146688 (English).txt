Public Disclosure Copy




                         The project has five components divided into two main thematic areas: Reinforcing Fiscal Discipline
                         and Revenue Enhancement and Public Sector Institutional Strengthening to Remove Barriers that
                         Impede Trade Facilitation. Transforming and rationalizing Jamaicaâ€™s public sector is central to
                         improving service delivery, enhancing competitiveness and growth. In order to achieve this, there is
                         the need for increased efficiency and accountability in the use of public resources and improved
                         management of fiscal risks. The first thematic area of the proposed intervention seeks to reinforce
                         fiscal discipline and revenue enhancement through three main components: (a) Strengthening Public
                         Investment Management System (PIMS); (b) Strengthening Budget Preparation Process and Result
                         Based Budgeting; (c) Adaptive Public Sector Approaches to Promote Fiscal Sustainability; and (d)
                         Property Tax. The second thematic area seeks to strengthen those institutions that sit at the interface
                         between the public and private sectors; Bureau of Standards of Jamaica (BSJ) and Jamaica Customs
                         Administration (JCA).
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project encompasses five components:

                         Component 1: Strengthening Public Investment Management System

                         Component 2: Strengthening the Budget Preparation Process and Results Based Budgeting

                         Component 3: Adaptive Public Sector Approaches to Promote Fiscal Sustainability

                         Component 4: Property Tax

                         Component 5: Fostering Industrial Growth, Trade and Consumer Health and Safety

                         None of the Project components involve civil works, such as improvement or rehabilitation of
                         buildings. The policy and administrative changes to be executed do not have connected
                         environmental or social safeguards aspects, but instead are focused on improving the management
                         and efficiency of fiscal programs. Accordingly the Project is considered Category C (no adverse
                         environmental impacts).
