                           The proposed Project Development Objective is to confirm whether the Karkar geothermal site
                           contains commercially exploitable geothermal resources suitable for power generation.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project development objective is to confirm whether Karkar geothermal site contains
                           commercially exploitable geothermal resource suitable for power generation.
                         The project will have the following two components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Component 1: Exploratory drilling and associated civil works (US$9.6 million). This component will
                         finance:

                         •        Construction of an access road to the drilling site;
                         •        Construction of water supply infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted supply of water for
                         drilling needs. The water will most likely be taken from the nearby springs, and may require
                         construction of a small reservoir to ensure required water flow intensity to the site;
                         •        Construction of a rig pad (a smooth surface to accommodate the rig pad and the supporting
                         containers);
                         •        Exploratory drilling of one or two test wells to the depth of 1500-1800 m.

                         Component 2: Technical Assistance (US$2 million). This component will finance consultant services
                         and non-consultant services required under the project and will include:

                         •        Well logging and mud logging. This will include analyses of the cuttings from the borehole,
                         hole temperature and pressure measurements and gathering of essential data;
                         •        Flow testing, chemical sampling and analysis: This will include an assessment of: (a) the
                         possible power output of the well, the ratio between brine and steam, and (b) enthalpy;
                         •        Technical supervision: This will include hiring of a technical expert to be on site during the
                         entire duration of the drilling to collaborating on daily basis on the site to ensure adherence of the
                         drilling contractor to the requirements of the contract.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The Karkar site is situated in the Syunik province (marz) at an elevation of around 3,500 m above sea
                         level. The site is located far from human settlements and the project is not expected to require

                         physical relocation. Private land acquisition is not expected, but will be confirmed prior to appraisal.
                         The drilling site and the area nearby are not used for agricultural or any other economic activity.
                         Vegetation on the site is represented mostly by low-growing shrubs and a grass cover. Small scale
                         grass harvesting by rural residents occurs at lower elevations in the project area. The project site is
                         not part of any designated protected area.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The project will be implemented by the Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2
                         Fund), which is implementing an ongoing Energy Efficiency Project, which is financed from the
                         GEF and administered by the Bank, and has implemented a number of Bank-financed projects
                         (Urban Heating Project, Renewable Energy Project). It has an adequate institutional capacity for
                         dealing with safeguard issues. Specifically, the R2E2 Fund has a safeguards consultant familiar with
                         the Bank’s safeguards policies, currently supervising safeguards compliance of the ongoing GEF
                         Energy Efficiency Project. Safeguards performance under the Energy Efficiency Project has been
                         satisfactory from its start date till present.
