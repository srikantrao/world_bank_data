                           The project development objectives (PDO) are to increase the relevance of the skills of technical and
                           vocational education and training graduates to the needs of the labor market in selected pilot regions
                           and to expand best practices to other selected dissemination regions in the Russian Federation.
                            3. Project Description


                                                                        Page 1 of 9
                         The proposed project aims to support the Russian Federation and its regions in two main endeavors:
                         (i) introducing up-to-date models of training in selected regional TVET systems and (ii) enhancing
                         the capacity of the federal government to support regional TVET systems.

                         Component 1: Introducing modern workforce training models for regional economies (US$325
                         million; 79.3 percent of total project cost).

                         The purpose of this component is to develop different models of a regional TVET system that can be
                         replicated in other regions in Russia. Ten regions were selected to pilot the modernization of their
                         TVET systems: Chelyabinsk oblast, Kaluga oblast, Krasnoyarsk krai, Leningrad oblast, Perm krai,
                         Rostov oblast, Stavropol krai, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), the Republic of Tatarstan, and
                         Tambov oblast. The regions were selected in accordance to the criteria agreed between the Ministry
                         of Education and Science of the Russian Federation and the Bank. The project team assumes that, by
                         supporting key selected regions and building institutions to implement reforms in their TVET
                         system, this will influence similar efforts in other regions even if they are not supported directly by
                         the project. This component is divided into four thematic subcomponents.

                         Subcomponent 1.1: Bringing the content, technologies, and infrastructure used in vocational
                         education in line with the current and future requirements of the labor market. This subcomponent
                         will ensure that the substance and outcomes of vocational education are aligned with labor market
                         demand. It will support regional ministries of education in: (i) assessing regional labor market
                         demand (including the development of assessment tools); (ii) designing and implementing activities
                         to establish links between enterprises and vocational education; (iii) developing competence-based
                         modular TVET programs; (iv) improving the physical infrastructure of vocational educational
                         institutions; (v) supplying specialized hi-tech training equipment; and (vi) training teachers and
                         occupational instructors to deliver the new training programs. This component will be implemented
                         in parallel with the federal component (Component 2) to ensure a unified approach to and
                         dissemination of the outputs produced. Each region will develop a unique set of TVET programs to

                         avoid any duplication of efforts. Each program developed in the pilot regions will be shared
                         nationally (after passing through the quality assurance procedures).

                         Subcomponent 1.2: This subcomponent will ensure that the network of TVET services providers is
                         aligned with the demands of the regional economy. It will support activities to: (i) design regional
                         roadmaps for restructuring and developing vocational educational institutions and for implementing
                         priority training programs; (ii) introduce innovative institutional models to enhance the network
                         optimization; and (iii) establish a system for the certification of skills and qualifications.

                         Subcomponent 1.3: Developing and introducing relevant management and financial instruments and
                         building the human capacity to apply them.
                         The subcomponent will ensure that the management and financing models used in the TVET sector
                         and institutions are efficient and aligned with the requirements of the regional economy. It will
                         support activities to: (i) develop financial regulations to create incentives for employers participation
                         and introduce targeted funding mechanisms; (ii) introduce governance and management systems
                         based on labor market information that include employersâ€™ representatives; (iii) train regional
                         administration and college staff in the new financing and management policies; (iv) organize career
                         guidance and counseling services; and (v) prepare and publicly disseminate regional reports
                         analyzing TVET sector development and skills development.

                         extend the benefits of the project system-wide. Up to 7 regions will be competitively selected for the
                         dissemination exercise, and each of these regions will then choose a model or project output (or a
                         combination of outputs) that it is willing to introduce. This component will support the following
                         activities, among others, on request from the dissemination regions: (i) staff training; (ii) the
                         development of regulations; (iii) organization of study visits and other experience exchange
                         activities; and (iv) TVET infrastructure improvements.

                         Component 2: Building national-level capacity for workforce development (US$75 million; 18.3
                         percent of total project cost)

                         This component will support system-wide changes in the TVET sector in line with national policy
                         priorities including the development of enabling regulatory frameworks and guidelines, assessment
                         tools, and TVET programs, the creation of institutional capacity for developing competency-based
                         curricula, the enhancement of human capacity, and information sharing activities. This component is
                         divided into four subcomponents.

                         Subcomponent 2.1: Developing regulatory frameworks and guidelines to make regional vocational
                         education systems responsive to changes in the labor market. This subcomponent will provide tools
                         and guidance to help the pilot regions to align their skills training with the demands of the regional
                         economy and society. It will support activities to: (i) assess the labor market's needs, develop
                         assessment tools and enable the exchange of information between employers and TVET institutions;
                         (ii) develop management and financing mechanisms to align the TVET sector and institutions with

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              In accordance with the Bank's OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, the project is placed
                              into the Bank's Category B. The proposed project activities are not expected to cause significant
                              adverse environmental and social impacts and may be summarized as follows: (a) Dust and noise
                              due to the rehabilitation activities; (b) Dumping of construction wastes, accidental spillage of
                              machine oil, lubricants, paints, and solvents, etc.; and (c) Asbestos (although at this stage it is not
                              known if asbestos has been used in premises to be proposed for rehabilitation, but taking into
                              account it large usage in the former USSR it is possible to find such material used as an insulation
                              material and/or roofing material). In the case of inappropriate handling of asbestos this material
                              might be a real health concern for the construction workers, and the general public in the vicinity
                              of the rehabilitated premises in particular when it is inhaled. All these potential environmental

                           support of the project may be predominantly old, and some of these buildings may have some
                           historic value, which triggers OP/BP 4.11 Cultural Heritage.

                           The project will also bring positive social impacts as the proposed activities would increase the
                           youth employability and capabilities for continuous skills upgrading. There will be no expansion
                           of buildings beyond existing site boundaries, and no land acquisition will be required. Thus
                           OP4.12 is not triggered and no resettlement documents have to be prepared.

                           The Social Assessment confirmed the presence of indigenous peoples (IP) in one of the 10 project
                           pilot regions, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The minor rehabilitation and provision of equipment are not expected to have any negative long
                           term impact, if the mitigation measures listed in the EMF are correctly followed. No negative
                           impacts are expected from the proposed project on the indigenous peoples. No construction is
                           likely to affect indigenous people communities but access to vocational training opportunities may
                           be of particular significance for some IPs population.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           As part of project preparation an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was prepared,
                           which outlines environmental assessment procedures and mitigation requirements for the sub-

                           projects to be supported by the project. It provides details on procedures, criteria and
                           responsibilities for subproject screening, preparing Environmental Management Plans and their
                           implementing and monitoring. The document also includes Environmental Guidelines for
                           proposed sub-projects, containing an assessment of potential impacts and generic mitigation
                           measures to be undertaken for identified sub-projects in all stages - from selection, and the
                           implementation phase, to the monitoring and evaluation of results. The EMF will be integrated
                           into the Project's Operational Manual, as well as an Environmental Management Plan "Checklist"
                           will be used as part of all contracts involving equipment and works. In the case the selected
                           building for renovation is included in the list of cultural heritage, its renovation designs would
                           have to be cleared with the national authorities responsible for the preservation of cultural heritage
                           to ensure that historic/cultural value of such buildings are not compromised as a result of the
                           improvement works. These provisions are included in the EMF. The Bank is expected to provide a
                           special EA training to the PIU team, so they can promote compliance with the EMF and EMP. The
                           Bank will also supervise this aspect of implementation. The subproject EMPs will be also
                           integrated into the construction contracts for individual sites, both into specifications and bills of
                           quantities and the Contractors will be required to include the cost in their financial bids. The
                           project beneficiary institutions will also receive a copy of the EMF and EMP so, when appropriate,
                           they can oversee their compliance on the part of contractors.

                           Bank will also supervise this aspect of implementation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The draft EMF was disclosed in the country and consulted with key stakeholders. The Ministry of
                           Education and Science (MoES) has disseminated the draft summary EMF to Moscow State
                           University of Civil Engineering for review and comments, also posting it on May 30, 2014 for the
                           wide public on the website of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation
                           (http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/static/ministry_eng.html, http://www.fer.ru) in Russian
                           language. On June 6, 2014, the MES conducted a public briefing and consultation meeting on the
                           EMF documents. The meeting concluded that the draft EMF document covers practically all
                           potential impacts and possible mitigation measures. The draft document was revised after the
                           meeting, taking into account outputs from the consultation. The final version of the EMF (Russian
                           translation) and its English version were posted on the MES website and submitted to the World
                           Bank. The EMF will be used by the client during the project implementation.

                           As part of the IPPF preparation and Social Assessment, in-depth stakeholder consultations were
                           conducted in April-May 2014 to solicit stakeholders' feedback on the project design, validate
                           project assumptions and identify any negative impacts which the project could entail. Additional
                           consultations on draft IPPF were conducted on June 9, 2014 with a particular focus on soliciting
                           feedback from representatives of indigenous communities. The draft safeguards document was
                           revised after the meeting taking into account outputs from the consultation. The final version of
                           the IPPF (Russian translation) and its English version were posted on the web page of the
                           Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and submitted to the World Bank. Indigenous Peoples Plans would
                           be prepared at the outset of project implementation in accordance with IPPF and the Project
