                           The development objective of this activity is to strengthen the enabling environment for the
                           development of energy efficiency investments in large industrial enterprises in Indonesia.

                           The strengthening of the enabling environment, supported by the GEF grant, is expected to
                           incentivize local banks to undertake EE financing in the large enterprises sector resulting in
                           significant energy savings.

                         A.        Project development, project appraisal and monitoring. [GEF US$ 2 million] Under this
                         sub-component, a pipeline of EE investment projects will be prepared to be financed from existing
                         credit lines and, potentially through co-financing by IFC. A specific target under this project will be
                         to develop the energy efficiency lending activities of two or three participating banks. The
                         participating banks will be selected according to the following eligibility criteria: (i) portfolio of
                         industrial clients; (ii) ability to work with existing or planned IFI credit lines; and (iii) meeting Bank
                         criteria for FIs. Focus will be on 10-15 very creditworthy large industries, both state owned and
                         private. Focusing on very creditworthy industries would increase the prospects of coming to financial
                         close. This would then yield valuable case studies for the dissemination part.

                         Activities to be undertaken are expected to include:
                         (i)     pipeline development support for project developers/industries and financiers â€“ including the
                         selection of and building institutional capacity in a strong technical/financial advisory services entity
                         responsible for generating a pipeline of bankable EE projects;
                         (ii)    the development of special EE financing products or schemes;
                         (iii)   developing enhanced systems for monitoring energy savings after the projects have been
                         financed and implemented; and
                         (iv)    training.

                         B.       Transaction advisory services. [Total cost: US$3.25 million, of which GEF US$2 million;
                         MoI US$1.25 million] Under this sub-component, the project will support:
                         (i)    preparation of a Project Operations Manual for participating banks that would include sub-
                         project selection criteria, a list of eligible sectors, project types and sizes, energy savings
                         requirements, safeguards risk assessment and management guidelines and requirements, and

                         monitoring and reporting requirements; and
                         (ii)   provide transaction advisory services from subproject identification through financial close -
                         experiences gained under this sub-component will allow the participating banks to continue financing
                         EE projects after the IFI loan funds are fully disbursed.

                         Component 2: Awareness and Capacity Building. Total cost: US$2.47 million; of which GEF US
                         $1.22 million, MoI US$1.25 million as follows:

                         A.    Awareness Building and Knowledge Exchange. [Total cost: US$1.75 million, of which GEF
                         US$0.75 million, MoI US$1.0 million] This sub-component will support:

                         (i)     awareness building, training, and information dissemination to key market players on the
                         opportunities for EE and successful implementation schemes through existing IFI credit lines which
                         would be shared and disseminated widely to demonstrate the viability of EE lending;
                         (ii)    market studies, assessments and options papers for future investment programs beyond the
                         state-owned enterprise market; and
                         (iii)   participation in stakeholder dialogue during roundtables and other fora to discuss various
                         policy and market issues to develop recommendations to scale-up investments in the sector.

                         B.      Capacity Building within MoI and MEMR. [Total cost: US$0.72 million, GEF US$0.47
                         million, MoI US$0.25 million] This sub-component will support:

                         (i)      dialogue with donor partners conducting review of ongoing EE primary and supplemental

                         policies to identify deficiencies and discuss options for their resolution with a focus on the large
                         enterprises sector;
                         (ii)     review of incentive programs recommended by donor partners, and offered by the
                         Government to improve utilization and impacts for EE market development;
                         (iii)    design and launch of an energy/EE indicator function and database within MoI and MEMR
                         covering all sectors;
                         (iv)     identification and assessment of other potential policies with high impact potential, such as
                         government green/EE procurement, minimum energy performance standards, green award, tax
                         exemptions, etc. and develop program plans; and
                         (v)      staff training.

                         Component 3: Project Management: Total cost: GEF US$ 0.26 million

                         This component will finance consultants to support project implementation including procurement,
                         project monitoring, evaluation, and reporting activities.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Nationwide.

                         The project will be a stand-alone GEF project that will prepare a pipeline of EE investment projects
                         to be financed from existing credit lines at commercial banks to support the establishment of viable
                         financing and implementation models for large industrial enterprises in various sectors.

                         There are no physical works and no physical characteristics directly relevant to the safeguards issues
                         arising from this project. There are, however, potential physical safeguard implications relating to
Public Disclosure Copy




                         future investments in EE projects that will arise from activities supported by this project.
                         Furthermore, the advisory services and capacity building activities will also need to integrate
                         safeguards in accordance with the Interim Guidelines on the Application of Safeguard Polices to
                         Technical Assistance issued by the Bank.

                         Potential EE investments would include manufacturing process modifications in industries. These
                         modifications for EE improvement are made within the existing physical boundaries of industrial
                         plants (inside the plant fence), and do not require plant expansion. Therefore, it is not expected that
                         the foreseen future EE investments that arise due to project intervention will lead to any adverse
                         impacts to IPs or involve IPs in any manner nor will they involve any involuntary resettlement or
                         need for compensation for loss of assets or loss of access to assets or resources.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The Ministry of Industry will be the project implementing agency working in close collaboration
                         with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR). The main stakeholders of this project
                         are MoI, MEMR, participating banks and industrial owners. Additional stakeholders are equipment
                         suppliers, construction and engineering companies, technical/financial advisors and relevant
                         government ministries (e.g., Finance, Environment, and Research and Technology).

                         The project will prepare a pipeline of EE investment projects of very creditworthy large industries,
                           both state owned and private, and establish intermediary financing facilities in two or three banks to
                           be selected under the project.

                           An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the subprojects will be prepared
                           to ensure that the project has identified all potential environmental and social impacts that may be
                           arise due to the nature, scope, and scale of each of the sub projects and to provide adequate risk
                           screening, impact assessment, and appropriate mitigation measures to address the identified risks and
                           impacts.

                           Under Component 1, when selecting the participating banks and industries, the bankâ€™s capacity to
                           manage environmental and social safeguards according to the guidelines in the ESMF will be
                           evaluated as part of the selection process (OP 8.30). The screening criteria will be included in the
                           Project Operations Manual.

                           As MoI and MEMR do not have sufficient experience with the implementation of Bank projects and
                           Bank safeguards measures, Component 2 will include a safeguards awareness and capacity building
                           set of activities for MOI and MEMR. Specific training on how to implement the ESMF and the
                           Project Operations Manual (POM) will be conducted by a consultant hired by MoI. The ESMF will
                           be included in the POM. Instructions on how to articulate safeguards requirements into legal
                           covenants between the financing partners and the sub-borrowers would be provided to MoI, MEMR
                           and the partners. The Bankâ€™s safeguards specialists will provide support in developing the ToR for
                           the consultants who will implement the training program.

                           Through implementation of this project, MoI, MEMR, and the financing partners will build their
                           capacity to design and finance more sub-projects beyond this project. They will need to ensure that
                           implementation of safeguards measures by sub-borrowers (industrial owners) is also well managed.
                           Therefore, the ESMF needs to be well understood, implemented, and strengthened and can be readily
                           used for the proposed financing partners. The financing partners will then prepare their own
                           Environment and Social Safeguards Management System during full operations in line with the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           requirements and guidance in the Bank-approved ESMF.

                           The ESMF and Project Operations Manual of this GEF grant project will be required to be fully
                           disclosed and consulted on with all relevant stakeholders prior to Appraisal. MoI or MEMR and the
                           partners will work with the project design consultant to conduct public consultations on the project
                           and project ESMF.

                         from existing IFI credit line facilities.

                         Some of the known potential sub-project
                         impacts are related to construction aspects
                         associated with the movement of older and
                         inefficient machinery and materials (dust, noise,
                         disposal of packaging wastes). There is also the
                         possibility of hazardous materials management
                         in certain EE sub-projects such as replacement
                         of asbestos insulation, removal and disposal of

                         fluorescent light bulbs, etc. If old industrial
                         refrigeration equipment will need to be replaced
                         by new and efficient ones, this may result in
                         possible leakage of ozone depleting substances
                         which are also GHG with high GWP used as the
                         refrigerant in the equipment.

                         The nature of the project and the potential
                         physical impacts of all foreseen EE investments
                         are not known at this time, but most are
                         expected to be site specific at existing industrial
                         plants (within the physical boundaries of each
                         plant) and, of the ones known now, these are
                         expected to generate minor to moderate local
                         environmental impacts with no adverse, large,
                         sensitive or irreversible environmental impacts
                         generated as a result of the project or any future
                         subprojects.
                         An Environmental and Social Management
                         Framework will be prepared to ensure that the
                         project has identified all potential environmental

                         and social impacts that may arise due to the
                         nature, scope and scale of each of the sub
                         projects and other project financed activities to
                         provide adequate risk screening, impact
                         assessment and appropriate mitigation measures
                         to address the identified risks and impacts.

                         The screening process detailed in the ESMF, in
                         particular, will screen the investments for the
                         full range of environment and social impacts,
                         safeguard policies triggered and provide advice
                         on the types of safeguard instruments to be
                         prepared for each of the identified investments
                         financed during implementation of the GEF
                         project.

                         There will be three outputs from the screening
                         exercise: (1) the EE initiatives that would only
                         require an ECoP: environmental code of
                         practice, for example an SOP to handle the
                         disposal of used equipment; (2) initiatives that
                         would require UKL UPL or ESMP to manage
                         minor impact of the projects (e.g. install new
                         unit or minor change in onsite production
                         process and process control). (3) Initiative that
Public Disclosure Copy




                         would require the revision of AMDAL because
                         it will change the production process and output
                         that is significantly different with the current
                         AMDAL the project has in place.

                         The ESMF will specifically include screening,
                         assessment and management guidelines to
                         address hazardous materials as an issue of
                         special concern. In addition, the ESMF will
                         specify that the advisory services and capacity
                         building activities of the project will need to
                         integrate safeguards in accordance with the
                         Interim Guidelines on the Application of
                         Safeguard Polices to Technical Assistance
                         issued by the Bank.

                         Finally, the ESMF will also provide guidance
                         on the instruments to be prepared in the event
                         that other impacts are identified as outlined
