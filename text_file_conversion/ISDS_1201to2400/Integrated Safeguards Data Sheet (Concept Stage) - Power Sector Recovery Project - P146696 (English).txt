                           26.     The PDO is to improve the technical and commercial performance of EDG.
                           C. Project Description
                           The IDA project will support the Government of Guinea in financing a management contract for
                           EDG as well as associated hard and soft investments, such as the purchase and deployment of
                           prepayment meters, a software package for enhanced commercial operation and implementation of a
                           loss reduction program. It is envisaged that the project would be structured under three components
                           (with estimated cost):

                           (a)     Component 1 - Management contract (US$12-15 million): for 3-5 years. A private operator
                           with international experience will be selected through a rigorous and competitive process, and will
                           operate EDG, while implementing a utility recovery plan to improve its technical, commercial and
                           financial performance significantly over the course of the contract. The estimated cost of the
                           management contract includes the implementation of a comprehensive strategic business plan by the
                           private operator that will provide a senior management team for the utility, a comprehensive training
                           and technical assistance plan for utility personnel, and a communication plan targeted at EDG
                           customers. This component will also include an independent auditor to monitor and evaluate the
                           fulfillment of contractual obligations under the management contract by both parties, to avoid any
                           disputes between the operator and the government.

                           (b)     Component 2 - Associated investments (US$32-35 million): this includes mainly prepayment
                           meters for EDG low-voltage clients who currently lack meters (in coordination with other donors
                           who are also funding meters), regularization of current illegal connections and purchase of
                           maintenance equipment.

                           (c)     Component 3 – Technical assistance for sector reform and non-allocated (US$3 million).
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           Project’s activities, in particular component 2, will be undertaken in Greater Conakry Area and in the
                           center of the country where EDG’s two main networks are located.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The project will be implemented by the private operator that will be selected to manage that state-

                           owned utility Electricite de Guinee (EDG), except for component 3 that will be implemented by the
                           Ministry of Energy. EDG has experience working with the Bank through the Electricity Sector
                           Efficiency Improvement Project (ESEIP). With respect to components 1 and 2, the management
                           contractor’s responsibilities will include implementation of safeguards.
