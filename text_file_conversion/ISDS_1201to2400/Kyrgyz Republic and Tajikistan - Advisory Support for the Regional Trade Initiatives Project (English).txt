B. Project Objectives
The development objective of the proposed project is to facilitate the preparation of the
CASA-1000 project and other possible regional energy trade initiatives for the Kyrgyz
Republic and Tajikistan.

C. Project Description
The proposed grant will be used to support participation of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in the
meeting for CASA-1000 and other regional initiatives and to provide continued financing for the
country advisors of these countries. The proposed project will include the following main components:

Component 1: Technical Assistance (indicative amount of US$450,000). This component will consist
of two key activities:

(i) Support to the Governments and the working groups to advance the CASA-1000
groundwork by financing country advisors with technical, commercial, legal, environmental
and social and other necessary expertise. The country advisors will support the development
of commercial agreements, ancillary framework documents (e.g. Technical Code to define
operating parameters of the transmission system), agreements on the Account Bank
Agreement to manage funds flow, and Operations and Maintenance Agreements;

(ii) Support to other inter- and intraregional energy trade initiatives by financing relevant
assessments, studies, consultation with stakeholders and public outreach.

Component 2: Operating Costs (indicative amount of US$150,000). This component will cover
operating costs (travel and other logistical expenses) for Kyrgyz and Tajik delegates to facilitate the
dialogue and development of regional energy trade initiatives (ongoing or future) and incremental
operating expenses for the Project Implementation Units.



D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if
known)
The project will provide technical assistance to the Governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and
Tajikistan. As such, it will not have a specific project location. The project will not involve any types
of works (including construction works).
 E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

 The project implementation units have some safeguards capacity built through the implementation of
 World Bank funded projects that have involved construction works.
