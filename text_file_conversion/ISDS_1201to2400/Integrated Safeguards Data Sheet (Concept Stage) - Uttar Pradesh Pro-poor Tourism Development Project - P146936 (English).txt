                           The project development objective is to improve living standards and increase income opportunities
                           for the poor population living in/and close to the primary tourism attractions of the Buddhist Circuit
                           and the Braj-Agra Corridor.

                           The project will also assist the Government of Uttar Pradesh to restructure its tourism sector in a pro-
                         poor manner by (i) providing public services to poor communities living in some of the state’s
                         heritage rich, but lagging areas, (ii) enhancing the management of the state’s natural and cultural
                         assets as endogenous sources of inclusive development, and (iii) enabling private sector investments

                         and associated job creation (e.g. for youth and women). The project is expected to inform
                         policymakers in other states while responding to the Indian Ministry of Tourism’s request for a
                         demonstration project on pro-poor tourism policies and investments.
                         C. Project Description
                         1. Description

                         The project will support the state’s plans for restructuring its tourism sector in a pro-poor manner
                         with a view to increasing benefits to local communities and improving the management of its tourism
                         destinations. Many developing countries have recognized pro-poor tourism as an effective means of
                         reducing poverty and becoming a driver for a more inclusive economic growth, as well as a means of
                         contributing to steward their heritage assets (see Annex 1). Tourism’s pro-poor potential relies on the
                         fact that, when well-planned and managed, it is consumed at the point of production, is labor
                         intensive, and can finance basic services in backward areas often overlooked by traditional tourism
                         development schemes.

                         At its core, the project emphasizes the government’s key role in structuring and regulating tourism
                         development for its adequate growth in a pro-poor manner. Experience shows that the greatest
                         impediment to pro-poor benefits from tourism is not the type or size of tourism, but the way the
                         tourism sector is structured, its approach to development, supply chains, linkages and expenditure
                         reach. Governments also have a central role to play in removing bottlenecks to private sector critical
                         investments in tourism through adequate policies, regulations and focused public investment.

                         The pro-poor approach adopted by the project also aims at catalyzing the impact of key sectors in a
                         given area, such as accessibility/connectivity, environmental preservation, asset management and
                         business development on local communities. The project will do so by promoting an integrated area-
Public Disclosure Copy




                         based approach in which tourist destinations and their iconic heritage assets are planned, promoted,
                         served, stewarded and linked geographically. This area-based approach also allows for improved
                         understanding of a given area’s potential and linkages with other industries, the strengthening of the
                         skills of the local population, and the promotion of small-scale entrepreneurship, especially amongst
                         poor women and youth.

                         Such an approach has been deployed successfully in other circuits and routes worldwide, which
                         originally faced similar challenges. The project design and components build upon the lessons
                         learned and experience from these and other similar experiences. Based on lessons learned from
                         programs worldwide, five main principles will guide the projects’ investments, as follows:

                         �        Cluster initiatives by destination. Tourism is multisectoral but most tourism projects tend to
                         focus on sectoral interventions (i.e., hotel development), overlooking the totality of investments
                         required for a destination’s development. By geographically clustering investments and providing the
                         destinations with an investment package comprising of branding and promotion, services and
                         infrastructure, institutional strengthening and local economic support, pro-poor tourism investments
                         often contribute to increase synergies and sustainability of actions.

                         �       Target visitors with higher inducement value (proportion of spend that reaches the poor)
                         instead of just higher spending. Large influxes of revenue—usually brought by international tourists
                         —are often captured by elites and operators, often increasing inequalities at a destination. Thinking
                         needs to shift to metrics by which policymakers judge tourism’s success on the proportion of tourist
                         spending that reaches the poor.

                         �       Focus on domestic and regional rather than international tourists. Tourism policy and
                         products development in India, including UP, focuses on foreign tourists, but these are actually the
                         minority. Regional tourism in South Asia is a large and rapidly growing market: Ind ian travelers by
                         far make up the largest number of tourists in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
                         Although spending less per-capita, these tourists are more in volume, can have a greater inducement
                         and can have a proportionately larger effect on poverty reduction.

                         �        Disperse the geographic, temporal and economic distribution of tourism to surrounding
                         communities, which decreases the stress on tourist destinations, infrastructure, fragile environments
                         and cultures, and allows for a wider range of communities to benefit from tourism. Spreading out the
                         seasonality of tourism allows for more stable profits as well as facilitates planning for both
                         destinations and businesses. Facilitating the creation of Micro, Small and Medium Tourism
                         Enterprises (MSMTEs) in surrounding communities increases the distribution of tourism revenues,
                         generating additional income opportunities for local communities.

                         �        Reinforce sustainability. Sustainability principles refer to the environmental, economic, and
                         socio-cultural aspects of tourism development, and the need to achieve a suitable long-term balance.
                         Most destinations continue to focus on increasing tourist numbers and their spending, which while
                         important, need to be carefully managed to ensure they improve the lives of residents, benefit the
                         built and natural environment and increase the enjoyment of the tourists. Pro-poor tourism has shown
                         to strive to sustain its benefits for future generations.

                         2. Project Components

                         The project has four components, which will be further refined during preparation. These are:

                         Component 1 – Destination Planning and Governance aims at strengthening the policies, systems,
                         tools and capacities of concerned state and local government agencies and civil society for the
                         integrated development and management of the project target areas, through:
                         i)        Review of state tourism policy and regulations centered on poverty reduction
                         ii)       Development of tourism statistics and information system
                         i)        Development of a vision and ”storyline” for each project target area, including branding,
                         promotion and marketing
                         ii)       Preparation of integrated tourism development plans (in a participatory manner) based on
                         tourist products potentials for promoting local development and the sites’ heritage, social and
                         environmental vulnerabilities with operation and maintenance (O&M) plans
                         iii)      Preparation of communication campaign aimed at community (e.g., in local schools), visitors
                         (e.g., in airports and sites) and tour operators sensitization
                         iv)       Capacity strengthening of government officials and other relevant agencies on pro-poor
                         tourism approaches and management, including tourism statistics

                         Component 2 – Tourist Products Development & Management aims at supporting new tourist
                         products in the project target areas based on the following criteria, as per global standards: (i) income
                         earner/poverty impact, (ii) heritage significance, (iii) status of conservation, and (iv) investment
                         sustainability. Key investments will be done in (i) tourist assets/attractions enhancement, (ii)
                         interpretation, (iii) promotion of new activities (e.g. museums, meditation halls, festivals), (iv)
                         services provision (e.g. accommodation, sanitation), (v) access improvement (e.g. roads,
                         transportation), and (vi) training (e.g. guides, hotel staff), among others.

                         Component 3 – Support to Local Creative Economies aims at improving business development and
                         entrepreneurs’ skills and participation in tourism products and markets in the project target areas,
                         through (i) support for Tourism Cluster Analysis, (ii) access to financing, improved technology and
                         skills for entrepreneurs/small firms (including from the informal sector) to develop and implement
                         quality business plans, increase productivity, and become certified, and (iii) access to financing,
                         improved technology, coordination (consortia) and skills for business development service providers
                         through public private dialogue (PPD) to improve quality of services provided and diffuse
                         information on tourism business opportunities and market development

                         Component 4 – Project Management will finance a dedicated team (the State Project Coordination
                         Unit – SPCU) to be based in Lucknow and responsible for overall management, accountability and
                         coordination of the project’s activities and funds. The SPCU will be supported by competitively
                         selected decentralized technical support units (TSU) based in each of the core project areas to ensure
                         the necessary coordination with concerned local stakeholders (from the Urban Local Bodies and
                         Municipal Corporations to cultural authorities, community and local business associations), and thus
                         a smooth implementation of the project investments in the area. The SPCU and the decentralized
                         dedicated site teams will be supported by also competitively recruited experts, as needed. The proje
                         ct will finance salaries, expert services as well as operating costs (e.g. rent, vehicles, equipment,
                         workshops and training). The project will also finance monitoring and impact evaluation activities as
                         well as project-specific communication activities at sites,state, country and regional levels.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The Uttar Pradesh Pro-Poor Tourism Development Project will target its investments in the hubs and
                         surrounding areas of the two main tourist areas in the state – the Braj Agra Corridor and the Buddhist
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Circuit. The proposed project targeted destinations are: (i) Agra, Mathura, Vrindavan, Barsana,
                         Nandgaon, Gokul-Mahavan, Baldeo and Govardhan in the Braj Region, and (ii) Varanasi, Sarnath
                         and Kushinagar and Sravasti in the Buddhist Circuit.

                         Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, has also the largest number of destinations in India with
                         religious, cultural, historical significance that attracts yearly a millions of pilgrims and tourists. Agra
                         city, for instance, is home to three World Heritage Sites, including the iconic Taj Mahal – the India
                         image to the world. Sarnath and Khushinagar are two of the four main Buddhists sites in the world.
                         Sub projects will be located in the surroundings of these cultural and historic sites, and may be
                         located in sensitive zones such as TajGanj. Hence impacts of building infrastructure in these areas
                         will need to be assessed and the appropriate environmental and social mitigation measures, including
                         cultural properties management will be integrated in the project design.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The overall management of the project will reside with the Uttar Pradesh State Tourism Department.
                         A State Project Coordination Unit (SPCU) will be established within the Tourism Department in
                         Lucknow for overall management and coordination with relevant national agencies and state and
                         local government departments. The SPCU will be supported by competitively selected decentralized
                         teams to be located in the main hubs of the project target areas, responsible for the day-to-day
                         coordination, technical support and oversight of investments at local and site level. The UP Tourism
                           Department has not implemented investment projects supported by the World Bank. Hence their
                           capacity in safeguard policies implementation is weak; as so strengthening of the implementing
                           agencies safeguard capacities will be carried out during project preparation and implementation

                           through deployment of qualified Safeguard Specialists. A close monitoring of triggered safeguard
                           policies and provisions of applicable laws during project preparation and implementation along with
                           adequate staffing of the selected SPCU and decentralized teams with both social and environmental
                           staff will be ensured.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
                                  The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                      Given that the project target areas contains World Heritage Sites, presence of nationally
                                      designated historic and cultural properties, and environmentally sensitive zones, and the
                                      possibility of impact on natural habitats the project is categorized ”Category is A”. The final
                                      category will be defined during appraisal. A project level Environmental and Social Management
                                      Framework (ESMF) will be developed during project preparation to provide guidance on cultural
                                      properties, environmental and social management aspects from the design, execution and
                                      operation of the works and investments to be financed under the project, while enhancing the
                                      expected positive impacts of project activities.

                                      Once sub projects are identified during preparation, investment specific Cultural, Environmental
                                      and Social Impact Assessments (CESIA) will be undertaken to address investment specific
                                      impacts and prepare mitigation measures and site specific plans, applying provisions of ESMF.
                                      The ESMF and the investment specific ESIA (for first year of projects) will require about 4
                                      months for preparation, and will be completed prior to appraisal, by which time PAD Stage ISDS
                                      would be prepared.
