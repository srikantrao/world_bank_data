    2. Project Objectives
     To support the adoption of improved technologies for food production and storage, and
    ·provide cash or food to eligible beneficiaries in South Sudan.

    3. Project Description
    Component 1- Support to Agricultural Productivity: This component seeks to increase
    farmers' own production and to improve postharvest handling and management of food
    crops. This component would support provision of inputs (seeds and tools), technical
    advice on production and postharvest management, and construction of low-cost food
    banks and granaries at household and community levels.

     Component 2- Strengthening Community Safety Nets: This component provides support
    for a safety net program that targets food insecure households. The program will be based
    on a flexible and differentiated targeting approach where in some areas, beneficiaries will
    be required to participate in high priority public\works in exchange for food or cash,
    while in others (depending on the need and prevailing circumstances), beneficiaries,
    identified based on predetermined criteria through a facilitated process, will be provided
    direct food support.
 Component 3- Support to Project Implementation: This component finances
administrative costs of the Project Coordination Unit, including, procurement,
monitoring, reporting and evaluation of activities under the project.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will be located in the following States: Western Equatoria, Central Equatoria,
Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Lakes, Upper Nile, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Jonglei. As
need ari~es, the project will be scaled to other states with food insecurity hotspots.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Activities planned under this additional financing and restructuring will not trigger any
new safeguard policies other than those previously triggered (OP 4.01, OP 4.04, OP4.09,
OP4.36, OP4.10 and OP4.12). The environmental and social assessment carried out for
this project r'eveals that the project activities are small in size and generating considerable
socio-economic benefits to the farmers and the communities in the project areas. No
significant irreversible environmental and social impacts from project activities are
envisaged. The anticipated adverse social and environmental impacts would be limited
and~it is possible to mitigate these through implementation of appropriate environmental
and social safeguards instruments.

 The national Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF)
discussed by the Bank EDson March 28, 2013 is applicable to this project. Relevant
safeguards instruments namely Pest Management Plan (PMP), Environmental and Social
Assessment (ESA), Environmental and Social Management Framework.(ESMF) and RPF
were prepared and disclosed in-country and at the Bank's Info Shop on May 21, 2013 and
August 30, 2013 respectively.
    OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples is triggered as analysis by World Bank and other
  experts confirms that the overwhelming majority of people in the project area are
  expected to meet the requirements of OP 4.1 0. The project complies with the
  requirements of OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples as the implementation arrangements at
, the field level embed the basic principles of OP 4.10 of a free, prior, and informed
  consultation leading to broad community support for the proposed Project through a
  vulnerability approach, targeting of the poorest and a functioning grievance redress
  mechanism. Per the requirements of OP 4.1 0, no separate IPP is to be prepared.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No significant indirect and/or long-term impacts associated with this additional financing
and restructuring are expected.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
A national Environmental and Social Screening and-Assessment Framework (ESSAF)
was discussed by the Bank EDson March 28, 2013,,and r
                                                         is applicable
                                                             .
                                                                       to this additional
financing project. The ESSAF will guide the management of the environmental and
social impacts during implementation, in addition to the safeguards instruments that have
been prepared. The borrower has prepared PMP, ESA, RPF, and,'ESMF and disclosed in-
country and infoshop.                  '

 In order to offset/minimize the anticipated environmental and social impacts due to the
implementation of the proposed AF, the Borrower will commit to undertake the
following: a) to use and implement all guidelines and procedures indicated in the ESSAF
and ensure their use as the safeguards instrument by implementing NGOs, during
implementation of project activities. b) to use and implement the ESA, ESMF, ESMP,
RPF and PMP. The Bank implementation support mission also confirmed that
environmental and social screening of the subprojects is routinely performed, in a manner
consistent with EMSF and RPF, and ESMPs are developed for subprojects as required.
The subprojects have not required preparation of a RAP to date.

 The Environmental and Social Safeguards Officer in the PCU will oversee overall
safeguards implementation for this AF.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the m~chanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders will include the: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Tourism, Animal
Resources, Cooperatives and Rural Development and the communities residing in and
around the project area.
  Consultations were undertaken to facilitate stakeholder involvement and awareness
during preparation of ESMF, ESA, RPF, PMP and ESMPs and this will continue through
project implementation to ensure that the information required· for decision making is
available to all interested parties. The National ESSAF ESMF, ESA, RPF and PMP are
available to relevant ministries, implementing partners, communities and N GOs at local
level.
