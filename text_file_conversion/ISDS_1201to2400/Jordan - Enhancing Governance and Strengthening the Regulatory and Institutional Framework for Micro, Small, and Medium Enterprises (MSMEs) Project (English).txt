  II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management .

  l. Desca·ibe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with. the proposed project. Identify and
  describe any potential large scale; significant and/or irreversible impacts:

  No environmental or social safeguards institutional capacity needs to be a~sessed. An
  Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been developed for the
  Jordan MSME Development for Inclusive Growth Project to identify, minimize, avoid, screen
  out•.mitigate and monitor potential social and environmental impacts in compliance with both
  World Bank policies and Jordan's applicable laws and regulations. The ESMF has been
  disclosed and adopted by the Central Bank· of Jordan (CBJ).              '


  Similarly, the sector's enviromnental institutional c~pacity was assessed in preparation for the
  Jordan MSME Development for Inclusive Growth project. Because this project does not
  finance any subprojects and consists exclusively of t~chnical assistance, it is likely to have ·
  lniniinal or no adverse impacts. Nonetheless, it is highly suggested that capacity building of
  financial intermediaries include training on the application of Jordan's Ministry of
  Environment's EIA regulation 37/2005 to sub-project screening and standard mitigation
  procedures.

 impacts.
