                           on CSA website and World Bank’s InfoShop. The post-consultation ESMF report was re-posted

                           Overall it was confirmed by the municipality officials of all four urban centers where the Branch
                           Offices are to be constructed (Ambo, Hawassa, Bahir Dar and Mekelle) that their requirements
                           aligned well with what is stipulated in the World Bank ESMF requirements, as it was mandatory
                           for these municipalities that the site for such construction should be on ‘unoccupied’ land, which
                           will not involve the displacement and resettlement of people.
