                           B. Project Objectives
                           The Development Objective of the PROP is to enable the participating Pacific Island Countries to
                           capture greater economic benefits from sustainable management of the region’s oceanic and coastal
                           fisheries, and the critical habitats that sustain them. By supporting regional collaboration and the
                           adoption of rights-based approaches to resource access and use, the PROP will directly contribute to
                           the larger goals of regional integration and sustainable wealth creation among PICs.
                         In order to achieve the PDO, the program will support continued and strengthened collaboration
                         among PICS, and between PICs and other states, to reduce the open access conditions and

                         management inefficiencies that have led to overexploitation of the oceanic and coastal fishery
                         resources, and to build on the experience and knowledge being generated in the region to strengthen
                         institutional capacity and improve management effectiveness. The project will also assist in the
                         development and implementation of more effective management and monitoring, control and
                         surveillance (MCS) tools at national and regional levels, and, in the process, generate significantly
                         increased economic and social benefits for the region that can be sustained over the long term.
                         C. Project Description
                         In order to achieve the above objective, the Program will include the following components, sub-
                         components and activities available for all participating countries. These will form a menu of
                         activities the Program could support in each country, which would be chosen based on the specific
                         local context. Some activities will be implemented at the national level, while others will be
                         implemented at the regional level to capture economies of scale. All activities in this menu would
                         contribute to the shared regional objective of the PROP, even if implemented nationally. As such, the
                         Program follows the subsidiarity principle, whereby a common approach is coordinated at the
                         regional level, but implemented both regionally and nationally in order to show concrete results on
                         the ground. The legal agreements with each country therefore reflect the specific activities of PROP
                         Phase I described in Annexes 3 through 7.

                         Component 1: Sustainable Management of Oceanic Fisheries

                         The objective of this component is to help participating Pacific Island Countries sustainably increase
                         the net economic benefits provided to them by the region’s purse seine and long-line tuna fisheries.

                         Oceanic fisheries hold great economic potential for the Pacific, and particularly the three tuna
                         fisheries: tropical purse seine, tropical long-line and southern long-line fisheries. To date these

                         fisheries are relatively healthy compared to other tuna fisheries throughout the world, due largely to
                         their relative isolation. However, they are now reaching their long-term sustainable limits, and future
                         returns will have to come by earning more from current harvests, rather than increasing them. This is
                         eminently possible, but, because the fish are moving across borders, will require continued collective
                         action from countries to manage the resource.

                         The tropical purse seine fishery targeting skipjack tuna is a great example (this represents over half
                         of the tuna catch in the Pacific). The PNA countries introduced in 2009 a vessel day scheme (VDS)
                         to manage access to the fishery. It works as follows: each year the PNA countries set the total catch
                         limit needed to maintain healthy fish stock, and translate that catch limit into individual vessel
                         fishing days, which are allocated to countries based on an agreed formula, and then the countries sell
                         the days. The vessels days are valuable because they limit catch to sustainable levels of production
                         and this scarcity has value that can be traded. Prior to the introduction of the VDS, PNA countries
                         captured little of the value of the tuna caught in their waters. As a result of introducing the VDS and
                         subsequently a benchmark price, the price of a vessel day increased from US$1500 in 2010 to US
                         $5000 in 2013, and total revenues to PNA countries increased from US$60 M in 2010 to US$240 M
                         in 2013 (still less than 10% value of catch). This is only the value of access – and not potential
                         additional benefits from local value added. Nor is this the end of the story – a number of experts
                         believe that the price of vessel days can continue to climb, and this fishery could sustainably return
                         over US$350 million per year to Pacific Island countries.
                         For the tropical tuna and southern albacore long-line fisheries, a similar system to the VDS could be
                         introduced to enhance the management of access, significantly enhancing the value of this natural

                         capital asset and the benefits that it can provide to Pacific Island countries.

                         Building on results to date in the PNA, such a process of enhancing the sustainable management of
                         Pacific Island tuna fisheries and the benefits that they provide the region could be envisaged as
                         follows:

                         Strengthen both the sustainable management and value of access to Pacific Island tuna fisheries, and
                         the portion of this value captured by the region:

                         o        Improve compliance with the VDS for the purse seine fishery: Maintain robust limits on
                         fishing (by ensuring compliance with vessel days and associated links to total catch limits) – so total
                         catch stays within recommended limits, allowing the fish stock to stay healthy. Tuna is the region’s
                         natural capital asset, and the bigger the fish stock the more valuable access to it will be – particularly
                         as much of the rest of the world is overexploiting its tuna. Conversely, selling vessel days outside of
                         agreed levels in the VDS, or excessive capital stuffing within vessel day allocations (e.g. using
                         bigger and more efficient vessels to increase catch per vessel day) not only depresses the price of
                         other vessel days on the market but also threatens the long-term sustainability of the natural resource.

                         o        Expand the coverage of the purse seine fishery VDS and extend a similar system to the long-
                         line fisheries, to include all tuna caught in Pacific Island countries’ national waters. As a result, a
                         greater portion of the region’s resource would be utilized via this management regime.

                         o        Increase efficiency and flexibility of the purse seine fishery VDS and similar systems for the
                         long-line fisheries. With a healthy fish stock and valuable asset, many additional opportunities
                         emerge to increase the returns to countries by increasing the efficiency of access to fleets via systems
                         such as the VDS, including: (a) pooling vessel days among countries to allow operators to enter
Public Disclosure Copy




                         multiple countries’ waters at once, (b) selling days through competitive tenders and auctions, and (c)
                         extending the lifespan of access over multiple years, so operators and investors have more visibility
                         and security. To address any concerns about the stability of revenue flows, adjustments to the VDS
                         and similar systems can be made with better data sharing and more transparency, for example setting
                         aside a reserve of vessel days for countries that need them, to be purchased at the benchmark price.

                         Ensure an equitable distribution within Pacific Island countries of the benefits of a more valuable
                         natural capital asset:

                         o        A healthy natural asset and an efficient and robust access regime provide a stable
                         environment for capital investments in value chain improvements and market specialization,
                         increasing the opportunities Pacific Island countries will have to leverage access fees and agreements
                         for local investment in value added and processing, e.g. through preferential sale to joint ventures.
                         With a robust management system for fish supply like the VDS for purse seine tuna fishery, more
                         and more local investments become possible, such as IFC’s recent investment to help expand
                         processing capacity of SolTuna in the Solomon Islands. Of course not all Pacific Island countries are
                         the same and some will have different comparative advantages, so investment in value addition may
                         take different forms in different contexts, and may very likely contribute towards regional hubs for
                         different services. In some cases trade-offs will need to be made at national level between collection
                         of economic rents from access to the resource and investment in local value added activities.
                         o       Additionally, countries could explore options to create community VDS funds to target the
                         benefits of returns from access directly to coastal communities.

                         To help Pacific Island countries realize these opportunities, the following activities could be
                         supported by the PROP:

                         1.1 Strengthen both the sustainable management and value of access to Pacific Island tuna fisheries,
                         and the portion of this value captured by the region

                         These activities would support strengthening the vessel day scheme (VDS) for the purse seine fishery
                         and extending a similar management system to the long-line fisheries, in order to sustainably
                         increase the benefits to participating countries from access to these fisheries. More specifically, this
                         sub-component would finance the following activities:

                         o       Block grants to national fisheries agencies to build capacity for strengthened management
                         measures. This activity would provide grants directly to implementing agencies of national
                         governments to reimburse against pre-identified eligible expenditures that build capacity for
                         strengthened management of the tuna fisheries. Such eligible expenditures will be tracked, and all
                         procurement carried out would be subject to World Bank procurement guidelines, and PROP
                         safeguard instruments would also apply to these expenditures. Grants would be disbursed annually to
                         national government implementing agencies in each participating country to reimburse these eligible
                         expenditures, based on independent third-party verification that the following indicators have been
                         met (expenditures for each indicator are priced equally):

                         assistance provided by FFA in coordination with the PNAO, to participating countries for
                         implementation of the PROP. This activity would support a technical team to lead and coordinate a
                         number of assessments, studies, trainings, mentoring etc. as requested by participating countries, in
                         order to achieve the PROP’s objectives. Such assistance is expected to include, among others,
                         conducting economic analyses and preparing briefing materials to increase the understanding among
                         stakeholders of the benefits of a robust VDS, assisting in the development of any revisions or
                         additions to legal frameworks that may be needed (e.g. to enforce the VDS), and a conducting a
                         rolling regional review of the functions and services required to manage tuna fisheries and identify
                         opportunities for regional, sub-regional and national level location and provision of fisheries
                         management services (e.g. management, science, monitoring and surveillance and enforcement hubs,
                         etc.).

                         o        Technical assistance to identify surveillance and enforcement tasks and needs for countries
                         to collaborate to ensure compliance with the VDS, and a network of compliance experts to support
                         countries’ in this effort. This activity would build upon the current regional fisheries monitoring,
                         control and surveillance (MCS) strategy and effort at FFA in order to support:(i) a regional
                         identification of the key surveillance and enforcement tasks for ensuring compliance with the VDS,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         and the c omparative advantage of various countries to conduct these tasks in collaboration, as part of
                         sub-regional and regional efforts; and (ii) a regional unit and network of compliance experts that
                         could provide on-demand support to participating countries for surveillance and enforcement of the
                         VDS.

                         1.2 Ensure an equitable distribution within Pacific Island countries of the benefits of a more valuable
                         natural capital asset

                         These activities would support Pacific Island countries to make informed decisions and investments
                         to ensure an inclusive distribution of the benefits from increased tuna access revenues. This would
                         include collaboration with IFC to leverage access values to a healthy resource, into local investments
                         up the value chain where feasible, that can increase employment. Similarly, this would include
                         piloting local VDS funds to channel access revenues directly to fishing communities.

                         •        Regional Activities
                         o        Regional technical advisory services for the establishment of hubs throughout the Western
                         Pacific for services and value addition. This activity would support technical advisory services to
                         identify the competitive advantage of participating countries to establish regional hubs for various
                         services and value addition along the chain (e.g. fish quality assurance, processing, distribution and
                         providing services), linked to reforms for strengthening the VDS. Additionally, this activity would
                         include ongoing support to participating countries to develop the various opportunities identified, and
                         to secure the necessary finance and private partners in order to implement them.

                         o       Pilot Community VDS funds. This activity would support FFA to provide technical
                         assistance to conduct participatory scenario analyses to design pilot community VDS funds whose
                         objectives would be secure a share of tuna access revenues for fishing communities in participating
                         countries, by purchasing vessel days. This would include establishment and capitalization of pilot
                         community VDS funds based on the results of the scenario analyses.

                         Component 2: Sustainable Management of Coastal Fisheries

                         The objective of this component would be to support participating countries to sustainably increase
                         the benefits they receive from defined coastal fisheries, focusing on those with the greatest potential,
                         i.e. coastal fisheries such as bêche-de-mer (BDM) that (i) can generate export earnings for the
                         country, and/or (ii) support livelihoods, food security and dietary health.

                         Coastal and lagoon fisheries throughout the region are critically important to many Pacific island
                         States with few other sources of protein. It is estimated that fish provide 50 – 90 percent of animal
                         protein intake in rural areas and 40 – 80 percent in urban areas. Most of the fish eaten by rural
                         communities (particularly on the coral atolls and smaller islands) come from subsistence fisheries,
                         with little or no cash cost to the consumer. Subsistence fisheries generally employ 10 to 20 times as
                         many people as commercial fisheries.

                         A diverse range of coastal fishery opportunities exist in the region: in some cases exploitation
                         pressure is low and the management goal is to encourage development of the fishery while protecting
                         resource sustainability for the future. In others, especially where there is easy access to markets,
                         over-fishing has already occurred and the fishery is performing sub-optimally. In these case s there is
                         a need to rebuild resources and effectively control the fisheries based on them to achieve optimal
                         biological or economic yields. This is perhaps most true for the high-value BDM fishery. BDM is a
Public Disclosure Copy




                         product that is harvested in all Pacific Island countries, almost exclusively for export to Asian
                         markets and Asian communities elsewhere. The BDM fishery is analogous in some ways to the
                         purse seine tuna fishery, in that a handful of Pacific Island countries now control a large share of a
                         global commodity for which demand exceeds supply. A 2013 study estimated the value of BDM
                         exports from 5 Pacific Island countries (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and
                         Tonga) to average US$17.4 million over the past 10 years, and that this value could have been at
                         least doubled through improved management (Hambrey et al, 2013). An earlier study estimated
                         average annual BDM exports from Australia and the Central Western Pacific islands during 2004–
                         2008 at about US$52 million (Purcell et al., 2009). That study notes that ‘many of these fisheries are
                         suffering unsustainable levels of exploitation, to the point of local extinctions of some species and
                         consequently impacting the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishers’.

                         To support sustainable increased benefits from targeted coastal fisheries such as BDM, this
                         component would largely be implemented nationally, with regional coordination activities to link
                         products to markets.

                         2.1     Sustainable Management of Targeted Coastal Fisheries


                         These activities would be implemented nationally in each participating country by the relevant
                         Government agency. The agency would provide dedicated technical assistance and small goods and
                         operating costs to communities to strengthen management and value addition
                         around targeted coastal fisheries, in many cases recruiting a partner such as a local non-government
Public Disclosure Copy




                         organization (NGO). Once the partner is recruited to provide this support, they would conduct the
                         following activities:

                         o         Identify the coastal fisheries targeted for support, including collection of baseline
                         information, i.e. initial biological and socio-economic assessments as needed to determine resource
                         potential and likely costs and benefits of different scenarios for rebuilding or improved management.
                         This program of extension support to improve management and returns from targeted coastal
                         fisheries will identify those fisheries and sites for support following a period of awareness-raising
                         and wide advertising to give interested communities a chance to come forward. Those sites with
                         valuable coastal fisheries and strong local commitment will be selected based on the following
                         criteria:
                         - The fishery or fisheries to be managed are well-defined (i.e. within a distinct geographic boundary,
                         for a particular species or group of species, or for a stock);
                         -         Each site must have the potential to accrue positive economic benefits to stakeholders
                         through improved fisheries management;
                         -         Each site must not encompass more than 3 to 4 small to moderate-sized communities, which
                         must be neighboring communities;
                         -         Each site must have strong local leadership, be socially cohesive, and ideally have a
                         stakeholder group or association formed that could be recognized with authority to formulate
                         management measures on behalf of stakeholders; and
                         -         Each site must provide formal confirmation that fishers in the targeted fishery are fully
                         committed to participate in the management and project.

                         o       Support the development or strengthening of stakeholder groups and associations to
                         participate in the sustainable management, and in some cases rebuilding, of these fisheries, including:
                         ensuring legal recognition and empowerment of the groups and their management/ use rights,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         providing extension and training to support organization and operation of the groups

                         o         Assist these stakeholder groups to develop and implement improved management
                         approaches appropriate to the circumstances and needs of the fishery, relying mainly on the
                         development or strengthening of Community-Based Management (CBM) systems, or on co-
                         management arrangements involving communities, government and other stakeholders. In others,
                         particularly for high-value export products, CBM may not provide all the tools needed for effective
                         management and there may need to be additional f ishery monitoring, control and surveillance
                         (MCS) carried out at provincial or national level. The stakeholder groups would be supported assess
                         the current situation and options for strengthening management of the resource and subsequently
                         returns, in some cases developing rebuilding plans for the fish stocks, drawing upon good
                         experiences throughout the region, such as the locally-managed marine area (LMMA) network.
                         Ongoing training and support would be provided to stakeholder groups for development and
                         implementation of management measures (such as identification and development of ecosystem-
                         based management measures, monitoring of fish catch and effort, etc.), supporting restocking or
                         artificial resource enhancement where feasible and justified, and providing any enforcement support
                         needed to ensure compliance (especially at the point of export).

                         o       Link products from the fisheries managed by stakeholder groups to regional markets,
                         including providing technical assistance and training for skills development, as well as small goods
                         and works for local value addition. This support would likely focus on development and coordination
                         of processing and packaging technologies, development of value-added products, market
                         diversification including certification and eco-labeling, compliance with food safety and other
Public Disclosure Copy




                         technical requirements of target markets, sharing of trade and market information, capacity-building
                         in small business and enterprise management, and cooperation in marketing arrangements and
                         information-sharing across communities and countries.

                         o        Monitoring to assess changes in the status of the resource and the economic status of
                         activities based on it, evaluate the performance of the management strategies adopted, and allow the
                         adaptation and improvement of these strategies.

                         2.2 Linking Sustainable Coastal Fish Products to Regional Markets

                         These activities would be implemented regionally, via a sub-grant to the SPC:

                         o        In parallel with national efforts to restore BDM fisheries, mediate the formation of a regional
                         or sub-regional BDM fishery grouping to advance the economic interests of participating PI
                         countries. Regional technical assistance and convening would be provided to harmonize economic
                         and other management arrangements, developing minimum terms and conditions of resource access,
                         establishing a regional register of responsible/ compliant BDM industry participants, maximizing the
                         leverage available through collective bargaining and action, and promoting exchange of technical
                         information in support of national-level management initiatives. The proposed arrangement would
                         mainly be of interest to the main BDM-producing Pacific Island countries (those of Melanesia) but,
                         as with PNA, countries with lower levels of production would also benefit from the bargaining power
                         generated by the larger producers. The proposed BDM arrangement will almost certainly be built on
                         an existing regional or sub-regional grouping of countries, and may ultimately be extended to cover
                         other coastal fishery resources, particularly trochus, another high-value export product.

                         o        Ongoing technical support to countries with BDM and coastal fisheries management (e.g. a
Public Disclosure Copy




                         ‘BDM task force’), including support to assess potential biological, economic and fiscal management
                         to ols for BDM and other export-oriented coastal fishery products, which could be applied at the
                         national level as part of an integrated suite of management arrangements that involve both CBM and
                         MCS. This would also include periodically updated assessments of BDM production, price and
                         market trends and other industry monitoring and intelligence; and development of fishery monitoring
                         tools that can be deployed at national level to enable performance assessment of fishery management
                         and development activities, and training of national staff from participating countries in their use.
                         These tools may possibly be based in part on the fishery monitoring ‘dashboards’ already developed
                         by the Bank for other countries/ regions.

                         Component 3: Sustainable Financing of the Conservation of Critical Fishery Habitats

                         1.       The objective of this component would be to help strengthen and develop models of sus
                         tainable financing for the conservation of critical habitats that underpin oceanic and coastal fisheries
                         in the region, following the guiding principles of the Pacific Oceanscape Framework. Towards this
                         objective, the component would include both regional and national activities that: (i) establish a
                         Pacific Marine Conservation Development Fund to support the establishment of large scale oceanic
                         marine protected areas (MPAs), including financing mechanisms for cost and benefit sharing; and (ii)
                         establish a pilot Pacific Blue Carbon regional program, to support financing for the conservation of
                         small to medium scale marine habitats. This component would be executed by the Oceanscape Unit
                         within the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, with guidance from the Marine Sector Working Group.

                         3.1     Establish a Pacific Marine Conservation Development Fund to support the establishment of
Public Disclosure Copy




                         large scale oceanic MPAs, including mechanisms for cost and benefit sharing

                         The Pacific Oceanscape Framework aims to support integrated ocean management at all scales that
                         results in the sustainable development, management and conservation of island, coastal and ocean
                         services – notably through conservation of key natural habitats that support the oceanic and coastal
                         fisheries targeted in components one and two. This component will contribute to the Framework and
                         these fisheries by helping to establish a regional financing mechanism to help capture the benefits
                         accruing to the international community from the conservation of natural habitats with biodiversity
                         of global significance, as well as support key local and regional fisheries.

                         2.        This sub-component will support detailed analysis, technical assistance, and the
                         establishment of financing mechanisms necessary to determine the costs and benefits of proposed
                         protected areas to conserve natural habitats, and enable protected area host States to mitigate any
                         conservation costs through trading of costs and benefits with adjacent coastal States and distant water
                         fishing States, and the development of ecosystem service markets. More specifically, the PROP
                         would support the development of a Pacific Marine Conservation Development Fund to provide
                         Pacific island States with market-based options to avoid, minimize or mitigate any loss in revenue
                         caused by the establishment of large scale marine protected areas, provided that such areas are
                         designed and managed to deliver both ecological and sustainable net economic benefits to the
                         countries. Market-based mechanisms for conservation provide one of the more realistic opportunities
                         for financial sustainability. Other potential options that depend on attracting and administering large
                         initial grants are at the mercy of fundraising/foundation conservation trends and have so far proven
                         highly problematic. Many previous attempts to establish large scale marine protected areas have
                         been challenged by concerns that closures will reduce critical fishing revenue. Given the importance
                         of fishing revenue to national budgets, some Pacific island States may justifiably be concerned that
                         they are taking a risk with high consequences – regardless of the low likelihood of adverse costs. In

                         some cases, marine protected area proposals have relied on the establishment of compensatory funds
                         to mitigate the perceived or actual costs from closing areas to commercial fishing. However, such
                         proposals can be difficult to implement successfully unless a business model can be developed that
                         raises funds from an explicit service or a value that is created from the closure. In this case, a
                         successful business model requires the creation of a service or value, and the existence or creation of
                         a market, or a taxa ble funding source. For example, a protected area over a reef that provides a high
                         value and accessible diving experience could be funded through a direct fee-for-service or tax on
                         divers, or commercial dive-operators. Similarly, a protected area over an importa nt habitat for
                         juvenile fish could be funded through a tax or licensing fee on commercial fishing vessels which
                         subsequently profit from increased catches. Activities to establish the fund would include:

                         o        Assessment of existing and potential new regional sites for large scale marine protected
                         areas. An analysis of both the scope and distribution of the ecological and economic costs and
                         benefits to the Pacific islands region from its large oceanic ecosystems, and identification of existing
                         and potential new marine protected areas that could further build the Pacific Islands Oceanscape
                         Framework. The analysis would consider short and long term impacts and focus on the shared
                         interests of the Pacific Islands region (i.e development, food security, sustainability). The assessment
                         would establish clear criteria for measuring costs and benefits of large scale marine protected areas
                         (MPAs) and engage with regional leaders, regional fisheries management organizations, and global
                         institutions to support and recognize these criteria. These criteria will then provide important
                         reference points for the financing activities of the Pacific Marine Conservati on Development Fund.

                         o        Technical assistance for the establishment of a Pacific Marine Conservation Development

                         Fund. This will include the technical assistance necessary to establish a Pacific Marine Conservation
                         Development Fund, including design, establishment and administration of the fund, its governance,
                         etc. A range of options and scenarios for the Fund to transfer benefits to those who bear the costs of
                         conservation would be considered in addition to direct endowment payments for operating costs,
                         including among others:


                         �        A Regional Conservation Trading Scheme: The purse seine fishery VDS (and its extension
                         to the longline fishery) provide opportunities for participating Pacific Island countries to establish
                         large scale marine protected areas and sell their allocation of fishing days to the Fund so as to avoid
                         or mitigate impacts on fishing revenue. For example, Palau has announced its intention to establish a
                         Marine Sanctuary and close its EEZ to all commercial fishing. By conserving a productive bigeye
                         fishing ground, the country is providing a boost to a transboundary resource and a service to the
                         region, that could be rewarded through the Fund. The Fund could purchase fishing days at a set price
                         for subsequent auction or trade to other PNA members – thereby reducing the risk for States hosting
                         marine protected areas. Other regional options for auctioning PAE will also be explored and
                         developed.
                         �        Piloting an Ecosystem Services Market. Coastal States, commercial fishing vessels,
                         processors and seafood retailers will likely experience significant benefits through productivity gains
                         that flow on from the establishment of large scale marine protected areas. The Fund could potentially
                         utilize the assessments described previously to identify and value these benefits, and support the
                         development of an Ecosystem Services Market. This will provide financing options for host coastal
                         States to mitigate potential losses caused by the establishment of large scale marine protected areas.
                         Based on technical and institutional support for the development of conservation measures that
                         recognize the regional value of ecosystem services from large scale marine protected areas, and share
                         conservation costs across the WCPFC membership, the Fund could support and subsidize a transfer
Public Disclosure Copy




                         of benefits to the host state. For example, a host coastal State that contributes significant benefits to
                         conservation goals through the establishment of a large scale marine protected area, could be granted
                         preferential access to high seas fishing grounds for its flagged vessels, or discounts on institutional
                         fees, or exemptions from specific conservation measures, etc.
                         �        Regional Assurance Funding. Given the importance of fishing revenue to some Pacific island
                         national budgets, governments may be unable to commit to marine protected areas due to the
                         potentially high level of risk during the transition period – regardless of the balance of costs and
                         benefits in the long term. The Fund could potentially insure host coastal States against any loss in
                         revenue in the short term.

                         o       Technical assistance, training and exchange of lessons learned to individual Pacific Island
                         countries hosting large MPAs. This activity will provide technical assistance, legal and regulatory
                         support, and fund institutional strengthening activities that enable host States to establish and manage
                         large scale marine protected areas and participate in the Pacific Marine Conservation Development
                         Fund. This activity would also provide national governments with communication materials,
                         technical assistance and iconic speakers to broaden government and stakeholder understanding of
                         sustainability limitations, ecosystem services, and conservation benefits. The activity will first focus
                         on Ministers and parliamentarians, church and community leaders, and media. It would then provide
                         governments with the capacity and material to promote such messages with industry and distant
                         water fishing Nation partners. Additionally, support would be provided for learning exchanges
                         between Pacific Island countries and others with experience in establishing and managing large-scale
                         protected areas, e.g. Brazil and its FunBio.

                         3.2 Establish a pilot Pacific Blue Carbon regional program for the conservation of small to medium
                         scale marine habitats

                         In complement to support for rebuilding or strengthening coastal fisheries (see component two), this
                         sub-component will provide technical assistance to help pilot a Pacific Blue Carbon regional
                         program that would create conservation incentives for coastal communities to conserve the mangrove
                         habitats that support so many fisheries. Such mangrove forests sequester significant amounts of
                         carbon, which can potentially be bundled and sold for credits on various voluntary and other carbon
                         markets – i.e. ‘blue carbon’. Blue carbon provides some opportunity for funding lost-cost small/
                         medium scale marine protected areas in some circumstances, and may provide more efficient carbon
                         sequestration potential than terrestrial habitats. The funding streams could be channeled directly to
                         the communities, providing them with a valuable asset. However, while there are exciting future
                         blue carbon opportunities in the long term, there are currently a large number of uncertainties and
                         gaps that must first be overcome before communities may see any benefit, including: a very small
                         market base, uncertain and/or inconsistent rates of return, significant gaps in supporting scientific
                         information, potentially high transaction costs, and a lack of supporting legal and policy frameworks
                         in place. In combination, these conditions currently represent too much of a risk for private
                         investments in blue carbon. In order to build blue carbon financing opportunities, the PROP will
                         support the pilot trial of a Pacific Blue Carbon Regional Program that will address these obstacles
                         and aim to create opportunities for communities to finance small and medium scale marine protected
                         areas. This sub-component will develop a methodology to explore opportunities to pair up with
                         established, standards-based mechanisms like the terrestrial framework to pay for carbon stored as a
                         result of avoided deforestation (REDD+), and develop opportunities in the voluntary carbon market,
                         with a long term strategy to ultimately develop regulatory compliance markets. Following the design
                         of the methodology, the activity will help identify pilot trial communities in participating countries
                         for blue carbon, where clear tenure and stakeholder benefits are ensured in order to avoid
Public Disclosure Copy




                         implementation and enforcement issues that are associated with top-down regulation, uncertainty
                         over tenure, and lack of engagement by stakeholders. Even if blue carbon projects become
                         financially successful, conservation of habitats is not guaranteed unless community stakeholders see
                         a significant, direct benefit. With pilots identified, significant amounts of baseline scientific research
                         on carbon sequestration capacities and habitat mapping will be conducted as a pre-requisite for any
                         blue carbon projects to become viable. This sub-component will include the technical assistance,
                         scientific and survey expertise, and legal and regulatory support in order to enable participating
                         countries to pilot trials to assess their blue carbon potential, limitations and opportunities and
                         participate in blue carbon markets. This work will be carried out in collaboration with stakeholder
                         communities, relevant governance agencies and regional technical expertise to identify and assess
                         potential blue carbon sites for marine habitat conservation. Analysis would assess costs and benefits
                         and potential blue carbon values, and work with communities to identify key stakeholders, decision
                         making frameworks and management requirements. Analysis would build on existing blue carbon
                         projects where possible (i.e Palau, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). Activities would be implemented
                         in an approach that strengthens and broadens national capacity in community consultations and
                         community based approaches to natural resource management, and creates an understanding of
                         ecosystem services and public goods aspects of critical habitats. In some cases, additional technical
                         assistance may be needed for participating countries to strengthen and expand their policy, legislative
                         and regulatory frameworks for habitat conservation, tenure, and participation in blue carbon markets.
                         Component 4: Regional Coordination, Implementation Support and Program Management

                         The obje ctive of this component is to provide regional coordination, implementation support and
Public Disclosure Copy




                         program management, to ensure a coherent approach to program implementation within the wider
                         context of the Pacific Oceanscape Framework and wide dissemination of results and lessons learned;
                         as well as regional and national implementation support and training as needed for the program to
                         achieve its objectives. Towards this objective, this component would include the following
                         activities:

                         •        Regional Activities
                         o        Program management unit located within FFA. This unit would provide ongoing
                         implementation support to participating countries for financial management and procurement. This
                         unit will also support monitoring and evaluation, working closely with the participating countries to
                         collect, compile, analyze and disseminate the results of the PROP as measured by the key results
                         indicators.

                         o        Global outreach and knowledge sharing by FFA. This would provide funding for FFA to
                         exchange lessons learned and share results on behalf of the countries with other highly migratory
                         fisheries around the world.

                         o        Oceanscape unit located within the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat. This unit would be
                         responsible for program monitoring and evaluation, and coordination with other country, regional
                         and development partner initiatives in support of the Pacific Oceanscape Framework. This support
                         would be provided in collaboration with the Government of Australia, and would include financing
                         for a full-time staff person in the Secretariat’s Oceanscape Unit, as well as support for convening
                         meetings and learning exchanges around implementation. The PROP and other initiatives in support
                         of the Pacific Oceanscape Framework would form a regional learning portfolio which could have a
                         demonstration effect throughout the islands in regard to shared challenges and opportunities. This
                         could also include support for a sub-committee of Finance Ministers from the region to monitor

                         country)
                         o       Program management, monitoring and evaluation in each participating country, including
                         technical advisory support and support for fiduciary management and controls, and data collection,
                         analysis and evaluation for progress according to the key results indicators. Opportunities to

                         analysis (if known)
                         Project Location:

                         The Project will operate over the Pacific Islands Ocean Region some 40 million square kilometers in
                         area in 11 IDA-member countries: Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, Papua
                         New Guinea, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and
                         Vanuatu.

                         These are areas characterized by the diversity of their marine ecosystem. They are also among the
                         most vulnerable to effects of sea level rise. There are several hundred islands spread over this vast
                         area and populated by a mere 9 million people.

                         The APL would be developed along the following lines:

                         •       A menu of investment activities common to the interests of all Bank-member PICs, drawing
                         from those presented in Table 1, will be further developed during preparation. Some of these areas
                         will concern regional/sub-regional issues that require multi-country response, while others will
                         address national-level issues common to several countries;
                         •       To participate in the PROP, countries will need to meet certain eligibility criteria
                         demonstrating their readiness and commitment to the regional program; they would then select from
                         the program activities according to their national interests and priorities;
                         •       The program will be implemented initially, in Phase I, in a small subset of few countries plus
                         one regional institution (most likely the Forum Fisheries Agency, FFA), with other countries joining
                         in successive phases according to their national requirements and capacities.

                         Islands and Tuvalu. Other countries meeting readiness criteria will be able to join the program in
                         subsequent phases.

                         Examples of the type of the proposed activities (salient physical characteristics relevant to the
                         safeguard analysis), which have the potential to incur adverse environmental or social impacts:

                         Component 1:
                           •        Component 1, Subcomponent 1 specifically for Solomon Islands might include the
                           construction of an operational center for surveillance of the fisheries, and two outlying enforcement
                           centers for fisheries surveillance. The construction work may generate minor site-specific and time-

                           bound adverse environmental impacts that can be readily mitigated through standard mitigation
                           measures, if screened properly.
                           Component 2:
                           •        Component 2, Sub-component 2 may include support to restock beche-de-mer if it is deemed
                           a viable method to sustainably restore stocks. If so, hatchery facilities based on native brood stock
                           would be used. And, support would include supplying fishers with juveniles to restock near shore
                           habitats. This activity will not involve introduction of non-native species nor involve the purchase,
                           distribution, use or disposal of bactericides during implementation. However, investments in the area
                           of small enterprise development associated with bêche-de-mer valued added processing may include
                           installation of small scale civil works (e.g., solar dryers) for drying.
                           Component 3:
                           •        Component 3 investments related to the TA for sustainable financing of MPAs, and
                           potentially blue carbon. Activities under Component 3 Subcomponent 1 will support research to
                           assess the unique physical and ecological aspects of the MPAs that would generate ecosystem
                           services (like spawning or feeding grounds for tuna which migrate beyond EEZs of host nations) and
                           that could be incorporated into a system of payment for environmental services. Subcomponent 2
                           will include TA in order to assess blue carbon potential and participate in blue carbon markets, and
                           will help identify potential blue carbon sites. Small scale infrastructure works are not expected to be
                           financed by the project.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           In Phase 1, Program implementation will involve a single agency as the national focal point entity
                           and one or two regional agencies involved in implementing regional activities and overall program
                           coordination and monitoring.

                           These include:

                           executed activities.

                           There are 11 Pacific Island Countries eligible to join PROP. Each possesses differing levels of
                           familiarity with Bank Safeguards Policies and Procedures; however the level of institutional capacity
                           across the region as a whole is quite weak. An assessment will be conducted for each country as it
                           joins the PROP to ascertain the Borrower's institutional capacity for applying and complying with
                           Bank safeguard policies, and a program of training and technical assistance devised to build
                           appropriate capacity and provide ongoing implementation support.
