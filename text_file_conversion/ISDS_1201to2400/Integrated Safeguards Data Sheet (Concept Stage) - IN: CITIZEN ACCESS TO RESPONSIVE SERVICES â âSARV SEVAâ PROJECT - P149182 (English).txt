                         and (iv) Capacity building activities for State Agency for Public Services (SAPS).

                         Project Components. Support to the above mentioned areas will be provided through three
                         complementary components:

                         Component 1: Results-based financing (US$ 20 million). This component aims to provide incentives
                         for undertaking critical public management reforms and achieving results in terms of service delivery
                         along the four result areas. Results-based financing will be disbursed to GoMP against the execution
                         of agreed-to Eligible Expenditures Programs (EEPs) and the achievement of key results as measured
                         by Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). The indicators and verification protocols measuring the
                         results will be defined during the preparation of the project. A preliminary analysis of the program
                         budget identified the following EEP as suitable for project financing: salary and wages, training, and
                         grants. Activities to be financed using a results-based financing approach inclu de:

                         •       Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) related to new RTPS services to be notified;
                         •        Human and organizational capacity to support the Department for Public Service

                         Component 3: Innovation Fund (US$ 5 million). This component will provide funding for
                         innovations that will lead to service delivery improvements related to the implementation of the 2010
                         Public Services Guarantee Act (“RTPS Act”). It aims to provide incentives for critical stakeholders
                         (front line providers, Line Departments, etc.) to participate in the project, and allow for some
                         experimental learning and identification of activities that could be scaled-up in subsequent phases of
                         the project. The Fund will have transparent selection criteria; and all entities involved in the
                         implementation of the RTPS Act will be able to submit proposals on a competitive basis, spelling out
                         the rationale, the proposed activities and the expected results in terms of service delivery. Funding
                         will be limited to the pre-defined eligible expenditures.

                         Project funding. The EEPs for disbursements under Component 1 are being reviewed at this stage,
                         but it is expected that these could include wages and salaries and non-procurable items such as
                         training, and grants. Project funding under Components 2 and 3 will reimburse the GoMP for the
                         following eligible expenditures: consultant services, goods, workshops and training, and other
                         operating costs. Preliminary disbursement arrangements for the project are summarised in Technical

                         First, the operation will strengthen existing RTPS monitoring systems and engage with Line
                         Ministries’ about monitoring systems. Second, it will support the establishment of a dedicated cell of
                         data analysis for service delivery at the School of Good Governance and Policy Analysis (SGPA)
                         and promote the use of such information for decision-making. Third, in collaboration with SGPA, the
                         Bank will design efficient M&E tools to be used during project implementation (such as mystery
                         audits and user feedback loops) and agree on a learning-by-doing process with the government to be
                         able to improve the design of the interventions during the lifetime of the project.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the second largest state in India after Rajasthan in terms of geographical
                         size. As recorded in the 2011 Census of India, over 72 million people reside in MP, making it the
                         fifth most populous state in India with nearly 6% of the country’s entire population . While rich in
                         mineral resources, MP is counted among low-income states (LIS) in India. Its per capita gross state
                         domestic product is the fourth lowest in the country, and nearly a third of its population lives in
                         poverty. The state is also known to have poor human development outcomes (a low Human
                         Development Index score of 0.375 in 2011, well below the national average and particularly high
                         levels of malnutrition) and has been ranked by independent studies as having an “extremely
                         alarming” hunger situation (IFPRI 2008).

                         A large proportion of MP’s population comprises of Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes
                         (STs). These groups account for respectively 15.6% and 21.1% of the state’s population (Census of
                         India, 2011). While the share of SCs in MP’s population mirrors their share in the total population of
                         India (16.6%), the share of tribals is significantly larger than their share in India’s population (8.6%).
                         In fact, more than 14% of tribals in India live in MP alone, making the state significant for any
                         advances towards the cause of tribal development in the country. The Scheduled Tribes in MP,

                         however, like their counterparts elsewhere in India, lag behind significantly when compared to other
                         social groups.

                         Social security schemes such as the PDS and MGNREGA appear to be reaching SCs and STs.
                         Nearly 72% of households holding an Antyodaya card (promising subsidized food to families with an
                         income of Rs. 250 per capita per month or below) in 2011-12 were from the SC/ST category and
                         52% of those holding BPL cards were from these groups suggesting that a substantial share of the
                         subsidy promised under these cards was being availed by SCs and STs. BPL card ownership was also
                         higher among SCs and STs compared to other groups.

                         Key social issue anticipated under the project is limited to differential access of the public services
                         by the scheduled castes, Scheduled Tribes, Women and other marginalized and religious groups in
                         the state. As the overall project is about improved citizen access to the public services this issue shall
                         be assessed in detail during the preparation stage and necessary strategies shall be put in place as part
                         of the overall project design. The entire project is expected to be designed based on the guiding
                         principles of inclusiveness, transparency and accountability.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The project implementation will be led by the Department of Public Service Management, through
                         the State Agency for Public Services (SAPS) which will serve as the Project Implementation Unit.

                           financial management, procurement regulations and safeguard requirements, and reporting to the
                           Bank on a timely manner. SAPS Executive Director will be responsible for overall project
                           implementation, coordination of technical activities and supervision of the project implementation
                           unit.

                           Being a new agency registered in May 2013, SAPS has limited track record of demonstrable
                           implementation experience. Once more clarity emerges on the fund-flow and implementation
                           arrangements of the proposed Project, a detailed assessment will be conducted and arrangements will
                           be agreed with counterparts to ensure mitigation of safeguards risk in compliance with Bank’s
                           safeguards policies. Overall social safeguards risks are limited as no adverse impact of the project is
                           anticipated.
