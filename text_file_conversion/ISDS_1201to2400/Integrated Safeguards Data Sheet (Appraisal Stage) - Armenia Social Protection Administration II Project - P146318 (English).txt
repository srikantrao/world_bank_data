                           The proposed Project Development Objectives (PDOs) are to (i) improve social protection service
                           delivery and (ii) strengthen analytical and monitoring and evaluation functions of the agencies
                           delivering social protection benefits and services.

                         World Bank credit US$14.3 million).
                         This component would support rolling-out of integrated social protection service delivery that was
                         initiated and piloted under the SPAP project. The project would finance the following types of
                         activities: i) civil works, IT equipment, furniture, and other goods for 37 Integrated Social Protection
                         Centers (ISPCs), ii) strengthening of ISPCs management information systems across all ISPCs,
                         further software development, and IT support; iii) drafting of legislation for the implementation of
                         the adopted model of integrated social protection service delivery; iv) training for ISPC staff in
                         integrated social protection service delivery, as well as follow up support to the local staff through
                         mentoring and on-the-job training, and v) public outreach through awareness campaigns and printed
                         materials. This component will also include civil works, furniture and other goods for the central
                         offices of two agencies â€“ the State Employment Service Agency (SESA) and the Agency for
                         Medico-Social Expertise (AMSE) - whose functions will be incorporated into the ISPCs at the
                         decentralized level.

                         Component II. Supporting the Implementation of the New Employment Strategy by the Government
                         (US$2.6 million, of which World Bank credit US$2.2 million).
                         The employment component of this project seeks to address some specific challenges of the
                         Armenian labor market, namely: a high share of unemployed and NEET (not in education,
                         employment or training) youth; a low rate of job creation; a lack of specific technical skills which
                         sometimes prevents employers from opening or filling vacancies; and a low awareness and coverage
                         of public employment services among both job seekers and employers. In response to these issues,
                         the project will support a limited set of measures that build on existing initiatives and infrastructure
                         and include: i) strengthening essential capacities of the SESA central services by investing in training
                         activities and IT infrastructure (including upgrading the GORTS management information system);
                         ii) piloting two targeted Active labor Market Programs (ALMPs) ; iii) expanding career orientation

                         towards specific skills and supporting its information system, drafting and introduction of online
                         consultancy and distance-training programs implemented via the web page, developing and
                         installation of software for testing of professional orientation; and iv) strengthening monitoring and
                         evaluation capacities, including implementation of rigorous impact evaluations of the ALMPs piloted
                         under the project.

                         Component III: Modernization of the Pension System (US$1.1 million, of which World Bank credit
                         US$0.9 million).
                         The pension component will support the State Social Security Service (SSSS) in improving its core
                         business processes and upgrading them in line with ISPC requirements. SSSS will focus on: i)
                         strengthening its technical capacity through investment in IT technology and further development of
                         its electronic pension information system, ii) development of the risk-based fraud-and-error
                         supervision software and system, iii) improving its HR capacity through training in core and new
                         business processes, such as central payment services for the integrated social delivery system.

                         Component IV: Strengthening Analytical Capacity and Monitoring and Evaluation Systems of
                         MLSA (US$1.3 million, of which World Bank credit US$1.1 million).
                         Activities under this component are aimed at strengthening the capacity of the monitoring and
                         evaluation unit within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MLSA) and developing an
                         integrated system of monitoring and evaluation of social protection benefits and services (in total


                                                                       Page 2 of 8
                         over 70 different programs). Capacity would be built around both quantitative and qualitative M&E
                         methodologies, and on beneficiary-led tools. This would enable the MLSA to gauge direct
                         beneficiary feedback on quality, satisfaction and impact, streamline the indicators and methodology

                         for monitoring the implementation of its policies on the ground (both in terms of impact on the
                         general population as well as on the most vulnerable target groups, and including gender-sensitivity
                         throughout), analyze possible reform options and their impacts, adjust policy solutions, and
                         eventually increase efficiency of the system of social protection. Part of the activities would be
                         focused on case management, continuous training and supervision of case managers in ISPCs.
                         Research activities on poverty and different forms of monetary and non-monetary deprivations, for
                         different vulnerable groups including youth and women, would also be financed under this
                         component. The proposed component would additionally cover the cost of IT equipment, software
                         development, and training of the monitoring and evaluation specialists of the MLSA.

                         Component V: Project Management (US$1.9 million, of which World Bank credit US$1.3 million).
                         This component would finance the standard operation of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) at
                         MLSA for the duration of the project, trainings, and incremental operating costs. The PCU is in
                         charge of technical aspects of the project and ensures overall monitoring and supervision of project
                         activities. The cost of project management would also partially cover the Foreign Financial Project
                         Management Centre (FFPMC) staff time, for those who will perform fiduciary activities for the
                         SPAP II project, as well as maintenance costs.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The Project will be implemented countrywide. Individual investments will be made in multiple
                         locations, not all of which are known upfront. Two beneficiary institutions, selected for having their
                         premises rehabilitated, are located in the city of Yerevan: the SESA and the AMSE.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The Project will finance refurbishment and area landscaping, and construction works at 37 ISPCs,
                              and rehabilitation of premises for the SESA and the AMSE. Because the Project carries physical
                              investment component involving construction/reconstruction of buildings, the OP/BP 4.01
                              Environmental Assessment is triggered. The envisaged civil works will have modest local
                              environmental and social impacts, which would be easy to mitigate by ensuring that works
                              providers adhere to the conventional good construction and environmental practices. Therefore,
                              the Project is classified as environmental Category B.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Operation and maintenance of small to medium size public offices, such as ISPCs, the SESA and
                              the AMSE carry small scale risks of pollution due to improper management of household waste,
                              poor operation of heating systems, and sub-standard connections to the municipal networks of
                              power supply, water supply and sewage. However, the Project-supported refurbishment of
                              buildings will address the existing glitches in the operation of these systems, and in case of new
                              construction - due attention will be given to the design and installation of grid connections and
                              heating systems. Therefore, the Project is expected to result in a neutral or a positive long term
                              impact on the environment.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              For each ESPC office, proposed for inclusion into the Project's work program, alternatives or
                              refurbishment of the existing building vs. construction of new premises will be carefully explored.
                              Fixing of the existing buildings will allow reducing the Project's environmental footprint, however
                              for some heavily damaged buildings, refurbishment may not be justifiable from the economic
                              standpoint and new construction may be preferable option. Seismic stability of the existing
                              buildings and existence of structural damage will be factored into the analysis of alternative
                              solutions for the provision of decent premises to ISPCs.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.


                                                                        Page 5 of 8
                           The 37 ISPCs will be selected, and detailed designs for their refurbishment/construction will be
                           developed on the rolling basis. Therefore, not all of these decisions could be made and not all
                           designs were prepared by the Project appraisal. However, the environmental and social risks

                           related to the works at all of ISPCs are known to be pretty similar and insignificant, and most of
                           them are already known. Because of the above, an Environmental and Social Management
                           Framework (ESMF) was prepared to guide further environmental work under the Project. Site-
                           specific Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were also developed for works at the SESA
                           and the AMSE premises. EMPs for ISPCs will be prepared once detailed designs are produced.
                           Commencement of works will not be allowed at any site till the respective EMP is disclosed and
                           consulted with local stakeholders.

                           The MLSA is the Project Implementing Entity for SPAP II, and the Foreign Financial Project
                           Management Centre (FFPMC) under the Ministry of Finance will provide financial management
                           services for the Project. After having implemented the first SPAP project, the MLSA has basic
                           understanding of the Bank's safeguard policies. However, the first SPAP was classified as
                           environmental Category C, and the MLSI now has to expand its institutional capacity in applying
                           safeguards under a more complex Category B project by recruiting staff of consultant, or assigning
                           an existing staff to safeguards management, including supporting and overseeing implementation
                           of the EMPs and RAPs, as required. This may be one of the engineers currently on staff (with
                           appropriate supplementary training), or a qualified new staff, or a consultant engaged for this
                           purpose. This person will work closely with safeguards specialists of the Bank team and receive
                           on-the-job training sufficient for handling safeguards issues under a low risk Category B project.
                           Institutional arrangements for handling safeguards must be in place within MLSA by the time of
                           Project effectiveness and shall be maintained through the Project life.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Project stakeholders include the MLSA, SESA, AMSE, SSSS, development partners (USAID,
                           UNICEF), ISPCs and their beneficiaries.
