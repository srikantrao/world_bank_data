    2. Project Development Objcctivc(s)
       A. Current Project Development Objectives- Parent
       The overall goal ofECCAS' CAADP-related activities is to contribute to the achievement of
       CAADP targets and objectives within its Member States. Tbe specific project development
       objective of the ongoing Child Trust fund (CTF) is to improve strategic planning and
       budgeting of agricultural investments at national and regional level within the ECCAS
       sub-region.

       B. Proposed Project Development Objectives - Additional Financing (AF)
       The objective of the proposed Additional Financing (AF) to the ECCAS CTF is improved enabling
      environment fOr Afi'ican agriwltural programs and policies at national and regional level.

    3. Project Description
   The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Program (CAADP) is the African Union (AU)/New
   Partnership for Africa's Development 1 (NEPAD) vision and strategy for the development of
   Afi:ican agriculture. The goal of CAADP is to help African countries reach and sustain a
   higher path of economic growth through agricultural-led development that reduces hunger and
   poverty and enables food and nutrition security and growth in exports. The CAADP
   Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) was established in 2008 in recognition that African
   institutions required further capacity strengthening to deliver on CAADP in an effective
   manner. To this end, ECCAS is one of six African institutions which received a Child Trust
   Fund (CTF) grant to support this endeavor.

   The original ECCAS CTF became effective in November 2010. Its objective is to improve
   strategic planning and budgeting of agricultural investments at national and regional levels
   within the ECCAS sub-region. The CTF is supporting CAADP-related activities of the ECCAS
   General Secretariat through the following components four components:

   Component 1: Strengthening of the institutional capacities of the ECCAS General Secretariat
   Component 2: Facilitate and coordinate the CAADP process at country level
   Component 3: Facilitate and coordinate the CAADP process at regional level
   Component 4: Develop horizontal strategic functions


   CAADP represents an ambitious agenda. Building the capacity of organizations to take on this
   agenda has taken time. As a framework it has evolved over time. In 2012 stakeholders launched
   the Sustaining CAADP momentum initiative which presents the new policy vision for CAADP
   over the coming decade. The initiative expands CAADP's scope by encouraging stronger
   engagement in key areas such as policy reform, private sector investment, and results. CAADP
   has also established a number of strategic initiatives, including establishing a results framevmrk
   for the entire CAADP process, establishing processes that will lead implementation of regional
   investment plans, and a new structure for delivering African-led approaches to knowledge

    information and skills into the CAADP process. All these processes are enabling CAADP to
    become more effective and sustainable.

    Recent endorsement of MDTF donors and approval by Bank management to extend the
    CAADP parent MDTF to June 30, 2016 has provided an opportunity for ECCAS to support
    additional CAADP activities. Additional Financing is therefore proposed to ensure continued
    support to ECCAS to solidify gains achieved to date, scale up ac;tivities and extend
    implementation to address new CAADP priorities and challenges for an additional two years
    (20 14-20 15).

    The AF will support the following:
         (i) Strengthening /he de!iverv o[ current CAADP commitments - the AF would ensure
          ECCAS continues supporting coordination of the CAADP process in Central Africa to
          ensure all member countries go beyond the basic elements ofCAADP planning processes:
         (ii) Support to CAADP 's new agenda- the AF would ensure ECCAS is able to play a central
          role in effectively delivering this new Sustaining CAADP momentum initiative; and
         (iii)Consolidating on going reform processes- the AF would allow ECCAS to continue to
          mainstream the reform initiated into CAADP.

   4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
   (if known)
   The AF will fund activities implemented at the ECCAS General Secretariat's Headquarters
   (IIQ) in Libreville, Gabon, and in the 8 ECCAS Member States 2 .

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
         . of Key Safeguard Issues
A. Sw1mwn•
I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. ldcnti(y and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
No new World Bank Safeguard policies are triggered by the proposed additional financing
(AF). The proposed AF is rated category C (not required) which is in line with the ratings of the
original CTF (1'121913).

The activities funded by the CTF will be limited to the above areas and the CTF cannot and will
not fund any on the ground agricultural activities or civil works, their engineering design
(either detailed or schematic) or their feasibility studies either at the ECCAS level or in
Member States. There will therefore be no adverse environmental or social impacts associated
with the CTF implementation.
2. Descdbe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project" area:
N/A
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considci'Cd to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
N/A
4. Describe measures taken by the boJTowcr to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
ECCAS has complied with World Bank safeguard policies since the CTF became effective in
2011; however as a category C no safeguards ·policies were triggered. The Bank Task Team will
continue to work closely with ECCAS as it has been doing during CTF implementation. to
ensure that the processes that the proposed AF will support include evaluating member
countries environmental and social management systems.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safegmu·d policies, ·with an emphasis on potentiall)' affected people.
