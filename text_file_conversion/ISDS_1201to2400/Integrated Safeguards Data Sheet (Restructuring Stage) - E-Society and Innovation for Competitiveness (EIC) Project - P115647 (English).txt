                         The primary Project Development Objective is to catalyze an innovation driven e-Society in Armenia
                         by promoting growth of the local IT and high-tech sector and
                         affordable, efficient and secure access to broadband, ICT-enabled services and i

                          3. Project Description
                         The Project aims at addressing constraints to competitiveness of the economy by promoting
                         innovation and the development of an ICT-enabled Society (e-Society) in Armenia. It is structured
                         around two core components: (i) e-Society and Digital Inclusion Infrastructure Development, and (ii)
                         Innovation Infrastructure for IT Sector and Technology Clusters Development. Each component
                         addresses a specific gap in the ICT development of the country identified through the Governmentâ€™s
                         ICT Strategy adopted in 2008.

                         The e-Society and Digital Inclusion Infrastructure Development component was designed to increase
                         access to affordable broadband services for citizens, businesses, and public institutions countrywide.
                         Toward this end, the Project proceeds were to be used for works for laying optic fiber cables along
                         the existing highways and motor roads. After the Project restructuring, this component is
                         considerably scaled down and now aims at the provision of Internet coverage for 344 rural locations
                         in 10 marzes (provinces) of the country. This will be achieved by installation of Wi-Fi devices on the
                         public buildings in the central locations of rural settlements.

                         The Innovation Infrastructure for IT Sector and Technology Clusters Development component was
                         designed to promote the creation, growth and competitiveness of IT-intensive businesses through the

                         establishment of favorable environment for knowledge and technology-driven companies. For
                         achieving this goal, the Project proceeds were allocated for rehabilitation of an existing public
                         building in the city of Gyumri to house a Technology Center that would function as a business
                         incubator. After successful completion of this task, the decision was made to replicate it in the town
                         of Vanadzor. After restructuring, this component will finance rehabilitation of an existing public
                         building in Vanadzor, which will also be used by a Technology Center.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Rural broadband component will be implemented in 344 rural locations of 10 marzes (administrative
                         districts) of Armenia: Aragatsotn, Armavir, Shirak, Kotayk, Lori, Gegharkunik, Tavush, Ararat,
                         Vayots Dzor, and Syunik.

                         Premises for one Technology Center are already refurbished in the town of Gyumri, and an existing
                         building will be rehabilitated to house another Technology Center in the town of Vanadzor.

                               Originally the Project was rated as environmental Category B due to infrastructure investments
                              planned under its components 1 and 2. Investments under component 1 for creating the National
                              Broadband Backbone and Government Network did not materialize and will be replaced, through
                              the project restructuring, with the establishment of the Rural Broadband entailing the installation
                              of wireless towers in the selected rural settlements. As a result of this change, environmental risks
                              of component 1 will considerably decrease.

                              An existing building was refurbished to provide premises for a Technology Center in the town of
                              Gyumri. This old building was listed among historic assets of Armenia. Design for the
                              rehabilitation of this building was cleared with the national authority for preservation of cultural
                              heritage. A site-specific Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed and implemented
                              over the course of works. Refurbishment is completed to the satisfaction of the client and the
                              Bank. After restructuring, the Project will finance rehabilitation of another building in the town of
                              Vanadzor, were a similar Technology Center will operate. This building is one of several on the
                              campus of the Vanadzor branch of the State Engineering University of Armenia. It is not a historic
                              monument. Renovation of this building had been intended for a long time and years ago its interior
                              was cleared of finishing and appliances requiring replacement however rehabilitation works did
                              not commence due to financial constraints. The University campus is located in the outskirts of
                              town, has ample space, is fenced, and is easily accessible from the main road. Because of the
                              above circumstances, rehabilitation of the building will carry minimal environmental and social

                           triggered. OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitats and OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources, triggered for
                           the project at the time of its commencement, will not apply to works to be undertaken after the
                           Project's restructuring
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                             Operation of Wi-Fi access points in rural areas, as well as functioning of Gyumri and Vanadzor
                           Technology Centers will increase efficiency of the governance and improve the business
                           environment in Armenia. No long-term negative environmental or social impacts are expected.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                             Decision to renovate the existing buildings for the purposes of housing Gyumri and Vanadzor
                           Technology Centers was taken over the option of constructing new buildings in order to minimize
                           costs as well as to stay within the existing environmental footprint.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             The Borrower developed an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which
                           provides an overview of the telecommunications sector in Armenia, describes the legal and
                           institutional context for the Project implementation, lists the main expected environmental and
                           social impacts of the e-Society and digital inclusion infrastructure, and recommends measures for
                           their mitigation. A site-specific simplified Environmental Management Plan checklist was
                           developed for the rehabilitation of premises for Gyumri Technology Center. Both of these
                           documents were disclosed, consulted upon with stakeholders, and finalized at the Project
                           preparation stage. Once the decision was made to finance rehabilitation of premises for another
                           Technology Center in Vanadzor an EMP, similar to the one previously developed by the client and

                           stakeholders, and re-disclosed with the minutes of public consultation attached.

                           Responsibility for the Project implementation lies fully in the Ministry of Economy, which has the
                           overall project coordination role. High-level management of the Project is being carried out by a
                           Project Steering Committee (PSC). Day- to-day management of specific activities under the
                           project is assured by the Enterprise Incubator Foundation (EIF) which is in charge of fostering
                           enterprise innovation, including establishment of the Gyumri and Vanadzor Technology Centers.
                           The Foreign Financed Projects Management Center (FFPMC) is responsible for the financial
                           management, disbursement, and procurement under the Project. The FFPMC, operating under the
                           Ministry of Finance for a number of years, has an extensive experience of contract management
                           under the Bank financed projects. FFPMC and the Ministry of Economy sign civil works contracts
                           on behalf of the borrower and oversee quality of works, including their environmental compliance.
                           The EIF provided excellent technical supervision of works in Gyumri and the Projectâ€™s rating on
                           safeguards performance has been Satisfactory up to date. Recently the EIF developed the EMP for
