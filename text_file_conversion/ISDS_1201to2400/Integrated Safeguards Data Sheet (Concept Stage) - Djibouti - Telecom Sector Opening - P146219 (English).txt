                           B. Project Objectives
                           The PDO is to create an enabling environment in the telecom and ICT sector by: (i) strengthening the
                           policy, legal and regulatory framework of the telecom and ICT sector; (ii) restructuring Djibouti
                           Télécom, through the opening of its capital to a world class private operator; and (iii) opening the
                           sector to competition, through the award of a new license to an international telecom operator.
                           C. Project Description
                           This project takes place in a context where the government of Djibouti is seeking the World Bank
                         technical and financial assistance to i) create an enabling environment in the telecom and ICT sector
                         and ii) develop IT-enabled services (BPOs, call centers) and infrastructure development projects so
                         as to increase the contribution of the telecom sector to employment and economic growth, thus

                         consolidating Djibouti’s position as an ICT hub in the Horn of Africa.

                         In order to address government’s demand for assistance, the World Bank proposed to sequence its
                         intervention in two phases. The first phase consists in the proposed project and aims at improving the
                         governance of the telecom sector, through the creation of an enabling environment. The second
                         phase, tied to the results obtained in the first one, will aim at funding: i) pilot projects for developing
                         IT-enabled/BPO services, such as call centers; and ii) infrastructure projects at both national and
                         regional level, such as fiber optic backbone deployment projects.

                         The rationale for this phased-approach is to ensure that the governance of Djibouti’s telecom sector
                         is aligned with international best practices in terms of legal, regulatory and competitive environment,
                         before investing in new IT-enabled services and additional infrastructure.

                         The proposed project refers to the first phase of the World bank intervention described above. The
                         design of the proposed project falls under the overall strategy agreed on with the government of
                         Djibouti.
                         1. Description
                         The proposed project has four components that are described below:

                         Component 1: Setting-up of an enabling environment ($US 0.5 million). This component will
                         finance the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework and the set-up of an autonomous
                         regulatory entity.

                         Component 2: Strategic repositioning and restructuring of Djibouti Télécom ($US 0.7 million). This
                         component will fund the strategic repositioning of Djibouti Télécom to transform it into a world-
                         class operator (opening of Djibouti Télécom’s capital to a private investor). More specifically, this

                         component will fund the transaction advisor that will assist the government during the transaction.
                         Component 3: Telecom sector opening and feasibility studies for infrastructure development ($US
                         0.5 million). This component comprises two activities: (i) the award of a second license to introduce
                         competition and foster dynamism in the telecom sector in Djibouti; and (ii) financing of technical
                         studies for the construction and management of the telecom infrastructure, through a PPP
                         arrangement.

                         Component 4: Project Management ($US 0.3 million). This component will finance the
                         establishment of the project implementation unit within the Ministry of Telecom, the implementing
                         agency.
