B. Project Objectives
C. Project Description
The development objective of the Punjab Rural Water and Sanitation Sector Improvement Program
(hereinafter referred to as the "Project Development Objective" or "PDO") is "To strengthen local


﻿institutions for improved water supply and sanitation service delivery in select habitations in rural
Punjab.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Punjab, with a population of 27.7 million living in 22 districts, is one of the advanced states of India.
It has made significant strides in implementing RWSS sector reforms while delivering services
appropriate to meet the specific needs of local communities. Punjab is perhaps the first state in India
to provide safe water supply to all its 12,258 villages (146 residual non-covered villages are
expected to be covered by end December 2014). Rural sanitation coverage has been impressive at
about 71.9% (the all India average is 32.7%). The State has demonstrated impressive fund
absorption capacity of close to 100% utilization of World Bank.
Increasing levels of water contamination and over exploitation of ground water resources due to
anthropogenic activities is slowly becoming an area of concern in addition to natural contamination
like fluoride, arsenic due to geogenic conditions. Lack of means to dispose animal waste, garbage
and to some extent open defecation is major contaminating factors in the state. As per baseline data,
the state of Punjab has an annual replenish able groundwater resources of 22.53 BCM and net ground
water availability is 20.32 BCM. Out of which 172% is being utilized annually. With regards to
groundwater exploitation, out of the 138 blocks, 110 blocks are classified as over exploited, 4 as
critical, 2 as semi-critical and 22 as safe blocks in Punjab. According to DWSS estimates for the year
2013-14, 1587 villages of the total 15370 villages suffer from poor water quality conditions, viz.,
iron, fluoride, arsenic, nitrates, etc. Apart from these villages, there are 2307 villages affected with
major quality problems such as Uranium, lead, aluminum and Selenium. Due to its higher depth and
relative hydrogeological isolation from the shallow aquifer, deep groundwater is expected to be free
from the presence of bacteriological contamination, but chemical contaminants such as fluoride, Iron,
lead and aluminum could be present. In Punjab, about 75% of the rural households have household
latrines and usage level is observed to be good. In many of the habitations open defecation is not
widely prevalent. The total area under forests in Punjab is about 1,764 Sq.km., out of which 736 Sq.
Km is moderately dense forest area and 1028 Sq.Km is open forest area. Against the total
geographical area of 50,362 Sq.Km, forest area is only 3.50%. There are 12 wild life sanctuaries with
an area of 32, 370 Hectares.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The state has well established Environmental Management System; developed with an appropriate
Environmental Assessment conducted both for water and Sewerage schemes at state and district
level. The environmental implementation and monitoring systems will be strengthened given the
experience of the on -going project. The institutional capacity building on environmental aspects and
relevant staff positions at state and district levels will be strengthened in the current project.
Social Assessment was carried and Social Management Framework was prepared that takes into
account measures on inclusion, equity, participation, transparency, accountability and gender
mainstreaming, citizen feedback and grievance management.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY


﻿Safeguard Policies           Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment     Yes         The project will support construction of single and
OP/P 4.01                               multiple village based rural water supply and
sanitation schemes/services (RWSS) and sewerage
schemes, which will improve overall environmental
conditions through expected improvement in quality
of RWSS services. Incorporating the key
environmental challenges identified under the EA, an
EMF has been prepared. The EMF includes various
environmental management strategies to be used
during project implementation. Environmental Code
of Practices have been prepared and included in the
EMF. The above measures are effectively utilized to
screen the schemes from environmental impacts, and
suggest measures of mitigation. The same practices
will be followed in the current project.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04  No           The ongoing project does not provide any learning
that project activities are in any way impacting
natural habitat. Hence, policy is not triggered.
Forests OP/BP 4.36           Yes         Environmental Code of Practices have been prepared
and included in the EMF. The above measures are
effectively utilized to screen the schemes from
environmental impacts, and suggest measures of
mitigation. The same practices will be followed in
the current project.
Pest Management OP 4.09     No           No activity will support use of pesticides or related
activity, hence policy is not triggered.
Physical Cultural Resources  No          The project activities do not foresee any impact on
OP/BP 4.11                               physical cultural resources. Hence, policy is not
triggered
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP    No           There are no indigenous population in the state.
4.10
Involuntary Resettlement OP/  No         The project does not entail any land acquisition.
BP 4.12
Safety of Dams OP/1P 4.37   No           There is no water supply source involving dams or
ponds hence policy is not triggered.
Projects on International   No           No source is used for schemes which have flow
Waterways OP/13P 7.50                    interstate or international flow across countries. Not
applicable
Projects in Disputed Areas OPT No        Project is not in disputed area.
