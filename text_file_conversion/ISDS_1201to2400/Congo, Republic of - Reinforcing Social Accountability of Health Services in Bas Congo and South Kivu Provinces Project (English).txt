2. Project Objectives:

The development objective of this proposal is to improve access and quality of health care
services in targeted regions (Bas Congo and South Kivu) by strengthening of Health Facility
Committees.

3. Project Description:

Component 1: Reinforcing tlte ltealtlt facility committee system

The objective of this component is to reinforce the health facility committee system by working
with its members and care providers to better understand the mechanism. The main activities of
this component include:
   (a) Conducting information session and training at the provincial level for provincial-level
       officials on the role and responsibilities of HFCs and the nature of their engagement with
       HFCs.
   (b) Conducting information session and training in the eleventh selected health zones on the
       role and responsibilities of HFCs and the nature of their engagement with HFCs.
   (c) Conducting training for HFCs that were not part of the pilot using the guidelines that
       were developed during the pilot project.
   (d) Conducting refresher sessions for HFCs; two per HFC in the first year and one per HFC
       in the next two years.
   (e) Setting-up a supervision and support system through pat1ners CSOs and provincial health
       authorities.
   (f) Developing and implementing a contract mechanism to further integrate HFCs into the
       objectives of the health facilities and health system.

Component 2: Empowering health facility through community actions and projects

   (a) Defining criteria and conditions for micro-grants.
   (b) Allocating micro-grants to HFCs that meet the requirements to apply. A limited number
       of micro-grant will be granted each year through a competitive transparent process.
   (c) Monitoring of the micro-grant execution in coordination with pat1ner CSOs.
   (d) Supporting micro-grant management strategy in coordination with partner CSOs.
   (e) Establishing HFCs hotlines for service users in the most remote areas of the
       interventions.

Component 3: Integrating the poorest and most vulnerable fringes of the population in the
flea/til facility committee and decisions on flea/til-care services

   (a) Selecting 100 health facilities where the approach to include most vulnerable groups will
       be experimented for 2 years before it is scaled-up. This will provide the baseline against
       which to monitor success of the mechanism.
   (b) Conducting session with HFCs and medical staff to identify vulnerable groups and
       include them in the HFCs.
   (c) Developing a quota-system for the patticipation of vulnerable groups in the HFCs,
       including executive positions, and electing vulnerable groups representatives of the
       HFCs.
   (d) Provide support and training to the vulnerable people representatives within the HFCs.
   (e) Conducting special training session and following-up on the creation of social
       commissions within HFCs. The Social Commissions are an existing mechanism that is
       under-used.
   (f) Evaluating the impact of the intervention to include most vulnerable groups in the HFCs.
   (g) Scaling-up the intervention to include other facilities.

Component 4: (K&L) health facility committees are fully integrated into the health system
and beyond and project management




                                               2
    (a) Integrating of a social accountability approach in all health-related interventions of
        Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID - DRC) through
        CORD AID country policy and working sessions with HFCs.
    (b) Preparing a Quarterly newsletter for all the partners involved in the project, including
        CSOs and HFCs, to promote best practices in HFCs.
    (c) Conducting training on social accountability for partner CSOs.
    (d) Exposing project through active participation in online communities of practice such as:
        GPSA, COPASAH (Community of practice on Accountability and Social Accountability
        in Health), CoP Financial Access to Health, and CoP Performance-based financing and
        media.
    (e) Conducting visits and exchanges with similar projects supported by CORD AID in
        Burundi and other countries.
    (f) Conducting a national-level working session with the Ministry of Health to strengthen
        central level commitment with HFCs.
    (g) Creating and disseminating new guidelines and refreshed framework for HFCs.
    (h) Project management, monitoring and evaluation of project activities including audits.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project will not finance any physical activities, no risks related to environmental or social
safeguards policies are anticipated during implementation of project activities.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
  N/A




                                                 3
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts: N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:
This project is not expected to trigger any safeguards policies as the project screening identified
minimal environmental or social risks related to project activities. The project does not anticipate
any civil works to be financed under this Grant. The project is, therefore, Environmental
Category C, requiring no further environmental and social assessment. However, as the project is
operating in an area where indigenous groups are present, it triggers OP 4.10 to ensure screening
for inclusion of these indigenous groups into the project implementation. The project will use the
Indigenous Peoples Plan developed for the DRC Prevention and Mitigation of Sexual and
Gender Based Violence (SGBV) in North and South Kivu Project to address people and/or issues
unique to the health project. The IPP for the SGBV project has been consulted upon and publicly
disclosed in DRC and in the Bank InfoShop on July 9, 2014. A key aspect of this project is
outreach to and consultation with vulnerable groups to ensure they are receiving adequate
medical attention. In addition to special outreach for women and children, the project will also
ensure other vulnerable groups in the project area, such as Indigenous Peoples, are included in
consultations and studies regarding services.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
The Project's direct beneficiaries include: the health service users in targeted rural communities
particularly, vulnerable groups (including women, children, and Indigenous Peoples) and the
medical staff that works on these health care facilities. The project will cover nine stable health
zones of South Kivu (Katana, Miti-Muresha, Walungu, Idjwi, Uvira, Lemera, Kalehe,
Mubumbano) and three health zones (two among them are qualified as development zones) in
the more stable province of Bas Congo (Mwanda, Kitona and Boma-Bungu). An estimated 190
health facilities will be covered by the project, serving over 2.2 million people (a third of the
population of South Kivu and a tenth of the population of Bas Congo).

The Project's indirect beneficiaries include: all the citizens of DRC. The strategy behind the
scale up of the intervention is to re-launch the role of the Health Facility Committees at national
level and improve the health care system nationally.
