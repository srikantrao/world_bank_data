2. Project Objectives
is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water distribution in three
AWBs (Ghotki, Nara and Left Bank canals), particularly with respect to measures of
reliability, equity and user satisfaction.
  The objective will remain unchanged under the additional financing. No changes are
proposed to the original scope and implementation modalities of the project.
  No addtional works or activities will be financed. The AF is only financing cost-
overrun.

3. Project Description
The additional financing will finance the costs associated with the Government of Sindh's
(GoS) continuing efforts to rehabilitate and improve the irrigation and drainage system,
and to integrate storm and agricultural drainage needs on the broad flat plain stretching
from the Indus River to Badin and the coastal zone (the so called left bank area in
southern Sindh). In order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation water
distribution in the province, the Water Sector Improvement Project (WSIP) financed
priority works on the main and branch canals, distributaries and minors in three Area
Water Boards (AWBs), in addition to analytical tools and information management
systems to support planning and management of flood risks by local authorities, as well
as feasibility studies for rehabilitation works on major hydraulic structures. The
additional financing will address a financing gap in the project because of rising costs and
will ensure that the project completes is intended objectives. No changes are proposed to
the project's development objective and to the current implementation, coordination, and
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements. The partnership arrangements as
designated under the original project will also remain unchanged.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will be implemented in Sindh Province, on the left bank of Indus River. Most
of the project activities will be carried out in the rural areas where canal-irrigated
agriculture is the main source of livelihood. River Indus is the main source of water in the
area. Groundwater is mostly saline except for small quantities of fresh groundwater found
near the river and canals. Air quality in rural areas is generally good except near
industrial units particularly sugar mills. Some wildlife-sanctuaries and game reserves also
exist in the area.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The key environmental and social issues associated with the activities under the original
project included air quality deterioration noise, water and soil contamination, disposal of
spoils and silt, borrow area management, hazards associated with additional vehicular
traffic, risk of habitat modification, potential threat to wildlife, risk of disruption of
irrigation water, damage to the existing infrastructure, safety hazards for local population,
and land acquisition. Most of these impacts were however associated with the
construction phase and hence were temporary in nature. The activities under the AF are
likely to cause similar nature and scale of negative environmental and social impacts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The EA for the original project identified soil and water contamination as well as health
hazards for the farmers and nearby communities associated with the increased usage and
handling of pesticides and fertilizers due to increased water availability as the key
potential indirect and long term impacts in the project area. These concerns were
addressed by implementing a Pest Management Plan in the area. No additional indirect
and or long term impacts are expected to be caused by the AF.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The project has no 'siting alternatives' since it involves rehabilitation of existing irrigation
network. Other project alternatives such as construction methodology, location of borrow
and disposal areas, location of construction camps, and construction timings have been
considered in the Project ISEA and will be further refined in the sub-project specific
EMPs that will be prepared during the project implementation.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has prepared an Integrated Social and Environmental Assessment (ISEA)
for the original project. The ISEA remains valid for AF also since it covers the project
components under the new project. ISEA calls for conducting sub-project and site-
specific EA for sub-projects under Component B1. In line with this requirement, the
Borrower will conduct separate EAs and prepare EMPs for rehabilitation works on
Ghotki and Left Bank canals. These EAs and EMPs will provide site-specific mitigation
measures to address the potential impacts of the project works under AF.

 The Borrower possesses adequate capacity to manage the safeguard aspects of the
project and has established elaborate institutional setup for this purpose. This setup
includes environmental specialists in Sindh Irrigation Development Authority (SIDA) –
the implementing agency and Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU), as
well as in Project Implementation Consultants (PIC), M&E Consultants, and contractors.
EMP implementation is included in the construction contracts, and PIC supervises the
contractors to ensure that the works are carried out in compliance with the EMP
requirements. M&EC routinely carries out safeguards monitoring to identify gaps in
EMP implementation – these gaps and non-compliances are discussed in a monthly
meeting among the project entities and corrective measures determined.

 This above described setup and monitoring mechanism will continue to exist during the
AF also. Capacity building of the safeguard staff of the project entities will be continued
during the AF.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders of the project include the farmers in the command areas of the
canals to be covered under the project, Farmer Organizations (FOs), local community,
Irrigation Department, Sindh Wildlife Department, and Environmental Protection
Agency. Consultations with these stakeholders were carried out during the preparation of
the ISEA of the original project. Additional consultations were carried out while
conducting EAs and preparing EMPs of B1 and B2 components of the original project.
Such consultations will be continued while conducting EAs of the sub-projects under
component B1 of AF.
