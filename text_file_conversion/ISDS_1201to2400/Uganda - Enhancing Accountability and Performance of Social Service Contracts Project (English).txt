                                                                                               e
partnerships with relevant government officials to ensure that government actors take conectiv
action based on feedback provided by citizens.

Activities under this component include:
                                                                                               re

    and monitoring. This will include developing manuals on access to
                                                                                               to
    improving the AskyourGov.ug website that citizens can use to submit information requests
                                                                             r based  system   to
    government officials. It will also include the development of compute
    suppoti contract monitoring data entry and analysis.
    (2) Skills building: On the basis of the developed tools and approaches, training of CSO
                                                                                              the
    leaders and community monitors will be conducted who will be responsible for
    monitoring on the ground and reporting the data of the monitor     ing  results in  different
    districts.




                                                  2
   (3) Application of Monitoring and engagement with decision-makers: Support government
   officials and civil society stakeholders in conducting disclosure and monitoring activities and
   facilitate dialogue and partnerships among players to effectively address citizens' concerns.
   This will include the development and analysis of monitoring reports and monthly meetings
   with community monitors. For the health sector, monitoring activities will be conducted
   regarding improvements of infrastructure in existing health facilities under the Uganda
   Health Systems Strengthening Project (UHSSP). This includes renovation of facilities,
   provision of medical supplies, capacity for operations and maintenance and performance of
   the referral system. On education, monitoring will cover construction of schools under the
   Uganda Post Primary Education Training Project (APLl).
   (4) Media and advocacy campaigns: These advocacy activities include presenting monitoring
   report and recommendations during District Technical Planning Meetings, Ministry Top
   Management Policy Meetings, and Annual Sector Reviews. The project will also work with
   media organizations, especially, radio to disseminate information, education and
   communication materials and messages on open contracting, access to information, public
   procurement and whistle blowing.

Component 3: Enhancing Uganda Contracts Monitoring Coalition Technical &
Institutional Capacity.

This component is focused on strengthening the UCMC at both the technical and institutional
level. The project believes that having an active and strong CSO coalition for joint project
implementation, advocacy and learning will contribute to achieving changes on the local and
national levels in Uganda. Coordinating activities, leveraging resources and advocating with
one voice will put civil society in Uganda in a stronger position to effectively partner with
government agencies.

Activities under this component include:
   (I) Strengthen UCMC governance structure and update UCMC's strategic plan to ensure that
   the UCMC operate effectively, attracts new members and raises additional funding. This will
   include working with a local expert consultant.
   (2) Capacity building support to UCMC members on open contracting, constructive
   engagement, strategic communication and use of new media, advocacy, proposal writing and
   fundraising, social accountability tools and strategies.
   (3) Development and implementation of a communications and advocacy strategy around
   open contracting.
   (4) Monthly UCMC Steering Committee meetings and quarterly UCMC general meetings.

Component 4: Knowledge, Learning and Project Management.

This component focuses on documenting and sharing project tools, methodologies, experiences
and lessons learned from the application of contract disclosure and monitoring activities in
agriculture, education and health. Knowledge products will be shared with other UCMC
members and other CSOs, and goverrunent agencies in Uganda. Through AFIC's website, the
open contracting community of practice and the GPSA knowledge products the projects outputs
and resources will also be shared with other practitioners in Africa and globally. The Open

Category C, requiring no further environmental and social assessment.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Project's main direct beneficiaries are:

(I) Government agencies in Uganda. The project will directly benefit the Public Procurement
and Disposal of Public Assets Authority (PPDA), the Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES),
the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), the Ministry of Health
(MoH), the National Agricultural Advisory Services Secretariat (NAADS) and the Ministry of
Local Government and the respective local governments of five targeted districts where the
project will be implemented. Other government agencies who will benefit from the project are
the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM), the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic
Development (MoFPED), the National Agricultural Research Organization, and the Ministry of
Ethics and Integrity (DEI).

The Uganda Contracts Monitoring Coalition (UCMC) under the coordination of AFIC will work
with these government agencies to improve access to contracting information and to collect
citizens' feedback on contracting procedures and contracting performance. Through the project
government agencies will get information on the effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and
accountability of contracting procedures and processes. Based on the information, they will be
able to address identified problems.

(2) Targeted communities. The project will benefit up to 2,537,100 people living in the Ugandan
districts of Lira, Oyam, Ama, Kabale and Ntungamo. In the agriculture sector, the project will
target local communities, specifically faith-based leaders, women and youth. From the
government side, the project will work with local government district and sub county NAADs
departments and social service departments. The project will facilitate collaboration among all
these players to monitor farmer supplies, equitable delivery of advisory and extension services
and distribution of goods in agricultural zones. In addition, the project will work with citizen
fora on budget transparency, constmctive engagement on access and use of advisory service and
recovery issues. In the health and education sectors, beneficiaries include community monitors



                                                 5
in five targeted districts. Community monitors will be equipped with the necessary tools and
skills to monitor infrastructure contracts in education and health sectors.

(3) Uganda Contracts Monitoring Coalition. The UCMC consists of 22 CSOs. These CSOs are
organized in 6 topic specific clusters: Education, Health, Agriculture, Works and Transport,
Extractives and Water and Environment. Through component 4, the project will strengthen
UCMC's capacity to engage in contract monitoring and successfully advocate for greater
disclosure and participation in public contracting at all stages.

Project's indirect beneficiaries are:

(I) Citizens and CSOs outside of target districts who will benefit from the increased level of
publicly available contracting data and information. In addition, the tools and methodologies that
the project will developed will be disseminated through list-serves, forums and other channels to
make them accessible for a broad audience. To do so, the project will engage the Uganda Social
Accountability Forum coordinated by the National NGO Forum tluÂ·ough which it will share its
lessons, tools and experiences.

(2) Media in Uganda who will benefit from disclosed procurement and contract information and
from the evidence, reports and recommendations generated from the monitoring in this project.
This will contribute to credible reporting on issues related to procurement and contracts in
Uganda.

(3) CSOs working on procurement and contract monitoring in other countries and regions,
including the Open Contracting community. Tools, approaches and learnings will be shared as
part of this project with other practitioners through websites, community of practices and
