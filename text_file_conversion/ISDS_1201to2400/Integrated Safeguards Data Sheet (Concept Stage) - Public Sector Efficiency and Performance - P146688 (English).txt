                           B. Project Objectives
                           The development objectives of the project are to: (i) strengthen public sector resource management;
                           and (ii) establish accountable linkages between the public and private sectors to facilitate growth
                           through investment and trade facilitation.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will support the Government of Jamaica in shifting its policy context from one
                           of fiscal crisis to that of utilizing the public sector as a driver of growth. The project will have two
                           main directions: (i) reinforcing fiscal discipline and revenue enhancement; and (ii) public sector

                           institutional strengthening to support investment and trade.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project encompasses five components:

                           Component 1: Improving the link between policy, planning and budgeting by adopting a results-
                           based multi-year budgeting perspective

                           Component 2: Treasury and Cash Management

                           Component 3: Customs and Regulatory Agency Management

                           Component 4: Support to the Civil Registries System

                           Component 5: Strategic Management and Service Standards in Key Public Sector Institutions

                           None of the Project components involve civil works, such as improvement or rehabilitation of
                           buildings. The policy and administrative changes to be executed do not have connected
                           environmental or social safeguards aspects, but instead are focused on improving the management
                           and efficiency of fiscal programs. Accordingly the Project is considered Category C (no adverse
                           environmental impacts).
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) will be in charge of overall project implementation and is
                           an established partner with World Bank on many projects. PIOJ has the capacity and experience

                           (including fiduciary) in implementing projects funded by World Bank and other donors such as the
                           Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). PIOJ is therefore familiar with safeguards policies;
                           however, as there are no significant environmental or social negative impacts, the institutional
                           capacity with regards to safeguard policies is not expected to be of importance.
