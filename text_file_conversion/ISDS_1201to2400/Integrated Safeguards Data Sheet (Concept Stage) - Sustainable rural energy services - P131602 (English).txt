                           B. Project Objectives
                           The development objective for the proposed project is to enhance the enabling framework and
                           business models to increase access to clean energy services in rural and peri-urban areas. This will be
                           achieved through the promotion of public and private investments in renewable energy for off-grid
                           electrification and efficient cooking solutions.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project consists of the following three components:
                         1.       Component 1: Strengthening Policy and Regulatory Framework (Total: USD 1.00 million -
                         USD 0.85 million SREP-WB, USD 0.15 million GoH). The main goal of this component is to create

                         a more conducive regulatory structure and guidance that would better facilitate greater rural
                         electrification utilizing renewable energy and access to modern cooking solutions. A key activity is
                         the preparation of an indicative Rural Electrification Master Plan that would provide an umbrella
                         policy, which would provide clarity and guide the various scattered electrification efforts including
                         new activities in a cohesive manner that is necessary to progress towards universal electrification.
                         The Master Plan will provide a framework for the development of rural electrification at a national
                         scale by identifying the potential markets for rural electrification, proposing the least-cost technical
                         options to serve those markets, estimating the corresponding investment required, and providing the
                         main technical, social and environmental constraints to be considered. The component will also
                         support the preparation of any other supporting policies and regulations that are identified during
                         preparation and implementation as being important to achieve the overall electrification and energy
                         access goals.

                         2.       Component 2 : Increasing Rural Energy Access
                         �        Component 2A: Off-Grid Rural Electrification (Total: USD 8.50 million - USD 7.0 million
                         SREP-WB, USD 1.50 million GoH). The aim of this sub-component is to assist the GoH develop a
                         national program that will progressively help achieve universal connectivity, particularly focusing on
                         targeting Mancomunidades (grouped Municipalities) that the grid expansion programs are unlikely to
                         serve. It will seize on the existing momentum and private sector capacity that has already been built
                         and look to supporting immediate scale-up of access in areas where there is scope for expansion
                         under existing modalities. The component will also develop specific additional business models that
                         will reach more deeply into rural areas with dispersed populations that would remain unserved under
                         present modalities (i.e. the private dealer model). The effort will primarily focus on household (and
                         community facilities) level electrification through solar photovoltaic systems, and where there are
                         opportunities for off-grid clustered solutions, very small hydroelectric schemes (typically less than
                         100 kW) will be considered. The component will be prepared in coordination with other programs

                         including the World Bank funded PROSOL, in order to support existing efforts and ensure
                         complementarity; and include technical assistance to build institutional capacity for effective
                         implementation The areas of interventions and specific business models that will be supported under
                         the proposed project, the scale of the initial intervention, project impacts including gender impacts,
                         scope for promoting productive activities, and implementation arrangements will be determined
                         during project preparation with the assistance of a consultancy.

                         �        Component 2B: Efficient Cookstove Program (Total: USD 1.93 - USD 1.43 million SREP-
                         WB, USD 0.50 million GoH). This component will be designed to scale-up access to more efficient
                         cooking solutions for the poor in mainly rural and some peri-urban areas. It will develop a
                         comprehensive national program targeting the entire value chain for delivering cookstoves that will
                         create a national strategy and enabling framework, establish standards and certifications, identify
                         financing mechanisms and develop incentives, and build capacity within the private and public sector
                         to implement the program. The component will identify and help strengthen existing efficient
                         business models which take into account socio-cultural preferences (including gender
                         considerations), also helping to design and establish new ones, in order to sustainably and cost-
                         efficiently scale-up the use of clean and efficient cookstoves. It is envisaged that aspects of the
                         program that can most effectively be implemented through the public sector (i.e. mainly initiatives
                         that improve market conditions and investment climate such as development of awareness
                         campaigns, establishment of cookstove standards and certification processes, and monitoring and
                           evaluation frameworks, among others) will be implemented through the proposed project, while
                           various other stakeholders will implement the private aspects, including through a SREP funded
                           related project supported by the Inter-American Development Bank (FOMIN – one of the private

                           sector arms of IDB). The preparation of this component is being carried out in full coordination with
                           IDB as well as other private stakeholders in the cookstoves industry.

                           3.      Component 3: Project Management Support (including Monitoring and Evaluation) (Total:
                           USD 0.61 million - USD 0.51 million SREP-WB, USD 0.10 million GoH). Support implementing
                           agency to coordinate a national rural energy access program including performing monitoring and
                           evaluation.

                           analysis (if known)
                           Development of activities from Component 2A. Off-Grid Rural Electrification might be implemented
                           in selected “Mancomunidades? (a group of joined Municipalities) while activities of Component 2B.
                           National Cookstove Program is expected to be nationwide. Further details on the selected
                           Mancomunidades and locations of the project area will be defined during project preparation.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Honduras Finance Secretary (SEFIN) will serve as the main conduit for the SREP funds, while
                           the project components will be ultimately implemented by other entities that specialize in rural
                           electrification and the modern cooking solutions. These implementing entities will be identified
                           during project preparation and will be defined depending of the needs of the specific business models
                           that the proposed project will ultimately support. Once these agencies are defined, an assessment of
                           the environmental and social management and supervision capacity will be assessed, as necessary.

                           Main risks are associated with the project implementation include: (i) participation of several
                           national institutions, some with limited experience in environmental management, (ii) potentially
                           weak capacity of environmental supervision by the Implementing agencies at the central or local

                           level. SERNA, which is the national authority on environmental impact assessment, water resources
                           and energy, also has limited staff and it is slow in its resolutions which could affect project
                           implementation.
