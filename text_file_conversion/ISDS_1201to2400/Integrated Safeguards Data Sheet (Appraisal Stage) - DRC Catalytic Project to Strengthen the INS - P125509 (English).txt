                           The development objective is to strengthen the capacity of INS to generate and disseminate statistical
                           information.

                                                                        Page 1 of 6

                         This approach acknowledges that financing is only one need, and that improving the skills of existing
                         staff, recruiting trained staff, and a better working environment will help to produce more and better

                         data that will be more readily available for all users.

                         The project will be financed by a Statistics for Results-Catalytic Fund grant of $11.8 million and will
                         consist of three components, including contingency ($0.68m), with:

                         Component A for Increasing INS technical capacity for $0.86m: the objective of this component is
                         to increase the proportion of the professional staff with formal degrees or on-the-job training in areas
                         related to statistics, demography, economics, and information technology (particularly
                         programming). Two approaches will be used to support this objective: study abroad in degree-
                         granting institutions that are supported by international quality assurance standards and on-the-job
                         training for existing staff whose training is not in core fields.

                         Component B to Improve the non-technical environment for $2.94m: the component will support
                         management and fiduciary training, office furnishings, computer hardware, and software for INS
                         staff. The objective is for INS to develop and implement annual work plans relying upon a
                         strengthened fiduciary team with appropriate technology and with a staff skill mix that is, in
                         conjunction with the outputs of Component A, evolving towards what is needed for a statistical
                         office.
                         The buildings used by INS technical departments in the Limete neighborhood of Kinshasa are
                         dilapidated, unsafe, and inadequate for computer-based work. To address this, the project will
                         rehabilitate one or more buildings on the site. This will be done through two project-financed
                         activities. In its first year, the project will finance an architectural site evaluation to explore
                         rehabilitation options. Once a choice is made, the project will finance the rehabilitation of the
                         building(s) selected. This complements the focus by UNFPA and AFDB on provincial INS offices
                         and does not overlap with UNFPAâ€™s work on office space for the Census Bureau. The site is

                         officially assigned to INS and the documentation is in the project file. In order to provide locals for
                         the BCR and the INS departments affected by the rehabilitation, the project will support rental and
                         operation costing for a building where these units will temporarily move for three years.

                         Component C to support the statistical production and dissemination for $7.32m: this component will
                         support the development of critical statistical data that meet the following criteria: broad impact,
                         currently severely outdated, and infrequent in nature. It will also provide for the development and
                         implementation of archiving and dissemination policies for statistical information in order to increase
                         access, use, and quality of the information produced. It will focus on the Mapping phase of the
                         Population and Housing Census; the Enterprise census and cover activities to Improving access to
                         statistical information.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will primarily be undertaken in Kinshasa. Data collection financed under the project will
                         affect the entire country. Training financed under the project will affect primarily Kinshasa-based
                         staff, although provincial staff will also benefit from training.
                         Safeguards aspects are limited to the INS compound in Limete, a neighborhood of Kinshasa. More
                         details are in Section II.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Project impacts are not expected to be large scale, significant or irreversible; potentially adverse
                              impacts will be minor and site specific. Impacts will be limited to the rehabilitation of one single-
                              story building inside a walled property (estimated at 125m x 100m), a compound owned and used
                              by INS as offices. An architectural evaluation will be undertaken with project funds to define

                           The project will not finance (i) land acquisition, (ii) involuntary resettlement, or (iii) restriction of
                           access to resources or livelihoods and will provide no financing for any activity that would result
                           in (i) land acquisition, (ii) involuntary resettlement, or (iii) restriction of access to resources or
                           livelihoods. The planned works will be done within an enclosed site that is owned by government
                           with no claims or encroachments on the land.
                           The social safeguards risks of the project are generic and not location specific. The risks are
                           related to the potential exclusion of some segments of the population during the census mapping
                           operation; that preclusion could potentially induce social disturbances. To mitigate potential
                           exclusion risks, the methodology of the census is designed to be all inclusive, and it will establish
                           a mechanism for addressing attrition; to ensure the statistical representation of the entire
                           population of DRC; irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, religion or civil status. Indigenous
                           people as well as vulnerable groups will be incorporated into the census roster, and the the project
                           includes preparation of a plan to communicate to IPs and other vulnerable groups to ensure they
                           understand and participate in the census.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           No major impacts are anticipated. The project is rehabilitating office space for the INS, which
                           should not lead to significantly increased future activities in the area or long term impact. After
                           rehabilitation, INS will go about its normal business which is collecting, processing and analyzing
                           statistical data.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Not relevant.

                           An environmental screening of the project has been carried out, including an environmental
                           management plan with a snag list. The snag list will be part of the contract document. Potential
                           needs for supervision, if any, will be ensured by the supervision consultant. The Ministry of
                           Environment, through the Groupe d'Etudes Environementales du Congo (GEEC); has the capacity
                           to address potential safeguards issues encountered by the project. The GEEC ensures safeguards
                           compliance for all investments in DRC. The project is not expected to induce any major
                           environmental impacts that would trigger a full environmental impact assessment (EIA), beyond a
                           screening.
                           To mitigate potential exclusion risks during census mapping, the methodology of the census is
                           designed to be all inclusive, and it will establish a mechanism for addressing attrition; to ensure
                           the statistical representation of the entire population of DRC; irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity,
                           religion or civil status. Indigenous people as well as vulnerable groups will be incorporated into
                           the census roster. Cartography agents will be specifically trained to locate and interview small
                           population groups in sensitive areas and in the forest. For this, the Government will receive
                           assistance from UNFPA and its experts.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The project will not negatively affect other properties or people. The environmental impacts are
                           limited by the compound wall, which is unbroken (aside from the entrance doors) and rises to

                           the snag list, will be disclosed in country and at the Bank prior to Appraisal.
