2. Project Objectives

The objectives of these advisory services are to (i) assess the soundness of the West -East
corridor pendulum service concept, (ii) identify feeder ports (first movers) for
implementation of the pendulum service system, and (iii) identify and assess operational
improvements and investment needs in these ports, and propose a financing strategy for the
operational improvements in these ports.
3. Project Description

The advisory services are organized in three Components as follows:

      Component 1: Review of existing studies and documents to assess the soundness of
       the West-East corridor pendulum service concept
      Component 2: Identify potential feeder ports susceptible to feed the Pendulum
       Concept or being expected to require improvements based on expected growth of
       containerized cargo volumes
      Component 3: Develop a financing strategy for the feeder ports

Component 1: Review of existing studies and documents to assess the soundness of the
West-East corridor pendulum service concept
                                              1
The key proposal in the context of which the port requirements are to be analyzed is a West-
East “Pendulum Service? linking Belawan, Batam, Tanjung Priok, Tanjung Perak, Makassar
and Sorong. It is described in detail in a report, “Business review on Domestic Container
Main Sea Corridor – Final Report V4 Dec 2012, by Drewry Maritime Advisors.?

All other relevant studies, master plans, evaluations, evaluations carried out in the port,
shipping and trade sectors, laws and regulation, including in particular the NPMP, the study
on Inter-Island transport services, the Logistics Blueprint, etc., would also be taken into
account. Special attention will be paid to the Eastern part of Indonesia.

The following main tasks will be carried out:

   A review of existing studies and documents to assess the soundness of the concept of the
    West-East Shipping corridor, and the “pendulum services?. In particular, the assessment
    will seek to confirm the shipping cost reductions that could be achieved with (i) larger
    ships giving economies of size, (ii) new itineraries and (iii) faster turnaround in port with
    additional handling equipment, which will in turn increase throughput at the container
    terminals in terms of TEU per meter p.a. The review will also include an examination of:
    - The advantages and disadvantages of the pendulum services when compared with the
        current system, in particular the hub and spoke system with transshipment at Tanjung
        Priok and Tanjung Perak;
    - How the costs of the pendulum services would compare with those of current
        services;
    - Whether the traffic levels will be high enough to fill large vessels and justify the
        handling equipment, especially gantry cranes, necessary to turn them round quickly at
        the ports;
    - The feasibility of achieving the necessary levels of handling efficiency at domestic
        ports, given the current levels of productivity in Indonesian ports and the institutional
        changes in the ports industry introduced in Shipping law 17 of 2008; and
    - The impact of the economic integration within the Association of Southeast Asian
        Nations (ASEAN).
   Assessment of the domestic shipping sector, including the regulatory and legal
    framework, routing, tariff structure, etc., and interviews with the top shipping
    lines/association ) to obtain their views on the prospects for the pendulum concept, its
    strengths and weaknesses, whether they would support it and the process by which the
    Concept would be introduced.
   Interviews with other stakeholders along the inter-island logistic chain (e.g. freight
    forwarders, truckers, terminal operators, importers and exporters, relevant ministries and
    government agencies) the ministries and other government bodies to seek their views on
    current and the proposed shipping services, and to identify the current constraints to
    access to markets and barriers to competition in transport services.
   Prospects for additional transshipment traffic under the proposed shipping services and
    for the proposed shipping services to unlock more of the economic potentials of the
    hinterlands of the ports.



                                                2
   Rrecommendations on the development of priority shipping routes or sub-routes,
    covering vessel sizes, frequency of services, handling speeds, etc. The pattern of routes
    could be revised to one based on hub ports with feeder services.
   Review of the port master plans of the five pendulum ports to assess their alignment with
    the pendulum concept. This review will include traffic forecasts, berth occupancies, the
    economic evaluations, the lists of investments and equipment requirements, etc.;
   Indication of actions required to implement the Pendulum Concept

Component 2: Identify potential feeder ports susceptible to feed the Pendulum Concept or
being expected to require improvements based on expected growth of containerized cargo
volumes and assess the investment and operational improvement needs in these ports to
handle the forecasted traffic.

The identification of the ports will be based on the forecasted container traffic and population
size. The identification will include the following steps:
 From the all of the commercial ports in Indonesia, 15 to 20 ports will be selected for a
    generic assessment, in order to determine, six to seven so-called “Pilot? ports (first
    movers) which will be subject to further detailed assessment and development projection.
 Presentation of feeder ports to a broader audience of stakeholders.

The assessment of the “Pilot?- port investment and improvement needs will include the
following steps:
 Traffic forecasts (Containers)
 Current berth occupancies, equipment, handling speeds, etc.
 Capacities of feeder ports (with existing and improved operations)
 Comparison of port capacity and future traffic, to derive the need for additional berths
    and handling equipment
 Optional berth designs
 Prefeasibility cost estimates (capital and operating)
 Issues that may impact the port development, e.g. major environmental issues, bottleneck
    to reach the hinterlands, etc.
 Revenue forecasts with existing tariffs
 Comparison of forecast revenues and estimated costs


Component 3: Develop a financing strategy for selected pilot ports

An assessment will be carried out to identify the feeder ports which may be suitable for
private sector involvement and those which should be funded under public sector financing.
The analysis will consider affordability, budget allocations, the level of competition, nature
of the service, etc.

For this purpose, the following tasks will be carried out:
• Review of the environment for private sector involvement in ports in Indonesia,
   especially institutional and regulatory, tariff setting, etc.;
• Based on the analyses and other considerations in the previous Component, for each
   feeder port financing options will be suggested. They may include financing from
                                               3
   accumulated surpluses from IPC or the individual ports, loans from commercial banks
   based on the ports’ own balance sheets, government funding, investment and operation
   by private companies (e.g. possibly ship operators), joint investments, public sector
   investments which can later be sold to the private sector, loans/guarantees from
   development agencies and possibly bonds.

All data and information necessary to carry out Components 2 and 3 will be provided by IPC.
It will include among others historic traffic data (for the last 5 years), broken down into laden
and empty, inbound and outbound, and domestic and international containers. Where
possible the statistics would distinguish between inbound traffic with foreign and domestic
origins, and outbound traffic with foreign and domestic final destinations. The data provided
by IPC should also include details of other traffic that shares the berths with containers. the
ports’ accounts, information necessary to calculate port capacity, including ship turnaround
times, container handling rates and berth occupancies (for the last 5 years), data on
development plans for the hinterlands, socio-economic data, data on hinterland connections,
etc. In addition, IPC will supply information on equipment and asset inventories for every
feeder port with details of technical specifications, age, etc., plans and drawings of all port
facilities, access land and sea characteristics, staffing of port work force, etc.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis

The project location spans the entire country. But the project location of specific foreseen
(future) investments will be at the 6-7 “Pilot? feeder ports (mostly domestic ports) selected
from the set of 15-20 existing ports and will feed the “bigger? Pendulum Ports mentioned
above in the Corridor.

Since the locations of the selected “Pilot? ports are still unknown, the salient physical
characteristics relevant to safeguards analysis cannot be identified at this moment. However,
in general, these ports are smaller than the Pendulum Ports and the approximate locations
will be along and around the Pendulum corridor: Belawan-close to Medan in North
Sumatera- east coast, Batam (still in Sumatra Island – close to Singapore and Pulau Riau,
Bintan), Jakarta’s Tanjung Priok , Surabaya’s Tanjuk Perak (both are in Java Island),
Makasar ( South Sulawesi) and Sorong ( West Papua)- close to the famous Raja Ampat
diving spots and the BP (British Petroleum) Gas Plant in Tangguh.

The feeder “pilot? ports may be located a long distance from the Pendulum Ports especially if
they are in eastern parts of Indonesia. Other feeder ports are mostly located in converted
land areas or coastal areas, such as in Sumatra and Java (western parts of Indonesia). The
pilot feeder ports’ investment and operational improvement might involve infrastructure
development or canal enlargement in natural environment comprising such as in the
mangrove systems, delta, coastal and marine ecosystem, and also wetlands area of which
adjacent to the existing infrastructure or within a considerable distance. These activities may
also require land acquisition and resettlement. Increased feeder ports activities due to
investment and operational improvement may lead to increased sea and land traffic that may
lead to disturbance to the sea-based livelihoods for the fishermen and social costs,
respectively. Indigenous Peoples may also be present in or around the foreseen pilot feeder

                                               4
ports that need investment and operational improvement in coastal areas especially in the
eastern parts of Indonesia.

Overall, improved sea freight system due to investment and operational improvements of the
“pilot? feeder ports might increase adverse environmental and social impacts along the
Pendulum corridor.

However, it is important to note that the RAS will focus primarily on the studies and
assessment activities on the investment and operational improvements, as well as assessment
of the financing schemes for the proposed investment and operational improvements of the
pilot feeder ports. Hence, the RAS will not be involved directly in any physical works.

There are, however, potential safeguards implications relating to the foreseen investments
and operational improvements that may arise from the activities in this RAS as explained
above that should be carefully assessed and managed. Especially for the potential feeder
ports susceptible to feed the Pendulum Concept or being expected to require improvements
based on the forecasted traffic and expected growth of containerized cargo volumes.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                                                                        X

The proposed project related RAS aims at identifying port improvements for existing smaller secondary container
or potential future container ports, including identification of physical investments through pre-feasibility studies. It
is classified as a Category A intervention because if the recommendations of the RAS are implemented, there may
be larger investment needs for operational improvements of selected ports, involving port development,
geographically dispersed across the country’s seawater, and therefore there might be potential adverse
environmental and social impacts which are significant, irreversible and sensitive.

Besides the general adverse construction impacts from the “pilot? feeder port operat ional improvements such as
impact on air, land, water, soil and human from the dust, noise and construction wastes material, the infrastructure
improvements might also bring adverse environmental impacts such as morphology change in the estuarine system
from canal widening, dredging activities and the dredged material disposal, and port expansion.

Also during port operations after improvements are made, there might be potential adverse environmental impacts
from increased traffic and possible spillage from the shipped materials in containers such as petroleum products,
ore concentrate, hazardous chemicals and substance and waste water (ballast water) disposal from larger ships.
Also distraction to the marine, coastal or estuarine ecosystem and mangrove forest are possible due to new
itineraries and faster turnaround in ports with additional handling equipment.

Significant and adverse social impacts may also take place during port improvement construction and operation of
the ports due to the potential land taking, access restriction, disturbance on existing settlements, relocation and
increased sea (e.g. which may disturb the sea-based livelihoods for the fishermen) and land traffic volume (e.g.
which may increase social costs) around the ports.


Given the nature of the advisory service described above, environmental and social safeguard requirements will be
integrated directly into the RAS activities in a manner that commensurate to the level and type of activities. .
Specifically,
          A. Component 1: The component 1 assessment of the technical and commercial/financial soundness of
               the West-East corridor pendulum service concept will screen potential significant environment and
               social impacts resulting from the changes from the existing sea freight service system (more ports,
               more ships, less efficient routes) to the proposed pendulum service system (less ports, bigger ships,
               more efficient routes). In order to do so RAS will develop and apply a set of environmental and
               social criteria to be included in the assessment of the West-East Pendulum service system to
               integrate environmental and social aspects in the advice provided. RAS will include criteria that are
               generic or at a macro level depending on the type of advice provided.
          B. Component 2:
               a. A set of environmental and social safeguards screening criteria to identify potential impacts
                     will be applied to the selection of 6-7 pilot ports (first movers) from the pool of 15-20 ports.
                     This will also be done at the macro level and focus only on significant impacts that could affect
                     or will inform the selection process.
               b. Safeguards requirements will be integrated into the detailed assessment of operation
                     improvements of the potential ports. For example, when identifying improvements that involve
                     dredging or land acquisition, the study should identify the safeguards requirements (EIA, EMP,
                     RP, etc.) to be taken into account when and if a subsequent investment occurs beyond the RAS.
          C. Component 3: In addition to the financial and technical costs the RAS should also include the
               estimated costs of preparing and implementing the needed safeguard instruments such as EIA, EMP,
               RP and IPP, etc. in the financing plan for each of the “pilot? feeder ports.

The RAS will hire consultants to undertake above tasks for component 1, 2, and 3, the Terms of References (TOR)
for which will be reviewed by the safeguards specialists of the RAS team.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.

This project has triggered Environment Assessment (OP 4.01) and the triggering of other
safeguard policies will be determined during project preparation through a screening process.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

Long term, irreversible and cumulative environmental impacts to mangrove and coastal and
marine ecosystem are possible from the port expansion proposal, larger ships used, faster
port turnaround, and also from the possible dredging activities. Also the future port
improvements proposed but beyond this RAS could cause possible impacts to surrounding
Indigenous Peoples and livelihood impact because of potential land acquisition and
resettlement. Regional environmental and social impacts along the Pendulum Service
System corridor that includes the main ports and feeder ports area of sea and land traffic may
also occur as explained in the above sections. The proposed safeguards requirements when
identifying investments and operational improvements will ensure that the significant long-
term impacts are well addressed in safeguard implementation during both feasibility study of
those improvements, construction and operation of those improvements.




                                              8
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

The selection process of different ports will include environment and social safeguards
criteria.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of the grantee capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The state-owned port service company, Indonesia Port Corporation (IPC) or PT. PELINDO
II, is an established port management organization, with adequate experience and satisfactory
performance in addressing national environmental regulation and policy. They have
implemented several CSR (Corporate Social Responsibilities) activities for the communities.
However, they lack experience in dealing with the World Bank safeguards policies. The RAS
will help enhance capacity of PT PELINDO II to implement environmental and social
safeguards management.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders of the RAS are PT PELINDO II, Bappenas, and the Ministry of Transport,
Ministry of SOEs, Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs as well as population located
in the project area. Direct beneficiaries are users of the ports who will get a more reliable,
stable and efficient port services.

The TORs for component 1, 2 and 3 will be consulted with relevant stakeholders (PT
PELINDO II, Bappenas, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of SOEs, Coordinating Ministry of
Economic Affairs, users of the ports, and stakeholders interested in ports and sea freight
development, etc.). This ISDS will be publicly disclosed in the Bank
