•   Design and implement a communication strategy to disseminate the findings to exact

Policy advocacy to influence the budget planning processes in the education and health sectors
at the district and national levels. Activities including in this stage are:

•   Facilitate the development of "citizen budgets" in targeted districts and to consolidate them
    into national citizen budgets on education and health and share them with relevant actors
    (ministries, parliamentary sub-committees and media).
•   Facilitate the participation of the PME network at the district and national level, so that
    network members can use citizen budget (at the district level) and the consolidated version at
    the national level to influence budgetary allocations
•   Use/share citizen monitoring findings (see activities above) to hold multi-stakeholder policy
    dialogues (involving representatives from various line ministries and local Government
    officials, PME network members, parliamentarians etc.) sessions at different levels including
    the participation of targeted ministries representatives as well as Parliamentary sub-
    committees to exact commitments from their part to act on the findings. This consultations
    will happen in intervals (i) mid-term review to discuss progress with the stakeholders (ii)
    sharing of completion report at the end of the project.

Strengthening the existing Budget Monitoring System in Ghana. Activities included in this
stage are aimed to support concrete actions from Govermnent actors and parliamentary sub-
committees to strengthen the existing budget M&E system and compliance with budget laws and
guidelines towards improving the access and quality of education and health services, including:

•   Hold multi-stakeholder dialogue with the ministries of Finance and Planning, other levels of
    Government. and Parliamentary committees to share evidence based recommendation on
    how to strengthen the existing M&E system
•   Asses and monitor changes made by target ministries in their M&E systems based on
    evidence-based mechanisms implemented in the project and/ the use of monitoring
    information/data by Parliament in budget hearing sessions to request compliance with budget
    laws and guidance.

It is intended that implementation of evidence -based social accountability mechanisms and tools
will boost government actions to improve current outcomes in the delivery of education and
health services while providing insights into relevant budgetary macro context to seek
compliance and to apply corrective measure in subsequent budget cycles in order to better
address the needs of the poor.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an

This project is not expected to trigger any safeguards policies as the project screening identified
minimal environmental or social risks related to project activities. The project does not anticipate
any civil works to be financed under this Grant. The project is assigned the Environmental
Category C, requiring no further environmental and social assessment.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
The Project's direct beneficiaries include: all children of school going age, women and children
under-five, and persons with disability in 50 districts in the Northern, Upper East, Upper West
and Greater Accra regions, who have not benefitted from improved living conditions and poverty
reduction as other parts of the country have in recent years.

The Project's indirect beneficiaries include: (I) Municipal and Ministry Assembly (MMDAs) by
increasing their capacity to comply with the fiscal decentralization requirements, through
increased engagement with' civil society actors as stated in the Decentralization Action Plan.
Regional Coordinating Councils (RCCs) which will receive feedback about the budget from
CSOs and DAs. (2) The Ministry of Finance and relevant line Ministries (Health and Education)
which will have additional information on how effectively public funds allocated in the national
budget are spent at the local level. Furthermore, the Project will develop an on-line messaging
platform to collect citizens' feedback and provide information to target ministries so that they
can respond to specific citizens' budgetary concerns; (3) Parliamentary Committees will have
direct access to citizen information about budget allocations and expenditures which will
empower their oversight capacity in holding the Executive accountable; (4) International donor
programs supporting the governance process and specific sectors in Ghana; and (5) all Ghanaian
citizens and civil society organizations that may benefit from the information and knowledge
generated by the Project, within and outside the targeted regions. The Project expects to design
and implement a communications strategy (engage journalists and community radio stations) to
disseminate relevant information and thus reach out to Ghanaian citizens and other critical
groups to enhance citizens' "political awareness."
