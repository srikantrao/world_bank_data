                          2. Project Development Objective(s)
                         The project developmental objective is to enable electricity trade between Senegal, Guinea, Guinea-
                         Bissau and The Gambia.
                          3. Project Description
                         The proposed project will support the expansion of the transmission network among member states
                         of the OMVG and provide technical assistance to support project implementation and operation of
                         the transmission facilities. The OMVG interconnection consists of: (i) 1,677 km of power
                         transmission line in 225 kV; (ii) 15 substations HV / MV for powering loads from national utilities;
                         and (iii) two dispatching centers (see Figure 2 below). The project will be implemented by OMVG
                         Secretariat. The project will also partly finance the operations and maintenance contract costs for the
                         first five years of operations (FY2018-2022).

                         Components of the project will comprise:
                         Component 1: Extension of WAPP transmission network – OMVG Interconnection (Component cost
                         US$584 million; IDA credit US$161 million).
                         Component 2: Technical Assistance to OMVG (Component cost US$115 million, IDA Credit US$39
                         million).
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project includes construction of a 651km 225 kV transmission line (of a total 1700km in the
                         network), connecting the electrical networks of the four countries of the OMVG (Gambia, Guinea,
                         Guinea-Bissau and Senegal). Though the provisional right-of-ways (COTECO, 2006) are identified

                         out-of sensitive areas, they may finally cross various landscapes including forests, degraded
                         savannas, wetlands, agricultural and pasture lands human settlements. In light of that, biodiversity
                         conservation and disturbance of water courses during the construction phase will be of important
                         concern. The expected impacts will be detailed in the existing environmental and social
                         documentation (ESIA, ESMP, and RAP prepared in 2004 and revised 2006) which are being
                         updated by the OMVG secretariat.

                                                        2004 and 2006 and captured the essential of these
                                                        impacts. It found that a large part of the potential impacts
                                                        is linked to the construction activities and can be managed
                                                        by good construction practices. In the
                                                        operation phase, the impacts are, in general, minor or
                                                        negligible. The overall environmental impact of the
                                                        transmission line, therefore, appears to be moderate. The

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Preparation has highlighted following potential impacts:
                              •        270 hectares (4 percent of the project influence area) of gazetted forest areas or park forest
                              will be cleared in The Gambia, thereby inducing temporary disturbance of terrestrial fauna and
                              potential depletion of flora diversity; however no irreversible or high magnitude adverse impacts
                              are related to the loss of natural habitats and terrestrial wildlife due to the RoW passing though the
                              marginal areas of gazetted forests. Further review during appraisal of area data in consultation
                              with the Gambia National Environmental Agency (NEA) confirmed this. The ESMP includes
                              measures to minimize deforestation, avoid critical habitats and species, and restore vegetation,
                              gallery forests and mangroves.
                              •        8,750 hectares of land will be permanently set aside for the construction and maintenance
                              of project infrastructure. Of this, it is expected that the project will result in a loss of 8 hectares of
                              agricultural land out of the 2,050 hectares directly impacted by the RoW and the substations. The
                              remaining 6,700 hectares to be set aside represent the marginal areas around the RoW in which
                              electromagnetic waves present potential health risks following construction of the transmission
                              lines;

                              •        Three houses potentially affected by the construction of substation in Labe (Guinea).
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              Indirect and/or long-term potential impacts include the following:
                              •        Increased human pressure on the degrading of non-gazette forest ecosystems and
                              savannahs because of increased access.
                              •        Occupational diseases and risks during construction because of immigrant employees and
                              non-compliance to safety measures.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              There have been no project alternatives identified.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                              86.      A total amount of US$4,300,000 is provisioned for the implementation of the
                              Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP), excluding the measures embedded in the
                              enterprise proposals. Under component 2.1 of the project, the World Bank will finance the non-
                              compensation related aspects of the ESMP (estimated to be US$1.1 million of the US$4.3 million
                              total ESMP costs). Compensation and resettlement costs will be the responsibility of the
                              recipients. Cash compensation payments may be made for crop damage, land acquisition,

                           process will work, how cash will be handled, what security measures will be in place to ensure that
                           the funds are used correctly and the necessary proofs of payment that will be required.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The environmental and social mitigations measures will be executed, monitored and reported in
                           the Environmental and Social Safeguards section of the overall project periodic report. Apart from
                           the PMU national ESIA institutions that are responsible according to regulations, the following
                           stakeholders can play roles in the follow up of the execution of the safeguard due diligences:
                           •       Environmental and Social Management Steering Committee: chaired by the Executive
                           Secretariat of OMVG, it will have the mandate of approving the annual work plan and budget on
                           the environmental management side.
                           •       Conservation Independent Expert Panel (CIEP): composed of representatives of NGOs as
                           envisioned by the OMVG Secretariat, the panel will assist in forming recommendations if any loss
                           of natural habitat occurs after the delineation of the Right-of-way of the transmission lines.
                           •       Local Committees of Dialogue and Follow up: composed of relevant public institutions,
                           NGOs and representatives of affected people, the committees will be set up at national or
                           subnational level, as appropriate.
