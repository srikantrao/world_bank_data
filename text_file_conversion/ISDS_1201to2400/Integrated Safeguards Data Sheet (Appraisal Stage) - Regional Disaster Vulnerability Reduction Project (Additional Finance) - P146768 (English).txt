2. Project Development Objective(s)
   A. Original Project Development Objectives – Parent
   The Program aims at measurably reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change
   impacts in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The objective of the Project in Grenada is to
   measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Grenada and in
   the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The objective of the Project in Saint Vincent and the
   Grenadines is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in
   Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The achievement of
   the Program Development Objectives of the Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program
   (RDVRP) would be measured using the following key indicators: (a) Reduced risk of OECS
   population to failure of public buildings and infrastructure due to natural hazards or climate
   change impacts; and (b) Increased capacity of OECS Governments to identify and monitor
   climate risk and impacts.
   B. Current Project Development Objectives – Parent


   C. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)


3. Project Description
The proposed AF would be used for: a) emergency recovery activities; b) scale up activities; and c)
cost overrun. Additional financing is required to cover the reconstruction needs as a results of the
disaster, the financing gap for completion of the on-going RDVRP activities and the project scale up
is required for financing new activities of similar type and objective to activities already included in
RDVRP. There would be no change in the overall project design the project components would
remain the same.

The additional funds will be used by the GoSVG to fill its financial gaps to adequately address its
emergency recovery needs. The additional funds will be used for recovery and reconstruction efforts
with a particular focus on the transport infrastructure to integrate disaster risk management and
overall climate resilience.

The main causes for the cost overruns are: a) inflation since the approval of RDVRP in June 2011; b)
increase in the scope of civil works activities due to damage occurred on account of heavy rain
events experienced since 2011 combined with further decay and damage to identified rehabilitation
sub-projects due to a lack of maintenance; and c) expanded scope of pre-engineering and design
consultancy services required to further incorporate disaster and climate risk.

For project scale up, the proposed additional activities are in line with the original project objectives
and would be the best mechanism to maximize development impact. The magnitude of scale up
activities can be easily accommodated within the context of the project framework. Moreover, most
of the scale-up activities were part of the initial RDVRP appraisal, but due to financing limitations all
the activities could not be included under the RDVRP. Additionally, the PSIMPU would hire the


                                              Page 2 of 10
requisite additional staff to ensure the appropriate capacity is in place; coupled with the fact that the
PSIPMU has gained sufficient experience in the overall project management, the PSIMPU would
have the adequate capacity to implement the scaled up project.

Component 1: Prevention and Adaptation Investments
The proposed AF would be used to cover emergency response activities, financing gaps and scale up
to increase the impact of RDVRP in terms of building disaster and climate resilience of the built
infrastructure in the proposed Project locations. The AF would finance the following type of
activities: (i) river training and bridge rehabilitations; (ii) retrofitting and rehabilitation of public
buildings; (iii) rehabilitation and risk reduction of transportation infrastructure including slope
stabilization and road realignments; and (iii) support for the preparation of future sub-projects.
Specific sub-projects and activities identified under this component are summarized as follows:

• Emergency recovery river trainings and bridge rehabilitation;

• Financing gaps for consulting services to develop detailed designs for the Milton Cato Memorial
Hospital;

• Scaled up consulting services and civil works to construct 2 additional satellite warehouses;

• Emergency recovery and scaled up consulting services and civil works for slope stabilization and
road realignment works in the Dark View, Troumaca, Petit Bordel, Rose Bank, Ginger Village, Mt.
Greenan, Maroon Hill, Spring, English Gutter, German Gutter and Coull’s Hill areas; and

• Consulting services to carry out feasibility and pre-engineering studies and preparation of
preliminary designs - including reliable cost estimates at Paget Farm in Bequia.

Component 2: Regional Platforms for Hazard and Risk Evaluation, and Applications for Improved
decision making
The proposed AF would be used to cover financing gaps and scale up for the following activities to
increase the impact of RDVRP. Specific sub-projects and activities identified under this component
are summarized as follows:

• Scaled up scope for construction of: (i) South River Bridge; (ii) Green Hill Bridge; (iii) Dauphine
Bridge; and (iv) Fenton River Fords aimed at Flood Mitigation measures for Arnos Vale/
Warrawarrow River Watershed Pilot;

• Scaled up consulting services and civil works for River Defense Works at (i) Buccament; and (ii)
Carriere;

• Emergency recovery coastal defense works in Dark View and Sans Souci; and

• Financing gaps required for the construction of Georgetown Coastal Defense.

Component 3: Natural disaster response investment
The proposed AF would be used to replenish the emergency respo nse component that was utilized in
response to the December 2013 disaster event.

Component 4: Project Management and Implementation Support

                                              Page 3 of 10
The AF would support strengthening of project management capacity by providing a Senior Quantity
Surveyor and Procurement and Contract Management Specialist. The AF would also support M&E
training, including the PPCR program level M&E, for the PSIPMU and staff of key implementing
agencies. Project management and implementation support activities may include training and
capacity building through participating in regional workshops and seminars. These activities are
designed to improve national capacity for disaster risk management and climate change monitoring
to support the integration of risk management principles into national development planning. In
addition, the activities would strengthen the capacity of the PSIPMU to coordinate disaster risk
management and climate resilience activities under the Project.
 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Project works may be undertaken in the principal islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines such as
St. Vincent, Bequia, Canoaun, and Union Island. Works contemplated relate to the repair and
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, retrofitting of key government buildings and new facility
construction (particularly satellite warehouses), geotechnical studies and engineering supervision for
slope stabilization along critical road segments, as well as river defense works and coastal erosion
protection studies. The possible project locations have been field-checked by World Bank staff and
are being inventoried and assessed in updated safeguards assessment instruments.

 Environmental Assessment OP/        Yes             An Environmental Management Framework
 BP 4.01                                             (EMF) was prepared and disclosed by the
                                                     government in-country on January 27, 2014 based
                                                     on the updated project portfolio for St. Vincent
                                                     and the Grenadines. The EMF updated and
                                                     expanded the previously prepared Environmental
                                                     Assessment (EA) by providing screening methods
                                                     and procedures for the application of Bank
                                                     safeguards, including guidance on the scope of
                                                     studies necessary to complete for each subproject,
                                                     criteria for triggering additional studies in the
                                                     case of complex or significant activities, and a
                                                     generic Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

                                                     no additional assessment. It is likely that the
                                                     majority of works will be relatively minor in
                                                     nature and involve simple civil works where the
                                                     environmental impacts are limited to the
                                                     construction phase, requiring only the application
                                                     of a standardized generic EMP, which was
                                                     included in the EMF. However, any exceptions
                                                     will be identified by screening as described in the

                                                during implementation.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04       Yes           This safeguard has been triggered as a precaution
                                                due to potential project activities which may
                                                occur in highland forest areas, river valleys,
                                                coastlines and/or marine areas. During project
                                                preparation potentially sensitive areas were
                                                identified in riparian areas near Green Hill where
                                                bridge work is planned, at Georgetown where
                                                coastal defenses are under study, and at Ginger
                                                Village where a new road segment may be
                                                constructed. In the case of future undefined
                                                works, this policy along with all other Bank
                                                safeguards will be included in the screening
                                                procedures provided under the project EMF.
Forests OP/BP 4.36                No            There are no activities which would involve
                                                harvesting or change in management of forest
                                                resources.
Pest Management OP 4.09           No            There are no plans for subprojects which involve
                                                augmenting the use the pesticides, herbicides or
                                                activities related to the management of pests.

                                                or vector control will be managed by including
                                                appropriate procedures in the generic
                                                standardized EMP for inclusion into contracts.
Physical Cultural Resources OP/   Yes           While no works have been identified in sensitive
BP 4.11                                         areas, this safeguard is triggered as there is the
                                                small likelihood for encountering sites of cultural
                                                historical significance, particularly in the case of
                                                new construction excavations. In the case of
                                                small civil works, procedures for chance find are
                                                included in the EMF and its generic EMP
                                                together with appropriate small works contract
                                                clauses.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     In accordance with Bank environmental safeguards requirements, the program has been classified
     as Category B, and the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) is triggered.

    Environmental Safeguards. Prior to appraisal, the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
    (GoSVG) has updated and disclosed in-country the project-level EMF, which includes guidance
    during project execution for screening possible subprojects to identify complex projects or those in
    sensitive areas and which would require additional studies to comply with safeguards policies. A
    qualified external consultant has prepared this safeguards instrument for the project with support
    and guidance from the World Bank specialist during project preparation missions.

    For relatively uncomplicated projects, the EMF includes generic mitigation measures through the
    development of a generic EMP, to be included in the Operations Manual and included in future
    environmental compliance contracting clauses. Subprojects in environmentally complex settings
    or with potentially significant impacts (if unmitigated) will be identified using the screening
    methods in the EMF and will have individual Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) prepared
    as required during implementation, to develop subproject-specific mitigation measures.

    The EMF defines the principles, guidelines and procedures for assessing the environmental
    impacts of future individual subprojects identified and designed during project implementation.
    Procedures for screening future subprojects, selecting mitigation measures and conducting
    additional subproject-specific EIAs (if required due to environmental complexity and / or
    safeguard triggering) are also defined. The EMF specifically responds to the types of projects/sub-
    projects under Components 1 and 2 and includes standard procedures for mitigating environmental
    impacts of construction, monitoring and reporting. The EMF provides procedures for the
    application of Bank safeguards including information on subproject screening and categorization.
    Finally, the EMF includes a section with safeguards guidelines for emergency investments and
    works including a provision for expedited specialist review and the preparation of any safeguards
    studies prior to works as pertinent under OP 10.00.

    Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04. The EMF has been written to account for natural habitats when
    screening both known works and any future activities which are currently undefined. Most works
    in the portfolio will not affect natural habitats, and only a few have been identified with the
    potential to do so. During project preparation potentially sensitive areas were identified in riparian

  under study, and at Ginger Village where a new road segment may be constructed. Preliminary
  assessment of these projects were included in the EMF, which also contains guidance and
  procedures for screening future projects and triggering additional studies if need be. Erosion
  control, river defense and slope stabilization works thus far proposed are focused on mitigating
  existing landslides along public roads and are located in areas of previously altered habitat;
  however, areas with preserved riparian vegetation near bridges and on new roadway segments will
  be further assessed as explained in the EMF. Candidate sea defense works include extensive
  baseline data collection and a specific Environmental Impact Assessment as part of alternative
  selection and design. Locations for building rehabilitation and construction have been identified
  and will be subject to site screening, and as described in the EMF, the candidate work sites will be
  identified and reviewed for potential application of this policy. In the case of future undefined
  works, this policy along with all other Bank safeguards will be included in the screening
  procedures provided under the project EMF.

  Pest Management OP 4.09. This safeguard has not been triggered. Although some subproject
  activities may require the use of pesticides for termite control, road maintenance activities or
  emergency activities such as crop recovery or vector control, the use will be incidental and minor.
  The EMF has also provided for restricting pesticide use to licensed providers and other measures
  to ensure that this minimal use of pesticides is responsibly managed.

  Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11. This safeguard is triggered as a precaution as project
  activities may potentially include historical building retrofits, restoration of culturally significant
  structures, and chance finds of historically or culturally significant resources during construction
  of works. The EA and EMF include screening for historical structures as well as a "chance-find"
  procedure, particularly during activities such as major excavations, road realignments or similar
  works where such assets could be affected.

  Social Safeguards OP/BP 4.12. This safeguard is triggered as project activities will likely involve
  permanent or temporary acquisition of private lands. Land acquisition will likely be on a small
  scale and the nature and extent will be determined upon completion of final designs. The client has
  developed and disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework and will prepare Resettlement Plans
  for Bank review and clearance as well as compensate affected parties prior to sub-project
  financing.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
  in the project area:
  The project neither stimulates negative indirect impacts nor induces future activities in the project
  areas. Benefits and positive impacts will accrue from the improved resiliency of infrastructure and
  the increased capacity of GoSVG in managing environmental aspects.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
  impacts.
  The project has already included alternative evaluation in the terms of reference for coastal
  defense studies, as part of the engineering and design efforts, to avoid or minimize potential
  adverse impacts.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
  assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  The Central Planning Division (CPD) will manage the supervision of environmental compliance,


                                              Page 7 of 10
  while receiving technical support from the Minister of Works (MoW). The CPD has staffed a full-
  time Field Supervision Engineer with experience on similar projects (Hurricane Tomas Emergency
  Recovery) and so is familiar with environmental requirements. In addition to Bank requirements,
  CPD will also be responsible for (a) ensuring the proper application of national environmental
  laws, (b) ensuring environmental compliance in accordance with procedures detailed in the
  project's Operations Manual and (c) reflecting such requirements in associated works contracts.

  Technical staff of participating Ministries will assist with contract supervision. The Ministry of
  Works has staffed a new Chief Engineer with abundant experience to help guide the execution of
  the project, ensure that environmental protection measures are implemented by contractors, and
  otherwise provide support to CPD.

  A World Bank Environmental Specialist will further provide additional technical support by
  periodic field supervision. Environmental Assessments TORs will be forwarded to the Bank for
  review. EIAs produced will be forwarded to the Bank for review prior to the development of
  specific works contracts. All works contracts requiring an EIA will be subject to prior review and
  supervision missions will review project activities with respect to environmental compliance.

  The CPD will further receive technical assistance for environmental supervision from relevant line
  guidelines for emergency investments and works including for the preparation of any safeguards
  studies prior to works as pertinent under OP 10.00.

  The Central Planning Division (CPD) will manage the supervision of Social Safeguards
  Compliance – specifically compliance with OP/BP 4.12 – Involuntary Resettlement. The CPD has
  staffed a Social Safeguards Specialist and will continue to retain a specialist for the duration of the
  project. CPD’s recent experience with land acquisition under similar projects (Hurricane Tomas
  Emergency Recovery Project-P124939) has increased its capacity to handle small scale land
  acquisition.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
  on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
  The existing EMF, RPF and Social Assessment have been updated and disclosed in-country. In
  addition, the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines grievance redress mechanisms were
  documented and analyzed during the preparation of the updated RPF and Social Assessment and
  sent to the Bank for information purposes. The EMF, RPF and Social Assessment provides for
  future public comment as needed.

  The majority of works contemplated involve the repair and retrofitting of existing infrastructure.
  In these cases, impacts to stakeholders will relate to temporary inconveniences associated with
  construction activities and will be managed to minimize impacts to the greatest extent possible.
  Advanced public notifications will inform potentially affected persons. Relevant line ministries
  will assist MoTW and the CPD in these efforts.

  When sub-project-specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) or Environmental Impact
  Assessments (EIAs) are required, specific stakeholders will be identified and public meetings will
  be conducted to enable the reflection of stakeholder concerns in project design. These
  requirements are outlined in the project Operations Manual and will be incorporated into the
  design phase of relevant sub-projects.
