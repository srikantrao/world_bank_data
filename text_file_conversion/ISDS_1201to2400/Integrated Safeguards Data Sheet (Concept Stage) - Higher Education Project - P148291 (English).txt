                           To strengthen the higher education system through policy, program, and governance reforms that (i)
                         provide more equitable access and retention, (ii) enhance internal and external quality assurance
                         capacity, and (iii) enhance relevance of academic programs to better reflect labor market demand.

                         education; (ii) improving higher education governance; (iii) establishing quality assurance
                         mechanisms; and (iv) project management and monitoring and evaluation.

                         This component supports various access, equity, quality and relevance enhancement activities at
                         central and institutional levels. For activities at institutional level, this component (and only this
                         component) may support minor civil works on campus.

                         vertical (i.e., enrollment, completion, etc.) and horizontal (i.e., program choice) equity.

                         This component would finance a pilot program to strengthen the programs and projects aimed
                         ensuring under-represented students have access to the resources (financial support, university-

                         them succeed in higher education. Activities to be supported include:

                         -       Designing and piloting effective student aid instruments to assist with both living and tuition

                         1 Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the InfoShop and (ii) in country, at publicly accessible locations and in a
                          form and language that are accessible to potentially affected persons.
                             The specific activities will be identified during the implementation on a proposal basis. Hence, the
                             team will request the government to prepare a generic Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
                             for rehabilitations that will be used for all sites prior to the appraisal.
