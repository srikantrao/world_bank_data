                           The development objective is to support the strengthening of Myanmar’s PFM systems and
                           institutions, and improving PFM policy formulation and implementation for effective, efficient and
                           accountable delivery of public services.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will provide development finance to the Government to implement Phase 1 of
                           the Government’s PFM Reform Strategy and action plan in close coordination with development

                           partners through the Public Finance Management Sector Working Group. Recognizing that PFM
                           reforms in Myanmar will evolve over time based on experience and changing priorities, there will be
                           need to build in learning and adaptation within project design – which means supporting broader
                           priority areas rather than locking-in all support for the next five year period.

                           The project will finance mostly office equipment, vehicles, training, acquisition of hardware and
                           targeted technical assistance.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           Project interventions will be mostly located at the Ministry of Finance and Revenue and the Ministry
                           of National Planning and Economic Development in Nay Pyi Taw and deconcentrated offices of
                           these ministries. The project does not envisage construction of buildings at the concept stage. There
                           may be renovations of existing office spaces needed. However, mostly the project will finance
                           technical assistance, training, office goods, and related tools and software for improving management
                           of public finances.
