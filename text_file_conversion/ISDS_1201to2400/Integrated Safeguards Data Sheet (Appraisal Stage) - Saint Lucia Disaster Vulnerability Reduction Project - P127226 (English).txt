                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate
                         change impacts in Saint Lucia.
                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The Project comprises the following five components:

                         Component 1 – Risk Reduction and Adaptation Measures (US$51.4 million). This component would
                         support structural and non-structural flood and landslide risk reduction interventions and climate
                         adaptation measures to improve Saint Lucia’s resilience against current and future climatic shocks.
                         Additionally, the component would finance the reconstruction of critical infrastructure damaged
                         during the December 2013 flooding, using the ‘build back better’ approach. Activities under this
                         component will also account for other potential risks (e.g. seismic) to ensure financed works are
                         generally disaster resilient. Sub-projects include the following: (i) reinforcement of flood control
                         infrastructure, including at the international airport; (ii) climate resilient rehabilitation of road
                         sections along the national highway through drainage improvements, slope stabilization works and
                         retrofit of select bridges; (iii) retrofits and climate resilient rehabilitation of priority emergency
                         shelters; (iv) climate-resilient rehabilitation of deteriorating water supply infrastructure; and (v)
                         retrofit and rehabilitation of existing schools and health centers. Additionally, relevant national plans,
                         policies and strategies to support risk reduction and climate resilience efforts would be developed,
                         including, inter alia: a national watershed management framework, a rainwater harvesting pilot
                         program, and a climate change public awareness and education strategy.

                         Importantly, technical assistance and capacity building are embedded within sub-activities and
                         include: (i) development of operation and maintenance plans, including a bridge maintenance plan,
                         (ii) risk assessments to support engineering design options and final detailed design solutions, and
                         (iii) integrated hazard and climate analyses to inform project designs.

                         Component 2 – Technical Assistance for Improved Assessment and Application of Disaster and
                         Climate Risk Information in Decision-Making (US$7.6 million). This component would support

                         capacity building for open systems and platforms to create, share, analyze and use disaster risk and
                         climate change data and information for improved decision making and engineering design for risk
                         reduction and climate change adaptation. Specifically, the component would finance, inter alia: (i)
                         the creation of a high resolution digital topographic and bathymetric model for Saint Lucia, (ii) sea
                         level rise modelling and coastal flood and erosion risk mapping; (iii) design and deployment of
                         meteorological, hydrological, and sea level rise monitoring networks to provide high resolution
                         hydrologic data; and (iv) deployment of an environmental health surveillance system.

                         Data collected under this component would be used to inform investments under Component 1 (when
                         suitable) as well as to identify and prioritize future risk reduction and adaptation investments. Data
                         outputs would also inform the development of appropriate land use plans and provide a basis for
                         future flood and landslide risk management schemes.

                         Component 3 – Climate Adaptation Financing Facility (CAFF) (US$5.0 million). This component is
                         designed to pilot a financing mechanism meant to incentivize pre-emptive climate adaptation
                         amongst Saint Lucian households and businesses. Loans would be offered to finance works and
                         activities which build the resilience of assets and livelihoods to adverse hydro-meteorological events.
                         Saint Lucia Development Bank (SLDB) would serve as retail bank and on-lend to final beneficiaries
                         – with a concerted aim of building an affordable and self-sustaining loan portfolio in climate
                         adaptation. Based upon the initial success of the component and local demand for climate adaptation

                                                                       Page 2 of 11
                         loans, consideration will be given to include other commercial banks as participating retail banks.

                         SLDB would receive technical assistance to address identified gaps in its current operation and risk

                         management structure and practices. A standalone OM would be generated for the CAFF, while
                         SLDB would receive systematic support in implementing an institutional development plan to
                         overcome existing gaps, and would monitor progress to this end.

                         Component 4 – Contingent Emergency Response (US$1.0 million). This provisional component
                         would allow rapid re-categorization and reallocation of project financing from other project
                         components to partially cover emergency response and recovery costs associated with a natural
                         catastrophe. The component would only be triggered upon formal declaration of an emergency by
                         GoSL, in accordance with the Saint Lucia Constitution Order 1978, following the occurrence of a
                         disaster. This component could also be used to channel additional disaster response funds should
                         they become available. A specific OM would apply to this component, detailing financial
                         management, procurement, safeguards and any other necessary implementation arrangements.

                         Component 5 – Project Management and Implementation Support (US$3.0 million). This component
                         would finance activities required for efficient project management and implementation through the
                         provision of technical advisory services, staffing, training, operating costs and acquisition of goods.
                         The component would also cover incremental operating costs, including those related to operating
                         the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) under the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, Planning and
                         Social Security (MoF) and the Sustainable Development and Environment Division (SDED) of the
                         Ministry of Public Service, Sustainable Development, Energy, Science and Technology (MoSDEST).
                         Incremental operating costs incurred by implementing agencies would also be covered as well as
                         those required for outside consultancies to prepare and supervise specific activities, technical audits,
                         and M&E.

                         Project works would be carried out throughout Saint Lucia. Works will include, but are not limited
                         to (a) the repair and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, (b) new construction of select public
                         facilities, (c) erosion control works and new construction of river defense structures to protect human
                         settlements and critical infrastructures (including the international airport), and (d) community-based
                         small mitigation works (e.g. slope stabilization, community drainage systems). Certain project
                         activities (including riverbank reconstruction and slope stabilization) would entail relatively minor
                         construction works with some potential environmental impacts. And as Saint Lucia has a number of
                         designated Forest Reserves, the possibility exists that works will occur in such areas, thereby having
                         implications for the Natural Habitat policy.

                         Saint Lucia shares similar disaster vulnerabilities with other OECS countries, which include volcanic
                         eruptions, seismic activity, sea level rise as well as variability in rainfall and storm intensity related
                         to climate change. Like Saint Lucia, the small island developing states of Dominica, Grenada and
                         Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share common hazard profiles for flooding, landslides, storm surge
                         and coastal erosion, which are addressed in the corresponding national disaster vulnerability and
                         climate risk reduction programs. Similar lessons learned are expected to be generated from
                         comparable hydro-meteorological monitoring and watershed management practices, construction
                         techniques as well as contractor logistics, which will be shared and applied across all related projects
                         throughout the four island states. Environmental management practices common to the sub-region

                         will also be evaluated and incorporated into safeguards analysis and instruments in the Saint Lucia
                         project.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01. The borrower prepared a project-level Environmental
                              and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to encompass and evaluate potential environmental
                              impacts of the entire program and to screen future projects for additional assessment needs. For
                              relatively simple subprojects and activities (e.g. building rehabilitation), a standard screening
                              procedure and draft contract clauses for environmental mitigation measures have been developed
                              to serve as part of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and will be applied (as needed) to
                              construction contracts. This simplified environmental management strategy will suffice in the
                              majority of cases, since most works planned under the project are relatively small-scale in nature.
                              Only minor impacts are anticipated during the construction phase of such works and can be

                              mitigated with best management practices as well as standard operating procedures (e.g. building
                              rehabilitation or bridge construction).

                             In addition, the ESMF includes a preliminary assessment of potential environmental impacts of the
                             portfolio of subprojects under the DVRP, and identifies several activities which may require
                             additional assessment. Examples of such activities include WASCO waterline easement works in
                             forest reserve areas, SLASPA works along sensitive coastlines as well as road reconstruction
                             works between Venus and Anse la Raye in sensitive riparian areas or in well-conserved zones.
                             These more complex projects as well as other similar road works (e.g. Savannes Bay) will be
                             further assessed upon availability of detailed designs using the principles, guidelines and
                             procedures described in the EMF for assessing the environmental impacts of future subprojects
                             during project implementation. An EIA has already been prepared for the construction of the new
                             Dennery Polyclinic due to potential issues related to siting and medical waste management.

                             Procedures for (a) screening future subprojects, (b) selecting mitigation measures and (c)
                             conducting additional subproject-specific EIAs (if required due to environmental complexity and/
                             or safeguards triggering) have been defined in the ESMF and respond to the types of projects/
                             subprojects anticipated under Components 1 and 2. Standard procedures for mitigating
                             environmental impacts of construction, monitoring and reporting are also included. The ESMF

                                                                        Page 6 of 11
                         screening and categorization. The ESMF also includes a section with clear safeguards guidelines
                         for emergency investments and works including for the preparation of any safeguards studies prior
                         to commencement of works as pertinent under OP 10.00 (as may be considered under Component

                         Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04. This safeguard has been triggered as a precaution due to potential
                         project activities which may occur in highland forest areas, river valleys, coastlines and / or marine
                         areas. The ESMF accounts for natural habitats when screening both known works and any future
                         activities currently undefined. Works in forest reserve areas may include WASCO waterline
                         replacements for the Louisy and Au Leon intakes, which would involve rehabilitation of
                         abandoned or damaged diversions within the reserves and the placement of waterlines across
                         easements through the reserves. SLASPA activities may involve works in sensitive areas along
                         coastlines which could affect coral reefs or marine environments, and would need to be screened
                         for such effects once they have been defined. In addition, the Venus – Anse la Raye road
                         reconstruction project would affect sensitive and potentially well-preserved riparian areas as well
                         as involve earthwork near watercourses and intake areas. Given that such areas are characterized
                         by highly erodible soils, the potential of landslides is duly accounted for. Evaluations will also be
                         made of proposed road rehabilitation works in other potentially sensitive areas such as the
                         southeast coast near Savannes Bay. Finally, landslide stabilization works will be undertaken
                         within the upper watersheds in forest reserves; while the majority involves simple activities and
                         soft engineering works (e.g. check-dams and native re-vegetation), in the event that more complex
                         activities are undertaken, specific mitigation measures may need to be developed. Screening of
                         future subprojects, as described in the ESMF, would determine if additional assessment and
                         specialized mitigation measures would be required for these projects, once detailed designs are
                         developed during implementation.

                         Forests OP/BP 4.36. Forest resource harvesting is currently unanticipated in any project
                         interventions. Additional research and verification throughout project preparation showed that the
                         policy is not triggered. Proposed activities which include development of integrated watershed
Public Disclosure Copy




                         management plans as well as to stabilization of landslide-prone slopes in designated forest
                         reserves, do not aim to bring about changes in the management, protection, or utilization of
                         forests, nor are there any projects considered for converting forest lands to other uses.

                         Pest Management OP 4.09. Select subproject activities may require the incidental use of
                         pesticides for termite control in buildings, road maintenance activities or emergency activities such
                         as crop recovery, or vector control. The ESMF provides for restricting pesticide use to licensed
                         providers and other measures to ensure that adequate protection measures are included in the
                         generic EMP for contracting documents.

                         Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11. This safeguard is triggered as a precaution as project
                         activities may potentially include retrofits of historical buildings, restoration of culturally
                         significant structures and / or chance finds of historically or culturally significant resources during
                         construction of works involving excavations or land clearances. The ESMF includes (and EMPs
                         will include) a "chance-find" procedure, particularly for activities such as major excavations, road
                         realignments or similar works where such assets could be affected. Site screening exercises will be
                         performed to (a) avoid adversely affecting physical cultural resources such as historical buildings
                         and (b) solicit stakeholder contributions to conceptual designs of projects such as building
                         rehabilitation.

                          Involuntary Resettlement OP/BP 4.12. The Client has developed a Resettlement Policy
                          Framework (RPF) to account for any unanticipated land acquisitions that emerge during project
                          implementation. The RPF has been publicly disclosed in-country and at the Bank’s InfoShop.

                          Additionally, a social assessment has (a) been developed during project preparation, (b) screened
                          all project sites and (c) confirmed that neither land acquisition nor resettlement is anticipated.
                          Should unanticipated land acquisition and/or resettlement be required during implementation,
                          either an abbreviated or full-scale resettlement action plan would be prepared as appropriate and
                          disclosed prior to subproject financing.

                           Past DRM engagements suggest the potential impact a project can have on beneficiary assets or
                           access to assets (e.g. in the case of river bank reinforcement). Resettlement could also result if
                           integrated watershed management plans for flood mitigation projects result in restricted access to
                           protected areas. As no such risks have been found to exist at the time of Appraisal, a Process
                           Framework for Involuntary Resettlement has not been required. Finally, the Project is considering
                           screening criteria to avoid complicated resettlement and/or land acquisition processes for small
                           projects – both to clearly identify cases where lands need to be acquired and establish mechanisms
                           to verify that any land acquisition is carried out through voluntary means.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           At the time of Appraisal, it was determined that project activities will likely not stimulate any
                           indirect or negative long-term future impacts; however, this aspect would continue to be
                           monitored throughout the duration of project implementation.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

                           Environmental Safeguards. The GoSL has prepared a program-level ESMF to provide preliminary
                           assessments of project activities and to guide project execution for screening possible subprojects.
                           For complex projects, triggers have been defined which would requireadditional studies to comply
                           with safeguards policies. For relatively uncomplicated projects, the ESMF has included generic
                           mitigation measures through the development of a generic EMP, which will also be included in the
                           Operations Manual and ideally reflected in future environmental compliance contracting clauses.
                           For complex projects or activities in sensitive areas, the ESMF has defined criteria to trigger
                           additional assessment requirements.

                          While technical staff of participating Ministries would assist with contract supervision, the PCU
                          will be the final responsible agency for environmental management. In addition to Bank
                          requirements, the PCU would also be responsible for (a) ensuring the proper application of
                          national environmental laws; (b) ensuring environmental compliance in accordance with
                          procedures detailed in the project's Operations Manual; and (c) reflecting such requirements in
                          associated works contracts. A World Bank Environmental Specialist would further provide
                          additional technical support during project implementation.

                          The Sustainable Development and Environment Department (SDED) within the Ministry of Public
                          Service, Sustainable Development, Energy, Science, and Technology provides national
                          supervision of environmental compliance, while receiving technical support from the relevant


                                                                     Page 8 of 11
                           Ministries and Agencies on an as-needed basis. The PCU will manage and supervise a local
                           environmental consultant hired as-needed during project implementation to support the
                           compliance and collaboration with the SDED and other line Ministries and Agencies. Periodic

                           supervision by a World Bank Environmental Specialist would be conducted to provide additional
                           support. Component 5 of the Project would also serve to enhance the institutional capacity of
                           SDED through safeguards training to implement the provisions of the Operations Manual.

                           Social Safeguards. The PCU has direct, recent and relevant experience with OP/BP 4.12 from the
                           recently closed DMP II project and the ongoing Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project –
                           both of which triggered this safeguard. The PCU is therefore familiar with OP/BP 4.12 and
                           related instruments. Nevertheless since there would be multiple sub-projects involving civil works
                           and potential land acquisition, it has been agreed that a part-time social development specialist
                           would be hired to oversee the implementation of the RPF and development of RAPs, as needed.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           A process of stakeholder identification and consultation is built into the project-level Social
                           Assessment. The SA takes a gender perspective and considers the perspectives of both female and
                           male beneficiaries under this project. The findings of the SA and the views garnered during these
                           consultations have been reflected (when relevant and possible) in project design.

                           The majority of works contemplated involve the repair and retrofit of existing infrastructure. In
                           these cases, impacts to stakeholders would relate to temporary inconveniences associated with
                           construction activities and would be managed to minimize impacts to the greatest extent possible.
                           Advanced public notifications would inform potentially affected persons. Relevant line ministries
                           would assist SDED and the PCU in these efforts.

                           In addition, consultation with stakeholders on the disposition of potential physical cultural
                           resources would be sought as contributions to project conceptual design, in the case of antiquated
Public Disclosure Copy




                           or historically valuable structures, possibly meriting preservation activities for reconstruction or
                           rehabilitation activities of schools, clinics, and similar projects.

                           When subproject-specific EIAs are required, specific stakeholders will be identified and public
                           meetings will be conducted to enable the reflection of stakeholder concerns in project design.
                           These requirements have been incorporated into the TORs for EIAs. Projects identified as
                           potentially requiring EIAs include those which demonstrate environmentally complex aspects or
                           which may directly or indirectly affect natural habitats, sensitive areas, or physical cultural
                           resources. Examples of such projects may include SLASPA activities, activities within designated
                           forest reserves such as slope stabilization measures or water diversion infrastructure. Once specific
                           interventions are identified, specific EIAs may be required and will require full engagement of the
                           affected communities through meetings and public consultations. Community comments and
                           concerns would be integrated into the project design, while plans for public engagement during the
                           construction phase of subprojects would be provided as part of the assessment process. A record
                           of public meetings and community engagement activities would be required as part of the
                           assessment and implementation program.
