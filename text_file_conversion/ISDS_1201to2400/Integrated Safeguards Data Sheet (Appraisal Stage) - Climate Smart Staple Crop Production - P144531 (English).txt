                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The environmental and social impacts of the proposed project are overall positive as the project
                              will promote climate smart and sustainable crop production techniques and practices. Positive
                              environmental benefits include reduced emission of greenhouse gases, reduced uses and releases
                              of agricultural chemicals into the environment, and improved soil organic matters. In addition to
                              these environmental benefits, successful implementation of CSA demonstrations is expected to
                              generate positive social economic and health benefits to project farmers as these activities will
                              improve crop productivity, reduce the use and release of pesticides and fertilizers, and promote
                              professional crop production and pest management services.

                             Project preparation confirms that (a) there are no sensitive locations and social and environmental

                             issues; and (b) CSA demonstration activities under Component 1 trigger OP4.01 (Environmental
                             Assessment), OP4.09 (Pest Management), and OP4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement).

                             OP4.01 is triggered as some negative and short-term construction impacts may result from
                             rehabilitation and construction of small-scale on-farm infrastructure (such as farm roads and
                             irrigation channels) financed by counterpart fund. The potential impacts (e.g. noise, air,
                             wastewater, solid wastes etc.) will be short-term, temporary, limited and local in nature, and can
                             be readily managed with cost effective mitigations measures.

                             OP4.09 is triggered as the project will promote IPM practices as part of CSA demonstrations and
                             will support the review and development of technical codes and standards related to applications
                             of agricultural inputs (including pesticides). Implementation of the project promoted IPM practices
                             will generate positive environmental and health impacts as such efforts will reduce the use of
                             pesticides.

                              OP4.12 is triggered as the small scale on-farm infrastructure construction may require limited land
                              acquisition.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              It is anticipated that successful implementation of this project will cause that climate smart and


                                                                        Page 3 of 7
                           sustainable crop production techniques demonstrated under the project will continue in the project
                           area after project completion. Demonstrated positive social, economic and environmental benefits
                           of these techniques will promote wider adoption and replication of these CSA techniques beyond

                           the project area and thus promote sustainability of staple crop production in these areas.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Not applicable.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           Environment Assessment (OP4.01). The client has engaged the Environmental Assessment Center
                           of China Agricultural University to prepare the ECOPs for the project in accordance with the
                           Bankâ€™s requirements. A set of ECOPs were prepared for existing farm road improvements, and
                           rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, leveling of crop lands, installation of power
                           lines and pumping stations, and tree planting around farm lands. The ECOPs will be included into
                           the bidding documents and civil work contracts. ECOPs are prepared based on national norms,
                           proven practices in other Bank financed projects and practices recommended in Environmental
                           Health and Safety
                           Guidelines of World Bank Group. They specify all aspects of environmental management issues
                           during the entire project cycle, including but not limited to, site preparation, construction dust
                           management, air pollution control, noise impact control, water pollution control, solid waste
                           management, public and workersâ€™ health and safety, as well as public consultations on the
                           environmental issues. It also includes the reporting and supervision arrangements for the project
                           implementation. With proper implementation of the proposed mitigation measures, the potential
                           adverse impacts will be avoided, eliminated entirely, minimize or mitigated to an acceptable level.

                           Pest Management (OP4.09). The project will promote IPM practices at the project site and will
                           support the review and development of technical codes and standards related to applications of
                           agricultural inputs (including pesticides) for climate smart staple crop production. A PMP has

                           been prepared for the production of rice, wheat and corn in the two project counties. It includes
                           major pest issues, pesticide management methods, monitoring and evaluation activities, and
                           capacity building for project stakeholders. It incorporates the existing good pest management
                           practices from the project areas, outlines IPM based pest control and management methods, and
                           recommends various application approaches under different conditions such as promoting IPM to
                           reduce the use of toxic pesticides (e.g. improvement of pest forecasting, use of bait lamps, crops

                           was prepared by a team from China Agriculture University, covering detailed procedures on
                           preparation, review and approval of potential land acquisition activities, institutional and financial
                           arrangements, and a monitoring plan for resettlement implementation.

                           safeguards) will be provided under project implementation to improve the PMO's capacity to

                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Extensive public consultation was performed during the SA, RPF preparation and ECOP
                           preparation processes. During the preparation of ECOPs, consultation, meetings and interviews
                           were arranged with the project's key stakeholders of different genders, socioeconomic and
                           educational backgrounds, social groups, and occupations. In total, about 404 people were
                           consulted in the ECOPs Preparation process. Similarly, during the preparation of SA and RPF,
                           expert consultations, questionnaire survey, meetings and interviews were conducted with the
                           project's stakeholders of different gender, socioeconomic and educational backgrounds, social
                           groups, and occupations. In total, 280 households were surveyed in the process. During these
                           consultations, the project information was disclosed at project villages and government websites.

                           The majority of consulted stakeholders have expressed their strong support to the project. The
                           ECOPs/SA/RPF have incorporated countermeasures to address the concerns of consulted
                           stakeholders. Such countermeasures (for example, support to farmer field schools to align project
                           training to the farmers' actual needs, support cropland leveling and transformers to improve
                           irrigation efficiency) have been fully incorporated into the project design.

                           In accordance with the Bankâ€™s information disclosure policy, on April 24, 2014 the ECOPs and
                           PMP were made available in the project areas and on the websites of the local government
                           agencies, and are accessible at PMO and PMUs. The ECOPs, PMP, SA and RPF were disclosed at
                           the World Bank InfoShop on May 8, 2014.
