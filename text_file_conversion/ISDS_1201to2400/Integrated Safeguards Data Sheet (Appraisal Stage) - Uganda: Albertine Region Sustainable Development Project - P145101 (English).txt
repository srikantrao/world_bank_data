                         3. Project Description
                         The Government of Uganda has requested World Bank support to prepare for and facilitate a more
                         orderly, sustainable and inclusive transformation of the Albertine Region which is anticipating rapid
Public Disclosure Copy




                         growth and development related to planned oil sector developments. Of particular concern to the
                         Government is ensuring the development of: (i) regional transport infrastructure that will improve
                         connectivity and access within and to the Albertine Region and facilitate an economy centered not
                         only on oil, but also agriculture, fishing and tourism; (ii) local area development for orderly and
                         planned growth and improvements in the infrastructure and services of rapidly urbanizing centers in
                         the region and improved access for rural communities; and (iii) a more skilled workforce that could
                         respond to the demands and leverage the employment opportunities that are emerging in the region.

                         Therefore, the Project is envisaged to have three components: (i) Regional Access and Connectivity;
                         (ii) Local Access and Development ; (iii) Skills Access and Upgrading.

                         Component 1 - Regional Access and Connectivity ($95Million)

                         This component will finance the upgrading of an approximately 100 km stretch of road from
                         Kyenjojo to Kabwoya which forms part of the 238 kilometer Kyenjojo-Hoima-Masindi–Kigumba
                         road connecting the Districts of Kyenjojo, Kibaale, Hoima, Masindi and Kiyrandongo in Western
                         Uganda The work will entail upgrading of the existing unpaved gravel road to a paved Class II
                         (bitumen or asphalt) standard road. The component will also finance the costs associated with
                         construction supervision and individual consultant’s costs to support the Uganda National Roads
                         Authority in the oversight of the component. The remaining stretch from Kabwoya to Kigumba is
                         being financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) under the Road Sector Support Project 4.
                         The two projects are well-timed and there will be close coordination on implementation to ensure
                         consistency

                         The Kenyjojo-Hoima-Masindi-Kigumba corridor forms the backbone of the Albertine Region. There
Public Disclosure Copy




                         are a number of rural towns and trading centers with considerable populations living along the road
                         which is the main road connecting the urban centers of Kyenjojo, Hoima and Masindi. There are
                         also important tourist destinations in the region. The road is also a strategic corridor in western
                         Uganda, connecting international transport routes between countries to the south east of Uganda such
                         as Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, to countries in the northeast such as
                         Sudan. In addition, 43% of oil products from the proposed refinery in the region will be transported
                         along the road. It is therefore strategically important for opening access to the region, its major
                         economic and social centers and for the long-term development of the region and its key economic
                         sectors.

                         Component 2 – Local Access, Planning and Development ($25 Million)

                         This component will finance town planning and infrastructure development in three key centers in
                         the Albertine region: (i) Hoima District Council, (ii) Buliisa District Council, and (iii) Buliisa Town
                         Council. Infrastructure investments will be focused, for greater impact, on rural District roads and
                         some urban roads. Economic infrastructure will support markets, fish landing sites, storage facilities
                         and slaughterhouses to benefit the majority farming and fishing communities. Town planning will
                         focus on towns that are expected to benefit from improved infrastructure from oil development and
                         from proximity to the planned refinery. Also financed under this component will be consultant
                         services to support implementation, engineering design and supervision and technical assistance. The


                                                                      Page 2 of 11
                         component will also include the financing of a regional strategic development plan that could form
                         the basis of a follow-on operation for the region.

                         This component will focus on three local areas - Hoima District, Buliisa District and Buliisa Town
                         Council. These three areas were chosen because of the immediate oil development and population
                         influx pressures on these communities. The preliminary choice of infrastructure sub-projects were
                         selected from existing plans and identified through numerous consultations with both the local and
                         central governments. By and large, the sub-projects identified align fairly well with the Five-Year
                         Development Plans of the selected local governments. The limited geographic focus and the limited
                         investment menu was chosen to maximize impact and the heavy focus on District roads is to benefit
                         the majority rural population by ensuring that they have better access to infrastructure, markets and
                         services. Locations to benefit from planning assistance were chosen based on their potential role in
                         contributing to the future development of the region the on-going regional physical plan that wi ll
                         be completed in 2014 will be a foundation for more detailed plans.

                         Component 3 – Skills Access and Upgrading ($25 Million)

                         This component will finance technical assistance, studies, training, and equipment to support
                         establishment of the Oil and Gas committee under the Reform Task Force. It will also finance
                         upgrading of the Uganda Petroleum Institute and the Kichwamba Technical College including
                         physical infrastructure, goods, curricula development and instructor training. The financing of
                         bursaries for people living in the Albertine Region to attend technical training institutes will also be
                         included

                         Component 3 comprises two sub-components. The first sub-component will focus on establishing
                         mechanisms for the coordination of skills development for the Albertine Region, with a focus on
                         sectors of potential growth arising from the oil production. The sub-component will finance the
                         establishment of an oil and gas (O&G) committee under the Reform Task Force (RTF) comprised of
                         stakeholders including relevant government ministries, industry, trainers, and professional bodies

                         from the private sector. The purpose of the RTF O&G committee is to:

                         �      Provide a platform for the engagement of the public and private sectors to jointly support the
                         development of skills training in the Region;
                         �      Determine, through appropriate studies, the skills requirements for the Region over the short,
                         medium and long-term;
                         �      Define the national occupational standards, to describe the skills and knowledge needed to
                         perform competently in an occupation.

                         The Project will finance technical assistance, studies, training, and equipment for the RTF O&G
                         committees. Salaries of staff will be financed by the Government of Uganda.

                         The sub-component will also support improvements in the quality and relevance of at least two
                         institutions in the Albertine Region. It will finance civil works, equipment and associated facilities
                         for the upgrading of the Uganda Institute for Petroleum in Kigumba (UPIK) and the Uganda
                         Technical College in Kichwamba (UTC); and it will also finance the costs associated with improving
                         curriculum, testing and trainer competencies to internationally accredited levels to ensure that
                         training standards improve to those required by private sector employers. Training of specialized
                         technicians for the petroleum industry at UPIK (petroleum operations, mechanical maintenance,
                         electrical maintenance, and instrumentation) for the emerging petroleum industry will also be

                                                                       Page 3 of 11
                         supported. And training of artisans and craftsmen at UTC-Kichwamba will focus on construction
                         (carpentry and joinery, bricklaying, plumbing, electrical installation, scaffolding, welding and
                         fabrication) which will be critical during the development phase of the oil and gas sector. Even after
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the development phase, it is envisioned that there will still begrowing demand for construction
                         workers as the Government uses oil revenue to accelerate growth by investing in the expansion of
                         infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads etc. The institutes, which were selected to provide a
                         regional benefit, will be upgraded to a higher standard to better prepare graduates to participate in
                         emerging employment opportunities. An assessment of BTVET training needs in the Albertine
                         region will round out this sub-component.

                         The second sub-component will focus on improving access to relevant skills training programs
                         through the provision of bursaries to learners from the Region. While the institutions targeted in the
                         second sub-component will require two to three years of management, technical and administrative
                         reforms to yield results with respect to developing quality and demand-responsive skills for the labor
                         market, this sub-component seeks to address the short-term skills needs of the Region during the
                         development phase of the oil production. These are portable skills that can be used in other sectors
                         throughout the country. The component will finance bursaries for learners from the Region to
                         undergo skills training in the foremost institutes in the country on construction, agriculture and
                         tourism. Females will be given preference for the bursaries since they only constitute about 25
                         percent of enrollment within public BTVET institutes currently. In Kichwamba females constitute
                         only 10 percent of enrollments.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented in the Albertine rift valley region of western Uganda, an area of
                         high biodiversity. The road (Component 1) to be upgraded from gravel to bitumen standard is 238
                         Km with gravel carriage way located in Western Uganda, running through Districts of Kyenjojo,
                         Kibaale, Hoima, Masindi and ending up at Kigumba Town Council in the newly created
                         Kiryandongo District connecting to Gulu highway. The World Bank project will finance

                         approximately the first 100 km of of the Kyenjojo-Hoima (Kabwoya) section. The African
                         Development Bank is financing the remaining 138 km. The Kyenjojo - Hoima stretch lies in hilly
                         and rolling terrain with degraded forests in Kibaale district and parts of Hoima district. There are 2
                         bridges along this link. The proposed construction, upgrading and rehabilitation of Kyenjojo –
                         Hoima – Masindi – Kigumba road will be restricted to the existing road alignment except in a few
                         places where there are socio-cultural sites to preserve.

                         The Preparing and Planning for Urban Growth Component (Component 2) is anticipated to be
                         implemented in the urban areas of Hoima and Bulisa Districts. Works are anticipated to be those with
                         localized negative environmental impacts associated with civil works such as drainage, markets,
                         upgrading of urban roads and other urban infrastructure. The Skills Development will also be
                         implemented in the Lake Albert region. Construction works would be limited to the rehabilitation
                         and upgrading of existing facilities and would have limited environmental impact.

                         It is anticipated that oil production activities and improved access to the Albertine region will
                         promote economic and industrial developments, with attendant environmental and social impacts
                         which may range from pollution of Lake Albert, ecological degradation and loss of biodiversity, loss

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The project has been assigned Environmental Assessment Category B since it involves sub-
                              projects with readily predictable environmental and social impacts. The sub-projects include
                              upgrading of an approximately 100 km of an existing stretch of road from Kyenjojo to Kabwoya
                              forming part of the 238 kilometer Kyenjojo-Hoima-Masindi–Kigumba road and upgrading of 2-3
                              vocational/technical institutions in the Albertine region with readily predictable environmental and
                              social impacts. In addition, the project will also finance planning and infrastructure development
                              of 2-3 town councils and/or local governments. While the planning may not have immediate
                              environmental and social impacts, it will identify issues that will be addressed in future urban
                              development of the towns and local governments involved. Some 5700 people will be affected by
                              the project. The majority of project-affected people (PAPs) will only lose a small section of land
Public Disclosure Copy




                              that abuts the road reserve. In some cases, this will also result in the loss of permanent or
                              temporary structures, or crops. If they have room on their remaining land holding, PAPs are likely
                              chose to construct new structures or plant crops on their adjacent land, rather than moving to a
                              new village. As such, current social ties and access to infrastructure or services such as water
                              sources, schools, shops, transport services and places of worship will be maintained.

                             The potential safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project include:
                             adjustment of road alignment in some sections resulting in entailing relocation of water and power
                             mains; sourcing of road construction materials which may result in loss of vegetation cover,
                             excessive noise, vibrations and dust from blasting/crushing of rocks, including risks of flying
                             rocks; haulage of earth construction material may pause accident risk to road users and
                             communities, construction dusting contaminating goods in road side markets and nose at sensitive
                             receptors (schools and health centres); establishment and operation of equipment yard and
                             workers’ camps; demolition of structures within the reserve of proposed road; traffic diversion
                             may cause temporary delays in transportation of goods and passengers/cause traffic congestion/
                             accidents; limited change in drainage patterns as a result of widening the road embankment and
                             construction of bridges along the road stretch especially at key rivers – namely: Muzizi and Nkusi
                             increasing sediment load which may temporarily impair water and drainage. Other impacts include
                             amongst others: safety of workers and the public during construction works, soil and water
                             contamination due to potential spillage and leakage of oils and other toxic materials including


                                                                        Page 7 of 11

                           sites of the technical/vocational institutions. There are no significant potential large scale,
                           significant and/or irreversible environmental and social impacts that may be associated with the
                           project.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           N/A
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           None
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The ESIA and the RAP were prepared and updated for component 1 –Regional Access and
                           Connectivity, involving upgrading of an approximately 100 km of an existing stretch of road from
                           Kyenjojo to Kabwoya. The ESIA and RAP provide the process and guidance for assessing the
                           potential environmental and social including resettlement impacts including compenstation for the
                           Road component of ARDSP. In addition, an Environmental and Social Management Framework
                           (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared for component 2 - Local
                           Access, Planning and Development and Component 3 - Skills Access and Upgrading respectively;
                           establishing clear mechanisms for environmental and social screening, conduct of Environmental
                           and Social Impact Assessment where necessary, development of Environmental and Social
                           Management Plans (ESMPs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), guidance for managing,
                           monitoring and reporting the implementation of environmental and social, including resettlement
                           impacts. The ESMF has also provided the following: i) Chance Finds Procedure to be used in

                           managing any PCRs that may be encountered during project implementation; ii) included
                           procedures to identify and address potential impacts on natural habitats; and iii) included
                           guidelines for preparation of ESMPs which will include measures to address impacts on forests. In
                           addition, the ESIA, RAP, ESMF and RPF have established a Grievance Redress Mechanism
                           which shall be used to handle complaints that may arise during project implementation. The ESIA,
                           RAP, ESMF and RPF prepared shall were disclosed in country and at World Bank’s infoshop
                           before appraisal completion.

                          The project will be implemented by three government agencies UNRA, MoES and MoLHUD. All
                          the three agencies have undertaken preparation of relevant safeguard instruments and have
                          experience of undertaking World Bank supported projects (including implementing the safeguards
                          requirements) and therefore will not have great challenges in implementing the safeguard
                          requirements under ARSDP. UNRA has a fully-fledged safeguard unit that has environment and
                          social safeguard staff, although it may be overwhelmed by the numerous projects implemented
                          within its jurisdiction. MoES and MoLHUD have designated staff to work on social safeguard
                          issues with this project. ARSDP project in MoLHUD will be coordinated with by an Environment
                          and Social development staff funded by another Bank projects. MoES and MoLHUD have also
                          trained a reasonable number of staff in Management of Land acquisition, rehabilitation and
                          resettlement to support the implementation of land acquisition and compensation issues. The
                          Ministries of Local Government and Education and Sports are recommended to either recruit

                           responsible for approval of environment and social assessments including undertaking follow-up
                           on compliance monitoring of projects in accordance to their mandate. In addition, there is
                           established a National Multi-sectoral Environmental Monitoring Committee that undertakes
                           quarterly monitoring of oil and gas activities in the Albertine region.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The preparation of the ESIA, RAP, ESMF and RPF involved consultations with key stakeholders
                           such as National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Ministry of Works and Transport,
                           Ministry of Lands Housing and Urban Development, National Water and Sewerage Corporation
                           (NWSC), Electricity Distribution Company – UMEME, Ministry of Water and Environment,
                           Local Governments (both technical and political teams) and communities of Masindi, Bulisa,
                           Hoima, Kyenjojo as well as technical staff and communities neighboring Uganda Institute for
                           Petroleum in Kigumba (UPIK) and the Uganda Technical College in Kichwamba (UTC). The
                           consultation was done at various times during the preparation and upgrading of RAP/ ESIA as
                           well as during the preparation the ESMF and RPF which included institutional and community
                           field visits and discussions as well as joint met consultative meetings. The safeguard documents,
                           namely the ESIA, RAP, ESMF, RPF were disclosed both in-country in the one or two local daily
                           newspapers, website for the three implementing agencies and MoFPED and at the WB’s infoshop.
