II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
As expected, the original project did not have any major, large scale, significant or
irreversible environmental and social impacts. The two potential safeguards issues
identified under the original project include: the unsafe disposal of used lead acid
batteries from solar PV and the potential of low voltage lines from pico hydro crossing
private lands and properties. The disposal of used batteries was an issue in the original
project and remains an issue in the restructured project especially since the original
proposal in the ESSF to incorporate an element dedicated to the purchase of the first
replacement battery proves to be difficult and cumbersome for PFIs to enforce and
administer.

 The crossing and impact of distribution lines from the pico hydro did not materialize as
there was no pico hydro proposal in the original project. This however, cannot be ruled
out for the restructured project. In addition to pico hydro activities, and community
based biofuel (coconut oil) generators could potentially affect other land owners if low
voltage distribution lines are needed from the point of power generation to point of
consumption. The generators financed will be small, portable generators. Pico hydro is a
run of river scheme with a pipe diverting water into a small turbine. Both will normally
use 240V distribution lines. It is possible that some small business may use 415V lines.
The wires are strung over small posts or put underground.

 Pico hydros requiring distribution lines traversing third party properties will be required
to obtain permission from the land owner(s). Biofuel generators will generally be for
villages supplying a number of people living close together in a community arrangement
on community land. The village chief or headman (or a community group) would
coordinate such installation and procure necessary permission should the distribution line
have to traverse third party properties.

  The impacts on IPs are deemed positive as they receive equal and culturally appropriate
benefits from project activities, which are demand driven and based on individual
households or small community groups' own desire to borrow money for sustainable
energy investments. There are no adverse impacts on local communities or households
from project activities as all physical investments take place on the land of individual
households and MSEs (except for the potential support to pico hydro and coconut oil
activities that may require a low voltage distribution line to cut across third party
properties – these are only supported if third party land owners/users consent to such
arrangements).

 Under the restructured project, the identified environment and social safeguard issues of
the original project remain valid and relevant. In addition to OP 4.01 and OP 4.10, OP
4.12 is also triggered for the restructured project.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Long term impacts will be positive with the switching to sustainable energy sources from
non-RE fuels such as kerosene, petrol and diesel.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The original project developed an Environment and Social Safeguards Framework
(ESSF) to screen and address environment and social safeguard issues of different
sustainable energy investments financed by the PFIs.

  For the restructuring, the ESSF has been updated to reflect changes on safeguards
arrangements based on the lessons learned and experience from implementing the
original project. Among the changes made is the disposal and management of used lead
acid batteries from solar PV by requiring suppliers of batteries to collect back used
batteries and to properly dispose them in compliance with the 2007 Fiji Environment
Management – Part on Waste Disposal and Recycling. A due diligence of the
implementation of this regulation indicates that this is working and can be adopted and
relied upon in the context of the restructured project. The Department of Environment has
a Waste Management and Pollution Control Unit which is responsible for waste and
pollution control in Fiji. The Department normally issues the permit for 3 years to battery
supplier companies who, in turn, have to send to the Department their filled Batteries
Handling Return forms every 6 months. The Department of Environment's officers
normally do random checks on the compliance of companies. The World Bank, as part of
its supervision of the project, will conduct random checks of the project's compliance to
battery disposal and management consistent with the national regulations.

 Second change to the ESSF is to include coconut oil facilities, in addition to pico hydro,
as those subprojects that may potentially affect/traverse private lands/properties related to
the low voltage distribution lines.

 The implementation of the ESSF by the Implementing Agency and the PFIs and
compliance by sub-borrowers will be supervised by the Bank during implementation. In
particular, safeguard supervision will focus on how well the buy back and disposal of
used batteries have been complied with and whether consent has been secured from
private land owners before financing is approved for the sub-borrowers.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The EAs, PM and PFI are the key stakeholders. The PM will prepare safeguards
information in a brochure which will be part of the information package provided to
potential beneficiaries. The information will also be distributed to Green Peace and other
civil society organizations in Fiji. The revised ESSF will also be disclosed in Fiji.
