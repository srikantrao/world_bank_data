                           The proposed project development objective is to improve the protection of the coastal population to
                           cyclone and extreme weather events through improving access to effective multi-purpose shelters in
                           fourteen coastal districts
                           C. Project Description
                         Component A: Reconstruction and Improvement of Multipurpose Shelters (US$352 million).

                         Bangladesh has considerable experience with cyclone shelters since massive construction started
Public Disclosure Copy




                         after the 1970 cyclone. Lessons learned and continuous upgrading of the designs has led to a
                         typology of shelters today that feature resilience to high wind speeds, safe haven for animals and
                         livestock, water supply systems, separate sanitation facilities, and safe haven from storm surges. In
                         addition, the shelters serve as community centers or primary schools during the year, providing wider
                         community benefit to the coastal population.

                         Subcomponent A1: Construction of new shelters (US$220 million). This component will finance the
                         construction of 550 new shelters. The construction of shelters will be carried out by LGED as
                         multipurpose buildings for primary schools, community centers or other community buildings, in full
                         coordination with local government, local communities and education departments. Lessons learned
                         from ECRRP demonstrated that the construction of new shelters increased access for coastal
                         communities to essential protection from cyclones, and also provided local communities with
                         necessary community amenities, such as schools or community centers through the multi-purpose
                         uses of the buildings. Shelter designs were updated under ECRRP to include separate toilet facilities
                         for men and women, and to include a safe space for livestock.

                         Subcomponent A2: Rehabilitation of existing shelters (US$40.5 million). This subcomponent will
                         finance repairs and improvement to existing shelters that are damaged or cannot be used as shelters
                         due to inadequacies. These shelters will be rehabilitated to bring these back into use, and to update
                         and modernize the facilities.

                         Subcomponent A3: Improvement of communication network to shelters (US$71.5 million). This
                         component will support reconstruction of around 550 kilometers of rural road networks as well as
                         communication networks to the shelters constructed under the project to make them more accessible.

                         Subcomponent A4: Social and Environment Management (US$8 million). As part of the designs of
                         the construction activities, social assessments (SA) and environmental impact screenings (EIS) will
                         be required. This component will finance costs associated with the preparation of Social
                         Management Plans (SMP), Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) and Environmental Management Plans
                         (EMP). While it is expected that land acquisition will be minimal under the project, this component
                         will also finance any costs associated with land acquisition and resettlement. An Environment and
                         Social Management Framework is currently being prepared. All site specific SMP/RAP and EMP
                         will be reviewed by the Monitoring and Evaluation consultants (component B3) and cleared by the
                         Bank.

                         Subcomponent A5: Design and construction supervision of shelters (US$12 million). This
                         component will finance the costs associated with consulting services for surveys, designs and
                         construction supervision of multipurpose disaster shelters and all works covered under
                         subcomponents A1 to A3. This would include facilitating consultations with the local communities in
                         identifying sites, needs and suitable design of the shelter as well as coordination with other
                         government agencies and stakeholders, such as the Ministry of Education, local governments, and
                         upazilla and union level governments.

                         Component B: Project Management, Monitoring and Technical Assistance and Training (US$18
                         million)
                         This component will support the Government in implementing the project, and in coordinating all
                         project related activities, monitoring, technical assistance and training. It will include: (B1)

                         establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Local Government Engineering
                         Department; (B2) support for the operation of the Project Monitoring and Coordination (PCMU)
                         within the Ministry of Planning (US$3 million); (B3) monitoring and evaluation; and (B4) technical
                         assistance and training in such areas as disaster management and preparedness, construction, contract
                         management, financial management, preparation of environmental impact screenings and social
                         assessments, and preparation of EMPs and RAPS (US$4 million). The monitoring and evaluation
                         (M&E) activities would provide continuous feedback to the Government, the Bank, and
                         implementing agencies on the projectâ€™s performance and impact of its various components, so that
                         corrective actions could be undertaken in a timely manner. They will also supervise implementation
                         of the overall EMF and SMF, careful review and monitoring of sub-project specific social and
                         environmental management plans and impact screenings, and supervision of their implementation.

                         Component C - Contingent Emergency Response (US$0 million)

                         In the case of a major natural disaster, the Government may request the Bank to re-allocate project
                         funds to this component (which presently carries a zero allocation) to support response and
                         reconstruction Disbursements under an Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) will be
                         contingent upon the fulfillment of the following conditions: (i) the Government of Bangladesh has
                         determined that an eligible crisis or emergency has occurred and the Bank has agreed and notified the
                         Government; (ii) the Ministry of Finance has prepared and adopted the Contingent Emergency 30
                         Such a reallocation would not constitute a formal Project Restructuring. Response (CER)
                         Implementation Plan that is agreed with the Bank; (iii) Local Government Engineering Department
                         has prepared, adopted, and disclosed safeguards instruments required as per Bank guidelines for all
                         activities from the CER Implementation Plan for eligible financing under the CERC. Disbursements
                         would be made either against a positive list of critical goods and/or against the procurement of
                         works, and consultant services required to support the immediate response and recovery needs of the

                         Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh (GoB). All expenditures under this component,
                         should it be triggered, will be in accordance with BP/OP 8.0 and will be appraised, reviewed and
                         found to be acceptable to the Bank before any disbursement is made.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed MDSP will expand the coverage of cyclone shelters to all coastal districts facing high
                         risks from cyclones, and where comprehensive early warning systems are currently present. The aim
                         of the project will be to meet at least two thirds of the required shelters for nine coastal districts. The
                         project interventions for construction and improvement of shelters will be located in four Sidr-
                         affected coastal districts including Bhola, Barisal, Pirojpur and Patuakhali and five other coastal
                         districts including Chittagong, Coxâ€™s Bazaar, Feni, Laksmipur and Noakhali.

                         Cyclone shelters are constructed for multipurpose use largely for education centers. These
                         multipurpose shelters are generally established on the lands of existing education centers, community
                         centers, and offices. Shelter connectivity under ECRRP has been developed using the existing
                         designated roads in agreement with the community and in circumstance when additional lands for
                         expansion of the roads was needed, with the land owners along those roads. As MDSP targets
                         expansion of the facility in critically vulnerable areas, private lands may also be used in unavoidable
                         circumstances, for construction of new shelters and improvement of the existing ones and for access
                         road construction.

                         The existing educational institutions, especially the primary schools â€“ under the project - will be
Public Disclosure Copy




                         developed into multipurpose disaster shelters enabling an improved environment for class works by
                         the students and school managements including safe building, furniture, water supply tube-wells,
                         sanitary latrines, electricity and the like. The improved buildings of the schools/community centres
                         will be used as shelters only in events of cyclone and flooding. The existing use of the premises will
                         continue without any interruption from any corner, public or private.

                         Location of new disaster shelters, site for improvement of existing shelters and alignment of shelter
                         connecting roads will be identified through all inclusive consultative process. Population, location,
                         vulnerability of communities to disasters and availability of shelters around the location will provide
                         the bases for demand and availability of land for civil works construction will provide site readiness.
                         Final site selection will review and confirm agreement of the communities and availability of lands
                         for construction. In case of voluntary donation of land, direct purchase or exchange of lands for sites
                         (building and/or road), the land owners must voluntarily agree on such acts and LGED will execute
                         the land taking with documentary evidences under national legal framework. In circumstances that
                         lands through donation, direct purchase or exchange are not available but the intervention is critically
                         required; LGED will go for involuntary acquisition of lands, as the last resort, complying with the
                         requirements of the Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. Voluntary donation, direct purchase
                         or exchange of lands will be executed in a manner that the acts are voluntary and are at the unbiased
                         will of the owners without any threat or coercion.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The project will be implemented by LGED under the Local Government Division (LGD) of the
                         Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives (MLGRDC). LGED has long
                         working experience with IDA investments complying with the safeguard policies of the World Bank
                         and it is currently implementing the ECRRP for construction and improvement of multipurpose
                         disaster shelters in the coastal region. Depending on the project objective, designs and expected
Public Disclosure Copy




                         impacts, ECRRP was designated as safeguard category B and only policy OP/BP 4.01 was triggered.

                         LGED â€“ under the current ECRRP - is carrying out SA and SMP for all packages of shelter
                         construction and improvement works, development of shelter connecting roads and construction of
                         killas (cattle shelters). The SAs are comprehensive capturing data on disaster vulnerability of the
                         impact area population, availability of lands, social issues and demand for improved shelters and
                         connectivity. LGED is reviewing the land ownership of sponsoring schools/community shelters,
                         obtaining documentary evidences of land ownership and attaching them with the SA reports. Social
                         screening is being done for all sites and the filled out screening formats are signed by the participants
                         and certified by the heads of sponsoring institutions. Project activities are largely being carried out
                         within existing lands of the sponsoring institutions and in special circumstances of unavailability of
                         lands, voluntary donation, direct purchase or exchanges have been resorted to. The ongoing ECRRP
                         provides the lessons that site selection should also confirm the transfer of lands in the name of the
                         sponsoring institutions before contract bidding. To ensure this, SA and SMP should identify all social
                         issues with a management plan for LGED to execute before contract bidding. Additional lands may
                         need to be acquired for social safeguards compliance of connecting roads and critical sites for shelter
                         construction.

                         All environmental and social issues and impacts of the project at subproject sites will be captured
                         through a comprehensive EMF and an SMF, those will lay out the policy requirement, likely impacts,
                           environmental code of practice and how these will be addressed under the project. Once the sites of
                           the shelters are known, site specific Environmental Impact Screening, Social Assessment, and
                           Environmental and Social Management Plans, and, if applicable, a Resettlement Action Plan, will be

                           prepared and submitted at the time of detailed designs of the shelters. These will be independently
                           reviewed by Environment and Social Specialists, to be retained by the PMU. Lessons from previous
                           project will be utilized for site selection and improved design of shelters and connecting roads.
