II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project triggers 3 of the World Bank safeguards policies due to the nature of project
activities. Environmental impacts have been moderate and manageable. The GoL has
dully prepared all instruments in response to the policies that have been triggered- the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and associated RAPs (to date, two RAPs for the
roads and one Abbreviated RAP for the Caldwell Bridge have been prepared, consulted
upon, and disclosed); the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF);
and Health, Safety and Environmental Management Plans (an Environmental Mitigation
Plan and addendum have been prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed) which are
currently under implementation. These action and management plans will ensure the
reduction of expected negative impacts or substantially reduce expected impacts. It is
important to note that these impacts are reversible when the action and management plans
are effectively applied.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
N/A
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower-GoL through the infrastructure Implementation Unit (IIU) has developed
systems for managing and implementing safeguards issues in Bank funded project. They
have adequate capacity which is complemented by training and orientation from time to
time by the World Bank ensuring constant follow up and due diligence. The IIU has also
worked well with contractors, supervising consultants and the Bank and individual
consultants to carry out their safeguards responsibilities. It is expected that the checks and
balances as part of the due diligence and implementation of safeguards in the project will
continue under the Additional Finance activities. To augment GoL efforts and to
timeously implement compensation and expedite civil works, the GoL has requested the
World Bank to support the payment of cash compensation to PAPs. This request is part of
the processing of this AF, and has been cleared by Bank Management, per the
requirements of OP 10.00.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Different stakeholders have been consulted with during preparation, implementation and
monitoring of safeguards activities. The main ones are the project affected people, the
communities along the road sections under construction, community leaders, contractors
themselves and government Ministries and Civil society groups. Discussions took the
form of meetings on site and where possible at the project office in Monrovia. Key issues
raised included timing for compensation payment, entitlements and modalities for
payments. These issues were clearly discussed and explained.
