   2. Current Project Development Objectives
   The objectives of the Project are to provide technical assistance to the Beneficiary in the design and
   implementation of a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) framework and registry, and in
   the design and preparation of one or more carbon pricing instruments in the energy sector.

   3. Project Description
   Objectives and main implementation phases of the PMR:
   The Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) is a grant-based, capacity building multi-donor trust
   fund that provides funding and technical assistance for the collective innovation and piloting of
                                           Page 1 of 7
market-based instruments for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The PMR has received donor
pledges totaling about US$115 million as of April 2013. The PMR brings together developed
countries (i.e. the Contributing Participants: Australia, Denmark, European Commission, Finland,
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and United
Kingdom) and developing countries (i.e. Implementing Country Participants: Brazil, Chile, China,
Costa Rica, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, South Africa, Thailand,
Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam), as well as other key experts and stakeholders. The PMR provides a
platform for technical discussions on market instruments, fostering North-South and South-South
exchange, facilitating collective innovation for pilot efforts, and harnessing financial flows for
implementation and scale up. The Partnership Assembly (PA; consisting of both the Contributing and
Implementing Participants) is the decision-making body and determines the criteria for and allocation
of funding.
The PMR is country-led. It provides systemic support to enhance countries’ technical and institutional
capacities in order to implement market-based and carbon pricing instruments, such as a domestic
emissions trading system (ETS), a scaled-up crediting mechanism or a carbon tax. As the
Implementing Country Participants are at different stages of development and preparedness for such
instruments, each approaches the design and implementation of such instruments in different ways.
Some focus on building core “readiness? components, such as new systems for MRV, data collection,
baseline setting, and establishing regulatory institutions; others are prepared to go further and pilot an
appropriate domestic or international instrument. Regardless of a country’s choice, ca pacity building
and piloting can have cross-cutting benefits relevant to implementing non-market-based mitigation
actions, designing low emission development strategies, and identifying areas of low cost mitigation
potential.
Implementing Country Participants follow a Preparation Phase and an Implementation Phase, for a
total period of 4-6 years depending on the circumstances of the specific country and proposed
activities. The Preparation and Implementation Phases have the following roles:
     (a)     Preparation Phase: With a benefit of a US$350,000 preparation grant, each PMR
     Implementing Country formulates a Market Readiness Proposal (MRP) for consideration and
     feedback from the PA. The Implementing Country may also use the preparation grant for
     activities that continue into and overlap with the Implementation Phase.
     (b)     Implementation Phase: The Implementing Country Participant begins the PMR
     Implementation Phase once the PA allocates implementation phase funding for the activities
     outlined in the MRP. Each Implementing Country Participant is required to present its draft
     MRP within two years after the award of the preparation grant (with a possibility of extension of
     six months in extraordinary circumstances). PMR implementation funding is allocated in grant
     sizes of US$3, 5 or 8 million. The size of the funding is determined by the PA in accordance
     with a set of criteria and the availability of funding. Implementing Country Participants are
     invited to return to the PA to ask for additional funding when they can demonstrate further need.
     With the benefit of the Implementation Grant, the Implementing Country puts in place the
     readiness components outlined in the MRP, including, where applicable, piloting the proposed
     market instrument.
Chile’s PMR activities:
Chile joined the PMR in May 2011, upon the PA approving its Expression of Interest (EOI) and
allocating it $350,000 to prepare its MRP. The Implementing Agency, the MoE, used this funding to
organize consultations, meetings, training events and outreach to stakeholders, as well as to establish
effective project management capacity. The Ministries of Finance and Environment will assist the
MoE in its supervision function as part of a newly created body called the Petit Comité. Additionally,
a Steering Committee was established in March 2012, comprising the ministries of Foreign Affairs,
                                            Page 2 of 7
Finance, Economy, Agriculture, Mining, Transport & Telecommunications, Energy and Environment.
Chile presented its final MRP at the 5th PA meeting in March 2013. The PA reviewed and endorsed
the MRP, awarding it US$3 million in Grant Funding to implement the activities contained within it.
The World Bank LAC region provided technical support to the MoE to prepare and complete its MRP
and the World Bank’s Carbon Finance Unit (ENVCF) provided secretariat services, technical support
and carbon markets and mechanisms expertise. This involved helping to identify areas of PMR
support, supervising the execution of the PMR Preparation Phase funding and providing technical
support through regular communications with the consortium of local and international MRP
consultants.
Planned PMR activities in Chile:
a. Regulatory, Economic and Institutional Analyses to assess the viability of one or more carbon
   pricing instruments for the energy sector:
   i. Regulatory Analysis for one or more carbon pricing instruments in Chile.
   ii. Economic Analysis for one or more carbon pricing instruments in Chile.
   iii. Institutional Analysis for one or more carbon pricing instruments in Chile.
b. Design and implementation of MRV framework and Registry system:
   i. Design and implementation of an MRV framework.
   ii. Development of a Registry
c. Stakeholder engagement and communication strategy, and capacity building:
   i. Development of a strategy for stakeholder engagement.
   ii. Public, private and political stakeholder consultation.
   iii. Development of a communication strategy, including the preparation of informational tools.
   iv. Participation in trainings and workshops and country - visits by Chilean officials
   v. Other PMR-supported technical assistance and capacity building programs
d. Administration of the PMR project.

4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguards Analysis
    (if known)
The project does not finance any physical activity on the ground, but rather consists solely of
technical assistance activities, such as training, background analyses and studies, computer
simulations and modeling, etc. Consultants will work mostly in San Tiago, in their own offices and
those of the Ministry of Energy (MoE) and Agencia de Cooperacion Internacional de Chile (AGCI).
Delivery of the training and capacity building activities and preparation of consultant studies may
take place in various locations in Chile.
