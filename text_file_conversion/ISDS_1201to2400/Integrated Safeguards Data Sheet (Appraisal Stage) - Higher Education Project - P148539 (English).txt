                         The proposed Project will cover reforms of existing higher education institutions nationwide. No
                         land acquisition or physical displacement of residents is expected.
                         The project will finance sub-projects for higher education institutions that may include small-scale
                         physical investment such as minor rehabilitation and/or renovation of existing facilities. The location
                         of the sub-project sites will be determined during the implementation, but such sites will be limited
                         to the properties within the existing higher education institutions. The project will only finance
                         physical investments that do not involve land acquisition or resettlement, and accordingly OP 4.12
                         would not be triggered.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify

                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The environmental issues which might occur due to the implementation of the project are those
                              associated with Component 2.3 which, while providing TA and capacity building to selected
                              universities, may require physical improvement of some university facilities. The environmental
                              risks in such case will include those typically caused by minor renovation activities, i.e.
                              disturbance due to increased noise, dust and odor, generation of construction wastes, and labor
                              safety issues. All those will be addressed through sub-project specific EMP Checklists to be
                              prepared by the PCU once the sub-projects are identified. The procedures as well as the
                              institutional responsibilities for the development of such EMP Checklists have been determined by
                              the Project Environmental Management Framework prepared by MoE in October 2014.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              The long term indirect impacts of the Project include the better studying environment for the
                              teachers and students of the beneficiary universities.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              N/A.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an

                           The PCU under the MOE has prepared an Environmental Management Framework which
                           identified the most typical environmental impacts which might be caused by the minor renovation
Public Disclosure Copy




                           activities supported by the Project, determined the procedures to be followed if the need for such
                           renovation is indicated for any of the sub-projects which will be competitively selected in the
                           course of the project implementation. The EMF envisages that the PCU will develop EMP
                           Checklists to address specific risks of each sub-project related to the minor renovation activities.
                           The PCU under the MOE will be responsible for the environmental management of the Project.
                           The PCU has been involved into the implementation of the previous education reform project and
                           is well experienced with Bank’s operation policies and safeguard requirements. It is expected that
                           a dedicated environmental consultant will be contracted by the PCU to manage and handle sub-
                           project related environmental issues as specified by the Project EMF.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The Ministry of Education (Implementing Agency) has disclosed the EMF prior to Appraisal on
                           its official website on November 12, 2014, with an invitation for comments and questions to be
                           sent at least one week before the completion of Appraisal. In addition, at an introductory workshop
                           for this sub-project activity, further (in person) consultations on the EMP Checklists will be held
                           with the HEIs that have submitted an expression of interest to participate in the activity.
