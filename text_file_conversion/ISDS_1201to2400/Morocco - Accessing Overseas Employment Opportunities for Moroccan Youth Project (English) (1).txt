 2. Project Development Objective(s)
 The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to strengthen institutional capacity to
 pilot the reform of international labor intermediation services in Morocco and better prepare the
 Moroccan workforce for greater integration with international labor markets through a concrete
 recruitment experience with Germany.
3. Project Description
The proposed project will develop the institutional capacity of the Agence Nationale de
Promotion de l’Emploi et des Compétences (ANAPEC) to design, develop, and manage
international labor intermediation services through implementation of a pilot labor mobility
program with the German hospitality sector. The pilot is expected to involve up to 150
Moroccan workers. The proposed project has three components: (a) institutional capacity
building for the selection and preparation of overseas employment candidates; (b) developing
sustainable partnerships between public and private actors within and across borders for job
placement beyond the pilot; and (c) knowledge sharing and dissemination.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
None expected.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
Not applicable (NA)
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
Not applicable (NA)
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
None expected.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The primary stakeholders are public agencies in Morocco (primarily ANAPEC and the Ministry for
Moroccans Abroad) and candidates selected to participate in the pilot. As the project focus is primarily
capacity building and technical assistance, and will not trigger any safeguard policies, we do not expect
to hold consultations or disclosures on safeguards.

B. Disclosure Requirements
If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the
respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental
Assessment/Audit/or EMP.
If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please explain why:
