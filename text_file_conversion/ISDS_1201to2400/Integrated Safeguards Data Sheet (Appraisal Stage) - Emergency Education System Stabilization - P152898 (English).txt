II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
O
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
It is not expected that the project will have any significant negative environmental impacts.
Nonetheless, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared with the objective of
ensuring that the project activities are consistent with the Bank environmental and social
safeguards policies and procedures as well as the national and local environmental legislation.
The EMP describes the possible environmental impacts of the typical activities to be carried out by
the project, namely school rehabilitation, and the corresponding mitigation measures. These
mitigation measures will be adopted as means of addressing any potential negative environmental
impacts that may be generated by the project activities. The monitoring and supervision activities
are also outlined in the EMP. In addition, the EMP includes the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the
supervision engineers in order to ensure that the requirements set forth in the EMP are embedded
in their task descriptions. The EMP includes an annex which lists the technical specifications that
will be included in the bidding documents/contracts for the contractors selected to carry out the
various activities financed by the project.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:
N/A
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
N/A
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
As OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment is triggered, an EMP has been prepared. The Borrower
conducted consultations on the EMP and the project on November 12, 2104. A summary of these
a           consultations is included as an annex in the EMP. The EMP has been publicly disclosed and has
been submitted to the Bank for clearance. The implementing agency, the Ministry of Education
and Higher Education (MEHE) has already developed sufficient capacity for implementing an
EMP through the experience acquired during the implementation of the First and Second
Education Development Projects (EDP1 and EDP2, on-going).
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The rehabilitation and upgrading of the targeted schools and classrooms entails important positive
social distributional effects and thus, consultations with the affected groups are crucial. MEHE
carried out consultations on the EMP. They engaged with stakeholder groups in the education
sector including parents, teachers, school administrators, and interested civil society groups. The
consultation process was conducted in a manner that ensured a beneficial exchange of information
about the project and the EMP itself. The EMP was disclosed in-country by MEHE and at the
targeted schools as well as at the InfoShop. An Executive Summary in Arabic has also been made
available.
