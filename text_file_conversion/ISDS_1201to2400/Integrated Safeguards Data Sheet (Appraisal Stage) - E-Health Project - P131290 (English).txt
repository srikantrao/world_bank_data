                         Component 2: Clinical Data Collection, Access and Sharing (US$7,751,000). The aim of this
                         component is to design and pilot test systems to enhance access to and sharing of health data.

                         Component 3: National Health Information Center (NHIC) (US$2,624,000). The focus of this
                         component would be on establishing a center that oversees aspects of e-health in Mongolia, thus
                         assuring the long-term sustainability of Mongoliaâ€™s e-Health investments.

                         Component 4: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$1,000,000). This component
                         will build the necessary human capacity for the successful implementation and institutionalization of
                         e-health in Mongolia. Financing will be provided for improving the computer literacy of health
                         services providers through training in a variety of subjects. Support for the consultants necessary for
                         Project management, and incremental operating costs associated with the Project are also provided
                         under this Component. Preliminary technical assistance needs anticipated include areas such as
                         procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation.

                         Component 5: Project Management (US$1,103,000). This component would finance the project
                         implementation unit (PMU), domain expert consultation, and annual monitoring and evaluation
                         (M&E) of the project.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The Project will be implemented in 4 pilot sites, of which are 3 are in or around Ulaanbaatar, and one
                         in Khovsgul Aimag.
