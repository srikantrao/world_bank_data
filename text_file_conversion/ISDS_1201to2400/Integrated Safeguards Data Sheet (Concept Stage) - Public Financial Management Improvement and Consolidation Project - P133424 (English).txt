                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objective (PDO) is: “to improve budget planning and credibility, financial
                           control and accountability, and legislative and public oversight in the management and use of
                         government finances in Sierra Leone?. Through strengthened institutional capacity for the delivery
                         of effective PFM and oversight, the project will contribute to enhancing fiscal discipline, strategic
                         allocation of resources, and service delivery efficiency.

                         With this objective, a sound PFM system will be established and nurtured under the proposed project
                         to contribute to poverty reduction as: (i) it serves as a prerequisite for long-term and sustainable
                         poverty reduction, enabling the country to manage its own development; (ii) it helps ensure that
                         budget planning and discipline are compatible with macroeconomic stability, resource allocation is in
                         line with poverty reduction strategies, activities are implemented efficiently, and results are followed
                         up; (iii) national policies are transformed into actions through the PFM system, and services are
                         delivered; and (iv) democratic governance entails democratic control over resources.

                         In order to achieve the PDO, the Project will support the implementation of priority reform actions
                         identified in the GoSL approved PFM Reform Strategy (2014-2017) which was developed under the
                         following key themes: (i) Budget Planning, Comprehensiveness, and Credibility; (ii) Financial
                         Control and Accountability, Service Delivery and Oversight; (iii) Revenue Mobilization; and (iv)
                         Strengthening Local Governance Financial Management through Local Councils for Effective
                         Decentralization. It will establish tangible improvements in budget credibility, coverage, and realism
                         through improvements in macro-fiscal planning and forecasting, budget compilation and
                         comprehensiveness, it will instill improved internal and external controls and accountability
                         processes in expenditure management for enhanced service delivery, it will strengthen revenue
                         collection, accounting and reporting as a basis for improved fiscal management; it will strengthen the
                         capacity of the decentralized service delivery arm of government (the local councils) to plan and
                         account for the resources transferred to them; and it will support the overall governance and
                         management platform for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of not only the PFM
                         reform project but the PFM reform strategy as a whole.

                         The PFM Reform Strategy objectives against each of the themes have been accordingly built in the
                         relevant components of the proposed project for efficiency and for the sake of operational

                         implementation of the project. The strategy is anchored on five basic criteria: sequencing of major
                         actions; simplicity and realism; lessons learned in prior reforms; ownership and sustainability; and
                         partnership and collaboration.

                         Project Beneficiaries: The beneficiaries of the Project will include: the Ministry of Finance and
                         economic Planning (Comptroller and Accountant General’s Department, Budget Bureau, PFM
                         Reforms Unit, Aid and Debt Management Unit, and Macro-Fiscal Analysis Unit), National Revenue
                         Authority, Audit Service of Serra Leone, the Finance and Appropriations Committee and the Public
                         Accounts Committee of Parliament, National Public Procurement Authority, Local Councils. MDAs
                         will also be key stakeholders and beneficiaries of the reforms supported under the project. In
                         addition, the Project will benefit the non-state actors in executing their demand-side oversight
                         responsibilities in the area of PFM.
                         C. Project Description
                         The preliminary description of the proposed project as outlined below provides a compelling basis
                         for supporting the holistic reforms required in the public financial management and related cross-
                         cutting areas in Sierra Leone. This is consistent with the government-led reforms agenda as
                         articulated in the PFM reform Strategy.

                         The Bank’s PFM engagement in Sierra Leone across sectors, as well as on budget support
                         operations, focuses to a considerable extent, on strengthening the institutions and re-enforcing
                         accountability and fiscal management for improved service delivery. The foundation for
                         strengthened institutions lies to a large extent, on sustained capacity; its robustness, and the quality of
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the governance structure. Financial management is a key ingredient in establishing this foundation.
                         The ability to put in place adequate systems, policies and good practices in revenue and expenditure
                         management is a sine-qua-non for a sustainable path for good governance.

                         This understanding formed the basis for the Bank's financial and technical assistance support under
                         the IPFMRP - in partnership with such other Development Partners as DFID, the EU, AfDB, and
                         GIZ. This collaboration has also facilitated other complementary programs with the aim of
                         supporting the GoSL's progress towards realizing the long term vision for a PFM system. This
                         includes: the achievement of fiscal discipline; the strategic, efficient and effective allocation and
                         utilization of funds - and value for money; and the achievement of probity in the use of public funds.

                         Drawing from the strategic direction of continuing reform requisites as contained in the GoSL PFM
                         Reform Strategy (2014-17), and consistent with the need to improve on and consolidate the
                         achievements of the IPFMRP, the proposed project aims at further strengthening the foundation for
                         sustaining and broadening a robust PFM regime in Sierra Leone, recognizing that PFM
                         improvements take long to mature and to achieve visible outcomes.

                         Against the above background, the proposed technical assistance project was conceptualized to
                         respond to the GoSL PFM reform strategy, aimed at strengthening the overall PFM governance
                         ranging from planning, budgeting, accounting and reporting, internal audit and controls, public
                         procurement, revenue management, external audit, and legislative and public oversight. These
                         together constitute the core of the reforms envisaged in the government’s strategy document. DFID
                         is supporting complementary reforms in the areas of revenue management and external audit; the
                         GIZ is also supporting the GoSL in the domestic non-tax revenue area as pertaining to extractive
                         sector; and the AfDB is providing support in strengthening local governance. The activities to be
                         supported under the proposed operation in those areas will focus on complementary reforms not
Public Disclosure Copy




                         catered for in those defined support programs.

                         The proposed operation will be financed by IDA, MDTF (to be contributed to by DFID and EU) and
                         AfDB (through pooled, non-earmarked funding). The specific financial contributions are currently
                         being discussed with the partners for pledges to be made around the PCN review date. In principle,
                         the expected contributions, apart from IDA allocation of about $11 million, are as follows: DFID (7.5
                         million GBP); EU (about 2.7 million Euros) and AfDB (about $3.5 million).

                         The proposed TAL would be implemented through 5 components over a 4-year period, consistent
                         with the Reform Strategy itself, at an estimated total cost of about $28 million. Since each of the
                         components will contribute to more than one of the project outcomes, and there will be
                         interdependencies between components (for instance, a strengthened IFMIS will contribute to
                         improved budget planning and management by the MoFED as well as to improved transparency and
                         accountability), these linkages will be taken into account in project management and the monitoring
                         and evaluation (M&E) framework for the project.

                         �       Component 1: Enhancing Budget planning and credibility – ($1.9 million): This component
                         which will be implemented through 3 sub-components: (i) strengthening budgetary and macro-fiscal
                         planning and forecasting; (ii) fiscal risk management and reporting; and (iii) strengthening budget
                         framework and formulation. The objective of the component is to improve the credibility and
                         reliability of the national budget to assure greater consistency between policy commitments as set out
                         in the GoSL’s development strategy (PRS3) and the services to be delivered to the public. Key
                         activities to be pursued include: Revenue and Expenditure forecasting; Public Investment Planning

                         and Appraisal; Development of Sector Strategies & Costing; Budget Formulation and transition to
                         improved MTEF and MTBF; Integration of Recurrent & Capital Budgets; Aid on budget processes
                         and implementation. In addition, the project will support activities related to the establishment and
                         strengthening of the Public Investment Planning function in government, to deliver on the methodical
                         screening of PIPs before they are brought on the budget. Linkage of these to the PPP arrangements
                         under the auspices of the President’s office will be one other area of the project’s intervention
                         support.

                         �        Component 2: Strengthening Financial Control, Accountability and Oversight: ($15.1
                         million): This component aims at strengthening a control, accountability and oversight regime, based
                         on building a strong legal and regulatory framework for PFM strengthening and encompassing the
                         requisite systems and practices that together foster accountability for public resource management,
                         including the culture of stronger oversight institutions. To this end, demand and supply driven
                         interventions from non-state actors (a feature of the current IPFMRP) will continue to provide
                         increased legitimacy to the service delivery functions of government. The component will have 5
                         inter-related sub-components as follows: (i) Strengthening financial management systems, controls,
                         accounting and reporting (including IFMIS, accounting and reporting as well as internal audit
                         activities); (ii) Cash, debt and aid management; (iii) Enhancing Public Procurement systems; (iv)
                         Strengthening External audit; (vi) Strengthening legislative and public oversight (including
                         parliamentary and civil society and non-state actors). The strengthening of the demand-side CSO
                         capacity development processes in budget and financial analysis is critical to providing independent
                         assurances in the management of public finances in Sierra Leone. Equally, providing the human
                         resource capacity as well as the requisite audit management information systems for the ASSL will
                         reinforce compliance with international standards and facilitate the capacity to follow up on audit
                         issues for sustained remedial actions.

                         �        Component 3: Supporting the Strengthening of Revenue Mobilization and Administration
                         Systems– ($1.0 million): This component is aimed at improving the efficiency and integrity of
                         revenue administration and increase domestic revenue resources and internally generated own-source
                         revenues of central government entities. The component is designed with 3 sub-components: (i)
                         Improving Tax legislation and regulatory framework; (ii) Strengthening tax systems, business
                         processes, collection and reconciliation; and (iii) Tax policy transparency. Noting that a number of
                         complementary activities are supported by DFID and GIZ, the focus of the component will be in the
                         complementary areas of supporting the administration, including the collection of and accounting for
                         domestic revenues, and strengthening the interfaces between the Customs and Tax administration
                         systems with the IFMIS and establishing a regime for timely reconciliation and transfer of
                         government revenues paid or payable into the GoSl consolidated revenue fund. The component will
                         support the MoFED to strengthen its tax policies with a view to enhancing the credibility of tax
                         collections as an ingredient of budget credibility.

                         �       Component 4: Strengthening local governance financial management and accountability
                         systems – ($7.8 million): The objective of this component is to improve the capacity of the financial
                         management systems in local councils and strengthen the accountability and oversight institutions to
                         enhance service delivery efficiency and effectiveness. The component which will be implemented
                         under 4 inter-related subcomponents – (i) strengthening budgetary planning systems; (ii)
                         strengthening budget execution, accounting and reporting systems; (iii) strengthening public

                           will reinforce the transparency and accountability processes and outcomes in the 19 local councils
                           and thus facilitate service delivery outcomes. The component will also enhance the functionalities of

                           the PETRA (the financial management application used in local councils) to provide meaningful
                           decision making fiscal information to local authorities as well as to the local government finance
                           department in the MoFED so as to strengthen the objectives under the fiscal decentralization regime
                           of the government.

                           �         Component 5: PFM reform coordination and project management – (S2.3 million): The
                           component will support the effective overall operational costs of project coordination, the monitoring
                           and evaluation aspects of both the project and the progress in achieving results under the overarching
                           PFM strategy of the GoSL. In addition, the component will cater to the requirements for maintaining
                           the central fiduciary function under the project in as much as primary decisions relating to
                           implementation actions according to approved work plans will remain the direct responsibility of the
                           component and sub-component managers across MDAs. Equally, developing and implementing a
                           communications & change management strategy, engagement with stakeholders, and dissemination
                           of project intermediate and final outcomes, will be financed under the component. This will be
                           essential to help overcome the political economy challenges associated with the implementation of
                           PFM reforms. Essentially, the component will have 3 sub-components: (i) project management &
                           coordination; (ii) PFM Strategy monitoring, evaluation and communication; and (iii) Project
                           financial management and procurement. The component will oversee, within the overall governance
                           structure of the project, the alignment of implementation actions to the project’s development
                           objectives, and ensure that project funds are spent for intended and productive purposes. It will
                           support the re-invigoration and strengthening of the work of the PFM Oversight Committee to
                           deliver on providing the strategic directions of the implementation of the PFM reform strategy and
                           the priority issues and elements that the project has been designed to respond to. The M&E will play
                           a critical role in ensuring coordination among linked components and subcomponents of the project.
                           The framework will meet the specific monitoring requirements of the Bank, but equally importantly
                           it will identify the linkages between inputs, project activities and workplans, outputs, and outcomes.
