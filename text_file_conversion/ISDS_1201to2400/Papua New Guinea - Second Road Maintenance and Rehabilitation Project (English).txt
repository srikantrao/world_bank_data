2. Project Objectives

        The project’s development objectives are to: (i) improve road transport to project
areas through providing satisfactory physical condition and safety in selected roads; (ii)
strengthen institutional arrangements for road maintenance including the participation of
the private sector and communities; and (iii) enhance road-related economic opportunities
for women.

3. Project Description

        Component 1: Road and Bridge Improvements. This component would
rehabilitate, upgrade and/or maintain existing national roads and bridges in some of the
ten provinces eligible for funding under the Additional Financing (AF).


       Component 2: Technical Assistance. Technical Assistance would continue to be
provided to relevant sector entities to strengthen the Department of Works and
Implementation (DoWI) and the National Roads Authority’s NRA capacity to more
effectively manage and maintain road sector assets, and to train small- and medium-sized
contractors in eligible provinces in preparing tenders and managing contracts. New
activities would be added to pilot: (i) an integrated maintenance regime for the Hiritano
and/or Magi Highways; and (ii) performance-based contracting through initial repairs to
roads followed by a maintenance period. In addition, design/construction standards and
specifications for national roads and bridges, and for axle load limits would be updated.

        Component 3: Enhancing Economic Opportunities for Women. This component
would help enhance economic opportunities for women related to improvements in road
assets by employing women’s groups to carry out non-technical routine road and bridge
maintenance activities before and after roads have been rehabilitated. Monies would be
allocated to support implementation, carry out capacity building measures for
counterparts, community groups and women, and conduct socio-economic and gender
surveys.

      Component 4: Project Implementation. Funds would be provided to support
implementation of the AF.

        Component 5: Contingency for Disaster Risk Response (est. US$0.0 million).
This component is being introduced to support preparedness and rapid response to
disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic events, as needed. The provisional zero cost will
allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined
procurement and disbursement procedures.

4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguards
   Analysis

        Ten provinces are eligible for financing under the AF, including Central, Gulf,
East and West New Britain, Oro, Morobe, Madang, Milne Bay, Manus and Western. The
specific roads to be rehabilitated under the project will be prioritized by DoWI by
applying a set of predetermined criteria, including specific cost/benefit criteria (when
available), and general selection preferences. In the first year, the East Cape Road in
Milne Bay has been identified as a Year 1 project.

        Papua New Guinea (PNG) has a total land area of 462,840 square km, of which
about 360,000 square km (78 percent) are covered in forests. The total sea area of PNG
is 3,120,000 square km with a coastline of 17,110 km. The only land boundary is with
the Indonesian Province of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya) in the west and consists of 820
km. Some of the country’s islands are mountainous, while many are low lying coral
atolls. PNG is subject to frequent and severe earthquakes, landslides and occasional
volcanic eruptions. The country also has very high biodiversity with a remarkable variety
of landscapes, ecosystems and species. It is ranked as one of the world's top twenty mega
diverse countries.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

        The additional financing will support the scaling up of the same activities and
works done, primarily rehabilitation and maintenance, as in the original Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, Phase 2 (RMRP II) project. Anticipated impacts
will likely remain the same. The road and bridge works will have impacts that are
limited in scope and can be managed through proper mitigation measures.

        It is anticipated that the improved roads will have a positive impact on the
communities. In general, the present baseline condition of the roads in the selected
provinces under the additional financing reveals an urgent need for rehabilitation and
repair. Poor road conditions lead to constrained and impeded movement of goods, poor
transport service delivery, and access to basic services.

        The negative environmental impacts of the project can be categorized in two
types: (i) construction related impacts; and (ii) impacts from the operation of the
highway. Construction related impacts are predictable, limited in scope and easily
mitigated. These impacts are in the areas of earthworks, pavement works, drainage
works, bitumen works, erosion protection and campsite management. The common
impacts linked to road operations are increased noise and dust, sedimentation of water
bodies in the immediate area of works, air emissions from bitumen heating, spillages of
bitumen, earth movement in borrow pits, vegetation buried under sidecast material and
generation of solid waste and domestic waste from campsites.
        The anticipated sub-project activities will not involve expansion or change in
alignments requiring acquisition of new land. Communities from the area(s) of the sub-
projects will be consulted to ensure broad community support and that there are no
pending issues, such as disputes or affected families with the current alignment and right-
of-way.

        The safeguards instrument in RMRP II was an Environment and Social
Management Framework (ESMF). During implementation, this document was not fully
utilized as intended, as the checklist proved to be too long and difficult to fill-in. All road
packages had Environmental Management Plans (EMP) as part of contractors’
obligations in carrying out their work. The EMP’s were submitted to the DoWI, but
DoWI had little time to monitor and supervise the projects. Based on this experience, a
simplified ESMF has been proposed for the AF. DoWI has also increased its
complement of staff in its Environmental Unit from one to three, which should help.
Additional support for the Environmental Unit will also be available under the AF during
implementation.

        Based on the experience from the previous RMRP projects, the majority of the
intended beneficiary communities for either the rehabilitated or maintained roads will
likely be Indigenous People (IP). The sub-projects will be designed to be culturally
appropriate with broad community benefits such as improved rural road access for
agricultural marketing purposes, improved transportation and reduced costs, access to
education and health services.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

        The long term impacts of improved and rehabilitated roads in the project sites are
generally positive. Transportation and movement of people will be improved and made
safer. Without the roads, the local communities travel by foot or by boat, with increased
time travel, reduced mobility and increased costs. Better access to basic social services
such as schools and hospitals is expected to better the lives of the local communities.

        During the operation phase of these rehabilitated roads, the potential negative
impacts are related to the increased number and speed of vehicles. This can impact
communities with potential increase in road traffic injuries and fatalities and in particular
for pedestrians who walk on the roadside including school children who walk along the
roads to get to and from their schools. There may also be an increase in the number of
fauna killed, but the impact on the total population of wildlife will likely not be
significant.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

       Pedestrian crossings and road safety measures such as speed bumps and
pedestrian crossings will be included in the sub-project rehabilitation activities as needed.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

        The DoWI has established an Environmental Management Unit to manage and
oversee environmental concerns of the department. This unit is responsible for the
implementation and monitoring of safeguards in the RMRP II and will continue during
the AF. The DoWI recently increased the staff complement of this Unit to better
supervise its projects. The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
has been revised and updated to guide the project in the required environmental
safeguards measures. This ESMF has a screening instrument which will be used to
assess each proposed road sub-project for any safeguards issues. Environmental and
Social Management Plans (ESMP) will be drafted for each of the future road projects in
the AF. An ESMP was completed for the East Cape Road in Milne Bay, which will be
tendered in the first year of implementation.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

        The key stakeholders are the local communities living along the sub-project roads
and local NGOs. Consultations with the beneficiary communities and local NGOs will
take place for the Year 1 project activities. The ESMF and Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Framework will also be shared and disclosed as separate documents in both
English and the local language. A formal grievance redress mechanism will be
established with support from both the Provincial Works Unit and the Department of
Works and monitoring of any grievances will be recorded and addressed. Once the sub-
project activities for the subsequent years have been confirmed, consultations will take
place on the appropriate ESMPs.
