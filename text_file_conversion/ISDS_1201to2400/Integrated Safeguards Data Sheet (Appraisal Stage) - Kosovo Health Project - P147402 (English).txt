                           To contribute to improving financial protection from health spending for the poor and quality of care
                           for priority Maternal and Child Health and Non Communicable Disease services through: (i) support
                           for health sector reforms focused on mandatory health insurance and performance-based purchasing;
                           and (ii) building capacity to improve quality of care.

Public Disclosure Copy




                         This component will build institutional capacity to implement health sector reforms to improve
                         financial protection and quality of care. It will finance capacity building and goods, services and
                         equipment to support the design and implementation of effective reforms, communications to
                         manage the reforms, monitoring and evaluation of the reforms and upgrades of health information
                         systems.

                         Component 2: Strengthening primary care

                         This component seeks to improve physical access to quality priority services at the primary care
                         level, including Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Non Communicable Disease (NCD) services,
                         and therefore, to contribute to enhancing the sustainability of the mandatory health insurance reforms
                         and improving population health outcomes. The component will finance capitation payments linked
                         to performance.

                         Component 3: Project management

                         This component will support the operational costs of implementing the Project, including project
                         coordination and supervision and fiduciary management (financial, procurement and audits of Project
                         accounts).
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Country-wide. Project activities will be implemented in hospitals and health centers across the
                         country.

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Not applicable. No construction or civil works are envisaged. Only minor refurbishment may be
                              undertaken in health facility areas where equipment are to be installed. The medical equipment
                              supported by the Project do not require any special arrangements for installation. Expert
                              assessment suggests that water and electricity requirements for the equipment to be supported with
                              Project funds are normally available in all hospitals. No medical equipment with safeguards
                              consequences - such as radiographic equipment that requires room shielding works - will be
                              purchased with Project funds.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              Not applicable.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                              Not applicable.

                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                              on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                              Not applicable.
