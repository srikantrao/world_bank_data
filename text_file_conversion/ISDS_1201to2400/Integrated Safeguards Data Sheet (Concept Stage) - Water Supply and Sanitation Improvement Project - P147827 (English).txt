                           The development objectives of the project will be to increase access to sustainable piped water
                           services and sanitation, and to improve hygiene behavior, in selected Districts in the country.
                           C. Project Description
                           Project Concept
                         The project supports the Government’s Mahinda Chinthana vision to expand piped water supply to
                         60% of the population by 2020. In doing so it builds on the experience of two earlier World Bank
                         financed rural water supply and sanitation projects, and on two recently completed NLTA studies

                         which, together, support a more integrated approach to water and sanitation service delivery in the
                         country.

                         The World Bank supported Sri Lanka with two consecutive Community RWSS Projects during
                         1992-2010. The 1st CWSSP for US$ 24.3 million was closed on December 1998 with satisfactory
                         rating. The 2nd CWSSP for US$ 39.8 million was closed on December 2010, with moderately
                         satisfactory rating on the account that only about 55 percent of the revised connections target was
                         achieved – although the project was fully disbursed at closing. Under the two projects, over 1.4
                         million people were provided access to safe water through construction of rural schemes, and close to
                         120,000 latrines were constructed. The lessons learned from these two projects as well as those
                         implemented by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are:
                         •        Continuous technical and management backstopping support to the CBOs during the project
                         period and the post-construction period is instrumental in long term sustainability of the CBO
                         managed schemes.
                         •        Communities require close support from Partner Organizations until their CBO reaches a
                         minimum degree of maturity to handle O&M of the schemes post construction.
                         •        Diligent investigations of groundwater sources, particularly in the dry zone, should be
                         conducted to ensure quality and yield of the water sources throughout the year. Clustering sub-
                         projects around surface water sources should be considered.
                         •        Asset ownership and legal status of the CBOs need to be defined and enforced to strengthen
                         the CBOs’ legal standing thus enabling them to confidently address tariff revision and collections
                         issues.

                         The NLTA study on the Estates sub-sector highlighted the low quality of services in the estates and
                         the challenges of organizing communities to take responsibility for water and sanitation services. The
                         study also identified the more complex institutional arrangements in the estates where the PHDT,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         plantation companies and the Estate Workers Housing Cooperative Societies (EWHCS) have to work
                         together to deliver sustainable services.

                         The second NLTA study, which assessed the delivery of the MC water sector goals, identified
                         challenges of mobilizing funds, increasing the financial sustainability of the NWSDB, and the likely
                         blurring of traditional divides between rural and urban as the rural areas develop and service delivery
                         methods converge towards piped systems expected in a middle income country. Issues of water
                         resources were identified as possible constraints going forwards. As a consequence the study
                         proposed that the sector be developed in a more integrated manner with Province-wide planning and
                         development covering urban, rural and estates sectors, whilst allowing different methods of service
                         delivery in each of them.

                         The project design builds on the above, incorporating key lessons learnt. It will cover all sub-sectors
                         – urban, small towns, rural and estates. The basic building block for project engagement will be the
                         District – in line with the organizational structure of the project counterpart (NWSDB) and
                         administrative structure in the country. Within selected Districts the project will support investments
                         across all sub-sectors, implemented by NWSDB, but with service delivery arrangements appropriate
                         for the sub-sector. The PHDT and estate companies will support service delivery in the estates, the
                         CBOs and NCWT in the rural areas, and the NWSDB in the towns/ urban areas.
                         The selection of the participating Districts is crucial. The project will cover up to seven high priority
                         Districts for infrastructure investments depending on the District profile, needs and demand as well
                         as the Government priorities in the District. The high priority Districts have been selected in
Public Disclosure Copy




                         consultation with National Planning Department (NPD), MWSD and the NWSDB based on three
                         criteria: (i) % of peopled with access to unimproved/unsafe water; (ii) % of households with access
                         to non-piped water source; and (iii) Districts in the dry zones. Poverty - measured by the poverty
                         head count - has a strong correlation with access level and is therefore implicitly captured in the
                         District selection process. Additional prioritization assessments, specifically including the Poverty
                         Head Count Index (the percentage of population below the poverty line), did not materially change
                         the priority Districts. The seven priority Districts in four Provinces are:
                         �         Mulathivu and Kilinochchi Districts in Northern Province
                         �         Nuwara Eliya District in Central Province
                         �         Badulla and Monoregala Districts in Uva Province
                         �         Kegalle and Ratnapura Districts in Sabaragamuwa Province

                         It should be noted that Central Province is home to some 54% of the estate population in the country.
                         This is important given that the estate poverty headcount index at 11.4 is more than double that in
                         urban areas (5.3) and 20% higher than in rural areas (9.4) according to the 2012 statistics. Within the
                         priority Districts the sub-projects will be selected based on considerations of equity (as between
                         Districts and sub-sectors) and on revealed demand (for rural and estates sub sectors).

                         Project Description

                         Component 1 – Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure ($132m indicative)
                         This component would finance infrastructure investments to support expansion of piped water
                         services, in urban and rural areas in the high priority districts. Within the urban sub-sector the focus
                         will be on towns given that the Government has a number of projects already planned for the larger
                         urban centers. Some rehabilitation of existing systems would be included.

                         In Central Province investment will focus on piped water supplies in estates and adjoining rural
                         villages. From experience of earlier pilots in the estate sector some of the key issues to be considered
                         include: (i) Capacity of the estate workers to manage the schemes, and alternatives in the event of
                         low capacity/interest; (ii) Roles of the different parties in O&M – the Board, the plantation owners,
                         the community, the PHDT and the Estate Workers Housing Cooperative Society (EWHCS).

                         Sanitation improvements would be included in all sub-sectors using appropriate models in line with
                         current government policy. In towns this will likely include the provision of district level septage
                         treatment plants and bowsers, in rural areas this will likely be pit latrines, and in the estates sub-
                         sector community toilets.

                         Component 2 - Technical Assistance for Sector Capacity Building and Sustainability ($10m
                         indicative).

                         The project will support a range of technical assistance for capacity building and to improve long
                         term sustainability of investments made by the Government. These will include:

                         National Program to develop a strategy to mitigate the aggravating effects of drinking water quality
                         on CKDu - The root cause of CKDu remains unclear but water supplies which are hard or fluoride
                         contaminated appear to exacerbate the disease. The TA would include: (i) preparation of a Water
                         Quality Mapping to map out the ground water quality assessments at the district levels nation-wide,
                         which will help to identify possible risk areas in relation to the spread of CKDu in the Island; and (ii)
                         preparation of a National Strategy to respond to CKDu threat; which include developing a risk rating

                         system (based on the water quality mapping) and assessing different technical and cost effective
                         approaches (e.g. Rain harvesting, bowers, RO).

                         Improving Sustainability of Rural and Estate Water Supply - This TA would address three key
                         elements:
                         o       Sustainability of rural water schemes to ensure that CBO managed schemes are kept
                         functional for their full economic life through a range of initiatives including: (a) administrative
                         backstopping to CBOs; (b) technical backstopping; and (c) a system to help the CBOs solve
                         problems on their own.
                         o       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Survey of CBOs/WUAs functionality, and preparation of
                         a data base and M&E system for same-time monitoring and reporting of CBOs functionality.
                         o       Sustainability of estate sector schemes. Designing an approach to ensure long term
                         sustainability in the estate schemes through appropriate financing and institutional arrangements.

                         Capacity Building for the NWSDB - The Board is now 35 years old and there is a need to confirm
                         whether the current structure is still relevant given changes in the sector. The latter include increasing
                         pressures to decentralize, to provide opportunities to staff, and to create a more entrepreneurial and
                         incentivized management/staff. Financial analyses will be undertaken to assess the long term
                         financial performance of the Board, institutional and regulatory aspects of the sector, and
                         identification of options to improve as needed.

                         TA Support to the Department of Community Water Supply - The newly established Department of
                         Community Water Supply can play a key role in the sustainability of RWS, and the project will
                         provide support to enhance the capacity of this Department and help with formulating an institutional
                         framework and operational strategy to sustain the RWSS investments.

                         Preparation of a Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Program – The project will be provide financial
                         and technical assistance for the preparation of a program to improve water supply and sanitation
                         across the island. This will allow GOSL to address the gaps and strategically invest in the sector
                         through a programmatic approach which can be financed by local or foreign funds.


                         Component 3 - Project Management Support. ($8m indicative)

                         This component will finance administration and management during implementation.

                         Component 4 - Contingency Emergency Response (US$ 0 million).

                         In case of an adverse natural event that causes a major disaster, the government may request the
                         Bank to re-allocate project funds to this component in support of emergency response and
                         reconstruction.

                         The Mullativu and Kilinochchi Districts have similar environmental conditions due to their location
                         within the Northern Province. The physical features of Mullaitivu District consist of flat land terrain,
                         generally sloping to the East and North. Mullaitivu has 70 Km of coastal belt and four key lagoons,
                         namely Kokkulai, Nayaru, Nanthikadal and Mathalan. Elevation varies from sea level to 36.5m as

                         newly established infrastructure, built post the ending of the conflict in 2009. The Kilinochchi
                         District is situated in the Northern part of Sri Lanka. It covers an extent of land area approximately
                         1237. 11 Km2 and inland water way of 44.30 Km2. The average population density is being 96
                         persons per Km2. The terrain in Kilinochchi is also flat with no major perennial rivers but a series of
                         irrigation tanks and medium tanks supply water to the local population. Climatic conditions in both
                         districts are dry and humid. The average annual rainfall in this region is 1325 mm and 75 % of the
                         rainfall receives during the period from September to December North-East monsoon. Temperatures
                         in the Districts range on average from 25°C to 30°C. Agriculture is currently sparse in both regions
                         but picking up as the newly resettled communities that were previously internally displaced establish

                         The Nuwara Eliya District (NED) is located in the central highlands of SriLanka of Central Province
                         and is located in the country’s highest Peneplain. The terrain is generally mountainous, with deep
                         valleys; it forms a complex of massifs, mountain ranges, plateaus and basins. The Southern border of
                         this peneplain runs about 50 miles from Adam's Peak (2,243m) which is on the Western side to
                         Namunukula (1,939m) of the Eastern side. From the middle of this Southern border and running

                         towards North is the High Plains that extends between Kirigalpotta (2407m) and Pidurutalagala
                         (2527m). It is near this Pidurutalagala mountain,that Nuwara Eliya town (1868m) is situated. The
                         district has a subtropical highland climate, with a mean annual temperature of 16 °C and is the main
                         area for tea productions. Numerous tea estates have been established and are operational along the
                         hilly terrains of the district.

                         The Badulla and Monaragala Districts have very different terrain even though they are both located
                         in the Uva Province. Badulla District covers a land area of approximately 2,861 Km² and has a
                         highland terrain with ample rainfall. Much of the mountainous terrain has been utilized for tea and
                         vegetable cultivation and the lower region where climatic conditions are drier and the terrain is flat,
                         for paddy cultivation. The mountainous terrain of the upper region is susceptible to earth slips and
                         landslides, especially during the rainy seasons. The Monaragala District has a similar terrain to the
                         lower regions of Badulla, where the land is flat and dry. It is the largest of the 25 districts of Sri
                         Lanka, with an area of 7,133 Km². The district is mainly made up of rubber, cocoa and sugar cane
                         plantations and paddy lands. The valley is mostly dry and rainfall is sparse, thus cultivation is linked
                         to the monsoonal seasons. The townships are located in the flat land and are fairly small settlements,
                         with the city of Monaragala being the main township. The Savanna like plains situated along the
                         Southern parts of Monaragala, bordering the Hambantota District, has been designated as part of the
                         Yala National Park.
                         The Kegalle District encompasses a land area of 1663 km2 of mountainous terrain of transitional
                         slopes between the high land and of the central hills. Elevations within the district as you start from
                         its periphery and move towards the central regions, are 50m to 1800m above sea level. The

                         mountainous terrain from the east meanders down to valleys in the western parts of the district,
                         where a number of rivers and streams are located. These include the Kaleni River, Ma Oya and
                         Rambukan Oya. Annual rainfall varies from 2,500 mm to 3,000 mm and temperature varies from
                         25.7 °C-30°C. Settlements are centered on rubber cultivation, which has stretched over most of the
                         area of the District, and minor export crops such as coffee, cocoa, pepper, clove and nutmeg.
                         Population densities in the rural regions are dispersed while there is high population density in the
                         major cities such as Kegalle, Mawanella and Ambepussa.

                         Situated in a Valley, the Ratnapura District (3,275 Km2) has a rich environment with numerous
                         streams and some of the islands main waterfalls are located in the wet zone of the island. The district
                         receives rainfall mainly from south-western monsoons from May to September. During the
                         remaining months of the year, there is also considerable precipitation due to convective rains. The
                         average temperature varies from 24 to 35 °C, and there are high humidity levels. Ratnapura is the
                         center of a long-established industry of precious stone mining including rubies, sapphires, and other
                         gems . Apart from gem mining, large plantations of tea and rubber surround the main settlements of
                         Ratnapura, Embilipitiya and Balangoda. Segments of the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the
                         Udawalawe National Park are also located in the South East of the District.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         A comprehensive policy and regulatory framework for the conservation of natural resources and
                         environmental management is in existence Sri Lanka. The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) is
                         the key regulatory body that is mandated by the National Environmental Act (NEA) to implement all
                         regulatory provisions outlined in its statutes. All development projects, that fall in to a set of
                         prescribed categories are required to conduct a comprehensive environmental screening and
                         mitigation planning process (EIA or IEE). These processes are largely consistent with the Bank’s
                         safeguard policy on Environmental Assessment. With over three decades of experience the CEA

                         demonstrates the technical expertise in evaluating environmental impacts of development projects.
                         However even with an enabling legal environment and an able CEA, field level enforcement of legal
                         instruments and subsequent monitoring of environmental management activities has been very low.
                         The Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MoWSD) will be the main implementation agency for
                         this project. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) under this ministry will be
                         the main counterpart for this project. The project will be built on the strength and expertise of the
                         NWSDB. In addition, local and provincial level agencies will take part in the implementation of this
                         project as per project design. Assessments of the financial and operational aspects of the involved
                         agencies will be carried out during project preparation.
                         The NWSDB has been working on bank funded sector projects since 2013 and thus have gained
                         adequate experiences in satisfactorily implementing safeguards under a project context. This is
                         certainly an advantage and provides a foundation which the project can build on further. However the
                         capacity of local and provincial level agencies will be assessed during project preparation. The
                         capacity of these institutions will have to be built via the NWSDB, drawing from the lessons learned
                         and experience, in order to enable them to fully implement safeguards at the field level.
