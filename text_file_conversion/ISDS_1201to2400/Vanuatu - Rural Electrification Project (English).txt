 2. Project Development Objective(s)
 The project dev~lopment 'objective (PDO) is to increase access to electricity services for rural
 households, aid posts and community halls located in dispersed off-grid areas.

 3. Project Description
 The project will have two components:
Component Oae: Elec~cation of off-grid households, aid posts and c~mmunlty baUs (US$ 6.2
m.Ullon). The Project will target 85 percent 9f the 20,470 dispersed off-grid households in Vanuatu,
which equates to approximately 17.soo households, and 230 aid posts and 2.000 not-for-prolit
cotnmunity ~alls. The Proje<,.ot wilJ subsidize the retail eost of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems by SO
percent. Aid posts serve the basic health serviees needs of the community and are
community-operated and managed. Communities and villages will also have access to subsidies to
purchase solar systems under this Project for community-operated and managed aid posts and
not-for-ptofit community halls. Initially. the Projeet will focus on solar PV systems of between 5 to 30
Watts peak capacity that are of "plug and play" type. installed easily by the co~er and require little
to no maintenance other- than replacing batteries. These systems can provide lighting and ·phone
charging capabilities, with some systems capable of supporting other uses such as radios and small
televisions. ''Plug and play" systems of higher capacity are not ruled out in the fu~e, provided they
meet the product registration criteria for this Projeet. ._The Project will not fund smaller systems such
as solar. lanterns; such systems were funded under the Lighting Vanuatu project. and the demand and
awaren~s for those systems is considered self-sustainable.             .·      ·

Component Two: Technical assistance and project management (US$ 1.6 mllllon). The Project
requires significant work on ensuring the integritY of the vendor.supply chain, and of the products that
are supplied to consumers/retailed, consmner awareness and training. collection and disposal of any
hazardous or toxic. materials, project management and ind~pendent verification to ensure the funds
allocated under this Project ~ effectively directed towards achieving the PDO of this Project The
            of
expectation the participation· of a nuinber of vendors, ~ n\unbet of different types of products with
different capabilities, the remote locations ·of oonsumers, the ·limited knowledge of the consume~ and
access to vendors. lack of a.specific residential addJ;ess or telephone or other fo~ contact details
make the above activities particularly challenging. This component addresses two key areas .of the
Project. the first focu~ing on design and the second on. implementation, with the following key
activities:

       (i) Vendor and product registration arrangements. communications and microfinance
       products. The following . activities will be financed to support the pre'p~ion . and
       implementatiOn of the investment "    activities under COMfX?Dent One: (i) establishment of
       vehdor registration arrangements; (ii) development of product regis~tion arrangements (for a
       product catalogue); (iii) development of-program and product awareness. safety and product
       care tra~ing material for communities, and end uSers; (iv) establishment of a grievance
       mechanism for end-user and communities; (v) support with the development of microfinance
       products to encotirage lending in rural areas; and (vi) development of legislation, regulations
       and/or Environmental Code of Practice (ECOP) for diSposal of lead-acid batteries for rural
       electrification products under the Project.

       (ii) Prqject manlljement and sypport. The following activities will be fmanced for effective
       implementation, monitoring and reporting under the Project (i) capacity building and
       implementation support to the Department of Energy (DoE) through technical experts and
       advisors; (ii) workshops and training for the DoE staff (and other Governmental departments.
       such as the MIPU) involved with off-grid electrification; (iii) execution of awareness
       programs to rural communities and consumers in Vanuatu; (iv) independent verifiCation of
       subsidy claims prior to payments; and (v) monitoring. evaluation and ~ual reviews of the
       Project.
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics r~levant1o the safeguard analysis
(if known)
The project is located in Vanuatu and includes remote communities in the outer islands that are not in
close proximity to the existing grid to consider grid extensions feasibJe, or clustered in one area to
consider micro- or mini-grid installations, for providing access to basic electricity services.

The PV systems intended for the households, aid posts and community halls, which will be subsided
by the Project, will be simple, portable and easily installed by the buyer: With this approach, on-site
provider installation in individual home~ ~d after sales maintenance will not be required.

    II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary ofKey Saf~guard Issues
    1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
    describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
    There are no significant and I or irreversible adverse environmental and social issues associated with
    the project. The use of renewable solar PV technology would result in net positive environmental
    impacts through replacement of kerosene and diesel currently used for lighting in rural areas of the
    country.

    The only potential environmental safeguard concern under the Project is improper disposal/recycl!ng
    of lead-acid or lead-gel batteries by the community. If not handled correctly or not properly disposed
    of or recycled, inappropriate battery disposal could lead to pollution of surrounding soils and water
    resources by lead, nickel, cadmium, etc. As a result, Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01 is
    triggered. An ECOP for battery disposal has been prepared and will be adopted, until such time the
    government develops the necessary legislative and compliance framework for disposal of solid wastes,
    in particular lead-acid and other batteries. The ECOP will provide guidance for the safe management
    of batteries used in the systems. Where these batteries are toxic and not suitable for land-fill (such as
    lead-acid batteries) clear perfonnance criteria will be established for the management of the batteries:
    Vendors participating in the Project will be required to coinply with the ECOP. Arrangements for the
    collection/storage/transport/disposal of used batteries are envisaged as criteria for vendor registration,
    in compliance with the ECOP, until alternative national systems are developed and are in place.

    Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10 has been triggered due to the presence of indigenous people (IPs) in
    the rural areas of the outer islands. However, since the overwhelming majority of the beneficiaries are
    IPs, the Project has integrated the elements of an Indigenous People's Plan (IPP) in the design of the
    Project, including consultations for broader community support of the PrOject, provision of culturally
    appropriate project · benefits in the installation of PV panels in households, and gender-related
    considerations (e.g., specific consultations with women's groups and uptake of project services by
    female-headed households). In addition, there is no land acquisition for this project since the solar
    power connections will take place within the existing confmes of households and community facilities.
    2. Describe any pote•tial indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities ia
    the project area:
    The project will encourage I finance the use of renewable solar energy tec~nology and therefore there
    are no irreversible or indirect and or long-tenn impacts anticipated in the project area. Solar PV panels
    for "plug and play" systems have a minimum life span of 10+ years and the technology for recycling
    PV panels is available.
    3. Describe any projed alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize advene
    impacts.
