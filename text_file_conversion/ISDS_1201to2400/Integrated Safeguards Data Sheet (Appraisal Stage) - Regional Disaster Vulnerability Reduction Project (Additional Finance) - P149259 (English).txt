2. Project Development Objective(s)
A. Original Project Development Objectives - Parent
The Program aims at measurably reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change
impacts in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The objective of the Project in Grenada is to
measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Grenada and in
the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The objective of the Project in Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in the Eastern Caribbean Sub-region. The achievement of
the Program Development Objectives of the Regional Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Program
(RDVRP) would be measured using the following key indicators: (a) Reduced risk of OECS
population to failure of public buildings and infrastructure due to natural hazards or climate
change impacts; and (b) Increased capacity of OECS Governments to identify and monitor
climate risk and impacts.
B. Current Project Development Objectives - Parent
C. Proposed Project Development Objectives - Additional Financing (AF)
3. Project Description
The proposed AF would scale up activities initiated under the RDVRP and contribute to institutional
capacity improvements that will be fundamental for transformative change in Grenada's long-term
climate resilience agenda, as endorsed by the PPCR Sub-Committee. Specifically, the AF would: (i)
ensure climate risk reduction outcomes for an important part of Grenada's population and economy,
through improved drainage and flood prevention infrastructure in selected urban areas; (ii) contribute
critical building blocks to the technical and institutional capacity to manage climate resilience of
forestry and water resource management departments.
The additional finance will also be used by the GoG to fill a financing in the parent project. During
the first three years of the project implementation additional technical studies were carried out to
ensure construction standards would be more resilient. These studies, pre-engineering assessments,
and some final designs, indicate that that the cost of building more resilient infrastructure in Grenada
is almost 20% more expensive than the original budget estimates that were largely based on existing
building practices at the time. The Government chose to continue with most of the projects planned
investments at the higher cost to improve its resilience, and to postpone St Johns River defense
construction since the budgeted cost of St Johns River flood mitigation works were $4.5 million,
similar to the approximate value of the total project financing gap. As a result, the St Johns River
sub-project will be re-appraised and advanced under this AF.
Component 1: Prevention and Adaptation Investments (Increase by US$5,200,000). The proposed
AF would permit the completion of priority investments for flood protection and improved drainage
in urban areas. These investments include: (a) pre-engineering studies and design for a flood
mitigation system in Morne Rouge area; (b) river training works for the St. Johns River flood
Page 2 of 9


﻿mitigation sub-project; (c) investments in fiber optic upgrades to assist agencies with participating in
a national data sharing platform (i.e. GeoNode, National hydromet network).
Component 2: Regional Platforms for Hazard and Risk Evaluation, and Applications for Improved
decision making (Increase by US$3,200,000). This component finances critical building blocks to
Grenada's technical and institutional capacity to manage climate resilience in forest and water
resource management departments, with additional applications for Ministry of Works, the National
Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) and the National Planning Office, which could contribute
to a transformative impact on Grenada's capacity to build climate resilience. Activities to be financed
include: high resolution topography and bathymetry models, high resolution forest cover mapping,
high resolution soils mapping, modernization of the national hydromet network, capacity building for
watershed analysis and modeling, and institutional strengthening and capacity building in forest
resources management. Developing/consolidating data resources and improving the analytical
capability of select institutions will provide a platform for informed risk reduction decisions in the
sectors prioritized under the SPCR, including water resource management, disaster prevention and
emergency planning, and forestry.
Component 4: Project Management and Implementation Support (Increase by US$400,000). The AF
would support strengthening the institutional capacity for project management and coordination of
SPCR implementation. This will be accomplished through the provision of technical advisory
services, training, operating costs and acquisition of goods. In particular, this Component will
support: (i) strengthening capacity of the PCU and relevant government agencies in project
management, implementation support, and coordination with other climate resilience investments in
Grenada; (ii) strengthening capacity of the PCU and relevant government agencies to monitor the
delivery of the SPCR (including climate resilience activities supported by other development
partners), monitor and report on the PPCR core indicators, and generate knowledge for the other
participating countries.
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Project works are expected at Grand Etang Nursery, on the St. Johns River, and at various
hydrometerological stations on the island. The Nursery at Grand Etang is within a protected area, so
works will be restricted to the existing nursery facility where upgrades are planned. St. Johns River
is an urbanized watershed, and most hydrometeorological stations will use existing footprints;
however, screening mechanisms are included in the EMF in the event that sensitive areas or complex
conditions are present, to require additional study, assessment, and mitigation measure development
as necessary and appropriate. Land acquisition will be required for the St. John's subproject and
possibly for the Mourne Rouge drainage and hydro-meteorological infrastructure projects, depending
on final designs and project locations respectively.

6. Safeguard Policies        Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment     Yes         An Environmental Management Framework (EMF)
OP/BP 4.01                               has been prepared based on the updated project
portfolio for Grenada. The EMF has updated and
Page 3 of 9


﻿expanded the previously prepared Environmental
Assessment (EA) by providing screening methods
and procedures for the application of Bank
safeguards, including guidance on the scope of
studies necessary to complete for each subproject,
criteria for triggering additional studies in the case of
complex or significant activities, and a generic
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for use in
simple situations where activities need no additional
assessment. The studies and management plans
related to each subproject should be completed prior
to the start of any works on a particular subproject.
It is likely that the majority of works will be
relatively minor in nature and involve simple civil
works where the environmental impacts are limited
to the construction phase, requiring only the
application of a standardized generic EMP.
However, any exceptions will be identified during
screening in the EMF, and subject to additional
assessment work.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04   Yes          During project preparation potentially sensitive areas
were identified in areas near the Grand Etang
Nursery (a protected area), where facility upgrades
are planned; and, at Morne Rouge (a sensitive coastal
area) where coastal and marine studies are planned.
This safeguard has also been triggered as a
precaution due to potential project activities which
may occur in forest areas, river valleys, coastline
and/or marine areas. In the case of future undefined
works, this policy along with all other Bank
safeguards will be included in the screening
procedures provided under the project EMF.
Forests OP/BP 4.36            No           This policy has not been triggered because funded
actions would not directly address change in
harvesting or management of forest resources, but
instead are focused on technical assistance works (e.
g. forest cover classification and inventory for
watershed management support). Measures to
address incidental tree harvesting are covered in the
EMF.
Pest Management OP 4.09       Yes          There are no projects to directly fund purchase of
pesticides, however, the Additional Financing
includes an upgrade to a nursery facility, where
provisions for storage of fertilizers and other
chemicals (pesticides, fungicides, herbicides) will be
built into the design as good practice. The policy is
therefore triggered as a precaution, and guidelines for
Page 4 of 9


﻿a Pest Management Plan are included in the EMF in
the event they are needed if or when such materials
are actually purchased. Other, incidental pesticide
use from building treatments or vector control will be
managed by including appropriate procedures in the
generic standardized EMP for inclusion into
contracts.
Physical Cultural Resources  Yes         While no works have been identifies in sensitive
OP/BP 4.11                               areas, this safeguard is triggered as there is the small
likelihood for encountering sites of cultural historical
significance, particularly in the case of new
construction. In the case of small works procedures
for chance find will be provided together with
appropriate small works contract clauses.
Community input into final design of historically
valuable works will be required in the EMF.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP     No          The Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP 4.10) is not
4.10                                     triggered by this project. Indigenous Peoples are not
present in and nor do they have collective attachment
to the project areas.
Involuntary Resettlement OP/  Yes        A small amount of land acquisition will be necessary
BP 4.12                                  along the St. John's River involving state land,
currently occupied by individuals and small informal
businesses, as well as the private property of a
commercial enterprise. Additional land may also be
required for the Mourne Rouge drainage and Hydro-
meteorological infrastructure projects, depending on
final designs and project locations respectively. Land
acquisition is equired under the additional financing,
specifically for Saint John's River. Additional land
may be required for the Moume Rouge drainage and
Hydro-meteorological infrastructure projects
depending on final designs and project locations
respectively. The Involuntary Resettlement
Safeguard (OP 4.12) was triggered by the parent
project and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)
developed and disclosed at appraisal. The RPF
remains valid and will has been updated, to reflect
AF subprojects, and disclosed in draft prior to AF
appraisal.

﻿II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Social Safeguards. Land acquisition will be required for the project, specifically the Saint John's
River subproject and potentially for Mourne Rouge (depending on design) and the Hydro-
Meterological infrastructure (depending on location). The impacts expected will be largely
positive for the affected communities and negative impacts associated with asset loss will be
mitigated and monitored. No large scale social safeguard impacts are anticipated.
Environmental Safeguards. The main safeguards issues relate to potential impact on natural habitat
from works at the Grand Etang Nursery, which lies within a protected area. Potential impacts on
natural habitat will be minimized through measures included in the EMF, and will be minimal
because works will be restricted to the existing facility. Pest Management will be addressed
through good building design and through guidelines in the EMF for a Pest Management Plan
should it be necessary. For works at St. Johns River a management plan has already been prepared
and has been updated and included in the EMF which has been prepared for the project.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:
The benefits of the project over the long term will include improved reforestation capacity, due to
the improvements at the Nursery facility; decreased flooding on the St. John's River corridor; and
improved environmental conditions at the Grande Anse area due to more informed coastal
management. The indirect and long term effects of the project will be largely positive.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
The project will include alternative evaluation in the terms of reference for the Morne Rouge
studies, as part of the engineering and design efforts, to avoid or minimize potential adverse
impacts. For the St. John's river sub-project consultations with local residents on design led to
slight design alternations and a minimization of adverse impacts.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Social Safeguards. The Borrower's capacity to address impacts under OP 4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement) has been built throughimplementing the policy under the parent project. In addition,
a regional capacity building safeguards workshop organized in May 2014 includedrepresentatives
directly responsible for land acquisition in Grenada.
Environmental Safeguards. An Environmental Assessment (EA) conducted in 2010 had guided
the parent project, familiarizing the PCU with safeguards instruments. A draft EMF was prepared
for the Additional Financing works by updating the EA with the new project activities and by
including robust screening mechanisms for the PCU to follow throughout implementation. The
PCU will require the assistance of a Consultant to assist with EMF implementation and other tasks
as required, for which Terms of Reference have been developed. Currently the PCU has staff with
relevant experience in engineering and construction oversight, who can adequately supervise
safeguards issues until the Consultant is brought on board.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

﻿Direct project beneficiaries will be approximately 200 people who currently live in housing with
significant flood risk with many more people in the local community suffering secondary effects
of flooding. An estimated 40-50 residential buildings, shops and commercial properties line the
River Road along the Project site, all of which are impacted by water during a flood event. Three
(3) school facilities where more than 900 school children are enrolled are located on the active
floodplain with no formal warning of flood events. During more major events floodwaters pose a
flood risk to the Power Station and GRENLEC which produces electricity for Grenada. Due to the
predicated effects of climate change and increasing flood risk from sea level rise and more
significant river flooding, more than 200 properties could be at risk and both direct (property) and
indirect damages will be greater due to property and infrastructure flooding as well as major
disruption to the local community, businesses and traffic.
Consultations. Regular consultations have been organized, by the PCU Social Development
Specialist with the community impacted by the Saint John's river sub-project. Consultations will
continue during implementation and have involved local elected officials and included the project
engineer to explain proposed designs and address community concerns. The project level RPF for
the AF will be updated and re-disclosed prior to appraisal along with the EMF.
