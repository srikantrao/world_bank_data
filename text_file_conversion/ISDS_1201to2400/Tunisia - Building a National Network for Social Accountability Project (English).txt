2. Project Objectives:

The development objective of this proposal is to contribute to improving the quality of service
delivery and to strengthen citizens' capacities to engage in evidence-based, collaborative
problem-solving through the creation of a participatory platfmm for monitoring services in two
pilot sectors, health and education.

3. Project Description:

Component 1: Promoting citizen monitoring of hospital performance.
The key objective of this component is to improve information flows about hospital performance
by leveraging participatory monitoring and evaluation tools. The intermediate outputs of this
component are: (1) The Hospital Perfmmance Score Card (HPSC) tool - a combination of
techniques of Patient Report Card, based on patient satisfaction questionnaire, and social audit of
hospitals that covers resources utilization, generated outputs, quality and access indicators -
developed; (2) HPSC piloted and then replicated at country level; (3) HPSC findings
disseminated on www.spitale.md website; (4) The Hospital Efficiency Evaluation Framework
(HEEF) - a pmiicular type of social audit based on statistics compilation and designed for
evaluation of resources' allocation and results of hospital activity - developed; (6) Report
developed, distributed and feedback collected; (7) HEEF findings disseminated on
www.spitale.md website; (8) institutionalization of both processes.


Component 2: Strengthening performance based incentive program in family medicine
through social audits of primary healthcare institution.
The key objective of this component is to strengthen performance based incentive program by
promoting Primary Healthcare Performance-based Incentives Audits (PHCPIA) that would help
the National Health Insurance Fund and the Ministry of Health verify the validity of perfonnance
indicators supplied by service providers. The intermediate outputs of this component are: (I)
PHCPIA tool - a social audit teclmique based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of PHC
institutions activity in the context of performance-based incentive program - developed; (2)
PHCPIA rolled out in targeted sample; (3) Report developed, distributed and feedback collected;
(4) Dissemination of results using transparency website, publication of reports and public
presentations; (5) follow up and institutionalization.

Component 3: Creating an enabling environment for informed public dialogue in health.
Activities included in this component are geared towards creating the enabling environment for
effective public pmiicipation including complementing existing evaluation processes, improving
infonnation flows and promoting opportunities for improve public dialogue. The intermediate
outputs of this component are: (I) Development of tools aimed at improving transparency of
information in health; (2) Implementation of Public Opinion Polls on health services; (5)
Organization of relevant policy dialogues on health reforms impact and sustainability.

Component 4: Facilitate Knowledge and Learning to enhance effectiveness of social
accountability interventions in Moldova and around the world and project management.
The objective of this component is to ensure that mechanisms for leaJUing and sharing are
developed both to support social accountability practitioners in Moldova as well as ensure that
lessons learned from the implementation of social accountability mechanisms are taken into
account to deepen knowledge base on the effectiveness of such interventions. This will include
inter alia:

   (a) Build/develop sustainable information-communication tools based on ex1stmg and
       popular tools to serve as a platform for disseminating and using health systems' data and
       project results.
   (b) Promote and monitor that project results, achieved on social accountability tools, are
       effectively used by MOH, NHIC and other governmental institutions to complement
       formal M&E and to inform about policy process.
   (c) Conduct a series of capacity building activities with local CSOs, local public authorities,
       media institutions, etc. for promotion of social accountability in healthcare.
   (d) Network with other GPSA grantees.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential hirge scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project will not Jinance any physical activities, no risks related to environmental or social
safeguards policies are anticipated during implementation of project activities.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
n/a

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
n/a

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment ofbonower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:
This project is not expected to trigger any safeguards policies as the project screening identified
minimal environmental or social risks related to project activities. Hence the project is assigned
the Environmental Category C, requiring no turther environmental and social assessment.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
Direct beneficiaries include: (I) service users and service providers (professional staff; etc.) in a
sample of health (hospitals and health clinics) and education (primary and secondary schools)
facilities. Project direct beneficiaries will be reached out to provide their feedback on the quality
of service delivery at the facility level through various mechanisms, such as SMS (service


                                                 3
messaging system), participatory meetings with service users and service providers, and service
quality surveys (e.g. citizen report cards); (2) UGTT local coordinators and CSOs based in the
sample of selected municipalities cmTesponding to the targeted health and education facilities.
Local CSOs will be selected competitively to administer a citizen survey or citizen report card
tool with service users; both UGTT local coordinators and selected CSOs will take part in the
Project's capacity-building program which will provide them with the skills needed to perform
their intennediary and facilitation roles at the local level; (3) public sector institutions, including
but not limited to the Ministries of Health, Education and Finance and their respective Regional
Delegations, the Presidency of the Government of Tunisia, Public Audit Court and the National
Assembly will also benefit insofar as they are expected to use the information generated by the
Project to complement information available through their management inforn1ation (MIS) and
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems. It is expected that the feedback generated as a result
of the Project will help them to take corrective measures and introduce improvements to the
service delivery chain and to the budget allocation and monitoring processes.

Project's indirect beneficiaries ure: (I) CSOs at the regional and national level, private sector
associations, media and other stakeholders that will be convened by the Project to take part in a
multi-stakeholder dialogue process around the feedback generated through the social
accountability tools. These organizations will be convened as part of the Project's effo11s to
create a national network tor social accountability; and (2) all the Tunisians that may benefit
ti·om the information and knowledge generated by the Project, outside the targeted facilities and
at the national level. The Project expects to design and implement a communications strategy
that will disseminate activities and thus reach out to Tunisian citizens and other key audiences.
