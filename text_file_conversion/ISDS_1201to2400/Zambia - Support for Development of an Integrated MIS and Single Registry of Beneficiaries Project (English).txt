2. Project Objectives:

The development objective is to support Government of Zambia to strengthen its social
protection system by building management information systems and a single registry of
beneficiaries to allow robust identification of beneficiaries

3. Project Description:

Support for Development of MIS and Single Registry

Sub-component 1.1: Design and development of a Single Registry (SR).
This sub-component aims to develop a Single Registry for the key social safety net programs in
Zambia. The SR will be hosted in the Ministry of Community Development Mother and Child
Health (MCDMCH), which implements the larger programs in terms of number of beneficiaries,
including the Social Cash Transfer Scheme (SCTS), the Public Welfare Assistance Scheme
(PWAS), the Food Security Pack (FSP) and the Women Empowerment Fund (WEF). The key
functionality of the SR is the inclusion of more robust controls on eligibility determination and
enrollment of beneficiaries in individual programs and on periodic updating of information on
beneficiaries to ensure they remain eligible. Another functionality is to facilitate rapid
identification of beneficiaries for programs that are scaling up or trying to create synergies with
complementary interventions to enhance their impact. It should also be able to produce key
monitoring reports required for decision and management. The Registry will initially link the
individual program MISs in MCDMCH. The SR shall also have the functionality to link to other
databases of beneficiaries outside the MCDMCH as well with the National Population Registry
when these data bases become automated. The key activities that will be supported under this sub-
component, include among others: (i) Diagnostic study to identify the information needs of various
stakeholders and develop the business specifications and functionalities of SR; (ii) Review of
targeting procedures and forms for individual programs to ensure that core household information
is collected in a harmonized way by individual programs to allow cross checks against each other
via the SR; (iii) Workshops for consultations with various stakeholders to agree on key design for
the registry; (iv) Consultancy for development, testing, and installation of the SR; and (v)
Acquisition ofiCT equipment (server, workstations, connectivity devices).

Sub-Component 1.2: Development and integration of individual program MISs.

This component will aim to develop an informatics platform to support key business processes for
all key safety net programs in the MCDMCH. Currently MCDMCH has only one program (SCTS)
using a fllllctional MIS to support key process including enrollment of beneficiaries, preparation of
benefit payroll, and change management. The key activities that will be supported tn1der this
component include, among others: (i) System assessment to take stock of existing information
systems and databases for each of the programs (this will be done in conjunction with diagnostic
study for the SR); (ii) Updating of manual of operations and guidelines for each of the programs to
ensure the procedures and information requirements are clearly defined and reflecting current
practices; (iii) Consultancy to develop an integrated MIS for the key programs in MCDMCH
including WE, PWAS, FSP to include user guide and training materials; and (vv) ICT equipment
(server, work stations, connectivity devices)

Sub-Component 1.3: Capacity Building for management, use and maintenance of MIS and
Single registry

Recognizing the importance of designing and administering complex informatics systems, this
sub-component will provide TA for capacity building in the MCDMCH. Key activities to be
supported under this component include, among others: (i) Training of staff in the use, trouble
shooting and maintenance of MIS and SR, depending on the roles at each level; (ii) Printing of
user guides and manuals for staff at each level; (iii) Provision of ICT equipment; (iv) Exchange
visits to learn from experience of one or two cotllltries with good SR and MIS ; and (iv)
Strengthening Procurement and FM capacity in MCDMC to ensure proper accountability for RSR
limds.
