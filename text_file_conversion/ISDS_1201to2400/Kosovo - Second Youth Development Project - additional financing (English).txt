2. Project Objectives: The project development objective is to: (i) promote social cohesion
though inter-ethnic collaboration among youth, especially from marginalized and vulnerable
groups; and (ii) improve economic opportunities for young people and sustainable access to
youth services in Kosovo. The objective remains unchanged for the additional financing.

3. Project Description:

Proposed Additional Financing components:
The Additional Financing significantly expands the scale of the original second component,
while integrating additional activities in the overall project design. The team also suggests
drafting the grant agreement around three key and mutually re-enforcing components as follows:

Component 1 - Technical Assistance for the development of the Youth Employment Strategy
The proposed project will ensure a solid analytical basis for successful youth employability
and integration of marginalized groups by providing carefully targeted interventions to

                                                1
increase youth employment opportunities in Kosovo. This is proposed through a technical
assistance component in support of the development of the Youth Employment Strategy that is to
be integrated in the recently developed Kosovo Youth Development Strategy and Action Plan.
More specifically, this component would provide support for inter-ministerial collaboration in
the area of youth development and will focus on: (i) identifying labor gaps and employment
opportunities for underserved and disadvantaged groups and minorities in Kosovo; and (ii)
identifying niche and growth industries in Kosovo for youth employment.

Component 2 - Youth Business Development and social integration support
The additional grant will place greatest emphasis on scaling up interventions under the
youth business development and social integration support component of KYDP2. This
component centers around 5 key interventions: (i) Vocational and Educational Training; (ii)
Entrepreneurship Training for Young Individuals; (iii) Equipment and Tool Grants; (iv) Business
Start- up Grants; and (v) Individualized Mentoring and Apprenticeship. Through the proposed
additional grant, this component will provide skills and business development training, and
business investment and community investment grants and support services with emphasis on
disadvantaged groups and minorities in Kosovo. The component will equip youth centers
supported by KYDP to serve as regional business incubator facilities, social entrepreneurship
networks, and providers of training, mentoring and business counseling. Finally, it would
conduct a public awareness campaign, bringing local NGOs, role models and peer-to –peer
learning events.
Component 3 - Support for results-based project management and evidence based decision-
making
A third component would provide technical assistance to the project implementation unit
to utilize the Project Management and Information System (PMIS) piloted under KYDP to
provide strong results (M&E) based management of the project. This will ensure
transparency and evidence-based decision making and serve as a resource for youth, providing
valuable information and ICT-enabled support. The component will also provide project
management support and capacity–building trainings for key Ministry of Culture, Youth, and
Sport and PIU staff.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project will continue to provide economic opportunities for disadvantaged youth of all
ethnic backgrounds, with increased emphasis on conflict-affected, vulnerable and minority
populations in Northern Kosovo. Emphasis will be placed on conflict-affected vulnerable,
minority and marginalized groups in Northern Kosovo. By facilitating increased employment
opportunities for young people in Northern Kosovo, the project is expected to support the
lagging region to keep pace with the remainder of the country. Support to this volatile region is
expected to contribute to peacebuilding and greater stability in Kosovo as a whole.

6. Safeguard Policies                      Triggered?           Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01               No    The project is not expected to have
                                                        significant, complex or irreversible
                                                        adverse environmental impacts. No
                                                        safeguards are being triggered, and the
                                                        environmental     category for      the
                                                        proposed project is C. No civil works
                                                        will be undertaken under the project
                                                        and therefore the environmental or
                                                        resettlement risks are expected to be
                                                        negligible.   However, as an added
                                                        precaution, the MFI will be expected to
                                                        use an environmental and social
                                                        screening check-list for evaluation of
                                                        micro grants to screen out any
                                                        potentially non-conforming activities.
                                                        The EMP checklist will be integrated in

                                                        activities which could lead to land
                                                        acquisition or resettlement. The project
                                                        will also use social screening check-list,
                                                        integrated in the OM, for all youth
                                                        grants envisioned under this project.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management:
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project is a Category C project, and is not expected to trigger any social or environmental
safeguards. The nature of the proposed expanded and scaled-up activities does not involve

                                              3
undertaking civil works and therefore environmental or resettlement risks are expected to be
negligible. However, as an added precaution, as with KYDP2, the proposed project will use an
environmental and social screening check-list to screen out any potentially non-conforming
activities as elaborated in the Operational Manual.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The long term potential impacts are anticipated to be positive since the Additional Financing will
promote social cohesion and peacebuilding by facilitating inter-ethnic collaboration among
youth, and by improving the economic opportunities of young people in Kosovo.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:
n.a.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:
The Department of Youth under the Ministry of Culture Youth and Sport will continue to serve
as the project implementing agency (PIU). The proposed PIU has considerable experience in
implementing Bank projects having implemented both KYDP and KYDP2. The PIU is well
versed in and has a track record of satisfactory performance in adhering to Bank fiduciary
principles and procedures.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
