2. Project Objectives:
The main development objective of this project is to improve and sustain household income of
the vulnerable poor through provision of business management support services to the existing
and new Community Interest Groups (CIGs) in the four pilot districts (Kitgum, Gulu, Nebbi, and
Soroti).

3. Project Description:
The Northern Uganda Business Support Program will pilot a participatory approach designed to
provide business management skills and follow-up business advisory services to the Community
Interest Groups (CIGs) for sustainability of their income generation activities in the districts of
Gulu, Kitgum, Nebbi and Soroti. Therefore, business management skills training and follow-up
business management advisory services will be provided to improve their income generation
activities through improving productivity and quality of their products or services and
collaborative marketing efforts. After formulating the business plan, monthly follow-up business
advisory services will be provided for maximum of one year. The selection of the pilot districts


                                                1
is based on poverty map of the Northern Uganda, the choice of a wide range of income
generation activities and accountability status of NUSAF2 disbursed funds by the districts.




Details on project components are provided below:

Component 1: Providing business training, small grants and follow-up business advisory
             services to CIGs (US$2,271,000)

This component will support the formation, training, provision of small grant and business
follow-up services to 240 new CIGs. It will also provide training and business follow-up services
to existing 120 CIGS. The existing CIGs will not receive small grants because they must have
already received similar grants from NUSAF 2 project. The new CIGs will be formed by
individuals from poor households (10 to 15 individuals per CIG) following the NUSAF 2
participatory process. The rationale for the formation of new CIGs stems from the fact that the
majority (over 85%) of the existing CIGs are focused on traditional based activities for income
generation, such as cattle and goat rearing, which take a relatively long time to generate income.
It is envisaged that the new CIGs will be guided during the enterprise identification process to
focus on value addition and services based activities which have potential to generate higher
income in a relatively short time. This will also help to widen the choice of income generation
activities by the poor communities.

This component will have five activities: (i) Formation of new CIGs and identification of
possible income generation activities focusing on value addition or service activities based on
local market assessment; (ii) providing business management training both to new and existing
CIGs and assisting them to produce business plans; (iii) providing small grants to new CIGs for
starting their income generating activities; (iv) establishing mentor support system; and (v)
providing business advisory services. The details of the activities are presented below.

Component 2: Program Management and Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation, and
            Knowledge Dissemination (US$586,000)

This component will finance three activities: (i) Program management and administration; (ii)
Monitoring and Evaluation; and (iii) Knowledge dissemination. In order to ensure good program
management, and governance and accountability, including financial management within the
central program implementation office, the program implementing districts and the associated
partners, this component will provide financing for basic grant administration and monitoring
and evaluation. It will also help ensure that lessons from the work are properly shared through a
knowledge dissemination sub-component.


4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:




                                                2
The NUBUSP will provide support to the vulnerable poor, who are located in communities of
four districts in the Northern and Eastern Regions: (i) Kitgum District; (ii); Gulu District; (iii)
Nebbi District; and (iv) Soroti District.

By its nature the project is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental and social
impacts and therefore given EA category B partial. With specific reference to Component 2
involving provision of small grants to new CIGs, the sub projects to be supported for value
addition may generate minimal impacts, which can be addressed by use of the existing
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) used in the NUSAF2 sub-projects (P111633). This project will follow the existing model
used in NUSAF2 project for administering sub grants. Therefore, the ESMF and RPF for
NUSAF2 project will be used to address any environmental and social impacts that may be
associated with NUBUSP. The framework approach has been recommended for use because the
exact project activities that may be supported under components 1 will be selected during
implementation. The ESMF provides a screening process for sub-projects so as to enable local
government staff to identify potential environmental and social impacts of sub-projects and to
address them by incorporating the relevant mitigation measures into the designs of the sub-
projects. The RPF on the other hand provide guidance on how to handle any arising
compensation and social issues. Enterprise based Training will be provided to CIGs when they
are completing the environment section of their application forms for the grant by the District
Environment Officer and Community Development Officer, or by hired service providers.

6. Safeguard Policies     Triggered Explanation (Optional)
Environmental                Yes    The proposed project is focused on improvement of
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)             value addition and service delivery in relation to the
                                    ongoing NUSAF2 World Bank funded project. By its
                                    nature the project is likely to have minimal or no adverse
                                    impacts and therefore given EA category B. Under
                                    component 1 the project is envisaged to support income
                                    generating activities, and depending on their nature and
                                    scale, the activities may have limited and localized
                                    environmental and social impacts that need to be
                                    identified and mitigated. The existing Environment and
                                    Social Management Framework (ESMF), which is
                                    applied to NUSAF2 (P111633) Project will be used. The
                                    NUSAF2 ESMF is used since it provides the guidelines
                                    that GoU is currently using for sub-projects involving
                                    districts, local government and villages in Northern
                                    Uganda including among others Kitgum, Gulu, Nebbi
                                    and Soroti Districts. Where necessary, ESMPs shall be
                                    developed during implementation to guide specific
                                    project activities under component 1.

                                    negatively affect any forest ecosystem.
Pest Management (OP       Yes        Pest Management has been triggered because there is
4.09)                               likely to be small scale use of pesticides that may be
                                    applied for veterinary care of animals under component 2
                                    Business Support for Income Generation activities. The
                                    NUSAF 2 ESMF adopted to use in this project has
                                    guidance on the use and management of pesticides that
                                    shall be applied.
Physical Cultural         No        The project activities shall not be undertaken in areas

                                    that require involuntary resettlement. However, in case of
                                    any involuntary resettlement issues, the RPF for NUSAF
                                    2 shall be applied since NUBUSP is meant to augment it.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The project is to fund income generation activities such as poultry keeping, piggery, tree nursery,
juice packing (tamarind, pineapple, passion fruits), honey making, packaging rice, groundnuts
paste, vegetables gardening (tomato, onion, cabbage, eggplant, green gram, cowpea, beans),
sesame oil processing (simsim), bakery, fruit processing (sun dry), milk processing (Bongo),
poultry with local chicken (Akokorei), aquaculture, smoke fish, maize flour, Chapati (made of
cassava flour), mushroom gardening, salon, tailoring, etc..

The project is largely small scale and is likely to have minimal environmental and social impact.
It is anticipated that juice packing, groundnuts paste, sesame oil processing, fruit processing will
lead to the discharge of small amounts of waste into environment. Most of the waste/remains
associated with the various food processes, can be recycled or re-used, especially for animal
feeds and fertilizers. However, it can be said that the negative environmental impacts anticipated
from the project within the ESMF is minimal and will be managed accordingly.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
None anticipated

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:
Not relevant.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

 NUSAF2 has already prepared ESMF and RPF, which were disclosed and will be used for the
JSDF/NUBUSP Project. NUSAF2 is already implementing a similar/same type of project and is
quite familiar with safeguard policy issues and mitigation plans. NUSAF2 ESMF outlines the
principles, the institutional arrangements and identifies the potential negative environmental
impacts. The ESMF also include management plans for addressing the potential negative
impacts, which have been classified as minimal and reversible. There is also capacity building
arrangements for relevant staff of the project team and implementing entities to ensure full
comprehension prior to and during project implementation. NUSAF2 prepared ESMF since the
specific locations of activities that would have such impacts were not known at the time of
appraisal. The NUSAF2 ESMF and RPF will be disclosed both in-country and Infoshop for
application to Northern Uganda Business program. During implementation when these sites have

                                                 5
been identified and agreed on, screening will be undertaken and follow up management plans
will be elaborated using the outlined one in the ESMF to address specific issues. The
implementation of the ESMF requirements shall be led by the Environmental Specialist, assisted
by the respective District Environment and Community Development Officers, all of whom are
in place, have been trained and will be actively involved.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
 The key stakeholders are Community Interest Groups (CIGs) and NGOs operating in these
areas, the respective District and Lower Local Governments, the Private Sector, etc. The
NUSAF2 has identified these key stakeholders and established the mechanism for consultation
and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
