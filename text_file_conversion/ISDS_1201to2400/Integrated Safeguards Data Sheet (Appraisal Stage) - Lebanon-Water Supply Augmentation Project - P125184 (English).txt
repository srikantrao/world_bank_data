                           The project development objective is to increase the volume of water available to the Greater Beirut
                           and Mount Lebanon area.

                         Despite its relatively abundant water resources, Lebanon is significantly water-stressed. Groundwater
                         is over-extracted by 200 million cubic meters (MCM) per year and water supply reaches as low as
                         three hours per day in the summer season across many regions. Lebanon further only stores six

                         percent of its total water resources, rendering it the country with the lowest dam capacity across the
                         Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Water deficits across Lebanon are currently estimated
                         at 353 million cubic meters (MCM) and are expected to increase to 425 MCM by 2035. Following a
                         major revival of the Ministry of Energy and Water (MOEW) in 2006, and recognizing the need for
                         urgent action, Government developed the National Water Sector Strategy (NWSS), with the
                         objective of developing a comprehensive, multi-sectoral plan for improved water resources
                         management across Lebanon. Government-led NWSS was developed by a team of qualified local
                         experts, widely consulted and disseminated. The NWSS was approved by the Council of Ministers in
                         2012 and outlined national priorities in water sector investment projects, including large dams,
                         irrigation and inter-basin transfers. Several key components of the NWSS are under implementation
                         including investment in transformational infrastructure , development of a national water and
                         sanitation tariff, and the enactment of a water sector public private partnership law.

                         As one of the most densely populated regions in Lebanon, the Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon
                         (GBML) is directly and significantly impacted by existing water deficits. During the six month
                         summer period spanning May – October, the GBML region enters into water crisis, wherein the
                         majority of its 2.2 million residents receive less than three hours of potable water per day on average,
                         and rely instead on over 20,000 private wells to supply their water needs. This in turn puts significant
                         pressure on the coastal aquifer underlying Beirut, which, as a result, is exploited at unsustainable
                         levels. The Beirut Mount Lebanon Water Establishment (BMLWE) is the Regional Water
                         Establishment (RWE) responsible for provision of water services in the GBML area. Established
                         through Law 221, the BMLWE operates as a commercial entity, and is headed by a Director General
                         who also chairs the Board. The BMLWE’s service areas are divided into three principal categories
                         namely: (i) the northern GBML; (ii) the southern GBML and (iii) Administrative Beirut. Southern
                         GBML comprises four distribution zones (Zones A, B, C and D), housing an estimated 1.6 million

                         people. During the six-month winter period spanning November - April, BMLWE’s springs and
                         wells are recharged by snowmelt, precipitation and spring river discharge. During the six month
                         summer period, as the water levels in the springs and wells sharply decrease, the BMLWE is only
                         able to provide an average of three hours of water per day to its users.

                         BMLWE embarked on an extensive program of investment, as agreed in the NWSS, to: (i) expand its
                         water storage capacity; (ii) reduce the estimated 40% non-revenue water (NRW) by rehabilitating/
                         replacing distribution networks; (iii) introduce volumetric metering; and (iv) modernize utility
                         operations. Further actions to improve the efficiency and sustainability of water services include the
                         piloting of metering, and implementation of a sanitation tariff. Despite these demand management
                         efforts, significant additional water supply is needed. The current water supply deficit is estimated at
                         90 MCM per year, and is expected to reach 180 MCM/year by 2035. As a result, BMLWE is in the
                         midst of a significant investment phase which includes the completed Shabrouh Dam and the Bank-
                         financed Greater Beirut Water Supply Project . However, these investments will only add 60 MCM
                         of water supply, leaving a significant short term and long term deficit which requires additional
                         investments.

                         Following a series of public consultations and detailed technical analysis, an Analysis of
                         Alternatives, commissioned by the Government, commended that GBML’s long-term water
                         sustainability depends on the implementation of a program of coordinated investments and reforms


                                                                      Page 2 of 14
                         involving non-dam activities, as well as development of new water sources through a phased
                         program of dam construction. Construction of a dam at Bisri was recommended as the immediate
                         next step as part of a program for water supply augmentation to the GBML. Bisri was assessed to

                         offer: (i) significantly larger volume of stored water; (ii) direct impact on water users in the southern
                         regions of the GBML, where a large majority of GBML poor reside; (iii) relatively lower
                         environmental and social impacts; and (iv) advanced level of detailed design which would enhance
                         the rate of outcome delivery.

                         The proposed project thus comprises:

                         pipeline will convey stored water to connect to the tunnel currently under construction under the
                         GBWSP. A second larger hydropower plant (12 MW) will be installed at the existing Awali
                         hydropower plant.

                         The upper catchment is characterized by the steep slopes and cliffs, with small traditional villages of
                         red-tiled houses perched on hilltops and cliff edges. In the lower catchment downstream of Bisri
                         Village, Bisri river runs through a narrow steep sided valley in which agriculture is largely limited to
                         tree-crops grown on terraced slopes. Despite the presence of extensive agriculture, the Bisri Valley
                         upstream of the dam site is very sparsely populated, with no significant settlements or communities
                         beyond family groups. The majority of land owners are absentee landlords, and most families present
                         are tenant farmers or seasonal laborers. Throughout the reservoir area there is a total absence of non-
                         agricultural commercial or industrial activities

                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              CDR has prepared an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) that describes
                              environmental and social project impacts and mitigation measures during construction and
                              operation.

                         clay, are expected to be taken from temporary borrow areas within and adjacent to the area of
                         inundation thereby significantly reducing reliance on quarries. Additional materials that may

                         become required will be sourced from commercial quarries and will follow the environmental
                         mitigation procedures of the Ministry of Environment as described in the Annex to the ESIA,
                         disclosed on July 21, 2014, for quarry management. Dam construction will also entail the
                         dismantling and relocation of the Mar Moussa church, located near the dam construction site. The
                         dam construction contractor will have responsibility for traffic, waste, labor force, environmental
                         monitoring, health and safety, and hazardous materials management. Environmental and social
                         clauses satisfactory to the Bank are included in the bidding documents and contracts for
                         infrastructure investments as legal obligations for contractors.

                         Impacts on natural habitats: The project will not cause any conversion to critical natural habitats.
                         The project will have significant impacts on the natural habitats during construction, filling and
                         operation of the dam. The expected land take extends to some 570 ha, of which 434 ha the
                         inundated area including reservoir and dam footprint. The construction of Bisri dam and its
                         associated structures, in addition to the creation of the reservoir, will thus cause both loss and
                         alteration of natural habitats. The presence of the reservoir will transform riparian riverine habitats
                         into lacustrine habitats with both adverse and beneficial effects. The reservoir will reduce habitats
                         for wildlife species that require flowing water but attract those adapted to still or slower-moving
                         waters such as waterfowl. Beneficial effects will also arise from the habitats presented by the
                         reservoir and new biological communities will establish themselves over time. Five fish species
                         and one crab were identified in Nahr Bisri. Three of the above fish species deserve special
                         mention. These are the Freshwater blenny, the European eel, and the Middle Eastern Green carp.
                         No exotic fish or macro invertebrates were captured. Impacts on aquatic fauna are considered to be
                         moderate to minor at Bisri dam site. Measures to ensure sustainable biodiversity management are
                         addressed as part of the ESIA.

                         from the future reservoir, as well as control of induced impacts at the periphery of the reservoir.
                         Greenhouse gas emissions from the construction of the dam occur primarily during construction,
                         from exhaust gas emissions, construction machinery, and during early operation as a result of
                         decomposition of organic material inundated in the reservoir. The Bisri dam project will avoid the
                         potential local health risks of particulate matter, nitrous oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions from
                         construction machinery. Most of the biomass will be removed from the reservoir to reduce
                         greenhouse gases, particularly methane emissions after flooding.

                         Social impacts: A combination of consultations, socio-economic surveys, desk study, informal
                         meetings and direct analysis informed the analysis of social impacts. A total of 861 landowners,
                         many of whom are absentee landowners, will be impacted by land expropriation. The total
                         population living in the area of influence is estimated at 36,000 in summer months and about
                         21,000 in winter months. Major economic activities in the area are agriculture, sedentary and
                         itinerant livestock rearing and fishing. The reservoir will displace economic activities currently
                         practiced, including agriculture, livestock rearing, and fishing. The reservoir will also entail land
                         take for other project activities and associated infrastructure like the access road leading to the
                         dam. One cultural heritage site, a small church, and adjacent monastic remains will also be
                         relocated. Expected social impacts and proposed mitigation measures are analyzed in detail in the
                         project’s ESIA, including those related to social and health consequences of migrant workers, and
                         safety issues from construction traffic. The involuntary resettlement of the populations directly

                         Expected positive impacts include job creation through the hiring of local labor for construction
                         works, the establishment of a project specific benefit sharing program, and the potential for
                         increased trade and tourism in an enclave area. CDR will undertake ongoing consultation activities
                         with the local communities to help prioritize community development needs aside from the
                         required livelihood restoration measures.

                         Land acquisition and resettlement: Land take will be extensive within the proposed area to be
                         expropriated and is estimated at 570 ha. Residential properties are few and there are no
                         commercial or industrial premises and no significant public infrastructure or community facilities
                         within the impoundment area. In total, there are some 966 separate cadastral plots, within these
                         570 ha, that will be expropriated from 861 landowners, including around 135 building structures
                         that could be residential, water tanks, storage rooms, generator rooms, religious places, or animal
                         refuges. The occupied residential accommodations house seasonal farm workers, mostly non-
                         Lebanese, that will need to be relocated. Twenty six designated archaeological sites and one
                         heritage site lie within the area to be expropriated. Land take and resettlement will also occur for
                         other project activities and associated infrastructure such as the distribution lines and access road
                         in the lower catchment along the conveyor line. Arrangements for land take of associated
                         infrastructure (including that for the conveyor line, hydropower stations and church relocation
                         sites) have been assessed as part of the RAP and ESIA.

                         In addition to the 861 landowners, the land acquisition will also affected 49 residential households,
                         of which six households are landowners, eight households are Lebanese tenants, and 35
                         households are tenants from other countries. The total residential population affected is 238
                         persons, of which, 64 are Lebanese and 174 are foreigners. Among 174 foreigners, 72 persons are

                         The Government of Lebanon has committed itself to implement the RAP according to the
                         requirements of OP 4.12 for resettlement and compensation. These requirements are considerably
                         more stringent than the applicable national laws and the Government of Lebanon has agreed to
                         compensate PAPs according to Bank standards. The project’s other development partners have
                         also agreed to adhere to the standards of OP 4.12. A cutoff date of March 20, 2014 has been
                         established and publically disclosed.

                         Impacts on vulnerable people: In the project area there are no Indigenous Peoples, as defined in
                         OP 4.10. However, women, elderly, children, sick, and disabled people can be considered as
                         particularly vulnerable on account of their limited adaptation capacities, their mutual need for
                         dependency, and/or their fragility or specific needs. Foreign and Lebanese farm laborers with no
                         formal employment title or no legal tenancy entitlement can also be considered as vulnerable. The
                         needs of the vulnerable groups are given specific attention and support as part of the RAP.

                         Dam safety concerns: CDR has appointed an independent dam safety panel of experts with terms
                         of reference and experience that has been reviewed by the World Bank. The dam design, including
                         the selection of the project site, seismic design requirements, general arrangement of the site,
                         location of the main structures, and scheme for diversion of the river during construction, has been
                         reviewed by the panel and is considered appropriate for the site and its construction feasible
                         without undue difficulties. This review has also included the evaluation of flood risks and their

                                                                    Page 7 of 14
                           incorporation in the design of th e Bisri dam and is considered to be consistent with industry
                           design practice. The dam safety panel will continue to provide guidance through construction,
                           initial filling, and start-up of the dam, including any design or operational precautions to ensure
Public Disclosure Copy




                           that the project is consistent with Bank safeguards policies.

                           Dam safety plans (instrumentation plan, operation and maintenance plan and emergency
                           preparedness plan) and a construction supervision and quality assurance plan have been prepared
                           as part of the revised engineering design and have been reviewed by the World Bank and the dam
                           safety panel. An Emergency Preparedness Plan will be drafted and will be available at least one
                           year before reservoir filling and will include a discussion of procedures for timely and reliable
                           identification, evaluation, and classification of existing or potential emergency conditions.

                           Impacts on physical-cultural resources: Physical Cultural Resources are addressed in the ESIA.
                           CDR has agreed with the Directorate General of Antiquities (DGA) of the Ministry of Culture on
                           the implementation plan related to the management of cultural heritage and chance finds. All
                           known or newly discovered archaeological sites shall be ‘off-limits’ to construction crews,
                           whether on or off duty, except with the express permission of the Engineer. Such permission will
                           only be given where access is needed for site protection or to ensure public and/or worker’s safety
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The project’s immediate area of influence area of influence includes (i) area where the project’s
                           direct, indirect, and induced impacts are felt, principally around the main infrastructure elements
                           required by the Bisri Dam, as well as (ii) a larger area wherein cumulative impacts are felt.

                           The cumulative socio-economic impacts resulting from the project will afford an overall increase
                           in domestic water supply to GBML consumers, providing them with improved water service. The
                           establishment of a Benefit Sharing Program to support project affected people will also provide
                           additional mitigating measures to those whose land and/or livelihood will be affected by the

                           project.

                           Without adequate sewerage and wastewater treatment in the upstream catchment of the Bisri
                           reservoir, water quality levels will deteriorate. A water treatment plant is currently under
                           implementation under a parallel project (the Bank-financed Greater Beirut Water Supply Project)
                           will treat water to potable standards. Detailed catchment management plans for the upper and
                           lower catchments will also be developed in parallel to construction of the dam
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Without Project Alternative: With the Greater Beirut Area edging towards a projected population
                           of 3.5 million people by 2035, the present water shortages, particularly severe during the hot and
                           dry summer months, will only be exacerbated by continued population growth, increased living
                           standards, and changing climatic conditions. Thus, the consequences of the “Without Project”
                           alternative are expected to include amongst others the following: (i) Further reduction in water
                           availability to less than three hours/day; (ii) Increased pumping from illegal, unlicensed wells;
                           (iii) Increase in salinity of potable water; (iv) Increased used of tankered supplies, often from non-
                           potable sources; and (v) increased household expenditure on water.

                           In addition to the “Without Project” alternative, the project was based on a detailed analysis of
                           alternatives in line with OP/BP 4.01 Environment Assessment. The range of alternatives includes;

                                                                      Page 8 of 14
                          non-dam alternatives, dam alternatives, in addition “Without Project” alternatives.

                          Non-dam alternatives considered were desalination, groundwater, rainwater harvesting,
Public Disclosure Copy




                          wastewater reuse and reduction in “Unaccounted for Water”. Non-dam alternatives would only
                          conditionally contribute to reducing Greater Beirut Area imbalance over the next 30 years.

                          Dam Alternatives: Earlier studies and work identified potential dam sites, and over the last three
                          decades the Government of Lebanon has commissioned feasibility studies at three sites in addition
                          to Bisri namely: (i) On the Damour River (two sites: Damour East and Damour West) and (ii) On
                          Nahr Ibrahim upstream of the Janneh Plain (one site: Janneh site).

                          In assessing each of the options for augmenting Greater Beirut water supply, the Analysis of
                          Alternatives conducted an options-prioritization-exercise, examining both the fundamental
                          considerations and detailed impacts. The analysis revealed that the Bisri Dam site was the priority
                          alternative site which can: (i) meet the high storage volume that meets Greater Beirut Area
                          demands in the long term; (ii) has a reservoir floor underlain by low permeability deposits; (iv) has
                          minimal pumping costs; and (v) has the lowest cost per unit volume delivered to Greater Beirut
                          Area.

                           The ESIA includes a detailed chapter that provides the analysis of the Alternative Analysis
                           described above
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The ESMP comprises mitigation measures that are proportional and sufficient to mitigate the
                           impacts identified in the ESIA and address the social and environmental safeguards issues
                           described above:

                          ESMP Implementation and Monitoring
Public Disclosure Copy




                          The measures included in the ESMP seek to minimize impacts on the environment, workers, and
                          neighboring populations, including those related specifically to the construction sites. CDR will
                          ensure that appropriate social and environmental clauses are incorporated into all works contracts,
                          including that of the dam works contract. These clauses legally require that contractors to prepare
                          a Contractor ESMP which will be subjected to: (i) ongoing supervision by the construction
                          supervision and quality assurance construction supervision consultant; (ii) ongoing supervision by
                          the senior social and environmental specialists to be appointed to the Project Management Unit
                          (PMU) within CDR and (iii) supervision by the independent Panel of Environment and Social
                          Experts.

                          Management of the Reservoir and Downstream Area
                          Management of the reservoir and of its downstream impacts will be a principal environmental
                          challenge during the dam’s operation phase. Management of the dam and reservoir by CDR will
                          seek to avoid or mitigate its direct, indirect, induced and cumulative impacts. It will take into
                          account the strong seasonal variation of the water level, given that drawdown during the dry
                          season will create opportunities for recession agriculture, seasonal pastures, and other land uses.
                          The ESMP also requires that CDR give particular attention be given during the operation phase to
                          the risks that water releases or a dam breach would pose to persons and their assets downstream.
                          These provisions are detailed in the Emergency Preparedness Plan, currently in final stages of
                          preparation.


                                                                    Page 9 of 14
                         PMU and Independent Panel of Environment and Social Experts: The implementation
                         arrangements for the ESMP are fully integrated with the overall implementation arrangements of
Public Disclosure Copy




                         the project. CDR will be responsible for the project’s compliance with the Lebanese legislation
                         and Bank safeguards policies. CDR coordinates closely with the Ministries and other actors
                         involved in the project, as has been outlined in the ESMP, including the Ministry of Environment
                         and General Directorate of Antiquities. An independent panel of social and environmental experts
                         comprising an environmental specialist, a social specialist and a cultural anthropologist will be
                         recruited by effectiveness, to oversee implementation of the ESMP. CDR will extend the mandate
                         of the panels throughout the duration of the implementation and initial year of operation of the
                         dam.

                         CDR will implement a monitoring and evaluation program, including monitoring of ESMP
                         indicators, monitoring impacts and their mitigation, as part of the regular donor reporting. These
                         reports will also be available in the CDR local office in Bisri. ESMP monitoring is also included in
                         the World Bank monitoring arrangements and will be supervised as part of project
                         implementation.

                         Capacity Building: The ESMP includes continued capacity building measures to strengthen the
                         capacity of CDR, the BMLWE and Ministry of Energy and Water for technical assistance and to
                         handle safeguards issues according to international standards, particularly in the context of large
                         water supply infrastructure projects. The capacity building measures in the ESMP build on the
                         technical assistance for environment and social studies. The GoL and CDR teams will continue to
                         receive guidance and support as needed from IBRD safeguards specialists. Complementing this
                         ongoing support, the proposed project will include further measures to ensure satisfactory handling
                         of safeguards during the construction and operation of the Bisri dam; in particular, the project will
                         include a training program, supported by a technical assistance package as needed.

                         RAP Implementation: The main adverse social impacts of the project are largely related to land
Public Disclosure Copy




                         acquisition and demolition of structures. The inundated area of the reservoir is about 570 hectare
                         of land, which include 966 separate cadastral land plots and 135 building structures. In total, it will
                         affect about 861 landowners. The project will also affect some non-Lebanese workers in the
                         project area.

                         To mitigate the impacts, a RAP has been prepared by following the World Bank policy on
                         Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 and relevant local laws and regulations of the government of
                         Lebanon. The RAP is prepared based on detailed ce nsus of the affected people, inventory of
                         affected assets, socioeconomic surveys and extensive consultations with the project affected
                         people. The following are the basic principles to be followed for the land acquisition and
                         resettlement planning and implementation:
                         �       All affected persons are entitled to compensation for lost assets, or to alternative but
                         equivalent forms of assistance in lieu of compensation; lack of legal rights to the assets lost will
                         not bar affected persons from entitlement to such compensation or alternative forms of assistance.
                         �       Compensation rates as established in the RAP refer to amounts to be paid in full to the
                         individual or collective owner of the lost asset, without depreciation or deduction for any purpose.
                         �       When cultivated land is acquired, it often is preferable to arrange for land-for-land
                         replacement. Where suitable alternative land is not available, or at the preference of the affected
                         person, compensation in cash at full replacement cost is appropriate.
                         �       Replacement house plots, sites for relocating businesses, or agricultural land should be of

                                                                    Page 10 of 14
                          equivalent use value to the land that was acquired by the project.
                          �       Compensation for land and other assets should be paid prior to the time of impact, so that
                          new houses can be constructed, fixed assets can be removed or replaced, and other necessary

                          mitigation measures can be undertaken prior to actual displacement. Adequate transitional support
                          should be provided to affected persons or businesses required to relocate because of the project

                           Independent Monitoring of RAP implementation: To ensure full compliance with World Bank
                           safeguards policies particularly relating to land expropriation and resettlement, an independent
                           monitor of RAP implementation will be incorporated into the project. The independent Panel of
                           Experts on Social and Environment will also monitor implementation of the RAP as part of their
                           terms of reference.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Key stakeholders consulted: Safeguards consultations were undertaken with institutional
                           stakeholders, local project affected people (PAP) in the villages in the vicinity of the proposed
                           Bisri dam, and for Greater Beirut residents.

                          Consultation: Extensive public consultations were held on the ESIA, and will continue throughout
                          project preparation and implementation. Civil society, Project-Affected People (PAP), vulnerable
                          groups and various stakeholders were consulted on all safeguards documents, including the ESMP
                          and the RAP. The date and timing of all meetings were agreed with individual municipalities. The
                          village sessions were scheduled at weekends and early evening’s week-day to allow the maximum
                          number of concerned people to attend.

                          A series of scoping sessions were held during April and May 2012, as part of the ESIA preparation
                          process, commencing with an Institutional Stakeholders session at CDR offices in Beirut to which
                          ministries, other governmental agencies and NGOs were invited. This was followed by separate
                          meetings in the vicinity of the three potential dam sites, that for Bisri being held at Mazraat El

                          Dahr Municipality on Tuesday 10 April 2012. Two separate sessions were further held for Beirut
                          residents, the prime project beneficiaries, at Hadath Municipality on Tuesday 24 April 2012 for
