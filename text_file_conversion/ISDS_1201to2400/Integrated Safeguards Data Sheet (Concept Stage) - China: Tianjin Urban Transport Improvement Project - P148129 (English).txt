                           B. Project Objectives
                           17.     The Proposed PDO is to improve safe and affordable access to areas located in the Tianjin
                           main city, in all weather conditions, through an effective combination of mass transit, buses and non-
                           motorized transport, focusing on people in the bottom 60 percent in terms of income level.

                           18.     By leveraging the Tianjin mass transit and public transport system, the project will relieve
                           congestion. By focusing on a combination of NMT and public transport access, the project will
                         ensure a strong focus on the B40, and build on global best practices. By combining transit oriented
                         development with some of the public transport stations, the project will facilitate walkability. By
                         supporting a flood information system, the project will provide early warning and decision support

                         system for city managers, transport providers and the public to enhance urban traffic operation and
                         management capability during period of heavy rains or flooding.
                         C. Project Description
                         The proposed project will have the following components:

                         Component 1: Street Network Improvement (US$245 million, 96% of cost) :

                         (i)      Construction of bus corridor with high level of service (BHLS) to complement the existing
                         metro network;
                         (ii)     Access improvement to the mass transit system, including selected intersection
                         improvements, interconnection facilities (bike parking, bus connection, park and ride) and street
                         improvements for NMT access at about 10 metro stations. This subcomponent would increase the
                         catchment area of these metro stations and leverage past investments in the mass transit system;
                         (iii)    Street improvement for about 8 urban roads experiencing congestion and playing
                         microcirculation functions, focused on NMT friendly environment and connection with other
                         transport facilities;
                         (iv)     Pilot a Public Bike Sharing system with about 12,260 bicycles and 446 stations to support
                         last mile accessibility; and
                         (v)      Construction of about 8 bus stations including six bus terminals and two integrated hubs to
                         improve the quality of bus service, and to ease transfers between different modes.

                         Component 2: Flood Management Information System (US$6 million, 2.3% of costs): This
                         component includes investment in a geospatial information system that links flood hazard/water
                         logging modelling with: (a) meteorological forecasts, (b) real-time flood levels, and (c) transport
                         management systems, to provide an early warning and decision support system for city managers,

                         transport providers and the public.

                         Component 3: Technical Assistance (US$4 million, 1.6% of costs): The proposed topics for technical
                         assistance include:

                         (i)     Flood hazard assessment and performance assessment of existing and planned urban
                         drainage systems, with particular focus on the catchment area of the mass transit system;
                         (ii)    Sustainable green urban transport development strategic study for the Tianjin Central Area;
                         (iii)   Tianjin strategy to control motor vehicle ownership and use (including parking, congestion
                         charges), combined with GHG emission inventory and emission reduction strategy (potentially
                         together with GIZ);
                         (iv)    Decision making supporting system to enhance the Tianjin Central Area bus network and
                         develop a dynamic network improvement plan;
                         (v)     Diversified financing mechanisms for urban transport sustainable improvement, including
                         PPP options for bus terminals, public bike sharing system or BRT;
                         (vi)    Public bicycle management development and operation mechanism, and sustainable
                         development, considering the complementary role of private bikes and public bikes; and
                         (vii)   Comprehensive urban transport improvement and awareness rising for innovative
                         approaches.

                           analysis (if known)
                           The proposed project is located in the city of Tianjin, about 150 km southeast of Beijing. It is a

                           renowned historic, cultural and portal city in China as one of the four municipalities directly under
                           the Central Government. By the end of 2010, the municipality spread over a total area of 11,946
                           km2, with a total population of 14.13million. Tianjin has formed a twin-center urban development.
                           The main center city is about 280.83 km2, and the Binhai center city is about 304.44 km2.

                           The physical activities of the proposed project are all within the central urban built-up area, i.e.
                           renovation of existing urban streets for BHLS and network improvement, and existing parking lots/
                           empty land reserved for urban utility for bus terminals and bicycle parking lots. There is no sensitive
                           ecological environment site/area identified at the time of identification within the project impact area.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Tianjin PMO (TPMO) was founded in the 1990s for the World Bank financed project Phase 1.
                           This project is the third World Bank loan project the PMO prepared and implemented. The TPMO
                           has extensive experience with World Bank safeguards policies and procedures. TPMO has entrusted
                           Tianjin Environmental Impact Assessment Center, an experienced EIA consultant which has been
                           involved in previous Bank projects in Tianjin. The task team will remain closely engaged to ensure
                           Bankâ€™s safeguards policies be adequately addressed throughout the project preparation and
                           implementation.
