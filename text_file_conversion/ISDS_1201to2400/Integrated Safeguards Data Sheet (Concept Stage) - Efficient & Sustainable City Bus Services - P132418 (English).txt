                           The project's development objective is to promote a shift to environmentally sustainable modes of
                           transport through a more comprehensive focus on city bus transport.
                           C. Project Description
                           This proposed project intends to fund the incremental activities aimed to enhance sustainability,
                         energy efficiency, and quality of city bus services, and therefore the potential for GHG emissions
                         reductions from the baseline project.

                         The project comprises the following components:

                         Component 1: Capacity building and Technical Assistance on Policy, Regulatory, Fiscal issues (GEF
                         US$ 0.7M, co-finance US$ 2.0M): As part of this component, policy, regulatory and fiscal
                         constraints will be reviewed at national, state and city levels to promote efficient and high quality
                         city bus services and policy notes developed for discussion and debate among key stakeholders.
                         Capacity building initiatives involving development of knowledge materials, training activities,
                         knowledge sharing through website/newsletters and cross learning events etc. in cutting edge areas
                         aimed at development of the overall urban bus sector in the country shall form part of this
                         component.

                         Component 2A: City Demonstration Projects (GEF US$ 6M, co-finance US$ 113 M): This
                         component shall support physical improvements targeted at modernizing the city bus services in
                         demonstration cities including (i) modern depot equipment for improved maintenance and life of
                         buses, (ii) modern Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) and Management Information Systems (MIS)
                         - to make the services more user friendly and for improved planning and management of operations
                         to enable optimal use of resources. Four cities have been selected as demonstration pilots. These are
                         Bhopal, Chandigarh, Jaipur and Mira Bhayandar.

                         Component 2B: Capacity Building & Technical Assistance to Demonstration Cities (GEF US$ 2.1m,
                         co-finance US$ 0.92m) : The capacity building and technical assistance component is targeted at
                         supporting the modernization efforts of selected demonstration cities. These shall include to the
                         following kinds of activities (i) institutional strengthening, capacity building and training, (ii)
                         business planning including route planning and rationalization for better utilization of buses, (iii)
                         marketing and branding, (iv) technical support with private sector participation including
                         mainstreaming of informal sector, (v) vehicle and driver performance management with a view to

                         improving fuel efficiency, (vi) incremental operational expenses.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The candidate cities for demonstration investments are Bhopal (population 1.7 million), Chandigarh
                         (1 million), Jaipur (3 million), and Mira-Bhayander (0.8 million). Mira-Bhayander is part of the
                         Mumbai Metropolitan Region on the west coast of India. Chandigarh is a federally administered high
                         income city that serves as a capital of two north Indian states â€“ Haryana and Punjab. Jaipur is the
                         capital of Rajasthan, the largest state in India. Bhopal is the capital of Madhya Pradesh in Central
                         India and is known for its lake system.

                         The physical improvements under component 2 A , targeted at modernizing city bus services in
                         demonstration cities are largely planned to be executed in the existing bus depots and bus stops.
                         However, in some cases such physical improvements and installation may be proposed at new sites
                         for bus depots too. In such cases both existing and new sites when identified would require to be
                         screened for any possible impacts on surrounding natural resources as applicable as well as need for
                         resettlement and loss of livelihood etc. For Mira Bhayander, due to its proximity to the coast,
                         mangroves covered areas are located close to two currently identified candidate sites and would
                         require protection/ suitable management measures. An environment and social framework prepared
                         for ongoing India Sustainable Urban Transport Project shall be updated to reflect new cities, sub
                           project level activities any additional issues based on the potential sites to be identified during the
                           project preparation.

                           Large scale land acquisition or resettlement is not envisaged under this project. However, all the sub
                           activities as part of the overall project in the select cities will be subject to social screening to
                           identify/confirm need for land acquisition and resettlement. Any proposed site requiring land
                           acquisition or displacement will require a detailed social assessment and preparation of Resettlement
                           action plan acceptable to the Bank. All sites would also be subject to environmental screening
                           followed by an adequate level of environmental assessment and preparation of management plan.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           MoUD, GoI has some capacity for safeguards policies, mostly outsourced from consultants, since it
                           is partnering with the Bank on the on-going India Sustainable Urban Transport Project. However, the
                           pilot cities are engaging substantively with the Bank on the Urban Transport agenda for the first time
                           and have no prior experience of applying safeguards policies provisions of the Bank. However, they
                           may have some experience of handling environmental management and social issues under
                           Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission to the extent that the activities would have required
                           regulatory clearances under national/local regulations. This capacity will be supplemented with
                           deployment of Project Preparation and Management Consultant teams with suitable environmental
                           and social expertise.
