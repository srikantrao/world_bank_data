                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen Sudanâ€™s capacity to design a socially and
                           environmentally sound national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus
                           (REDD+) strategy.
                           C. Project Description
                           The Sudan Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) presents all activities that the Government of
                         Sudan envisages to achieve REDD+ readiness. The total estimated funding required to achieve this
                         readiness over the next three years is US$7.82 million, of which US$3.80 million will be funded by
                         the FCPF. US$0.32 million will be provided by the Government of Sudan. The Government has
Public Disclosure Copy




                         requested support from the UN-REDD Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
                         for the remaining balance of approximately US$4.0 million.

                         The FCPF grant will fund a first phase of readiness preparation activities and it will be organized
                         along four components that correspond with the components and sub-components of the Sudan R-PP.

                         Component 1: Support for REDD+ readiness management and institutional arrangements (US
                         $1,250,000). This component will fund six sub-components as follows:

                         Sub-component 1.1: Set up and operation of the National REDD+ Secretariat (US$470,000). This
                         sub-component will fund the day-to-day operations of the National REDD+ Management Unit
                         (REDD+ Unit) and establish the human and technical capacity to support REDD+ readiness
                         preparation activities. The REDD+Unit is housed in the Forest National Corporation and will be
                         responsible for providing secretariat and logistic support for readiness preparation activities.
                         Sub-component 1.2: Set up and operation of the National REDD+ Steering Committee, Technical
                         Advisory Committee and REDD+ Technical Working Groups ($US130,000). This sub-component
                         will fund the establishment of National REDD+ Steering Committee (NRSC), Technical Advisory
                         Committee (TAC), and ad hoc REDD+ Technical Working Groups (RTWGs) as described in the R-
                         PP. These are the structures responsible for leading the execution and strategic planning of the
                         REDD+ process and for providing technical inputs and guidance.
                         Sub-component 1.3: Strengthen sub-national REDD+ institutional structures ($US300,000). This
                         sub-component will support decentralized implementation arrangements at the state and locality
                         levels, including operational support for regional technical specialist. Furthermore, this sub-
                         component will support the strengthening of existing multi-sectoral land use platforms at the state
                         level to facilitate cross-sectoral coordination. The Ministry of Agriculture at State levels are cross-
                         sectoral and would house the platform. As appropriate, additional sectors engaged in land use would

                         be added to ensure representation during the implementation of readiness activities. The support will
                         target high-forested area, which include the central and eastern states, as well as the Blue Nile,
                         Kordofan and Darfur regions as feasible.
                         Sub-component 1.4: Capacity building for REDD+ institutional arrangements ($US100,000). This
                         component will enhance capacity and knowledge on REDD+ by funding workshops, training
                         activities and technical assistance for the REDD Unit, FNC, TAC, and local level REDD+ Focal
                         Points and technical specialists to build sufficient technical, policy, communication capacity.
                         Sub-component 1.5: Feedback and Grievance Redress Mechanism for REDD+ (US$200,000). This
                         sub-component will fund the assessment, strengthening and/or establishment, as appropriate, of a
                         feedback and grievance redress mechanism/s (FGRM) to handle feedback and address complaints
                         during the readiness phase and beyond to implementation of future REDD+ emission reductions
                         programs.
                         Subcomponent 1.6: Program monitoring and evaluation (US$50,000). This sub-component will
                         support monitoring activities such as implementation of the monitoring and evaluation framework for
                         REDD+, independent assessment of readiness at mid-term, final program review, and preparation of
                         annual progress reports.

                         Component 2: Support for national REDD+ Strategy (including Strategic Environmental and Social
                         Assessment) ($US850,000)
                         Sub-component 2.1: In-depth analysis of drivers of deforestation and forest degr adation, including
                         studies on policies, wood-based energy, land tenure and forest governance ($US300,000). This sub-
                         component will fund:

                         a) Analytical studies to deepen the analysis of the drivers of deforestation and degradation, including
                         review of legal, policy and political economy considerations discussed in the R-PP, as well as review
                         of agriculture, forestry and other land uses.
                         b) Assessment of forest governance and land tenure, including land use and tenure arrangements.
                         This study will carry out forest governance and land tenure analysis, including traditional customary
                         land ownership and usage. It will provide an overview of the factors influencing decision-making
                         regarding forest and land use. It will also establish a baseline against which forest governance can be
                         assessed and monitored during REDD+ implementation.
                         c) On the basis of the outcomes of the studies undertaken in sub-component 2.1 and 2.2, the Grant
                         will support the review of forestry, rangeland, livestock and water policies (elaborated further in the
                         R-PP), as required. This will include meetings and workshops to discuss potential policy reform,
                         legislative amendments as well as national and state-level land use planning and zoning, as required.


                         Sub-component 2.2: In-depth analysis of strategic options to address deforestation and forest
                         degradation ($US200,000). This sub-component will fund:
                         a)        Analytical work on these options to ensure that they reflect new knowledge on the drivers of
                         deforestation and forest degradation study to be conducted in sub-component 2.1.
                         b) The strategy options identified during readiness will be screened and prioritized based on the
                         economic, environmental and social costs and benefits. Important co-benefits in Sudan include
                         biodiversity conservation, energy efficiency, reforestation and environmental services protection, as
                         well as water, food security and improvement in livelihoods. This study will analyze the costs and
                         benefits of different REDD+ Strategy options. It will also include an ecosystem valuation of forests
                         to get a better understanding of their economic importance.

                         Sub-component 2.3: Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) and development of

                         Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) (US$250,000). This component will
                         support the integration of social and environmental concerns into the REDD+ strategy development
                         process and ensure that negative impacts are avoided or minimized.

                         Sub-component 2.4: Study on options for benefit-sharing related to REDD+ ($US50,000). This
                         component will fund an options analysis and present recommendations for the development of
                         efficient, effective and equitable arrangements for sharing benefits related to the implementation of
                         REDD+.

                         Component 3: Support for stakeholder engagement ($US400,000). This component provides a
                         framework for engagement of relevant stakeholders during readiness preparation as well as
                         enhancing capacities at national, state and locality levels. Specifically this component will fund
                         consultations on key issues addressed under the FCPF, including (a) the drivers of deforestation and
                         degradation; (b) the identification of national REDD+ strategy options; (c) land and forest law,
                         policy and governance; (d) benefit sharing; (e) SESA; and (f) MRV. The consultations will be
                         focused on the eastern and central regions, and lessons learned will be used for the other states.
                         Potential activities for consultation and their cost estimates to build capacity were discussed with
                         stakeholders in detail.

                         Sub-component 3.1: Consultation and participation for activities to be implemented under the FCPF
                         grant ($US300,000). The sub-component activities will fund:
                         a) The development of a detailed and robust consultation and participation plan to be implemented
                         during readiness. This plan would build on Sudanâ€™s existing Communications Policy and formal
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Public Participation Policy, FCPF guidelines for effective stakeholder engagement and UNFCCC
                         decisions on full and effective participation. Furthermore as a signatory to ILO169 as well as the
                         United Nation Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), Sudan has adopted free
                         prior and informed consent (FPIC) as the guiding principle for all consultations and participatory
                         process.
                         b) The deepening of the stakeholder mapping analysis that began during the R-PP formulation phase.
                         It will identify the relevant stakeholders engaged in land use as those most likely to gain or lose from
                         REDD+. Furthermore, it will fund targeted stakeholder outreach at national, state and locality levels
                         on activities implemented by the FCPF grant.
                         c)        The Grant will also fund development of suitable communication materials and tools. The
                         Federal level Extension and Mass Media unit within FNC will play a lead role in assisting with the
                         development of the C&P Plan, as well as coordinating and managing information dissemination and
                         collecting stakeholder feedback in a centralized manner. Capacity to perform this function at
                         decentralized levels will be assessed, and strengthened as required.

                         Sub-component 3.2: Setting up and strengthening of civil society platforms ($US100,000). This sub-
                         component will support the strengthening of existing or establishment of new, where appropriate,
                         community based-organizations (CBO)/ non-governmental organizations (NGO)/association
                         platforms at the national level and in each of the states in order to facilitate the consultation and
                         stakeholder engagement process for REDD+ readiness., seed collectors), women, research centers
                         and universities, as appropriate to the national or state context.

                         Component 4: Support for Monitoring, Reporting and Verification ($US1,300,000). This component
                         will have 3 sub-components and supports the following key activities:
                         a)       An initial set of activities, helping Sudan to build the foundation needed for future: i)
                         operationalization of the Sudan Forest Monitoring System, ii) calculation of a national reference

                         emission level (REL)/reference level (RL), and iii) generation of robust forest data feeding into the
                         National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and National Communications/Biennial Updates to the United
                         Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (lead by HCENR MoEFPD).
                         b) Data collection and measurement activities underpinning the Sudan Forest Monitoring System. In
                         line with relevant UNFCCC decisions and IPCC guidelines, Sudan will use a combination of remote
                         sensing and ground based forest carbon inventory approaches for estimating forest-related GHG
                         emissions by sources and removals by sinks, forest carbon stocks and forest area changes.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         REDD+ readiness activities are country wide. However, the activities are limited to analytical
                         studies, capacity building, and consultation process at national and state levels. No physical activities
                         will be implemented on the ground.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         Sudan has environmental policies, laws and regulations. Furthermore there are existing legal and
                         regulatory frameworks relating to forest and other sectors that provide good basis for the governance
                         in relation to REDD+. However, the Borrowerâ€™s institutional capacity, for implementing national
                         polices and laws as well as the World Bank environmental and social safeguards, is not strong. Also,
                         effective coordination between relevant institutions across sectors and institutional capacity to
                           implement safeguards is weak. In order to address the capacity limitation, a Safeguards Working
                           Group will be established that will work closely with the FNC REDD+ Management Unit, the TAC
                           and the SESA Consultants to mainstream social and environmental issues in the various activities

                           that will be funded under REDD+ readiness and lead the SESA preparation process. Furthermore, the
                           World Bank Team will work closely with the Safeguard Working Group and the environmental and
                           social specialists in the REDD+ Management Unit.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
                                  The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                      It is envisaged that the SESA would be launched six months after a Grant Agreement is signed. As
                                      described above, the Project will not finance activities to make Sudan ready for potential REDD+
                                      initiatives. It will not have any investment activities on the groundand is thus not expected to have
                                      any direct environmental and social impacts. However, it is considered that the Project might
                                      have indirect impacts in the sense that the findings from analytical work carried out under the
                                      Project may influence the design of the national REDD+ Strategy. A draft Terms of Reference of
                                      the SESA have been prepared by the Forest National Coordination, REDD+ focal institution.

                                      The SESA allows: (i) social and environmental considerations to be integrated into the REDD+
                                      Readiness process, in particular the REDD+ strategy; (ii) stakeholder participation in identifying
                                      and prioritizing key issues, assessment of policy, institutional and capacity gaps to manage these
                                      priorities and recommendations, and disclosure of findings in the REDD Countryâ€™s progress
