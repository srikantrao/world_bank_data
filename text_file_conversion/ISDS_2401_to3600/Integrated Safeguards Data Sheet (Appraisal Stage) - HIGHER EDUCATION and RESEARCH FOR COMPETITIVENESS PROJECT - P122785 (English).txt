                              The Project development objective is to strengthen the quality and relevance of higher education and research in Montenegro through creating a
                              transparent finance system and a coherent quality assurance system and by strengthening research and development capabilities.

                              3. Project Description

                              This project is organized around four components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1: Higher Education Finance Reforms and Implementation of Quality Assurance Norms

                              This component would finance activities to implement the goals of the Strategy through such measures as improving the administrative capacity of
                              the Council of Higher Education and the Higher Education Department, through activities such as study visits and technical assistance, to support
                              the membership in the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education (EQAR) and ENQA. It would also finance a sector-wide
                              evaluation of the Universities, which includes baseline, and follow-up studies. The assessment of Bologna implementation would be part of these
                              studies, as well as the assessment of learning environment. Some identified needs of individual faculties would be financed under implementation
                              of the grants subcomponent. Finally, this component would also financed one tracer study and skills and two knowledge labor market studies (one
                              benchmark and one results study), which includes technical assistance for designing such studies and carrying out the related proposed
                              methodologies.

                              Component 2: Human Capital Development through Internationalization Initiatives

                              This component would address cross-border opportunities in two ways: (i) establishing a facilitation agency, which would serve as a clearinghouse
                              for all information regarding international opportunities for students and academic staff; and (ii) funding the development and implementation of a
                              targeted scholarship scheme for graduate and post-graduate students, as well as mechanisms to attract international staff to Montenegrin higher
                              education institutions, into fields deemed nationally important. The activities would also support a feasibility study to examine the potential of
                              introducing some basic changes, such as greater use of English language in the classrooms and provision of subsidized housing, for instance, to
                              lure foreign scholars and students. Finally, as a bridge to Component 3, internationalization efforts can and ought to be embedded into every
                              ambitious academic program, as it would be in the competitively awarded (and well-funded) posts at newly established CoEs.

                              Component 3: Establishing a Competitive Research and Innovation Environment

                              The component would support the development of the criteria defining the CoE and their governance framework and the establishment of one pilot
                              CoE, to be identified through competitive selection criteria, as established in the law. It is envisioned that existing faculties and research institutes
                              would compete, either on their own or in consortia, to establish this CoE. It would help the GoM to prepare the necessary assessments of
                              upgrading and skills gaps and feasibility studies to establish the centers, including co-finance upgrading of equipment, providing technical
                              assistance and training in strategic areas, and funding the development of partnerships with private sector and international research centers.

                              To support larger, more impactful R&D subproject that nurture international collaboration and have a high potential to generate commercial
                              innovations, the Project would provide for a significant expansion of the competitive National Project's research grants program. Under this

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 1 of 3
                               component, the grants would be awarded to Montenegrin research institutions or firms that wish to initiate a programmatic R&D project together
                               with an international partner.

                               Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation

                               This component was designed to build capacity within MoES and MoS to manage the day-to-day implementation of the HERIC Project, as well as
                               monitor and evaluate its impact. It would support the establishment of a minimal Project Management Team (PMT). This component would finance

                               the salaries of PMT staff, and financial audits. This component would also finance consultant services of the Technical Service Unit (TSU) within
                               the MoF. Lastly, this component would provide funds for M&E studies.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  OP 4.01 is triggered by the Project as it will finance the establishment of one pilot Center of Excellence in Montenegro and the expansion of the
                                  existing national projects research grants in areas of significant national interest. These funds could be use to purchase lab equipment, the
                                  operation of which would generate waste. The project will not finance major civil works, and new construction of buildings or schools is not
                                  envisaged. Minor scale refurbishment works (e.g. repainting, window alterations, etc) might be needed to adjust the activities that will be hosted
                                  within the Center of Excellence and the grantee institutions. The location of the pilot CoE and grantee institutions are not yet established, but it
                                  would not be located in any buildings under special cultural protection. The project will also finance the technological equipment for the pilot
                                  Center of Excellence and other research institutions.

                                  The research grant program will be awarding large scale grants for advanced research (maximum U$500,000) through a competitive process. A
                                  negative list of activities that will not be supported by this research program activities (e.g. IFC Exclusion List) will be agreed with the Borrower
                                  and included in the Environmental Management Framework (EMF) developed for the project. The potential environmental impact of the CoE
                                  and grant sub-projects will be assessed through a screening procedure based on the WB Environmental Assessment safeguard policy (OP/BP/
                                  GP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment), WB Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook (PPAH) and the relevant laws and bylaws of the
                                  GoM, in particular the Waste Management Law (Official Gazette of the RM, No. 80/05), and the Law on Integrated Prevention and Pollution
                                  Control (IPPC) (Official Gazette of the RM No 80/05). The environmental screening procedure outlined in the EMF will become an integrated
                                  part of the Grants Operational Manual. When the screening procedure indicates that environmental impacts may occur, a specific
                                  Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be developed for the object (CoE or grant sub-project). The EMP will identify mitigation measures
                                  recommended for the assessed adverse environmental impacts. Sub-projects that are screened as category "A" will not be eligible for funding.

                                  HERIC is not expected to present any large scale, significant or irreversible negative environmental impacts.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  There are no indirect negative long-term impacts anticipated as a result of this project. Modernization and upgrading of research facilities is
                                  expected to result in adoption of good laboratory practices, including for waste management.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 3
                              The EMF provides an exclusion list and screening process to avoid investments that would meet category "A" conditions or that would trigger
                              any of the other Bank safeguards policies. The EMF provides guidance for preparation of sub-project EMPs to mitigate and monitor
                              environmental risks.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                              An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been disclosed and consulted prior to appraisal. The EMF includes a screening

                              checklist for the pilot CoE and candidate research grant recipients to establish the sub-project environmental category. When indicated based
                              on the screening (e.g., category B sub-projects), a sub-project EMP will be prepared and incorporated into the sub-project Grant Agreement.
                              Guidance for preparation of the sub-project EMP is provided in the EMF. Ministry of Science (MoS) as implementing agency for Component 3,
                              Establishing a Competitive Research and Innovation Environment, will be responsible for implementation of the EMF as this is the only
                              component that triggers safeguards policies. MoS will recruit a local environmental specialist funded under HERIC to advise and assist with
                              implementation of the project with respect to environmental safeguards.
