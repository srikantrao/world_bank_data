                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The bulk of the works anticipated are for rehabilitation of existing facilities. Although there will be some new construction ( the Kisumu bypass,
                                 for example) all new construction will have limited and reversible environmental impact. No protected areas or forest reserves are traversed by
                                 the civil works planned under this project.

                                 Appropriate measures to ensure occupational health and safety to workers and safety of the general public will be included in all contracts for

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 3 of 5
                           civil works. Draft EIAs will be prepared, approved and disclosed prior to appraisal, and finalized prior to commencement of civil works.

                           Although the Meru Bypass is in the vicinity of the Imenti forest, an elephant breeding area, a site visit has confirmed that the Imenti Forest is
                           fenced off, and wildlife will not be able to access the road, and enough of a buffer is in place to ensure that elephants will not be impacted by
                           noise or air pollution. Construction crews will be closely monitored at campsites and worksites to prevent poaching. All construction waste will
                           be properly disposed of in borrow pits, which will be rehabilitated upon the completion of the project. KURA will keep KWS and KFS informed of
                           construction schedules.

                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            Indirect impacts are positive. By widening the existing highway from the airport, and providing feeder routes, thereby lessening traffic
                           congestion, it will be easier to deter commuters from the current practice of taking detours through the roads of the Nairobi National Park.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            Alignments to routes were taken to minimize impacts on local communities. For example, in case of Kisumu Bypass, the road was aligned to
                           avoid the vicinity of a nursery school.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            Draft RAPs and EIAs have been prepared for (i) JKIA-Rironi and (ii) Kisumu Bypass by the Kenya Highways Authority (KENHA). A draft RAP
                           and EIA haves been prepared for Meru Bypass by Kenya Urban Roads Authority ( KURA). The drafts RAPs and EIAs will be disclosed prior to
                           appraisal in May 2012. Terms of reference for safeguards studies for BRT and Commuter rail system (Components B1 and B2) will also be
                           disclosed prior to project appraisal. Draft Terms of Reference for safeguards studies for BRT and Commuter Rail System (Components B1 and
                           B2) will also be disclosed prior to project appraisal.

                           The Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA), Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA), Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Ministry of
                           Transport (MoT) and the Ministry of Roads (MoR) will be responsible for implementing the project. KeNHA is responsible for the management
                           of all national roads in Kenya; KURA is responsible for all urban roads, KRC is responsible for the development of railways, MoR is responsible
                           for policy and technical standards pertaining to roads sub sector issues; and MoT is responsible for other transport matters. A significant scope
                           of the project covers the road sub sector comprising mainly of road rehabilitation and improvement. KeNHA, KURA, and KRC, parastatals with
                           independent Boards of Directors outside the central government, will implement 95 percent (in terms of cost) of the project and the balance
                           (three percent) will be implemented by MoR and MoT. KenHA -- and to a lesser extent, KURA - have significant experience in preparing,
                           implementing, and monitoring environmental and social safeguard documentation in compliance with World Bank safeguard policies and
                           National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) regulations. Although there are no civil works investments envisioned under the
                           responsibility of the KRC in this project, environmental and social staff have been working with the KRC to enhance their familiarity with World
                           Bank safeguard policies. The overall training program for the project will incorporate capacity building module for environmental and social
                           safeguards.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            Key stakeholders are Project Affected Persons living or working along the proposed routes. Extensive consultations have been held with all
                           PAPs. In the case of the Meru Bypass, which is in the vicinity of the Imenti Forest, consultations have been held with KFSand KWS, and will
                           continue to be held during project implementation.
