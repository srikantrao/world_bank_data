2. Project Objectives:
To enhance government-CSOs partnership in the implementation and monitoring of sector
development programs

3. Project Description:
The proposed project will foster a dialogue between line ministries and CSOs working on service
delivery, participation and decentralization programs. This will help them develop a shared
vision and understanding of sector priorities and identify their complementarities and overlaps
toward defining jointly a Partnership and Mutual Accountability Framework. Based on the
dialogue outcomes, sector specific action plans will be developed in select sectors on a pilot
basis. The dialogue will build on the findings and operational recommendations of the ongoing
CSO mapping and capacity assessment study that will inform both the Government-CSOs
Partnership as well as the upcoming Civil Society Support Project requested by the Government
of Yemen.

The project will have two tracks: a Bank-executed track aimed at distilling international and
regional experiences and presenting both the demand and supply side perspectives on
government-CSO partnerships, and a Recipient-executed track with two components that aims to
lead the process of organizing and facilitating sector dialogue sessions and identifying pilot
sector action plans.

The project Component 1 will be Bank-executed, given the Bank’s comparative advantage in
terms of mobilizing South-South knowledge sharing to facilitate access to various stakeholders
representing the supply and demand side in other regions, as well as in MNA. World Bank teams
will also coordinate through World Bank country offices to bring in government representatives
from other countries as well as international experts. Components 2 and 3 aiming to organize and
implement sector dialogues will be Recipient-executed.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
This TAL has no salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis.
