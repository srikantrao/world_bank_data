                           The overall Project Development Objective (PDO) and Global Environmental Objective (GEO) is to
                         enable rural people to increase their productive assets in ways that improve natural resource
                         management and resilience to climate change in selected climate vulnerable sites.
                         C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Scope. The proposed project would comprise three components implemented over five years: (1)
                         Rural Production and Land Resource Management Investments; (2) Knowledge Management; and
                         (3) Project Management. The design incorporates lessons from previous and on-going projects in the
                         sector, notably the Bank- and GEF-financed Agriculture and Watershed Management Project
                         (CAWMP, 2005-2012), but also successful approaches supported by other donors in the field.

                         Component 1. Rural Production and Land Resource Management Investments. The purpose of this
                         component is to provide funding at the community level that would allow rural people to adopt
                         innovative and appropriate practices that reduce land degradation and increase resilience to climate
                         change.

                         Sub-Component 1.1. Village-based sustainable rural production and land resource management in
                         selected climate vulnerable sites. At the village-level, the project would finance rural productivity
                         investments in three categories: (i) farm production (activities that improve field and horticultural
                         crop productivity and diversity, livestock production efficiency, agro-processing and market access);
                         (ii) land resource management (activities that improve water conservation; soil fertility; pasture
                         management, sustainable sloping lands cultivation, including orchards, woodlots, shelter-belts); and
                         (iii) small-scale rural production infrastructure (activities that improve irrigation/drainage systems,
                         minor transport infrastructure, renewable energy, energy efficiency measures). These activities
                         would be selected based on their potential to reduce land degradation, improve livelihoods and
                         increase resilience to the impacts of climate change.

                         Sub-Component 1.2. Community Sustainable Pasture Management. This sub-component would
                         finance the development of sustainable participatory pasture and livestock management plans in
                         selected jamoats. The participatory plan would define: (i) measures to improve pasture productivity,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         such as rotational grazing, protecting areas for regeneration, pasture rehabilitation, improving access
                         to remote pastures, and needs for supplementary fodder production; (ii) grazing utilization levels;
                         (iii) animal health requirements such as vaccinations; (iv) investment needs; and (v) implementation
                         targets and indicators. Investments could include: (i) infrastructure to access and use remote
                         pastures, such as spot road improvements, stock watering points, shelters, and milk cooling
                         equipment; (ii) machinery to produce and harvest fodder; (iii) rehabilitation measures for degraded
                         areas such as fencing, weed and shrub control, and re-seeding; (iv) inputs for supplementary fodder
                         production such as seeds; (v) animal health measures; and (vi) breed improvement through artificial
                         insemination.

                         Sub-Component 1.3. On-Farm Water Management. This sub-component aims to introduce
                         sustainable on-farm water management practices in irrigated cropland, particularly in lowland
                         districts. The sub-component would support farmers to introduce, test and demonstrate practices that
                         could contribute to improving on-farm water management and efficiency, maintain soil quality and
                         reduce land degradation, and increase resilience to climate change. Investments could include: (i)
                         provision of equipment for drip irrigation and land-leveling; (ii) cleaning drainage systems to
                         alleviate waterlogging and for salinity control; (iii) provision of seedlings for planting shelter belts,
                         protecting canals and as an intercrop; (iv) materials for conservation agriculture; and (v) seeds of
                         improved varieties tolerant to drought, pests, diseases, and soil salinity..
                         Component 2: Knowledge Management and Institutional Support. This component will provide
                         facilitation services and technical support for rural populations to plan, implement and manage rural
                         investments. The component would comprise the following activities:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Sub-Component 2.1. Facilitation support and technical advice for mobilization, participatory
                         planning, and implementation of development plans at the village and/or jamoat level.

                         Sub-Component 2.2. A comprehensive training, dissemination and networking program would be
                         instituted to improve skills and knowledge in key topics such as environmental assessment,
                         monitoring and control, and information management; integrated land, water and grazing
                         management including pasture management approaches; sustainable land management and curtailing
                         land degradation; integrated pest management (IPM); pollution control; and climate change
                         adaptation.

                         Sub-Component 2.3. Analysis, research and impact evaluation will include analyses of topics such as
                         soil quality and extent of land degradation, grazing management and livestock production, market
                         development and access to markets, potential incentive policies for environmental measures,
                         sustainable land management practices and changes in productivity and environmental conditions
                         resulting from technological change to provide guidance for the design of rural investments and
                         supporting sustainability of the project’s impacts.

                         Component 3: Project Management. This component will finance the operating costs of a Project
                         Management Unit (PMU), which will undertake project management functions for both Components
                         1 and 2. The PMU will provide project management support in the following areas: procurement,
                         financial management, project coordination, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the              safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Project sites would comprise districts in three different agro-ecological zones - uplands, hill lands
Public Disclosure Copy




                         and lowlands – as recommended by the PPCR Component A5 Phase 1 Agriculture and Sustainable
                         Land Management Report. Districts and site selection would take into account: (i) degree of climate
                         and other environmental vulnerability; (ii) degree of farmland restructuring (secure land tenure is an
                         important aspect of sustainability); (iii) representation of upland, middle hills and lowland areas and
                         contiguous sites where possible to facilitate resource management approaches (watershed, river
                         basin); (iv) donor complementarity (to help ensure support not provided by ELMARL, e.g., in market
                         development, and thus make use of parallel co-financing from agencies such as DFID/GIZ), as well
                         as avoidance of overlap; and (v) relative potential for the project to sustainably increase food security
                         and agricultural growth, and successful environmental management (i.e., ensuring that project targets
                         can be met – number of households benefiting and area under effective land and agricultural
                         practices). Care would also be taken to coordinate with and not to duplicate efforts of other projects
                         and donors, including the Bank's PAMP 2 project, International Fund for Agricultural Development
                         (IFAD), United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and Asian Development
                         Bank (ADB).
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         No safeguard issues arose under CAWMP. A dedicated Implementation Group (IG) within the
                         Committee on Environmental Protection (CEP) will undertake primary responsibility for addressing
                         the environmental and social aspects of the project. The IG will ensure that related safeguard
                         measures (such as Environment Management Plans) are effectively implemented.
                           The CEP is responsible for naturalresource management and climate change policy, as well
                           environmental awareness raising and environmental monitoring. As such, safeguards implementation

                           activities, such as environmental reviews and environmental management activities, will draw upon
                           the capacity of the Committee which has experience with environmental assessments, environmental
                           management and legal and regulatory requirements. Additional capacity is expected to be obtained
                           to support environmental management aspects including training, data analysis, and if needed for
                           environmental assessment to prepare documentation such as EMPs and/or EMP check lists.

                         environmental monitoring system, including
                         indicators, was revised at the mid-term review,
                         and shifted from the less effective approach of
                         “preventing negative environmental impact? to
                         a more successful and clear message to local
