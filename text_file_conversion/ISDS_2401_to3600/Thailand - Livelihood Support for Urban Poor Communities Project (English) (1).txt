l. Project Objectives:

The objective of the grant is to assist the Royal Thai Government to provide at 3,000 vulnerable
households in poor urban communities with access to bridging income support and improved
living conditions. The grant objectives will be achieved through a community basic
infrastructure rehabilitation program in. five Provinces where the impacts of the economic crisis
have been aggravated by the recent floods.

3. Project Description:

The global economic crisis had varying impacts on the Asia and Pacific economies with
Thailand suffering significantly in tenns of reduced growth. The Thai economy contracted by
5.7% between October 2008 and March 2009. Analysis carried by the World Bank in 2009 and
2010 indicated that the government's stimulus package had not been effective in reaching the

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                    X
The project will fund small-scale rehabilitation of individual housing
and basic community infrastructure e.g. drainage maintenance, access
path or road upgrading/maintenance, water supply system
construction/maintenance, flood protection upgrading/maintenance, etc.
Such rehabilitation may results in minor and site-specific adverse
impacts on environment during construction i.e. disposal of
construction waste, dredged materials/spoil from drainage cleaning,
dust dispersion, nuisance noise, etc. In addition to the site-specific
impact, the impacts will be the short-term impacts (cease after
construction completion), and can be mitigated by mitigatory
me&S.ures. The project has, therefore, been assigned an
Environmental Assessment Category B.
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)                                                  X
The project locations will be in poor urban communities and there
will be no impacts on natural habitats.

The project locations will be in poor urban communities and there
will be no imp_acts on forests.

The project will not promote an increase use of pesticides.
Physical Cultural Resources (OPIBP 4.11)                                       X
The project activities involve rehabilitation of housing and
infrastructure in existing poor urban communities and will not affect
any physical cultural resources. Chance find procedures wili be
included in construction contracts.
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10)                                                X
This is an urban intervention and the screening carried out by the .
project team indicated that IP groups are not present in target areas.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The COOl has been working to support urban poor communities throughout Thailand since early
2000. The World Bank (WB) will provide COOl with capacity building support implemeni WB
safeguards policies and in line with the EMF and RPF. COOl staff will be in charge of the
compliance to the social and environmental safeguards requirements as stipulated in the grant
agreements of the project. Implementation progress reports will include a section for reporting
compliance with World Bank safeguards policies.

· 5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
  disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key stakeholders are urban poor communities who will be consulted through a participatory
planning process to define the small scale infrastructure and housing rehabilitation activities.
Project facilitation will emphasize the inclusion of vulnerable groups within the community and
environmental protection consideration. Participating communities will sign an agreement with
COOl, which will require them to support the participatory planning process. The project
principle of full transparency will be implemented through a program of disclosure of plans,
budgets and expenditures supplemented by independent civil society monitoring. The EMF and
RPF have been disclosed through the World Bank Info shop and in Country and will be further
included in SUP's Operations Manual.

of good planning and good environmental management practices. The project has, therefore,
been assigned an Environmental Assessment Category B.

In addition, during the construction of infrastructure it is possible that some land may need to be
acquired and some assets (such as trees) might be damaged to allow the most effective, efficient,
and beneficial use of resources. The SUP grant will support small scale rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure and housing damaged by the most recent floods at the end of 2012. Therefore,
need to build new structures is expected to be limited. However, the project will not be able to
exclude the need to on rare occasions, widen existing lanes with slightly wider surfaces, or to
build/upgrade drainage ditches. The so called right-of-way therefore needs to be increased by
one or two meters, and this can only happen if the land bordering the road is acquired or if there
is agreement on its voluntary donation to benefit the overall community. Similarly, it is possible
that the community may choose to invest in improvements in water/sanitation given the overall
conditions observed in target areas and it may not always be possible to locate these small scale
investments (pipe-laying, latrine construction) in communally held land. Therefore the project
has triggered OP 4.12 and prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework.


An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was developed. The EMF includes an
environmental safeguard screening and review process and safeguard actions, to be carried out
and applied to all sub-projects investment. The screening and review will take place prior to
submission of subproject proposals. It will also include set of simple mitigation measures for
typical small-scale rehabilitations works. The screening procedures in line with the EMF will be
included in the project's operation manual. The completed screening checklist and the mitigation
plan will be included as part of the sub-project documentation. The EMF will be used as part of
the overall project trajning for the implementing partner Community Organization Development
Institute (COOl) staff and community facilitators to ensure that the environmental mitigation
measures will be implemented to minimized the adverse impact from the project activities.
