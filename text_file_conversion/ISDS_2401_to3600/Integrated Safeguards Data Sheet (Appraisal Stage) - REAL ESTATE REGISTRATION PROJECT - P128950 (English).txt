                              The project development objective is to support development of a sustainable real estate registration system with harmonized land register and
                              cadastre records in urban areas of both the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Srpska.

                              3. Project Description

                              The Real Estate Registration Project (RERP) and its predecessor, the Land Registration Project (LRP 2007 - 2012), are part of a programmatic
Public Disclosure Copy




                              approach towards supporting a well functioning land administration system in the BH. Land rights registration in local courts, which operate under
                              the guidance of Entity level Ministries of Justice (MOJ), has greatly improved with support from the LRP. The RERP project will focus on the
                              scaling up of cadastre activities and on the sustainability of the land registration and cadastre institutions. The project activities focus on cadastre
                              and land registry data updating and harmonization and integration of this data, primarily in urban areas. The project has three components:
                              A)        Real estate registration data development
                              B)        Real estate registration infrastructure development
                              C)        Policy and institutional development, and project management

                              Component A: (18.3 million USD). Real estate registration data development will support land register and cadastre data harmonization on land,
                              buildings and rights based on the actual situation in the field. The objective is to establish up-to-date and interlinked land register and cadastre
                              databases, or integrated databases of real estate cadastre. The project will encourage and support the registration of legal rights in the land
                              register (in the FBH) or the real estate cadastre (in the RS) using project produced data. The component will ensure equal treatment of all citizens
                              regardless of their gender, ethnicity or social status by accompanying technical field work with raising public awareness, vulnerability mapping and
                              social monitoring functions.

                              Component B: (11.1 million USD). Real estate registration infrastructure development will continue LRP work in improving working conditions and
                              infrastructure in the cadastre offices across the country and in those few land registration offices in the FBH that were not targeted by LRP through:
                              office renovations and purchases; creation of digital archives; and provision of furniture and equipment. The office purchases planned in RS have
                              to be approved by the Land Committee of the World Bank. The objective is to improve working conditions, which will help to improve the quality of
                              customer services, the adherence of the service standards developed during LRP, and staff morale. Access to basic surveying technologies will be
                              provided to areas and offices that still rely on conventional methodologies, and sustainability of the recently installed Global Navigation Satellite
                              Systems (GNSS) network will be assured. Information technology investments will lead to further interlinking between real estate registers and
                              other public datasets making the data accessible online to a wide audience and in support of multiple uses. This will lead to incremental provision
                              of electronic online services and eventually to electronic conveyancing.

                              Component C: (4.7 million USD). Policy and institutional development, and project management will support policy and legal development in
                              support of reaching the project development objective. The objective is to enhance sustainability of the real estate registration. The component will
                              have a strong focus on institutional development and capacity building, addressing the long term challenges of sustainability and governance of
                              real estate registers and emphasizing financial sustainability, quality of service and client orientation and social vulnerabilities. Training for the
                              judiciary and land registration personnel on the new real estate legislation, regulations and procedures will be systematized in the RS and on other
                              related subjects in both the RS and the FBH. In FBH, the LRP supported training and education program that targeted the land administration
                              employees across the sector, i.e. in land registries, cadastre offices, planning authorities, etc., and this will continue. The program will ensure the

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 1 of 3
                               continuity of the training through seminars and workshops in the fields of law, management, ICT, cadastral science, physical planning, etc. The
                               Component will also include necessary project management and monitoring support. An impact evaluation (IE) technique will be used to assess
                               how citizens will benefit from the real estate registration programs. The intention is not only to demonstrate the impacts but also to use the
                               evaluation results for improving land registration services, and making urban planning and local property taxation more effective and sustainable.

                               registration with offices across the country. In FBH, the Geodetic Administration and MOJ operate land registration in a decentralized structure with
                               municipalities and local courts. RERP will not affect any forested areas, wetlands or areas of natural habitats, nor to facilitate the privatization of
                               State lands or forests. There were a number of displaced persons and refugees following the conflict between 1992 and 1995, but a Commission
                               for Real Property Claims of Displaced Persons and Refugees established under the Dayton Agreement dealt with 250,000 claims and finalized
                               their work by 2003. The project will only record existing rights of land holders and the project does not anticipate any resettlement.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The project is a category B for environmental assessment purposes given the specific rehabilitation infrastructure works related to Component
                                  B. A template Environmental Management Plan has been prepared targeting the main environmental impacts which include dust and noise
                                  generation, disturbances to other users of premises, work site safety, waste management. The EMP also includes precautionary provisions in
                                  cases of asbestos findings or other chance findings on site. All of these impacts are readily mitigated through the EMP prescribed mitigation
                                  measures. The project does not foresee any irreversible or large-scale environmental impacts.

                                  No resettlement or land acquisition will be undertaken, but there will be purchases of existing commercial premises in the RS.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   All impacts can readily be mitigated during construction on site. No long term impacts are anticipated.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                   The project could have been designed not to fund office renovations and office purchases. However, the land register and cadastre office
                                  renovations in the region have proven very efficient in improving working conditions and land governance, and the environmental impacts are
                                  readily manageable.
