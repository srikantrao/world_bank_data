                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed US$ 150 million Russia Export Support Project is a single-component project consisting of a credit line to Russian Export-Import
                              Bank (Roseximbank) as the borrower and implementing agency. Roseximbank would on-lend the funds directly to eligible exporters. Under the
                              project any Russian private exporting company producing industrial goods eligible to be covered by the export guarantee of the Russian
                              Federation would gain access to medium to long term financing for working capital and investment finance. In particular, the export industries that
                              could potentially benefit from this project includes: independent service suppliers to oil and gas, agriculture related industries, hi-tech and heavy
                              machinery. The proposed credit line would allow the targeted exporters to invest the proceeds of the loan into specific sub-projects to support their
                              finished products for export and modernize their export oriented production lines with added focus on technological modernization and innovations
                              in production processes and export products.

                              The State Specialized Roseximbank has been pre-selected as a financial intermediary for this project. The bank was established in 1994 as a
                              public policy vehicle to ensure domestic export support and promotion, develop import-substituting industries and encourage investments in
                              Russia#s economy. Within this mandate Roseximbank is committed to provide Russian exporters with access to long term loans, including pre-
                              export facilities, at lowest market rates. Also, Roseximbank has been entrusted by the Government of the Russian Federation to act as its agent
                              for the implementation of IFI supported projects. In particular, Roseximbank acted as a financial intermediary and project implementation unit for
                              two IBRD supported projects in Russia # Environmental Management Project and Part B of the Sustainable Forestry Pilot Project. Furthermore, as
                              project preparation progresses the World Bank will undertake a thorough due diligence to confirm the eligibility of Roseximbank as a financial
                              intermediary under Bank#s operational policy OP 8.30.

                              experience with WB safeguard               policies. Also, the project activities do not anticipate the triggering of any safeguard policies.
