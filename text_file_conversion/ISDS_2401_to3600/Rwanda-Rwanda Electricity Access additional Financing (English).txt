2. Project Objectives
The project development objective (PDO) is to improve access to reliable and cost-
effective electricity services for households and priority public institutions.

3. Project Description
5.      The proposed Additional Financing (AF) will support a portion of the Phase 2 of
the ongoing EARP and to raise the national access rate to at least 35 percent by 2017
(from 13 percent in 2012) by connecting an additional 48,000 households. In addition, the
AF will support scaling up of "green connections" associated with energy efficient
solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-
voltaic systems; low- cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low –
income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of
electricity to promote increased of us electricity by SMEs.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The parent project was rated Category B under the World Bank Policy on Environmental
Assessment (OP4.01), requiring a partial Environmental Assessment (EA). An
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared which
establishes a mechanism to determine and assess future potential environmental and
social impacts of the Ministry for Infrastructure planned investments/activities under the
proposed Project. The ESMF outlines a screening and review process, which will
determine whether a particular subproject will trigger a safeguard policy, and what
mitigation measures will need to be put in place. The screening and review process will
also ascertain if any subprojects have potentially significant impacts, which would
require more detailed study.This ESMF will continue to be used, as will the RPF
developed for the parent project. A Resettlement Policy Framework was developed to
provide guidelines on how the projects will avoid, manage or mitigate potential risks and
the process by which Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared and implemented
during the project implementation period(although the vast majority of compensation is
for lost trees and crops). There is no land acquisition required in the Bank-financed lines,
which lie outside Kigali. ARAPs have been prepared detailing compensation for lost
crops and trees. The compensation process for the parent project is expected to be
completed by December 2012.

 Overall, the parent project has had a positive impact on the environment in Rwanda.
Any adverse environmental impacts on the environment have not been significant. The
project does not pose major or significant risks to biodiversity, natural habitats and
wetlands as it does not fund activities in protected areas, national parks or wetlands.

 By reducing the demand for fuel wood and charcoal as the main source of energy, the
project has the potential to alleviate some of the root causes of deforestation in Rwanda
through the supply of a predictable and reliable electrical power supply. This will have a
cumulative positive impact on the conservation of forest ecosystems and their function as
a natural habitat.

 The project's promotion of solar hot water heaters and specific initiatives to buy down
connection costs for the poorest households including mainstreaming of the use of low
cost "ready boards" in homes, will reduce the consumption of polluting and costly fossil
fuels and the depletion of non-renewable biomass.

 Compact Fluorescent Lighting (CFLs) contain traces of mercury requiring special care
for transport, handling, disposal, and recycling. EWSA has worked with REMA to
determine how to best dispose of used CFL bulbs.

 Other project environmental impacts are short term and relate to the construction phase
of infrastructure.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
None expected.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The alternative of a private sector led scale-up program for the grid rollout program was
rejected taking into account several factors; (i) lack of a strong private sector base in the
country suited to the job at hand; (ii) Electrogaz (now EWSA) is the strongest sectoral
institution and has charted a remarkable turnaround while gearing up aggressively to
meet implementation challenges ahead. Significantly Electrogaz has been making greater
use of external local contractors to further accelerate the pace of new connections, and
under the project has in parellet mounted systematic efforts to build the capacity of local
contractors and related supply chains to support program implementation - simple
designs, procurement, and construction - in the medium term. Through working with the
public sector and local contractors, environmental and social safeguard capacity has been
built up domestically.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Effective implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Framework
required that adequate capacity enhancement within institutions and other stakeholders be
undertaken. There was training for project Environmental and Social Specialists. The
training covered implementation of the ESMF including project screening, impact
identification and analysis, Environmental Assessment procedures and requirements (EA
and EIA), design and implementation of mitigation measures at sub project level,
monitoring and review of environmental performance and reporting. However,
environmental and social staff are insufficient to handle the level of work. An SEA has
been prepared as an overall umbrella EA, to be supplemented by project-specific short
EMPs. However,the compensation process is extremely labour-intensive and the
safeguard staff should be augmented for this purpose.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Public consultation has been an on-going and regular activity through out the entire
project cycle.Public consultation took place during the preparation of the (i) the socio-
economic study undertaken to assess welfare improvements by the provision of
electricity to Vulnerable Peoples (ii) the compensation plan (and (iv) the environmental
impact assessment.
