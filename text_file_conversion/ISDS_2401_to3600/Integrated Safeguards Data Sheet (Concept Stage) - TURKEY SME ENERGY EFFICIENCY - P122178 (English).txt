                              C. Project Description

                              The project proposes to achieve the stated PDO by extending a US$200 million IBRD line of credit to three financial institutions (FIs),VakifBank,
                              HalkBank, and ZiraatBank , and a proposed GEF grant to provide a policy and market development platform within MENR for supporting the
                              scaling up of EE investments. The Project will aim to build upon and expand that FI's financial capacity to enable them to develop, assess and
                              monitor lending to EE investments through standardized lending process based on product lines (product line based financing). Additionally, the
                              Project will explore mechanisms to support development of domestic ESCO businesses, tailored to local market conditions, which can help
                              package projects together and assist clients with implementation. Technical assistance (TA) funds will be sought from the GEF to support
                              implementation of the credit line, as well as strengthen the policy and enabling environment for EE in these sectors. Some Clean Technology Fund
                              (CF) resources may also be allocated to this project. If the funds from CTF are made available, the funds are expected to be used as concessional
                              funding to encourage FIs to enter into the EE lending market using ESCOs involvement for technical due diligence and/or financing for EE
                              investments.

                              The project is expected to have two main components, along with project management functions:
                              1.        EE investments in SMEs
                              2.        Broad market development, policy support and capacity building

                              Each component is elaborated below.

                              Component 1: Energy efficiency investments in SMEs
                              [Estimated cost: US$367.1 million; proposed financing: IBRD Loan US$200 million, GEF US$2.8 million, FIs US$1.8 million, GDRE $2.0 million,
                              project owners/ESCOs US$60.5 million]

                              A US$200 million IBRD credit line will be provided to three FIs, VakifBank, HalkBank, and ZiraatBank, which are among the largest in Turkey. It is
                              expected they will be able to leverage their client bases and branch networks to develop the EE investments in the SME market on a national level.
                              For the SME sector, the project would seek to target key, energy intensive sub-sectors (e.g., metallic goods, textiles, furniture, food processing and
                              beverage, paper, and agro-processing) and then identify common technical retrofits in each subsector which can be replicated under a streamlined
                              appraisal method. The team will also explore the market for retrofits to improve energy use in commercial buildings (e.g., hotels/restaurants, office
                              buildings, shopping centers, warehouses).

                              In order to overcome the critical barrier of transaction costs for these smaller investments, the Project will include the following; (a) Standardized
                           loan application and appraisal procedures based on product lines to minimize administration costs. (b) Development of ESCO business model,
                           which will allow FIs to externalize the transaction costs through an intermediary with technical capacity to prepare implements and monitor the EE
                           investments. The development of ESCO business is expected to increase market penetration of EE investments and services, by ensuring viability
                           through technical service provisions and/or access of financing through aggregation of small transactions. One possible financial mechanism
                           identified, in addition to ESCOs, was equipment leasing. Leasing can be a common mechanism to use in underdeveloped EE markets, since it is
                           a well-known and mainstreamed financial product. It also allows clients to avoid mobilizing project equity and collateral requirements, typical of
                           commercial loans, since the equipment is owned by the leasing company.

                           Efforts would be taken to help ensure the successful implementation of the credit line and EE business development through the provision of
                           targeted TA such as: (i) pipeline developmen t and marketing, which may include performance-based pipeline development ESCO contracts; (ii)
                           select energy audits; (iii) development of 'product line' assessments, to allow simple assessments in single technical systems; (iv) technical due
                           diligence for early subprojects; (v) development of special EE project financing products or schemes, such as ESCO financing, equipment leasing,
                           trust /escrow accounts; (vi) developing enhanced systems for monitoring subproject energy savings; and (vii) bank training and other TA.

                           Component 2: Broad market development, policy support and technical assistance
                           [Estimated cost: US$9.725 million; proposed financing: GEF US$4.725 million, GDRE US$5.0 million]

                           Given the vast investment needs and limited size of the credit line, efforts will be made to broaden the market in three main areas: (i) awareness
                           and information dissemination among industrial and building owners, ESCOs, and financiers on EE opportunities and modalities and sharing
                           experience from the credit line; (ii) policy and market support for commercial bank EE lending and ESCO deve lopment; and (i ii) institutional
                           support to GDRE to support its EE policy and programs.

                           Two sub-components are envisaged under this component:

                           A) Market development, capacity building, and information dissemination. [Total cost: US$8.725 million, GEF US$4.225 million, GDRE US$4.5
                           million] - Under this sub-component, the following areas would be included: (i) awareness raising, training, and information dissemination to key
                           market actors (e.g., financiers, ESCOs, equipment suppliers, leasing companies, auditors, industrial and building owners, construction firms) on
                           the opportunities for EE and successful implementation schemes used in the credit line; (ii) ESCO development, through TA to GDRE to help
                           develop guides, template bidding documents, sample contracts, financing and M&V schemes, etc. and other efforts to foster viable ESCO models
                           within Turkey; and (iii) market st udies, assessments and options papers for future investment programs beyond the SME market, such as the
                           public and residential sectors.

                           B) Policy dialogue and capacity building within GDRE. [Total cost: US$1.0 million, GEF US$0.5 million, GDRE US$0.5 million] - Under this sub-
                           component, the following activities are envisaged: (i) review ongoing EE primary and supplemental policies to identify deficiencies and recommend
                           actions for their resolution with a focus on the SME and building sectors; (ii) review incentive and informational programs for EE and develop a set
                           of recommendations to improve utilization and impacts; (iii) provide support to design and launch an energy/EE indicator function within GDRE and
                           database covering all sectors; (iv) identify and assess other potential policies with high impact potential, such as building code implementation
                           linked with seismic upgrades, government green/EE procurement, minimum energy performance standards, etc. and develop program plans; and
                           (v) staff training.

                           Project Management. (Estimated cost: US$7.375 million; proposed financing: FIs US$6 million, GEF US$0.375 million, GDREUS$1 million) The
                           three FIs will each establish project coordination units (PCUs) which will be responsible for coordinating project activities. Similarly, GDRE within

                           MENR will create a project implementation unit (PIU), which will be responsible for managing their portion of the GEF grant.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           As this is an FI project, the location of the sub-projects are unknown at this time.


                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Halkbank, ZiraatBank and Vakifbank are currently working with WB with the 'Access to Finance for SMEs' project. OP 4.01 was also triggered in
                           that project and these banks are familiar for the preparation of environmental safeguard frameworks. They've also adopted the environmental
                           frameworks in their internal project assessment process. The environmental teams of these FIs also received safeguard trainings that were
                           provided by WB. There's also a possibility of using a leasing model for the project implementation and in the Operational Manual it will be made
                           clear that all safeguard requirements will also apply the leasing companies and the Operational Manuals will be included in the agreements
                           between the FI and the leasing companies.
