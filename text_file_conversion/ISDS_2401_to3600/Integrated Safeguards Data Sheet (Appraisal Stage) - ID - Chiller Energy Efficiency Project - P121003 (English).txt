                              ICEEP pursues this objective by supporting the installation of new energy efficient chillers with a grant and by a variety of promotional activities
                              that are designed to transform the chiller market in Indonesia. ICEEP is designed to overcome the barriers of investment in energy efficient chillers
                              through demonstration, awareness raising, capacity building and a partnership with a new KfW-supported program for emission reduction
                              investments (ERI).

                              While ICEEP’s grant component can only support a limited number of eligible chillers, the project’s promotional components target the wider chiller
                              market and generally awareness of energy efficiency opportunities in large buildings. ICEEP therefore includes the following four components: (i)
                              Financial incentive for chiller replacement, (ii) measurement and monitoring of chillers, (iii) technical assistance and awareness raising activities
                              and (iv) project management.

                              Component 1: Financial Incentives for Chiller Replacement – This component will provide a grant to chiller owners of approximately 15% of the
                              cost of a new energy efficient chiller – which will leverage the beneficiaries’ own funding contribution.

                              Component 2: Measurement and Monitoring – This component will measure and monitor the old and new chillers to determine their eligibility and
                              energy savings.

                              Component 3: Technical Assistance – This component will provide information to chiller owners and stakeholders on technical aspects of chiller
                              replacement and energy savings in buildings, assist the project management unit (PMU), promote the project and provide training.

                              Component 4: Project Management – This component covers operational and management costs and supports the PMU.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The project is an environment project to reduce CFC and HCFC emissions from old chillers, which damage the ozone layer and contribute to
                                 global climate change. The project will support the replacement of existing inefficient chillers with energy efficient chillers. Reduced energy
                                 consumption of new chillers will result in additional carbon dioxide emission reduction. The investment component of the Project will entail
                                 dismantling and removal of existing and installation of new industrial-sized chillers in large buildings (office buildings, malls …) and industrial
                                 facilities; the specific project sites will be confirmed during project implementation. The environmental impacts considered include ozone
                                 depletion, global climate change, as well as noise, solid waste, hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos, if any), handling of ODS-based refrigerants,
                                 and occupational health and safety standards. Chillers and their replacement can have local environmental and health impacts: noise

                                 (movement and operation of large equipment can generate local dust and noise pollution), liquids (lubricating oils and greases contained in old
                                 chillers together with the refrigerant), solid waste (scrap material and asbestos from buildings parts that may have to be removed to move
                                 chillers), destruction of ODS (the incineration of ODS, if not carefully controlled in an appropriate facility, can lead to release of harmful
                                 substances, such as dioxins and furans), emissions from power plants (chillers consume large quantities of electric power, however, the project
                                 will reduce electricity consumptions and ensure that old inefficient chillers cannot be reused). An environmental management framework has
                                 been developed for the project. The framework requires (i) an assessment of environmental impacts related to removal of old chillers, handling
                                 of used refrigerants, and installation of new equipment; (ii) compliance with proper procedures for all chiller replacement activities including
                                 monitoring and reporting, and (iii) preparation of an environmental management plan for each chiller replacement activity and site. The
                                 framework includes relevant information on safeguard policies and proper procedures, environmental impacts and mitigation measures,
                                 responsibilities and institutional arrangements and a template for environmental management plans.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  No negative indirect or long-term environmental or social impacts are foreseen by this operation.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The Ministry of Environment (MoE) has been empowered by the Government of Indonesia with overall responsibility for the implementation of
                                 the Montreal Protocol. The National Ozone Unit (NOU), established within MoE, is responsible for day-to-day operations of the Montreal
                                 Protocol Program under the guidance of a National Steering Committee, which includes the concerned ministries. Through the implementation
                                 of the ODS project, the NOU has gained experience with the implementation of Bank projects. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be
                                 established within the NOU for the day-to-day management of the project. The NOU has prepared an Environmental Management Framework
                                 (EMF) for the project. Potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures are identified in the EMF. They are reflected in the project
                                 design and must be included in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for each chiller replacement activity and site, a draft of which is
                                 included int he EMF. An EMP will be prepared by each chiller owner, reviewed by the NOU and becomes part of the legal agreement with the
                                 chiller owner. The EMP will spell out the environmental obligations and accountabilities of each chiller owner related to the chiller replacement
                                 activities at the site. The cost of the specified safeguard activities will be borne by each chiller owner and are included in the project budget as
                                 part of chiller owner's co-financing. The EMF includes capacity building and institutional strengthening measures, and provisions for the
                                 monitoring of EMP implementation. The PMU will organize technical workshops for chiller owners, suppliers and other stakeholders, which will
                                 include a section on the decommissioning of old chillers and the installation of new chillers, the proper handling of refrigerants, and other

                              replacement implementation plan and the EMP.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
