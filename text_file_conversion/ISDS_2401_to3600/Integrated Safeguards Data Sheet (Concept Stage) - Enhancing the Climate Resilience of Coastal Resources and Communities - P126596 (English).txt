                              B. Project Objectives

                              The project development objective is to reduce vulnerability to and enhance the capacity of natural ecosystems and coastal communities to
                              recover from impacts (chronic and acute) associated with climate change. This would result in the reduced exposure to future threats and facilitate
                              retreat/setback of key infrastructure inland of hazard zones where feasible; reduced risk of maladaptive (hard) infrastructure and other high profile
                              investments; and build social capital and capacity for autonomous adaptation in coastal communities. To achieve these outcomes, the project
                              would support: (i) implementation of revised Coastal Infrastructure Management (CIM) Plans in conjunction with other planning frameworks; (ii)

                              facilitation of increased public awareness and access to information about climate change; (iii) enhanced participation of civil society organizations
                              in climate change adaptation to enable them to design and implement more effective climate adaptation actions.

                              C. Project Description

                              To date in Samoa, the adaptation response to the exposure and risks identified has comprised mainly traditional engineering solutions centred on
                              the construction of seawalls. However, these have often been poorly planned, sited, constructed and maintained, and can sometimes work against
                              natural processes. An essential element of any strategy for adaptation of coastal communities to climate change, therefore, is enhancing the
                              resilience of natural ecosystems and resources on which coastal communities depend; i.e, the goods and services such as erosion control, storm
                              protection and water filtration. Therefore, the project would adopt a broad #ecosystem based approach# # or soft greener solutions - combined
                              with hard infrastructure to adaptation planning and interventions. Using an ecosystem based approach; a #ridge to reef strategy# will be employed
                              where investments supported under this project would be linked with activities already occurring under other projects in other parts of the
                              watershed.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Main island Upolu and Savai'i

                              On the ground activities will be focused on the revision and implementation of Coastal Infrastructure Management (CIM) Plans (Project Component
                              1) and supporting Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to implement adaptation projects (Project Component 2). It involves different types of
                              activities ranging from training to provision of infrastructures. The specific activities will not be known prior to appraisal as they will be identified
                              based on a review of CIM Plans which will only be completed during the first year of the project. Thus an Environmental and Social Management
                              Framework (ESMF) will be prepared to lay out the overall safeguards approach to manage the various subprojects. The project area will be
                              countrywide, encompassing 16 districts in total: eight adjoining the Apia - Airport road (where the first investment project supported by the Pilot
                              Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) is being implemented), and eight others, based on the CIM Plan prioritization exercise to be undertaken
                              during project preparation. Awareness raising and knowledge transfer activities are aimed country-wide.

                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              There is some familiarity with the Bank#s Safeguards requirements given the presence of ongoing projects funded by the Bank where the
                              safeguards instruments (Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework and Environmental Assessment Framework) have been developed.
                              Nevertheless, capacity shortcomings will be identified during preparation and appropriate capacity strengthening included in the project. The
                              existing frameworks shall be adapted, where relevant, to guide this project#s engagement and mitigate adverse impacts.

                              should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                A.            Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS would be prepared:
                                B.              For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS: March 15, 2012

                                C.   Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
                                     The specific studies and their timing should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                     An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be prepared to lay out the overall safeguards approach to manage
                                the various subprojects. Applicable instruments for subprojects known by appraisal will be prepared prior to appraisal; other instruments for
                                subprojects identified during implementation will be screened and prepared based on the ESMF. The ESMF will be built on the experiences
                                and lessons learnt from implementing the existing ESMF and Resettlement Policy Framework prepared by an ongoing Bank-financed project
                                (Samoa Post Tsunami Rehabilitation Project). The following key elements will be included in the ESMF:


                                i.        Screening and scoping requirements to identify the potential impacts from subprojects;
                                ii.       Measures to address potential environmental impacts from infrastructure interventions, by sound engineering design or
                                Environmental Codes of Practices (environmental specifications for construction contractors);
                                iii.      Chance Find Procedures;
                                iv.       Resettlement Policy Framework (in proportion to the potential impacts from the project);
                                v.        Process Framework (in proportion to the potential impacts from the project);
                                vi.       Public consultation for the ESMF and consultation requirements for sub-projects;
                                vii.      Capacity building plans for the client and other implementation agencies;
                                viii.     Institutional responsibilities for reviewing and approving subprojects, budget, monitoring and reporting arrangements for the
                                implementation of the ESMF;
                                ix.       A negative list subprojects, including activities that might cause significant impacts on natural habitats, PCRs, using materials of
                                important biodiversity values (e.g., coral reefs) for construction purposes.
