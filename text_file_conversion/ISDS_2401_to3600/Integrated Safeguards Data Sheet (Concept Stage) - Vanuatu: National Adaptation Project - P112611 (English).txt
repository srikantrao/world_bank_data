                              C. Project Description

                              The NAPA and the GFDRR/CCA stock-taking exercise identified a number of on-the-ground activities which simultaneously address Vanuatu➢? s
                              immediate adaptation needs and also tackle risks posed by natural disasters. Given the country ??? s limited capacity for implementation, it is
                              realistic to target only a few of these priorities for implementation under this first adaptation project. The sectors targeted are already experiencing
                              climate related impacts and the adaptation activities selected are those most likely to produce concrete results on the ground with in three to four
                              years, they would reduce risk directly and are important for the economy. The number of sites for implementation would be limited initially to the
                              main island, Santo, and one or two others which would be carefully selected during preparation based on risk profiles, with the possibility of scaling
                              up a nd replication to other islands after the mid term review. With a budget of $5.76m the project would comprise the following components:

                              Component 1:         Implementing climate resilient measures in the agriculture sector

                               Sixty five percent of the ni-Vanuatu people depend on agriculture, which is highly vulnerable to current climate variability from increased
                              temperatures, excessive rainfall and on some islands, drought, and to extreme weather events such as cyclones. This component would
                              implement pilot adaptation investments that would build the resilience of upland farmers, who are already experiencing the impacts of climate
                              variability, to cope with the impacts of climate variability and change as well as weather related disasters. It would focus on strengthening agr
                              icultural practices and developing sustainable livelihoods that are more resista nt to the impacts of climate change. Based on assessments of the
                              vulnerability, existing coping strategies and the adaptive capacity of farmers, specific adapta tion options to be supported in targeted communities
                              could include:

                               a.          Improved farming practices to conserve soil moisture and nutrients, to reduce run-off and control soil erosion (for example switching
                              cropping sequences, use of vegetative or other control structures, altering cropping patterns and mix, better use of organic and inorganic
                              fertilizers, crop rotation), rainwater harvesting (for example, construction of simple tanks to store rainwater, check dams), diversifying into agro-
                              forestry; and

                               b.        early warning and monitoring systems to provide timely and relevant information to assist farmers in watershed areas to cope with
                              flooding. Given their dependency on rainfed agriculture seasonal forecasting would also help to increase productivity

                              Component 2: Strengthening adaptation in coastal areas

                              A large proportion of Vanuatu➢? s rural population is concentrated on the coast, often in low lying areas. Coastal erosion and inundation are
                           severe in many areas and pose real threats to human lives, settlements and coastal infrastructure. Vanuatu has re-located a village at risk from
                           coastal flooding. Water security is an issue in these often isolated communities due to occasional droughts and salt water intrusion to aquifers. The
                           Regional UNDP-GEF supported Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change Project (in preparation) is expected to climate proof coasta                 l
                           infrastructure in Vanuatu. This component would therefore address the following complementary issues in a few selected coastal communities:

                            a.      Scaling-up successful practices such as roof water harvesting and storage to address water security issues in selected at-risk coastal
                           communities. The feasibility of mini-desalination plants would also be examined;

                            b.       Wetland restoration, replanting coastal vegetation and indigenous aforestation methods to reduce flooding, coastal erosion and the
                           impact of storm surges; .

                            c.        Hazard risk mapping to demarcate high risk areas and specifically help coastal communities to avoid expansion of settlements into flood
                           prone areas. This activity could also involve helping the Ministry of Lands, Geology and Mines to implement a hazard and risk mapping exercise
                           for the town of Luganville, which is a fast expanding coastal community and the second largest town in Vanuatu. In the longer term, establishing
                           the capacity for mainstreaming hazard risk mapping in town planning would be required for sustainable development in rapidly growing regions of
                           Vanuatu.

                            Component 3: Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation

                            Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation would be based in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The Ministry➢? s mandate
                           covers a large per centage of the scope of work envisaged under the project and it is already championing climate change adaptation in the
                           country. The coordination function would be integrated into the Ministry and not established as a separate unit. The component would provide
                           overall support to the project including technical, social and economic studies, workshops and training, and technical assistance. The Nati onal
                           Advisory Committee on Climate Change, which is chaired by the Vanuatu Meteo rological Office, would be the project Steering Committee to
                           oversee implementat ion and provide technical guidance. The project➢? s M&E system would rely as mucha s possible on existing arrangements
                           for M&E which could be strengthened with pro ject resources. A detailed M&E plan would be prepared during preparation.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           Countrywide - Specific sites to be determined duration preparation. Both the project sites and the type of activities to be implemented would be
                           selected so that there is no involuntary resettlement.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Borrower is presently implementing a Bank supported regional renewable energy project but as this is mainly supporting sectoral reform they
                           have little experience with addressing Safeguard Issues. A detailed assessment of insitutional capacity for managing safeguard requirements
                           would be carried out during preparation and any required strengthening included.

                                                                                              coastal communities and possibly also to changing cropping patterns to take into
                                                                                              account changing climate. All of these are small in scale with temporary and
