                              The development objective of the TARP is to reform the tax administration to become more efficient and effective in collecting revenue while
                              providing quality service to taxpayers. Specifically, the project aims to: (i) enhance the level of voluntary compliance; (ii) strengthen the
                              effectiveness of the Tax Committee to fight tax evasion and reduce the size of the shadow economy; (iii) strengthen the institutional and human
                              capacity in order to improve the professionalism of tax officials and reduce the avenues for corruption.; and (iv) modernize processes that would
                              reduce administrative cost for the government and compliance burden for taxpayers, thereby improving Tajikistan's business environment and

                              C. Project Description

                              A.           Description
                                It is envisaged that the project would consist of four components, the implementation of which would be managed by different units of the Tax
                              Committee.
                                   Component 1: Institutional Development. This component will aim to build capacity for strategic planning and organizational management;
                              improve the revenue forecasting and tax analysis capacity of the MOF and TC; provide support for restructuring and consolidating the organization
                              to match functional requirement; develop human resource management information system, staff training, distance education and e-learning; and
                              focus on motivation, honesty and integrity of tax officials.
                                   Component 2: Process Modernization and Operational Development. This component will aim at streamlining business processes based on
                              self assessment and risk management; strengthening tax functions including registration, return processing, collection, audit, and appeals;
                              enhancing the capacity of the large taxpayers’ office, arrear collection; improving taxpayer service and education; and development of a modern
                              call center).
                                   Component 3: Information Technology Infrastructure Development. This component will attempt to upgrade IT infrastructure in the TC to
                              develop an integrated tax management system which will unify business processes and support e-filing, e-payment, web-based taxpayer
                              information; improve telecommunications and connectivity; and develop a data management system (with data mining, data warehousing and data
                              exchange capabilities).
                               Component 4: Project Management. This component would help manage the change that would take place, ensure the timely and efficient
                              implementation of each activity, and interact with all local and international entities involved in project execution.

                              Preliminary cost estimate for the proposed Bank-funded project is $12-15 million. The overall implementation of GoT’s Tax Reform Program is
                              expected to cost about of $25.0 million over 4-5 years. Out of this, the GoT is expected to finance around $9 million towards the cost of buildings,
                              refurbishment and other civil works. The Government funding for the civil works is parallel to the project and not a co-financing of the project. The
                              approximate cost for IT development is about $12 million and for TA on organizational restructuring and process modernization is about S4 million.
                              ADB also plan to provide additional financing around $2-4 million in 2013-14 after completion of their current TA activities ending in 2012.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The proposed project is rated as Category 'C' for environmental purposes. The project does not envisage any civil construction or land acquisition.
                              None of the envisaged activities will require any special permission on environmental issues. Hence the proposed project will not be subject to
                               Environmental Impact Assessment procedures or any permission relating to environmental protection.
