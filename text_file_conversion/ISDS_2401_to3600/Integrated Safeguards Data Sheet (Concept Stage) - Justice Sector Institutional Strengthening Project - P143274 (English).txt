                           B. Project Objectives
                           The project development objective (PDO) is to strengthen the operational effectiveness of, and
                           improve public trust in, the selected entities proposed to be supported by the project.

                           These entities comprise, for the purpose of the project, the judiciary (including the Supreme Court),
                           the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning, the Ministry of Regional
                           Development, the Institute of Justice and the Presidential Administration.
                           C. Project Description
                           As outlined in previous sections, the key entities relevant for the justice sector – and hence for the
                           proposed JSISP - are the Supreme Court (SC - which oversees the judiciary); the MOJ; the MEBP

                           the IJ; and the Presidential Administration (PA - which guides policy and strategy formulation,
                           oversees implementation and coordinates the activities of entities on issues of strategic national
                           importance). The task team is coordinating with Kazakhstan’s other development partners involved
                           in the justice sector (e.g. European Union), to enable the JSISP to complement their programs and
                           avoid duplication and overlaps.

                           The proposed project is envisaged as a technical assistance project, to provide capacity-building and
                           M&E support to the selected entities over a 5-year period. The focus of the proposed assistance is to
                           enhance their performance, hence whenever possible the proposed activities aim to support the
                           agencies’ own strategic/modernization plans and programs. However, across the entities there are
                           common threads to the proposed support, e.g. an emphasis on capacity-building to (a) obtain periodic
                           public feedback on agency performance and service delivery; (b) conduct institutional self-
                           assessments; (c) develop strategic plans and programs based on (a) and (b); and (d) develop and/or
                           strengthen agency performance indicators and a management dashboard, and build/strengthen agency
                           M&E capacity. In addition, there are agency-specific capacity building priorities that this focused
                           project will attempt to address.

                           Kazakhstan’s authorities envisage the proposed JSISP as a strategic instrument to strengthen the
                           institutional capacity and performance of the selected justice sector entities, and deliver measurable
                           results. Because of the strategic importance attached to this agenda, the Presidential Administration
                           (PA) and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) are overseeing project preparation, and
                           intend to oversee implementation and results monitoring.

                                      Because the Project is mainly for technical support, no safeguard-related studies are required.
