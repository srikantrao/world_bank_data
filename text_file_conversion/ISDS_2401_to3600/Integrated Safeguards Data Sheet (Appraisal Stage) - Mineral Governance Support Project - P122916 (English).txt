                              exception of revenue management. The project will also support the development of a framework that promotes regional and local development of
                              mining areas and "demand for good governance" (DFGG) activities. All components will require strengthened institutional collaboration between
                              Ministry of Mines and other ministries, such as finance, transport, environment, decentralization, and private sector development. This will be done
                              through four main proposed components:

                              Component A: Facilitating access to mineral resources ($6.0 million)

                              This component will focus on supporting the Government of Guinea in developing the capacities and systems to facilitate negotiation and
                              contracting with private sector mining companies including mining ancillary infrastructure. It will further strengthen the governance and institutional
                              structure of SOUGIPAMI and its technical, legal, and financial capacities to engage with mining projects sponsors.

                              A1. State co-owned mining/infrastructure development facilitation. In light of the recently adopted policy to increase state ownership of mines and
                              associated infrastructure (rail and road), this sub-component would provide the following: (a) Support to the Socit Guinenne du Patrimoine
                              Minier (SOGUIPAMI) to clarify in an official decree its role vis--vis the Ministries of Mining, Transport and Finance with independence from the
                              state's regulatory functions and put in place the governance structure and capacity in order to enable it to participate as a partner and a
                              shareholder in large-scale mining investments; and (b) Transaction advisory support to relevant government entities regarding available options
                              for financing, ownership, access fees and operating costs of mines and infrastructure to enable informed decision making; and to provide relevant
                              technical, legal and financial advisory services related to mining assets potential financing and management. This work will build on assistance
                              provided through the EI-TAF and PPIAF funded activities in the mining sector.

                              A2. Mining regulatory reform. This sub-component will: (a) assess and update where relevant the environmental and social laws, regulations,
                              standards and systems pertaining to the mining sector; (b) assess and update where relevant mining related infrastructure law, regulations,
                              standards and systems, including the development of a model BOT convention for mining ancillary infrastructure; and (c) address as appropriate
                              other potential regulatory gaps on mining revenues collection administration issues, health and safety standards, artisanal and small-scale mining
                              standards; community development and gender issues; and local procurement of goods and services.

                              Component B. Institutional strengthening for mineral management (US$9.5 million)

                              This component will focus on strengthening the Government of Guinea's (GoG) capacities to license, control and monitor technical, environmental,
                              and financial compliance of mining operations. This will include the following:

                              B.1. The Ministry of Mines (MMG) will be supported by (i) socioeconomical analytical work and consensus building activities, ii) a high level

                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 4
                         roundtable between Government, private sector, and CSO. (ii) the cleaning up and strengthening of the cadastre through an assessment and
                         alignment of procedures and existing titles to the law; (iii) the setting up of a Panel of Experts (PoE) to provide the MMG and the Commission
                         Nationale des Mines (CNM) with independent professional opinion; (iv) the development of operational manuals and provision of relevant training,
                         hardware and software to support the various divisions and units in the ministry including the cadastre to enable online access of information by
                         prospective investors and other mining stakeholders; and (v) support to communication activities for the MMG and education institutions in
                         engaging with mining companies for the development of mining curricula or the development of a Business Plan for the Bok school of Mines.

                         small scale miners on environmental and social aspects of their activities; and (iv) conduct and implement selected recommendations from SESA.

                         B.3. Ministry of Finance on mineral tax and revenue collection. This will seek to enhance the mineral tax collection framework through the: (i)
                         development of manuals mapping out physical and financial risk control points; (ii) training the relevant units on the specifics of mining revenues
                         and potential tax evasion mechanisms; and (iii) when relevant the assessment of the economic viability of transactions in the mining sector.

                         B.4. Ministry of Transport: (i) support to the regulatory function (unit) on mining ancillary infrastructure, and the development of appropriate control
                         and monitoring manuals and standards, and (ii) capacity strengthening in infrastructure network economics and logistics as well as training and
                         equipment of the MT to fulfil their mandate in relation to the mining sector.

                         Component C: Promoting economic development of mining areas and demand for good governance (DFGG) ($2.5 million)

                         This component will focus on sustainable investments. This will include the facilitation of regional and local development plans through
                         partnerships with the private sector, and the strengthening of mechanisms for demand for good governance (DFGG). This component will have a
                         regional aspect, in that it will most likely focus on at least one "growth corridor," (iron-ore in the South-East or Bauxite/Alumina in the North-West).
                         It will build on work carried out under previous studies, and seek synergies with IFC and other donor activities.

                         C1. Public-private partnerships (PPPs)-led regional and local development: The geographical concentration of iron ore and bauxite deposits,
                         provide an opportunity for the development of two potential "growth corridors," if appropriate constraints to non-mining productive and employment
                         generation sectors are identified and addressed. This sub-component would include the following activities: (a) Development of regional and local
                         development plans to facilitate and support the government in developing PPP investment plans to promote other sectors of the economy and
                         seek partnerships with mining companies and local communities; (b) Strengthening of participatory capacities of local communities, CSOs, and
                         local and regional governments to engage with mining companies and identification and mobilization of resources for the development and
                         realization of economic plans; and (c) as appropriate, engagements with mining companies for the implementation of communities earmarked
                         financial resources and CSR funds to advance sustainable investments.

                         C2. Strengthening demand for good governance (DFGG): The proposed project will seek to strengthen transparency, accountability, and
                         participation of stakeholders in the management of the mining sector. Specifically, it will address availability of information, disclosure and
                         transparency to enhance public understanding of the policies and management of the mining sector. It will also strengthen and enhance the
                         capacities of civil society, media, and parliamentarians on mining governance, and sustainability to meaningfully participate in the debate around
                         policies and management of the sector. CSOs will be trained on how to conduct independent environmental monitoring within the Prefectoral
                         Environmental Monitoring Committees, as well as on the use of revenues at the local and regional level, social and community development
                         agreement benefits. DFGG analysis, activities, and M&E will be designed to ensure that they increase the voice and participation of both men and

                               Technical Assistance Project
                               For a TA project which will finance the preparation of a specific safeguards instrument, please indicate type of document disclosed, if any.

                               A Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) will be undertaken to amongst other identify the environmental and social constraints,
                               including gender-disaggregated impacts, to the development of the mining sector in Guinea; and ways in which its impacts may be mitigated. It
                               will assess the adequacy of the current environmental and resettlement policies and recommend a time-bound action plan to address the most
                               urgent mining related environmental and social issues. The Project will work on improving the environmental legal and regulatory frameworks, the
                               capacity of the ME and on sensitization of CSO, communities and artisanal miners on social and environmental laws and impacts of mining. As a
                               result it is expected to positively contribute to the overall environmental management in the country. As a technical assistance operation, the
                               Project will not generate significant direct environmental or social impacts, as it does not finance any mining or mining preparatory works, or
                               zoning for specific projects with identifiable impacts.

                               The TOR for the SESA were prepared and published in country by the Government, and were submitted to InfoShop for disclosure
