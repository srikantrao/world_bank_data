                              The proposed project will support PESRP II, which aims to increase school participation and attainment, and improve the measurement of student
                              achievement. Success of the project in meeting its objectives will be measured by the following outcome indicators:

                              --           Overall Net Enrollment Rate (NER), primary level (6-10 age group)
                              --           Overall Net Enrollment Rate, middle level (11-13 age group)

                              C. Project Description

                              Education development is one of the government's top development priorities. The high and steady attention to education given by the political and
                              bureaucratic leadership, reflected in the recent adoption of an Education Sector Reform Road map, signals a level of concern and seriousness that
                              bodes well for introducing a well-designed and strongly-backed reform program which underpins the aspirations in the Road map. The government
                              has requested the Bank and other Development Partners to provide financial and technical and advisory support for the design and
                              implementation of initiatives and interventions under PESRP II.

                              The proposed PDO is in line with the government's objectives for PESRP II. The design principle that the government is using is to select initiatives
                              and interventions that increase the efficiency and effectiveness of sector expenditures. Applying this principle, the government plans to be
                              selective and careful in its choices, focusing on: (1) modifying/refining the design of existing initiatives or introducing new initiatives that are known
                              or viewed to be cost-effective and likely to generate significant returns; and (2) strengthening program management, implementation, monitoring
                              and evaluation, oversight and engagement at various levels (province, district, tehsil, school, community) to improve service delivery performance.
                              The areas under consideration by the government for PESRP II include school budgets, a strengthening monitoring and evaluation, strengthening
                              information and communications strategy for increased stakeholder awareness and engagement, teacher performance pay, conditional cash
                              transfers and scholarships, private school vouchers, teacher management (recruitment, performance management, professional development,
                              licensing), strengthening assessment/examination systems; strengthening fiscal and budget management, district education management reforms,
                              and strengthening school councils (community- and school-based parent-teacher associations).

                              The government's ongoing design process for PESRP II is highly collaborative. The government is leading the exercise and has formed design
                              teams for each potential reform area composed of members from the School Education and Finance Departments and the Planning and
                              Development Board, as relevant. The design teams include members from the Bank and other Development Partners. The objectives of each
                              design team are to work out the design, along with implementation and institutional plans and arrangements, and budgetary, monitoring and
                              evaluation, technical assistance, risk management needs. At various stages during the design process, consultations will be held with a wide range
                              of relevant stakeholders, including district government officials (including district education management), teachers, and present and potential end-
                              beneficiaries (parents and students).

                              A specific investment credit is proposed that uses a sector-wide approach to support PESRP II. The project replicates the general design features
                              of PESP, which closes on June 30, 2012. The proposed project will disburse against selected, predefined program implementation progress and
                              performance targets, referred to as Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs), agreed with the government. The DLIs will be formulated to promote
                           critical reforms and initiatives in PESRP II that would generate returns in the short term in terms of participation and achievement gains, and also
                           promote activities that build robust, sustainable systems that would generate returns over the medium to long term. The government seeks to
                           structure a reform program that strikes an appropriate balance between its short-term "target-reaching" and longer-term "system-building"
                           objectives.

                           The proposed project will reimburse expenditures referred to as Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs). The selected EEPs will constitute sizeable
                           and/or meaningful government education expenditures --the latter based on the value of their expected contribution towards the PDOs and DLIs. A

                           TA component will finance selected, well-defined capacity-building activities, efforts to strengthen fiduciary, safeguard, and monitoring and
                           evaluation systems, and independent, rigorous validations and operational and impact evaluations of selected DLI-associated initiatives. Similar to
                           PESP, the financial management arrangements for the proposed project will use the government's own system for budget execution, accounting,
                           internal controls, financial reporting, and auditing. Fiduciary arrangements and oversight will cover all EEPs and TA expenditures. The fram ework
                           for environmental and social management will cover PESRP II in its entirety.

                           While the focus of PESRP II will be on primary and secondary education (grades 1-10), the government has argued that its overall education
                           development agenda can benefit greatly from a tighter link between these levels of schooling and its vocational training programs, which typically
                           require completing secondary schooling. In a major move, the government recently provided autonomy to the Punjab Technical Education and
                           Vocational Training Authority (P-TEVTA). The government now seeks to introduce market-driven vocational training in selected centers and trades,
                           and would like to phase in this initiative over time and space, accompanied by a strong monitoring and evaluation system. Given the rationale of
                           further strengthening backward and forward linkages between schooling and training, a single results-based investment operation may be
                           prepared to support the government's proposed efforts in primary and secondary education as well as vocational training.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The proposed project will be implemented across the entire province, which has several types of geophysical characteristics. Geographically, the
                           province can be divided into five zones: (i) Northern Hilly Region including Murree hills and adjoining areas; (ii) Potohar Plateau including
                           Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Jhelum districts; (iii) Central Plains which mostly consist of river interfluves and includes the districts of Lahore,
                           Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sheikhupura, Sahiwal and others; (iv) desert like plains in South Punjab, including Multan, Rahimyar Khan and
                           Bahawalpur districts; and (v) Cholistan and Thal Deserts. The Northern Hilly region is prone to earthquakes, whereas the river interfluves
                           experience occasional flooding during the monsoon periods. Water availability is a problem in the Thal and Cholistan deserts, while water quality --
                           both surface and ground water -- is a serious issue in and around most of the urban centers of the province. Groundwater is generally available,
                           though at varying depths, in the Potohar Plateau, Central Plain and Desert Like Plains. The quality of groundwater is generally poor in the southern
                           parts of the province.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The institutional arrangements that already exist to implement the safeguard requirements of the current Punjab Education Sector Project (PESP)
                           (Credit Numbers 4586-PK and 4890-PK), will be continued for the proposed project. These arrangements include: (i) designating the Deputy
                           Director (M&E) as the environmental and social focal point, with overall responsibility for fulfilling the safeguard requirements of the proposed
                           project; and (ii) a full-time Environment Officer responsible for implementing various activities required for safeguard compliance. Capacity-building
                           for implementing the safeguard policies is one of the key functions of the Environment Officer.
