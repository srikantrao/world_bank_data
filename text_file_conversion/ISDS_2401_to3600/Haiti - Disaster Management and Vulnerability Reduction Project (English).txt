2. Project Objectives:

The Project development objective is to enhance Haiti's disaster response capacity and the
resilience of critical transport infrastructure.

3. Project Description:

Component One: Natural Hazard Risk Assessment and Analysis (US$3.5 million)

Since the earthquake, resources have been directed to improving the national level awareness of
natural hazard risk and to better understand related vulnerabilities. Given the technical nature of
these activities, and the weak capacity within the GoH, a key challenge is to institutionalize
increased awareness of disaster risk. This component would build on the success and results of
the multi-hazard risk assessment initiative launched by the Bank by strengthening the
institutional capacity of the implementing Line Ministries to incorporate natural hazard risks into
development planning and collection of disaster risk data under a technical assistance program.

Based on the emerging needs of line ministries and an analysis of the results from the existing
hazard risk assessment, new disaster risk data, focusing on some key issues, would be acquired
to fill current knowledge gaps. Filling these knowledge gaps may include support and capacity
building activities for the GoH, aiming to improve the understanding of hazard risk of the line
Ministries so as to better inform their decision-making processes. This component would finance
extensive technical assistance along with data collection and interpretation, and if necessary,
small works.

This component would finance extensive technical assistance along with data collection and
interpretation.

Component Two: Enhanced Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Response (US$14.5
million)

Haiti has launched several initiatives over the past five years to increase its capacity to prepare
for, and respond to, adverse natural events, supported by different donors including the Bank,
UNDP, IDB, EU, WFP, and IOM. In particular, the Bank financed ERDMP (P090159) has
supported the establishment of CCPCs. Further investment is required to consolidate the
improvement in disaster preparedness and emergency response. Identified areas of intervention
include strengthening the DPC, the expansion of the CCPCs to cover the entire country,
improvement of the communication network and decision-support system for early warning and
emergency response, and implementation of a pilot shelter management program to identify and
retrofit existing shelters.

This component would finance consultancies and services to strengthen the institutional capacity
of the DPC and the nation-wide network of CCPCs, the acquisition of goods for the
improvement of the national emergency communication network, as well as works to support the
DPC training center and the pilot emergency shelter program. This component would consist of
three core activities:

Subcomponent 2.1 Institutional Development of the DPC and Expansion of its CCPC Network:
This subcomponent would finance: (i) improving the capacity of the DPC’s operational
efficiency; (ii) carrying out the construction of a multi-purpose center for the DPC, to serve,
among other purposes, as national Civil Protection training center facility; (iii) building the
capacity of the existing Comité Communal de Protection Civile (CCPC), and establishing new
CCPCs; and (iv) carrying out simulation exercises to, inter alia, evaluate the operational capacity
of the CCPCs, and the Departmental and Central branches of the Civil Protection System as
defined by the National Response Plan.

Subcomponent 2.2 Communication Network and Decision-support System: This subcomponent
would finance improving the communication network and decision-support system, including: (i)
establishing alert and communication protocols with the national disaster response system , with
a particular emphasis on the dissemination of warnings from the central level to the community
level (and vice-versa); (ii) developing a civil protection communication system and procurement
of alert equipment; and (iii) provision of training for the use of CCPCs’ early warning system or
communication protocols and equipment.

Sub-component 2.3 Pilot Emergency Shelter Rehabilitation and Construction: This
subcomponent would finance the carrying out of: (i) a comprehensive functional and structural
assessment of the national shelter network, resulting in a country-wide inventory of emergency
shelters; (ii) standard and functional designs for emergency shelter; and (iii) rehabilitation and
construction of priority shelters, as defined by selection criteria to be established in the shelter
management plan.

Component 3: Rehabilitation of Vulnerable and Damaged Critical Transport Infrastructure
(US$37 million)

To leverage the improved understanding of risk, and to ensure sustainability of the institutional
strengthening and capacity building efforts in previous and ongoing operations, the proposed
Project would finance structural investments in the transport sector and other investments to
protect local access to the national backbone road network. This component would focus on
strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and
Communication (MTPTC), and other relevant ministries, departments and agencies, at both the
central and local level, as well as explore innovative mechanisms in which public entities, such
as the National Center of Equipment (CNE), and private sector entities can be mobilized quickly
by the MTPTC for small emergency reconstruction or urgent maintenance works. Activities are
broken into three subcomponents that complement investments under the ongoing Bank financed
EBRVRP (P114292, approved in November 2009, and closing in December 2013), and the
IIERP (P120895, approved in March 2010).

Sub-component 3.1 Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building: This subcomponent
would finance capacity building activities focused on strengthening the institutional capacity of
the MTPTC for: (i) identifying vulnerabilities in the transport sector; (ii) building resiliency in
the transport sector; (iii) improving emergency response capacity to restore access to isolated
areas; (iv) promoting road safety; and (v) increasing the efficiency of the road maintenance
system.

Sub-component 3.2 Critical Spot Interventions and Reconstruction Investments in Transport
Infrastructure: This subcomponent would finance the carrying out of reconstruction and/or
reinforcement of identified investments in the transport sector, to be prioritized based on the
principle of greatest loss avoidance. Works will generally focus on rehabilitating damaged assets
before they fall to a level beyond repair. The works would include, inter alia, bridge and road
repairs or reconstruction, as well as riverbank and road protection works and all designs will
integrate road safety best practices. Urban road repairs, including, inter alia, rehabilitation and
pavestone works, would also be financed under this subcomponent, in addition to a pilot coastal
road protection project.

Sub-component 3.3 Investments to Protect Local Access to the Main Road Network: Identifying
critical investments to protect the local access to the main road network, and carrying out of the
design, rehabilitation, reconstruction and/or other work as may be required to protect said
investments. These investments would be identified by MTPTC in coordination with the
departmental delegates, the CCPC committees, and the MTPTC’s regional offices (the
Departmental Directorates: DDTPs). Investments would be designed and implemented with the
support of the MTPTC’s regional offices.
Component Four – Emergency Response and Recovery (US$1 million)

This component would facilitate rapid response upon occurrence of an Emergency, including, the
carrying out of emergency infrastructure reconstruction, rehabilitation and associated studies
(Emergency Response Activities). Following an adverse natural event that causes a major
natural disaster, the GoH may request the Bank to re-allocate project funds to support emergency
response activities. This component would draw resources from the unallocated expenditure
category and/or allow the GoH to request the Bank to re-categorize and reallocate financing from
other project components to partially cover emergency response and recovery costs. Additional
funds could also be made available through this window for the same purpose.

Disbursements would be made against a positive list of critical goods or the procurement of
goods, works, and consultant services required to support the immediate response and recovery
needs of the GoH. All expenditures under this component, should it be triggered, will be in
accordance with BP/OP 8.0 and will be appraised, reviewed and found to be acceptable to the
Bank before any disbursement is made.

If not disbursed 12 months before the closing date of the proposed Project, the amount of US$1
million can be reallocated to finance activities under the other proposed Project components.

Component Five - Project Management and Implementation Support (US$4 million)

This component would finance the costs associated with strengthening and developing the
institutional capacity for Project management, coordination, implementation, and monitoring and
evaluation, as well as those costs associated with supporting the project implementing agencies
compliance of the mitigation measures identified in the Operational Risk Assessment Framework
(ORAF).

Component 5 would be divided into two subcomponents. Sub-component 5.1 would finance the
strengthening of the capacity of the UCP-DPC for: (a) overall coordination of the Project
including, consolidation of financial and progress reports; and (b) management, coordination,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Components 1 and 2 of the Project. Sub-
component 5.2 would finance the strengthening of the capacity of the UCE-MTPTC for
management coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of Components 3 and 4 of
the Project. Activities financed under this component would include training and staffing with
institutional strengthening purposes, audits, equipment, vehicles, operational costs and other
activities associated with project execution.

This project is an Emergency Recovery Loan processed in accordance with Bank Operational
Policy / Bank Procedures 8.00.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The works for this project will occur throughout Haiti. Rehabilitation and
reconstruction/construction activities will consist of (i) construction of shelters; (ii) repair of
critical points of infrastructure damaged by adverse natural events (e.g. Hurricane Tomas); (iii)
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure or critical points in order to improve the resiliency; (iv)
new works to support an all-weather transportation network; (v) small works to improve local
access to the backbone network; and (vi) a specific subcomponent is dedicated to urgent works
in Port-au-Prince: urban road repairs, rehabilitation and pavestone works. Road network repair
activities will however largely take place in southern Haiti, which is the area most affected by
adverse natural events. The specific road networks to be repaired are not yet selected and will be
screened and identified by the MTPTC.

5. Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialists on the Team:
Nyaneba Nkrumah (LCSEN)
Fabio Pittaluga (LCSSO)
6.. Safeguard Policies Triggered (please explain why)                    Yes   No
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) In this Project,                    X
rehabilitation and construction works could potentially have minor
negative environmental and/or social impacts. Negative
environmental impacts may be related to waste/debris removal and
disposal, worker and fire safety, soil removal and erosion, increased
levels of dust and noise, oil spill or leakage from machinery etc.
Despite this, the environmental and social impact of the Project is
expected to be limited because the works are small in scale and the
Project will adequately screen to ensure these works do not occur in
environmentally sensitive sites. To ensure that all possible impacts
are mitigated, an ESMF will be prepared under O.P 8.0 within 6
months of effectiveness. Any negative impact will be mitigated and
the environmental specialist will follow up regularly with reports on
the environmental aspects of the Project and implementation of the
ESMF. The ESMF will detail the type of training and capacity
building that the environmental specialist will undergo to ensure that
there is adequate monitoring, reporting and supervision.
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) The Project is not expected to                   X
impact critical natural habitats. However, because the sites are still
unknown at the concept stage, the ESMF will also include screening
procedures to ensure that rehabilitation and construction of shelters
grid will not involve unprecedented degradation or conversion of
critical natural habitats. An effort will also be made to ensure that
non-critical habitats are not impacted by the Project.
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) This is not triggered because there are very              X
few significant forests remaining in Haiti and the project sites are
not envisioned to be within forested areas. Despite this, a screening
checklist will be used to ensure that any remaining forest cover is
untouched.
Pest Management (OP 4.09) There are no pesticides used in this                 X
Project.
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) It is expected that the         X
proposed Project will not involve any sites with archeological,
paleontological, historical, religious or other area of unique natural
value as defined under the policy. However, as part of the general
EMSF to be developed for the Project, chance finds procedures
would be included.
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) There are no indigenous people                 X
in the Project area
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). Social impacts may              X
include land acquisition and minor resettlement. A Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared 6 months after
effectiveness to assess potential impacts. The RPF will include: (i)
principles, review of policy regulations; (ii) institutional
arrangements, roles and competences; (iii) consultations disclosure
and grievance redress mechanisms; (iv) monitoring and reporting
process. All relevant safeguards policies and guidelines will be
discussed with the Ministry of Public Works and implementing
agencies during planning and implementation.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)- Not Applicable                                                X
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50) Not                                       X
Applicable
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60) Not Applicable                                     X

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The project is considered Category "B", and OP 4.01 is triggered. All works will focus on
rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure damaged during adverse natural events, which
are expected to be small and medium scale, generating only minor and localized environmental
impacts that can be easily identified, mitigated and managed. No large scale, significant and/or
irreversible impacts are expected. Overall, the expected environmental impacts are mostly
associated with the construction phase of the rehabilitation works, and include debris
management, including disposal, worker safety, noise control, use of hazardous materials, dust,
soil erosion etc.

The preparation of impact assessments and safeguards instruments (when necessary), along with
disclosure of documents, will be finalized following Board approval. Prior to Decision Meeting,
some draft TORs have been prepared for the preparation of the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The
ESMF/RPF will be finalized within 6 months following effectiveness date and will elaborate all
impacts, along with mitigation measures and appropriate monitoring.

Given the project's main focus on rehabilitating existing infrastructure, no impacts to physical
cultural resources are anticipated during project implementation. However, the policy on
"Physical Cultural Resources" (OP 4.11) has been triggered as a precaution. The ESMF/RPF will
include screening mechanisms for physical cultural resources as part of the environmental
screening process for subprojects, and "chance find" procedures will be included in all works
contracts. The Project Operational manual, to be prepared for Grant effectiveness, will be
updated, once the ESMF is complete, to include a summary of the ESMF and the relevant
screening and other checklists.

Moderate impacts may include the need for temporary or permanent minor resettlement along
road rights of ways. In addition, land acquisition is a possibility if the road is broadened,
extended or results in loss of livelihoods. As a result of this, OP 4.12 is triggered and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be developed to guide the potential impact mitigation
measures. The RPF can be folded into the ESMF and will have to be finalized within the first 6
months after approval. Draft TORs for the preparation of the RPF have been prepared prior to
the Decision Meeting (common ones with ESMF’s). When needed, a Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) will be developed to address the needs of project affected peoples. In the case of a number
of individuals and/or families to be resettled inferior to 200, an Abbreviated Resettlement Action
Plan (ARAP) can be prepared prior to construction.
The exact location of the specific activities to be financed will be defined during project
implementation. The ESMF/RPF will illustrate the modalities by which compliance with OP/BP
4.12 will be ensured, and lay out a series of processes for the identification of resettlement
impacts and the modalities by which these can be mitigated or avoided as needed. The RPF will
be based on the one that was developed for the recent CDD projects (PRODEP, PRODEPUR,
PREKAD, also called the Neighborhood Housing Reconstruction Project), which is applied to
both and urban areas. The ESMF/RPF will illustrate a clear and simple procedure to be applied
to each project that is easily understood by implementing partners.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

There are not likely to be any long-term negative impacts from the proposed activities (largely
road construction and rehabilitation as well as building construction). Physical activities
considered under this project mostly relate to the rehabilitation and strengthening of existing
infrastructure and both these and any new shelter construction are not expected to produce any
large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The majority of the physical investments will be undertaken under Components 2, 3 and 4 of the
proposed Project. Component 2 will be the responsibility of the UCP-DPC. The implementing
agency for Components 3 and 4 is the UCE-MTPTC. Both UCP-DPC and UCE-MTPTC have a
history with Bank-financed projects and are experienced in implementing and supervising the
projects. Throughout the infrastructure and transport projects, UCE-MTPTC has experience
with handling Bank safeguards, even more intensively since the earthquake and the most recent
Emergency project (Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency Recovery Project). Although they
are aware of the issues and benefit from the experience of the implementing agencies in other
ministries, UCP-DPC has less practice in addressing environmental and social safeguard issues,
with less experience in construction/rehabilitation activities. This lack of capacity will be
mitigated by the recruitment of an environmental specialist for the project. Currently, there are
already environmental specialists at both UCE and UCP. However, the specialist at UCE has a
heavy workload with other donor projects and cannot take on another one, while the specialist’s
contract at UCP will expire in December, 2011. Therefore, the proposed Project intends to
recruit consultants (one or two) whose responsibilities would be specifically related to
environmental and social safeguard policies compliance. The recruited environment specialist
will cover all the environmental aspects for the Project. In addition, a series of joint WB/IDB
social and environmental safeguards workshops has started: the first one was organized in
September 2010 to raise the importance of these issues with the GoH, discuss their integration in
all projects and particularly address the environmental safeguard policies. The second one is
planned for the fall of 2011 with a focus on social safeguard policies (resettlement policy
frameworks). The proposed Project will benefit from this past experience (IIERP), through
training sessions and cross-learning workshops. With further capacity building strengthening,
both financed by the IIERP and this Project, the Project should have adequate capacity for
project implementation. Finally, the project supervision team will review safeguard activities to
assure compliance with Bank requirements.

The Bank has been financing the rehabilitation of roads and community level infrastructure
(PTDT: Projet de Transport et de Développement Territorial, EBRVRP, IIERP, etc.). The
proposed Project will incorporate these experiences and lessons learned in the drafting of the
ESMF. Training in the implementation of Bank safeguards will be provided to UCE-MTPTC and
implementing partners to ensure compliance. The proposed Project will also benefit from the
ongoing CDD Projects (Community-Driven Development) with regard to land tenure issue in
Haiti, which is especially unclear as a result of the earthquake. Those projects are in the process
of carrying out social assessment studies to develop better understanding of these challenges,
including a study on gender issues to assess how resettlement can affect women differently from
men. These studies will provide useful information for any case of resettlement (in all projects).
Cross-learning workshops are also planned to share the concrete experience of CDD projects’
Project Implementing Unit in the implementation of Bank safeguards.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Many citizens will be positively affected by the rehabilitation of the damaged roads. They will
benefit not only from passable roads but also from improved access to areas that were previously
difficult to access. During the preparation of the ESMF and RPF a consultation process will be
initiated and conducted with communities, NGOs, development partners, government and local
officials to fully solicit their views. They are an important input to the preparation of the ESMF
and RPF. The final documents will be publically disclosed in-country by the PIUs in French.
Summaries of safeguard documents will be made available in Creole as well, and the documents
will be available in a location that is publically accessible such as a school or other convenient
location. The documents will also be disclosed through the Infoshop. Any feasibility and
detailed design studies financed by this operation will also adhere to World Bank safeguard
policies relating to consultation and disclosure.
