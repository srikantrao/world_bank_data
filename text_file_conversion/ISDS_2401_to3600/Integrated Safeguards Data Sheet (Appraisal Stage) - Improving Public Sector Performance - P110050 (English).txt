                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  None
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  None
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                  A Environment Management Framework was developed to mitigate potential construction related impacts for the one small civil work
                                  (refurbishment) of an existing building under Component 1 (Disaster Recovery Center). The relevant requirements will be included in the
                                  construction/refurbishment contract. The UDEM within the Ministry of Finance will supervise the refurbishment works including implementation
                                  of the framework by the contractor.
                                  The Environmental Management Framework provides guidelines and other relevant specifications, including prohibitions, construction
                                  management policies and others that should be incorporated into bidding documents, contracts and other relevant work orders.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
