                              (a)       Component 1: Treatment and prevention of malnutrition and provision of basic health services, including the screening of beneficiaries
                              (i)       Component 1a: Treatment and prevention of malnutrition among vulnerable populations, particularly children and women. This
                              component will address the prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition among children, in addition to focusing on the nutritional needs of
                              pregnant and lactating women.
                              (ii)      Component 1b: Provision of basic health services. This component will focus on maternal and child health services, in addition to the
                              prevention and treatment of common sources of morbidity and mortality, including respiratory tract infections, diarrheal disease, and malaria.
                              (iii)     Component 1c: Strengthening of sanitation facilities and safe water supply as key contributors to improved health status. This
                              component will enable the provision of improved water and sanitation facilities in the targeted areas.

                              (b)        Component 2: Project Management. Project management will include overall coordination of the operation, in addition to M&E activities
                              (including the innovative use of ICT technology to facilitate data collection, monitoring, and management).

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Horn of Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia) - the project will provide support to the Dadaab Camp in Kenya and the Dollo Ado Camp in Ethiopia

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 The key safeguard issue for this planned operation involves health care medical waste management, given the project's focus on the provision
                                 of emergency health and nutrition services. However, no potential large scale, significant, or irreversilble impacts are envisioned.

                                 However, given application of the United Nations Fiduciary Principles Accord (FPA) for this operation, World Bank safeguard policies do not
                                 apply. Rather, UNHCR's 2005 Environmental Guidelines apply in this instance and will be adopted for this operation according to UNHCR's
                                 standard project implementation mechanisms. The Guidelines call for the appointment of an Environmental Focal Point and the preparation of
                                 a rapid Environmental Assessment/Action Plan. UNCHR's Environmental Guidelines are broadly consistent with the Bank's Environmental,
                                 Health and Safety Guidelines for the water, sanitation and waste management interventions proposed under the operation. Medical waste is
                                 also a project risk and UNHCR's policies encompass management of medical waste generated during the life of a project.

                                 For World Bank records only, the project has been classified as a Category B operation and OP 4.01 is triggered. However, it is important to
                                 note that classification of the Project as Category B and triggering of OP 4.01 are soley for the purposes of signaling that had this operation
                                 been prepared as a standard Bank operation, not using the FPA instrument, that these elements would be appropriate for this type of operation
                                 and that relevant safeguard tools would have to be prepared. But, given the FPA and the fact that Bank policies do not apply in this instance,
                                 the Bank's safeguard policy requirements do not apply to this operation.

                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 Not applicable. In addition to medical waste management, the project would support only small-scale and site-specific rehabilitation of potable
                                 water supplies, in addition to possible rehabilitation and small-scale construction of waste management facilities, including latrines. All such
                                 activities would be site-specific and time limited, given the 18 month implementation period for this operation,
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 Not applicable
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 UNHCR's 2005 Environmental Guidelines apply in this instance and will be adopted for this operation according to UNHCR's standard project
                                 implementation mechanisms. Specifically and for the World Bank record, the team has confirmed that UNCHR adopted Environmental
                                 Guidelines in 2005 which appear to have the status of policy for that agency. UNHCR also has a handbook for addressing environmental
                                 matters in its projects. Both documents have been filed in the operations WBdocs file for the record.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 The key stakeholders will be the those residing within and around the indicated refugee camps, Dadaab in Kenya and Dollo Ado in Ethiopia.
                                 The consultations and disclosures will be conducted by UNHCR following their 2005 Environmental Guidelines and according to their standard
                                 project implementation mechanisms. The World Bank has considered the environmental and social risks associated with this project and
                                 understands that there may be minor, site specific and time-bound rehabilitation of small civil works involved. It is also understood that all
                                 project activities in the water and sanitation sector will be at pre-existing facilities in the two refugee camps.
