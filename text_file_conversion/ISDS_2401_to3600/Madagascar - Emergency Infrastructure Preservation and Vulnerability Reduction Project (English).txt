2. Project Objectives
The Project Development Objectives are to preserve key lifeline infrastructure and reduce
household vulnerability in targeted areas.
 The Project has been developed by a multi-sector Task Team from the World Bank
Sustainable Development Department (SD) and Social Protection team, and seeks to
address the emergency needs created by the impacts of the prolonged political crisis,
exacerbated by the global financial and food crisis as well as a number of external shocks
primarily due to natural disasters such as cyclones, hurricane and floods. These crises
have resulted in a dramatic increase in poverty levels, creating a devastating effect on an
already poor lifeline infrastructure and leading to a sharp decline in basic service delivery
in the social sectors. This operation would help preserve key institutions and
infrastructure in the road, agricultural and social sectors which have continued to
deteriorate as a consequence of the repeated crises and/or severe cyclone damage. The
project would also aim to build resilience through provision of safety net mechanisms to
alleviate poverty among the most vulnerable populations affected by the crisis. The
project's main interventions would include (i) the rehabilitation/reconstruction of key
road infrastructure to allow the continuation of traffic or restore access to schools, health
centers, markets and production sites; (ii) the rehabilitation/reconstruction of agricultural
infrastructure that is crucial when considered in the context of an impending food crisis
resulting from a rise of rice prices and low production; (iii) the provision of short-term
employment or income generation through cash-for-work programs to address vulnerable
populations survival needs; and (iv) the strengthening of the country's capacity for
disaster risk mitigation and prevention.

 The Project Development Objectives are to preserve key lifeline infrastructure and
reduce household vulnerability in targeted areas.

3. Project Description
The project design will be kept simple and build on existing activities currently being
implemented in ongoing projects that can be either continued or scaled-up. The proposed
operation would comprise the following three components:

 Component A: Rehabilitation of Lifeline Infrastructure and Risk Mitigation (US$72
million)

  Component A would support the following activities: (i) rehabilitation of transport
lifeline infrastructure; (ii) rehabilitation of community-level basic infrastructure; (iii)
enhancement of Disaster Risk Management (DRM) capacity, including an establishment
of a zero-budget contingency fund for use in the aftermath of a natural disaster.

  Sub-component A.1: Rehabilitation of Transport Lifeline Infrastructure (US$57.0
million). This sub-component would include the following activities: (i) emergency
rehabilitation and asset preservation of four existing major metallic bridges on key
National Roads; (ii) emergency works on key National Roads including the rehabilitation
of road drainage structures, culverts, small bridges, road slope protection works and
minor stretches of roads; (iii) reconstruction of smaller bridges that have exceeded their
design life; (iv) road asset preservation through the provision of minor civil works and
equipment required to enforce axle load limits on key National Roads; (v) acquisition of
portable metallic bridges (bailey bridges); and (vi) minor works and acquisition of
equipment to ensure compliance to international security codes (ISPS) for Madagascar's
major port. Construction works financed under this component would adopt a "Build
Back Better" approach and comply with the norms for climate-proofing transport
infrastructure developed by the CPGU. This sub-component would also strengthen
capacity of the Roads Authority of Madagascar (ARM) to preserve key transport-related
lifeline infrastructure. More specifically, the proposed Project would: (i) finance a study
and develop an action plan to make ARM a fully autonomous agency with the key
function of managing the road network; and (ii) finance ARM staff salaries. It is hoped
that after two years, the ARM will have become financially autonomous and able to
finance its staff.

 Sub-component A.2: Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Community-level Basic
Infrastructure (US$10.5 million). This sub-component would restore access to social and
economic services in the aftermath of catastrophic events, including cyclones. It would
finance community-level infrastructure sub-projects in crisis-affected areas, including
rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools, basic health centers, erosion control
structures, water points, and feeder roads. Communities most affected by the crisis would
be targeted. Representatives of the region, commune and community would prioritize
sub-projects most in need of rehabilitation following a transparent and participatory
process. Special attention would be given to rehabilitating cyclone-damaged health
facilities, nutrition sites and schools, as these are necessary to preserve human capital.
This sub-component would also provide training to the agencies involved in its
implementation. Community infrastructure rehabilitated and reconstructed under this sub-
component would comply with construction norms / guidelines and the "Build Back
Better" approach embedded in all activities financed under the proposed Project.

  Sub-component A.3: Enhancement of Disaster Risk Management Capacity (US$4.5
million). This sub-component would avert or mitigate the effects of future natural
disasters on lifeline infrastructure. It would rehabilitate the existing degraded national
hydro-meteorological monitoring and analysis network and strengthen communications
links between the national Direction-General of Meteorology (DGM) and disaster
response agencies, as well as improve the DGM's technical skills in weather forecasts and
projections. It would purchase equipment to improve cyclone and flooding early warning
systems (EWSs) that rely on the forecasts developed by the DGM, and provide training to
central and local operators, and affected communities in relation to the functioning of
these systems. This sub-component would support the development and application of
climate-proof construction norms and guidelines for key lifeline infrastructure in keeping
with the proposed Project's "Build Back Better" approach. Furthermore, it would provide
centralized and decentralized emergency response agencies with essential equipment and
training to improve post-disaster response planning and coordination, including
equipping of a recently constructed national disaster response center, and expansion of a
system of rapid post-disaster data collection. This sub-component also establishes a zero-
budget disaster recovery contingency fund that could be triggered in the event of a natural
disaster through formal declaration of a national or regional state of emergency, or upon a
formal request from the Government in the wake of a disaster. Upon triggering,
reallocation of project funds from other project components could be undertaken to
facilitate rapid financing of a positive list of goods and services in the transport,
agricultural and social protection sectors. Eligible activities would include clearing and
rehabilitation of road and irrigation infrastructure, rehabilitation of schools and health
centers, purchase of construction materials, agricultural inputs or materials for schools or
health centers.

 Component B: Reduction of Household Vulnerability (US$25.5 million)

 Component B would seek to reduce household vulnerability in crisis-affected areas
through investments designed to boost agricultural production, safeguard food security,
and provide short-term employment opportunities. This component would also enhance
households' responsiveness to exogenous fiscal shocks.
 Sub-component B.1: Preservation of Productive Capacity in Agriculture (US$15.5
million). This sub-component would finance: (i) emergency distribution of improved
seed, fertilizer, tools and associated technical assistance to enable rapid increases in food
production; (ii) rehabilitation and maintenance of small-scale agricultural infrastructure,
mainly micro-irrigation systems; (iii) watershed protection activities needed to preserve
the productive capacity of agricultural infrastructure; and (iv) capacity strengthening of
producers' organizations and community groups to sustainably manage irrigation
infrastructure and take advantage of income generating opportunities provided through
the Project.

  Sub-component B.2: Cash-for-work Program (US$10.0 million). This sub-component
would finance a cash-for-work program, with the twin goals of providing access to short-
term employment in areas affected by crises while improving small-scale infrastructure at
the community level. The targeting mechanism would be based on a multi-stage process,
with the wage rate paid to program participants kept below the prevailing market rate to
ensure minimal replacement effects. The names of selected communities and
beneficiaries would be disclosed to the public to ensure transparency and to avoid elite
capture. The selection process would ensure that at least 50 percent of beneficiaries are
women. Sub-projects (Projets à Haute Intensité de Main d'Oeuvre, HIMO) would be
labor-intensive (payments to beneficiaries would represent at least 75 percent of the total
costs of sub-projects) and be selected by the communities themselves. Activities to be
supported would include street and irrigation canal cleaning (which is particularly useful
in the aftermath of cyclones), basic road maintenance, soil erosion control, rehabilitation
of mangroves, and rehabilitation of feeder roads and small bridges, amongst others.
These activities would contribute to improved food production and distribution, and
income enhancement. Sub-projects would be technically sound and simple, and those
involving infrastructure construction or rehabilitation would meet climate-proof
construction norms / guidelines in keeping with the "Build Back Better" approach of the
proposed Project.

 Component C: Project Management and Coordination (US$4.5 million). Component C
would finance project management and coordination costs. It would pay for consultant
services, technical advisory services such as technical studies and assessments, operating
costs and training, media information campaigns and communication, and financial
audits.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
A more targeted five region approach will address poverty among the most vulnerable
populations exacerbated by the political crisis and the regions severely damaged by the
cyclones in the country, specifically Androy, Atsimo Atsinanana, Vatovavy Fitovinany,
Haute Matsiatra and Amoron'i Mania

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Parts of the activities described above will focus on capacity building, material and
equipment procurements, and institutional reform where no environmental and social
safeguard aspect would be expected. The remainder of the proposed subprojects will
focus on: (i) the rehabilitation and asset preservation of four existing metallic bridges and
critical road works on key National Roads, pipe culverts and concrete culverts and the
clearance and stabilization of eroded slopes (ii) the restoration of access to social and
economic services in the aftermath of catastrophic events through the rehabilitation or
reconstruction of existing schools, basic health centers, erosion control structures, water
points, feeder roads, etc.; (iii) the rehabilitation of small-scale agricultural infrastructure,
primarily micro-irrigation systems and grain processing and storage facilities; and (iv)
watershed protection activities to preserve agricultural infrastructure through the
stabilization of soil erosion and slopes and the planting of cover crops and trees. Project
activities might have direct impacts on soil, vegetation and the human population in the
project areas. Potential negative impacts of the Project include the following: (i)
depletion and deterioration of water supply; (ii) deterioration of soil quality; (iii) surface
water and groundwater pollution risks due to increased use of pesticides; (iv) loss of
vegetation following the installation of infrastructure (road rehabilitation/reconstruction,
irrigations schemes, feeder roads...etc.); and (v) risks of land acquisitions. The potential
environmental and social impacts are likely to be small-scale and site-specific and thus
easily remediable and reversible.

  Considering the nature and magnitude of potential environmental and social impacts
from a relatively limited scale of rehabilitation and improvement works, the Emergency
Infrastructure and Income Protection Project is classified as a Category "B" Partial
Assessment. Activities supported by the proposed operation are expected to have some
site-specific adverse environmental and social impacts; therefore, the following
Safeguards policies are triggered: OP/BP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment); OP/BP 4.09
(Pest Management), OP/BP 4.11 (Physical Cultural) OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary
Resettlement) and OP/BP 4.37 (Safety of Dams).

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The potential environmental and social impacts are likely to be small-scale and site-
specific, thus easily remediable and reversible. No long term or cumulative impacts are
foreseen during project implementation.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Not Applicable.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
As prescribed by OP/BP 8.00 policy on Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, an
Environmental and Social Safeguard Assessment Framework (ESSAF) has been prepared
by the Task Team to ensure compliance with the World Bank's safeguards policies during
the Project implementation. This Framework is based on the following principles:
  •     To ensure effective application of the World Bank's safeguard policies, the
ESSAF provides guidance on the approach to be taken during SD multi-sector project
implementation for the selection and design of subprojects and the planning of mitigation
measures.
  •     No physical resettlement issues are expected in any of the proposed subprojects
under the emergency Project as they are primaril concerned with rehabilitation and
reconstruction after catastrophic disaster-induced events. If any occur, Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) for the specific subprojects will be prepared following the
guidelines of the ESSAF and, where applicable, any relevant safeguards instruments
acceptable to the Bank that were used for the original sub-projects. .
  •     The proposed emergency operation will finance feasibility and detailed design
studies for subsequent investments to include environmental and social assessments as
required by the World Bank safeguards policies.
  •     Employment/income generating opportunities within the subproject areas will be
targeted and expanded as much as possible to the affected communities and households
that lost their livelihoods due to the political crisis and/or to natural disasters, especially
cyclones. Special attention will be given to women, youth and other most vulnerable
groups, including host-communities for displaced disaster-affected populations.
  •     Participatory Public Consultation and Disclosure requirements, as specified by
World Bank Safeguards policies, will be adapted t meet the special needs of these
operations. All subprojects which require public consultations with local communities or
beneficiaries will be conducted to help elicit the views and comprehension of the male
and female populations.
  The purpose of this Framework is also to assist the Project Executing Agencies (PEA) in
screening all subprojects for their likely social and environmental impacts, identifying
documentation and preparation requirements, and prioritizing the investments.
 OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment: This policy is triggered as most of the
proposed subprojects will focus on: (i) the rehabilitation and asset preservation of four
existing metallic bridges and critical road works on key National Roads, pipe culverts and
concrete culverts and the clearance and stabilization of eroded slopes; (ii) the restoration
of access to social and economic services in the aftermath of catastrophic events through
the rehabilitation and/or reconstruction of existing schools, basic health centers, erosion
control structures, water points, feeder roads, …etc.; (iii) the rehabilitation of small-scale
agricultural infrastructure, mainly micro-irrigation systems and grain processing and
storage facilities; and (iv) watershed protection activities to preserve agricultural
infrastructure through the stabilization of soil erosion and slopes and the planting of
cover crops and trees. All of these activities may have environmental and social impacts
that need to be managed appropriately. The Project will also support activities that will
have a positive impact on the environment and social sector. The executing agencies will
undertake a thorough social and environmental screening of all subprojects to properly
determine whether or not they trigger any World Bank safeguards policies. While the
ESSAF guides the preparation of safeguards instruments during project preparation, some
of the sub-projects have safeguards instruments acceptable to the Bank that have been
prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed some time ago notably Environmental and
Social Management Frameworks (ESMFs) and Resettlement Policy Frameworks (RPFs)
Therefore, for the preparation of the proposed emergency Project, each executing agency
will rely upon its applicable safeguards framework (ESMF and/or RPF) to prepare the
required safeguard documents. The ESSAF contains sample TORs for Environmental and
Social Impacts Assessments (ESIA) that may be needed for Project-supported activities,
as well as screening guidelines to be used by contractors hired to implement Project-
supported works (e.g., rehabilitation of roads and bridges, rehabilitation/reconstruction of
small scale agriculture infrastructures). Based on the outcomes of the screening process,
the requirement to carry out an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) that
includes an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) will be undertaken
during project implementation in parallel with subproject technical feasibility studies. At
the same time, prior to subproject appraisal, the implementing agency will agree to apply
the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion of standard
Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOP) in the rehabilitation and the improvement and
reconstruction bid documents of all subprojects; review and oversight of any major
reconstruction works by specialists; implementation of environmentally and socially
sound options for disposal of debris or drain spoils; and provisions for adequate budget
and satisfactory institutional arrangements for monitoring effective implementation.

 OP 4.09 (Pest Management): Although the project funds will not be used to purchase
and distribute agrochemicals, the agricultural subcomponent (emergency distribution of
improved seed, fertilizer, tools and associated technical assistance to enable rapid
increases in food production) will encourage farmer groups to use more inorganic
fertilizers and pesticides. Therefore, this policy is triggered because the Project will
support scaling up and/or intensification of agricultural production activities. Project
beneficiaries are likely to adopt integrated pest management practices that may involve
increased use of chemical pesticides, which could have negative environmental, health
and social impacts (especially since river and lake water is used for drinking purposes
throughout the project area). The Recipient will address OP 4.09 requirements by using
the existing Pest and Pesticide Management Plan (PPMP) developed for the ongoing IDA
funded agriculture project (BVPI). The PPMP includes a number of relevant actions to
reduce the exposure of farmer groups to pesticides used in agricultural production
systems. It also includes guidelines to be adopted on the possibility of agrochemical
application and disposal. Training kits to strengthen capacity building of different actors
(farmers, local vendors, regional agricultural agents, etc.) on the use, storage and disposal
of agrochemical products are also available. This PPMP has been approved by the Bank
and disclosed in-country and at Infoshop on May 25, 2012, by the Bank's ongoing
agriculture project.

 OP/BP 4.11 (Physical Cultural Resources): The proposed operation mainly tailored to
rehabilitation/reconstruction of already existing road segments of the targeted regions is
not expected to pose risks of damaging existing community cultural property.
Nevertheless, proposed subprojects will be screened for their potential impacts on
cultural property and chance find procedures will be applied and appropriate mitigation
measures for both the identification and protection (from theft, mistreatment of
discovered artifacts) of cultural property. These measures will be included in standard
bidding documents as part of the social and environmental clauses for consideration by
the construction companies. While not damaging cultural property, subproject
preparation may later identify and include assistance for preservation of historical or
archeological sites. If these opportunities occur, cultural property management plans
would be prepared for those subprojects. The Annex 4 of the ESAAF provides the
systematic steps to be followed once these properties are discovered during project
implementation.

  OP/BP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement: The need for involuntary resettlement resulting
from land acquisition in specific subproject areas will only be known during project
implementation when site-specific plans are available. Therefore, subprojects will be
screened for application of the resettlement policy and any subprojects involving
involuntary resettlement or land acquisition will only be approved after preparation of a
resettlement action plan acceptable to the Bank. Several issues will increase the
complexity of land acquisition, including the lack of reliable land record systems and the
inability of people losing land to either document ownership or be physically present to
make eligibility claims. The safeguards framework will thus include procedures for
identifying eligible project-affected individuals, calculating and delivering compensation,
and determining mechanisms for land dispute grievance redress as well as mechanisms
for adequately monitoring and evaluating the level of compliance.

 OP/BP 4.37 Safety of Dams: Although the proposed operation will not finance any new
construction or rehabilitation of large-scale irrigation facilities and dams above 15
meters, the agriculture subprojects will finance the rehabilitation of small irrigation
infrastructures, small check-dams to treat lavakas (gully erosion) and the replacing of old
hydraulic equipment/material. As a result, this policy is triggered. The Recipient will
address the requirements of OP/BP 4.37 by using the available Dams Safety Manual
(DSM) that is currently operational in the agriculture sector with the ongoing IDA project
(BVPI). The current Dam Safety Manual (DSM) has been prepared by the Recipient to
harmonize and improve Project operations in the existing irrigation perimeters to be
funded within agriculture sector. The DSM provides basic characteristics on the types of
dams, irrigation equipment and hydraulic materials as well as the forms of management
of irrigation schemes, the institutional arrangement and the social and environmental
clauses to be respected by construction companies during rehabilitation and exploitation
of the existing irrigation perimeters. The small-scale hydro-agriculture infrastructure
selected for Project financing after cyclone damage could use the principles and
mitigation measures described in the current DSM. This DSM has been cleared by the
Bank and publicly disclosed both in Country on May 25, 2012, and at the InfoShop on
May 25, 2012.

 Out of the five existing PEAs (ARM, APMF, BVPI, FID, UGPU), three (ARM, BVPI,
FID) have developed safeguards documents and each has a social and environmental
focal point (SEFP) responsible for following up on safeguards concerns to ensure that all
subprojects identified for operation financing have included consistent and coherent
environmental and social measures and are responsible for applying the safeguard
screening and mitigation requirements to each subproject. Each of the components (Road
infrastructure, Agriculture and safety net / basic community-based small infrastructure)
will be appropriately coordinated and supervised by an existing project executing agency
(PEA), specifically: the Road Authority of Madagascar (Autorité Routière de
Madagascar, ARM), th National Program for Irrigation and Watershed Management
(Programme National des Bassins Versant et Perimetres Irrigues, PN-BVPI) and the
International Development Fund (Fonds d'Intervention pour le Developpement, FID).
The PEAs will be responsible for day-to-day project management and implementation,
including fiduciary management. They are familiar with World Bank safeguards policies,
through the implementation of other World Bank-funded projects. In the Road
infrastructure, Agriculture and Social protection sectors, Environmental and Social
Assessment instruments (ESMF, RPF, RAP, ESIA, ESMP, PPMP, Dams Safety
Guidelines, etc.) have been prepared, appropriated and satisfactorily implemented in the
country under the ongoing IDA projects in each sector. The Project will thus be able to
draw upon successful previous experiences from ongoing Bank's operations in addition to
the available teams from the three PEAs which are fully operational. During and
throughout the project supervision, the World Bank task team will assess the appropriate
implementation of the environmental and social mitigation measures and subsequently
recommend additional strengthening measures as needed.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
IDA funding will support a number of subprojects classified as Environment and Social
Category B to which the public consultation and disclosure policy will apply. During
implementation of the proposed multi-sector IDA operations in these sectors, the
Environmental and social Safeguards instruments (ESIA, RAP ESMP,...etc.) will be
prepared and built upon existing safeguards instruments (ESMF, RPF, PMP, DSM, etc.)
through a consultative and participatory process involving all stakeholders at the regional
and national levels as well as within local communities and among beneficiaries of the
subprojects. In particular, the Executing Agency will consult project-affected groups and
local nongovernmental organizations on all environmental and social aspects of the
project and will take their views into account accordingly. The implementing agency will
initiate these public consultations as early as possible and will provide all relevant
material in a form and language(s) that are understandable and accessible to the groups
being consulted in a timely manner prior to consultation. The ESSAF will be shared with
the Government of Madagascar, concerned nongovernmental organizations and other
development partners and will be disclosed in-country and at the World Bank's InfoShop
during project implementation

* If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources,
the respective issues are to be addressed and disclosed as part of the Environmental
Assessment/Audit/or EMP.
If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please
explain why:
Due to the emergency nature of this project, and in compliance with OP/BP 8.00, the
completion and disclosure of the environmental and social instruments were not required
as a condition for project appraisal. An Environmental and Social Screening and an
Assessment Framework (ESSAF) have been prepared and will be disclosed at the
Infoshop and in-country during implementation. Safeguards instruments such as the
ESIAs/ESMPs as well as the RAPs/ARAPs will be prepared at the subproject level
depending on the findings of the preliminary technical studies and the screening checklist
of the ESSAF. All documents will need to be disclosed both in-country and at the
Infoshop during implementation and prior to the beginning of any civil works.
