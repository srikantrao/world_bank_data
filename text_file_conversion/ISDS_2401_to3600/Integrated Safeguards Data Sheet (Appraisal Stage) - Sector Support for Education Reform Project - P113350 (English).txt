Public Disclosure Copy




                              The school is at the core of the proposed Project, which has two complementary components in addition to a project management component:
                              one focuses on enhancing classroom learning, while the other focuses on improving the management of school resources and school
                              accountability to stakeholders, as described below.

                              Component One: Enhanced learning (US$ 13.4 million equivalent, 89.3% of total project cost)

                              The objective of this component is to improve pedagogical practices and teaching-learning materials availability in the classroom. As such, this
                              component would finance: (i) training of grades 1-4 teachers and pedagogical staff on the knowledge and skills needed to deliver the new
                              curriculum; (ii) provision of curriculum-aligned textbooks to grades 3-6, in addition to a package of essential pedagogical materials for all primary
                              schools; (iii) technical assistance to support the revision of the subject standards and content for grades 5-9 to address major issues of curriculum
                              imbalance and overload and to introduce competencies; and (iv) assessments of primary-level teaching-learning practices and learning
                              achievements.

                              Component Two: Improved management and accountability of school resources (US$ .93 million equivalent, 6.2% of total project cost)

                              The objective of this component is to increase efficiency in the use of school resources by improving their management and accountability. At the
                              school level, there is a need to improve oversight and accountability through community participation in budget formation and monitoring school
                              performance and expenditures. Further, school directors and local authorities need skills in budget formation and financial management to
                              smoothly adopt per-capita education financing in new districts, so that they can take full advantage of improved budgetary autonomy. As such, this
                              component would finance: (i) activities to improve financial management at the different levels of the system; (ii) training of school directors in
                              school leadership, development planning and community participation; and (iii) training of school directors and accountants in budget formation
                              and expenditures monitoring and reporting under the Per Capita Financing (PCF).

                              Component Three: Implementation Support (US$ .67 million equivalent, 4.5% of total project cost)

                              The objective of this component is to finance operating costs generated by the Project, including inter-alia translation, interpretation, equipment,
                              supervision costs (transportation and per diem), salaries of the staff in the Project Coordinating Unit, and incremental operating costs at the
                              Ministry of Education and Science.
