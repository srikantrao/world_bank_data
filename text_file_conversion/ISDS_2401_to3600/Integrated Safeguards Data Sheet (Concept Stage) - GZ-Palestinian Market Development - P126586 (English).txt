                              The WB PMD project aims to create a strong private sector development support system in the West Bank and Gaza by strengthening the capacity
                              of the Palestinian Authority to promote private sector growth. This will be achieved specifically by a) building the PAinstitutional capacity to promote
                              and manage private sector development initiatives and enhance the business and investment environment in the WB&G; and b) providing ICT
                              tools, information and services most needed for enabling business development.

                              C. Project Description

                              The World Bank Palestinian Market Development (PMD) Project is a GRANT under the WB Trust Fund for Gaza and the West Bank (TFGWB) in
                              the amount of US$ 3 million to support of the private sector development agenda of the new National Development Plan (NDP) 2011-2013.

                              The current NDP 2011-13 aims to shift the Palestinian Authority#s fiscal and institutional focus from reconstruction towards sustainability, by
                              gradually reducing dependence on foreign assistance, while continuing to improve the welfare of citizens. The private sector has a critical role to
                              play in ensuring sustainability. To achieve inclusive growth, the Palestinian Authority #intends to support the development of a strong private sector
                              that will create the tax base to provide public services for citizens and jobs for a growing labor force. The proposed PMD project#s goals are
                              aligned with this effort.

                              he proposed PMD Project's components are detailed as follows:

                              Component 1: Capacity Building to Promote Private Sector Development

                              The PMD project will provide assistance to the Ministry of National Economy (MoNE) to develop capacity to set private sector development
                              strategies, promote and monitor private sector competitiveness and investments, and undertake reforms to enhance business environment. It will
                              also strengthen the capacity of the PA to coordinate donor interventions around private sector development. This will be accomplished through: (i)
                              capacity building of counterpart institutions; (ii) implementation support and technical advice; and (iii) development of baseline private sector
                              indicators to monitor achieved progress.

                              The project will explore possibilities for a business development (PSD) unit or agency to be set given the level of development of the Palestinian
                              economy and its private sector. PMD can strengthen an existing unit within the Ministry, and/or an existing agency or it can set up a new unit/
                              agency to provide leadership on private sector development issues.

                              A creation/reinforcement of a business development unit/agency will build on previous and current ongoing donor activities. The PMD project will
                              build on results from the EU capacity building for the MoNE and trade diversification and competitiveness enhancement projects. At the design
                              stage it will evaluate what other donors working with MoNE are doing, including USAID, to align its activities. The project will also draw on best
                              practice examples of capacity building, such as the establishment with EU support of the Jordanian SME promotion agency JEDCO. It will draw
                              lessons from successful business development agency models such as Scottish Enterprise, Irish Development Agency and CzechInvest.
                           The project will also support the strengthening of a sustainable PSD policy framework. It will assist the PSD/business development unit/agency in
                           developing appropriate private sector data collection and monitoring and evaluation methodologies, as well as undertaking diagnostic work on
                           many of the challenges unique to the Palestinian economy and promoting reforms.

                           In the area of business environment reforms, the PMD project will be closely coordinated with an ongoing IFC Palestine Business Registration
                           Simplification Project, which is currently beginning implementation. The IFC project focuses on the business registration process in Palestine for
                           LLCs and sole proprietorship companies and includes process mapping. It will include a number of stakeholder institutions including the Company

                           Component 2: Business Electronic Services Platform

                           The component will aim to create a secure IT platform for business operations and transactional processes for the Palestinian private sector. It will
                           establish a set of online Government-to-Business (G2B) services to improve information availability on the business environment for market
                           development. The project will be mapping the business operations procedures and related required forms, as well as research their availability
                           online in existing on-line web sites currently offered in a fragmented way by different agencies. The site will consolidate the available information
                           and provide detailed information and step-by-step procedures for some selected transactions required by PA for business operations. It will
                           support business development capacity building to manage an Enterprise database and analyze other private sector data. In later stages, it will
                           aim to develop Internet and mobile-based services related to business and investor registries, tax registration and submission, business licensing
                           applications, customs and checkpoints processing, etc. if/as resources allow.

                           The information gathering website will be built with the vision to make business-relevant information highly searchable and widely available, based
                           on preliminary stakeholder consultations sponsored by the project with all relevant industry and government representatives. The site will make it
                           easier for all groups of entrepreneurs, including women entrepreneurs, to conduct business. The site will allow for a feedback from users to
                           enhance ICT accountability of the PA. A monitoring of trends on the website will also make it possible to further develop those areas most used by
                           businesses further. It is also expected that capacity building on related topics will be delivered to public servants, as well as private sector players,
                           to increase overall ownership of the online knowledge platform for selected G2B services.
