                              C. Project Description

                              The project will be financed as a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), whose final amount will depend upon the GOE final request and should take into
                              account refined cost estimates. The option of an APL, encompassing a program of investments over several years has not been considered
                              because of GOE's preference for SILs. The project is comprised of four components as follows:

                              Component 1: Provision of 1,100 new fuel efficient buses to replace old fleet;

                              Component 2: Construction of six Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors;

                              Component 3: Improvement of Traffic Management System; and

                              Component 4: Institutional support to the Metropolitan Urban Transport Authority.

                               There is also a proposal to include in the project scope the transformation of the existing and obsolete Metro Heliopolis into a modern and fast
                              Light Rail Tran sit (LRT) and its extension to New Cairo City, but this subproject will be confi rmed during preparation.

                               The proposed investments includes cost-effective measures that must be implemented in their entirety to make a significant impact in improving
                              the public transit system, reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality in the GCR, and in significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)
                              emissions by a minimum of 1.6 million tons CO2e per year .

                               Ministry of Transport, through the newly established Metropolitan Urban Transport Authority will be responsible for the implementation of this
                              project in coordination with Cairo Transport Authority (CTA) for bus replacement and Heliopolis Tram transformation and with the General Authority
                              for Roads, Bridges and Tunnels (GARBLT) for the BRTs.

                               In parallel, the World Bank is providing carbon finance support to the Government of Egypt for the Egypt Vehicle Scrapping and Recycling
                              Program (P119483). The national program enables vehicle owners affected by Traffic Law #121 (2008), which states that owners of fee-based
                              transport vehicles, including taxis and micro buses, that are greater than 20 years old are not eligible for a new operating license or license
                              renewal, may voluntarily surrender their vehicle for managed scrapping and recycling, in exchange for financial incentives that may be used
                              towards the purchase of a new vehicle from a registered vehicle dealer, under a closely monitored process. The estimated emissions reduction
                              from scrapping about 49,000 old taxi per se in GCR is about 1.7 - 3.5 million tons CO2e over the per iod 2009-2018. The Program is thus expected
                           to generate substantial revenues fro m carbon finance to cover all transaction costs and the cost of providing subsid ies to participating vehicle
                           owners. To date, the Minister of Finance has signed a Letter of Intent with the World Bank Country Director, confirming the Bank in tent to
                           purchase at least US$5.6 million worth of emissions reduction credits generated by the scheme under a CF Program of Activities (PoA). The
                           program is expected to be scaled up beyond its current phase in the Greater Cairo Region to other major cities.

                           EXPECTED RESULTS
                           The project investments would result in the following transformational changes in the urban transport sector in Greater Cairo Region:

                           - Bus Replacement:
                           878 old buses will be scrapped and replaced with 1,100 new clean technology buses, such as hybrid vehicles, that operate in dedicated bus lanes
                           with improved measures of Bus Operation Optimization (BOO); and

                            Annual emissions reductions of at least 128,000 tons CO2e.

                           - Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Investments:
                           Implementation of six Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors (one connecting Giza with 6th of October New City; two following routes along Cairo Ring
                           Road; and three East-West corridors linking new communities east and west GCR with each other and with the main urban agglomeration;

                            Improved mechanisms of integration among means of transportation, including fare integration;

                            Modal shift from carbon-intensive modes to less carbon-intensive modes;

                            Improved fuel economy of public transit vehicles through such measures as dedicated lanes and signal prioritization;

                            Reduction in overall VKT required to transport a given number of passengers over a given distance through such measures as electronic dispatch
                           and improved fleet management procedures;

                            Annual emissions reduction from 3 BRTs (6th of October and Ring Road) is about 80,000 tons CO2e; and

                            ER from the additional 3 BRT corr idors will be calculated during project preparation.

                            - Traffic Management Program:
                            Re-introduction of left turns that could reduce VKT by 1% less than otherwise, with implications on reduced trip time and economic losses;

                            Implementation of a dri ver education program that could alleviate chronic stop-and-go traffic conditions, thereby improving average fuel efficiency;

                            Improved pedestrian safety during street crossing; and

                            Annual emissions reductions of about 1,400,000 tons CO2e per year.

                            - Sustainability of urban transport:
                            Improved urban transport planning and regulation in GCR through efficient central coordination by the Metropolitan Urban Transport Authority.

                           (GOPP).

                            - Total estimated emissions reductions for all components: 16.117 million tons CO2e over 10 years.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           Greater Cairo Region, which comprises five Governorates (Cairo, Giza, Qalyoubia, Helwan and 6Th of October) and is home to a rapidly growing
                           population of 16 million in 2008, increasing to more than 21 million by 2022.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Egypt has a reasonably good legal and regulatory framework related to environmental and social protection, including requirements for
                           environmental assessments and mitigation. To ensure that proper attention is given to the project safeguards issues, an Environmental and Social
                           Impact Assessment Framework (ESIAF) will be carried out. The ESIAF will be aligned with the carbon Financed Vehicle Scrapping and Recycling
                           Program and its related environmental and social safeguards studies.

                            The ESIAF/ EMP and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared by the government of Egypt (GoE) and implemented by the
                           project coordination unit. The project Operations Manual will provide the framework for designing the detailed environmental and social mitigation
                           measures, as needed, to be undertaken for each related sub-projects. Capacity building on the project safeguards issues will be provided as will
                           be articulated in the EMP.

                           As the project components become more defined during the implementation phase, further detailed environmental and social impact assessments
                           will be carried out as necessary.
