    B. Program Objectives (supported by the IPF component)1


1
  The Oaxaca Water and Sanitation Sector Modernization Program is a hybrid operation financed through a
combination of two financial instruments: Program for Results (PforR) and Investment Project Financing (IPF).
Systems and policies applying to assess and mitigate environmental and social impacts will depend on the financial
instrument used. In the case of the PforR-funded activities, the country and state environmental and social systems
will apply after it has been assessed by the Bank and possibly strengthened. Activities that pose a risk of potential
significant adverse impacts are not eligible for PforR. For the activities financed through the IPF component, Bank
   The Program Development Objective is to improve the quality and sustainability of Water
   Supply and Sanitation (WSS) services and WSS sector information in the State of Oaxaca. To
   achieve this Objective, the Program will provide a multi-year steady financing framework to
   increase the legal and financial autonomy of service providers in priority areas, strengthen
   their operational performance and establish the tools to collect key sector data.


   C. Program Description

   The proposed operation will support the implementation of a new WSS Sector Modernization
   Program of the Government of Oaxaca (GoO) to increase the legal and financial autonomy of
   service providers in priority areas, strengthen their operational performance and improve
   sector information, through the following activities:
      Institutional framework modernization – Preparation of a new WSS sector law, by-law
       and organization manual of the State Water Commission (CEA), preparation of a standard
       by-law for autonomous municipal or inter-municipal WSS service providers.
      WSS service improvement in the Oaxaca city Metropolitan Area – Rehabilitation and
       extension of production or storage capacity, rehabilitation, hydraulic optimization and
       sectorization of water / sewerage2networks, macro- and micro-metering, update of the
       network mapping and commercial system in a priority service area (hydraulic sector "S2")
       of Oaxaca city water utility (ADOSAPACO).
      WSS service improvement in provincial cities. Same activities as just above, as well as the
       creation or improvement of the accounting system of the service providers in 18 priority
       provincial cities.
      WSS service sustainability strengthening in rural areas. Provision of equipment and tools
       to CEA to perform its new role of Technical Assistance (TA) delivery to rural service
       providers3; training, provision of tools and systems, development and dissemination of
       communication materials to strengthen rural WSS service providers supplying a
       population between 500 and 2,500 inhabitants; IT infrastructure and equipment to
       implement an information system for the rural water sector.

   D. Location and salient physical characteristics of the IPF component relevant to the
   safeguard analysis (if known)

   The IPF component will finance strategic TA activities to support the achievement of the
   targets of the Program that are not normally funded by the federal programs and for which the
   GoO seeks a specific oversight of the Bank, namely:

environmental and social safeguards will apply. This ISDS and definition of the environmental category apply solely
to the IPF component.
2
  The GoO has indicated so far its interest to give priority to investments of the Program in water supply. Inclusion of
investments in sanitation systems will be further discussed during the preparation process. PDO and Program amount
may be adjusted accordingly.
3
  TA would cover operational, financial, social and legal assistance
       3-year performance-based TA contract(s) with a professional operator / consultancy
        firm to assist the water utilities benefiting from the Program (ADOSAPACO and in
        provincial towns) on investment planning and to train service providers on leaks
        detection / repair, reduction of commercial losses, collection increase, customers
        service, design of communication campaigns, and, as relevant, environmental
        management. Performance indicators of the TA contract could be aligned with the
        DLIs of the Program.
       Training contract to build the capacity of the central and regional offices of the State
        Water Commission to perform their new role of TA (operational, financial, social,
        legal) to rural service providers. The IPF component may also finance TA to design
        and implement the rural information system.
       Other activities - Part of the IPF component could also be used to finance various
        activities as identified by the Program Action Plan for institutional strengthening
        related to technical, fiduciary, environmental and social aspects.

 In relation to the PforR part of the operation, the Bank will prepare an Environmental and
 Social Assessment (ESSA) of the proposed Program, including review of existing regulations
 and policies, their legal and practical applicability at the Program level, institutional capacity,
 the effectiveness of implementation in practice. If needed, measures incorporated in the
 Program Action Plan will be developed with the borrower to enhance environmental and
 social management capacity and performance.
