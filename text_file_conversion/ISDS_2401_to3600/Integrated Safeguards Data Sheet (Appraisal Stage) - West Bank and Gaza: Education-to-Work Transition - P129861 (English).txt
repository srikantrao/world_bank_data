                              The proposed Project seeks to improve education to work transition of young Palestinians attending participating tertiary education institutions
                              (TEIs) by: (i) fostering partnerships between TEIs and employers in order to make TEIs’ study programs more relevant to the needs of the labor
                              market; and (ii) enhancing the capacity of the MOEHE and TEIs to collect, analyze and disseminate data collected through the TEIs’ graduate
                              tracking system to monitor the outcomes of TEIs’ study programs, and to inform education policy formulation and implementation.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The design of the proposed project builds on the successful experience of the MOEHE’s QIF competitive grant system established in 2005 through
                              the Tertiary Education Project, supported by a grant from the World Bank and the European Community. It consist of three components: (i) a
                              competitive grant facility to tertiary education institutions managed by the existing QIF; (ii) a tertiary education graduate tracer study and (iii)
                              management and coordination of the project by the MOEHE’s PCU.

                              Component one consists of a competitive Education to Work Transition Innovation Grant Facility, in the amount of US$5.0 million, aimed at
                              enhancing education to work transition of graduates from TEIs. The MOEHE will support through a competitive grant system the implementation of
                              education improvement initiatives prepared and implemented by TEIs in partnership with employers aimed at improving the quality and relevance
                              of selected education programs offered by participating tertiary education institutions. To be eligible, proposals submitted by TEIs must focus on
                              the development and implementation of employment-oriented education programs.

                              Component two will support the establishment of a Higher Education Graduate Tracking System (US$0.6 million) through the MOEHE’s Higher
                              Education Development and Planning Department in coordination with TEIs. This component seeks to strengthen the capacity of TEIs to track
                              their graduates and to share that information with the MOEHE. It will also strengthen the capacity of the Higher Education Development and
                              Planning Department to consolidate and use the information collected by TEIS to support policy formulation and implementation; to monitor TEIs
                              graduates' transition process from higher education programs to the labor market; to evaluate the quality and relevance of tertiary education
                              programs to the needs of the labor market in West Bank and Gaza; and to communicate that information through a dedicated web portal to a
                              broad range of stakeholders.

                              Component three is related to project management and coordination (US$0.9 million) and will be the responsibility of the MOEHE’s Project
                              Coordination Unit (PCU). This component will support: (i) consultants for the PCU; (ii) incremental operating costs; and (iii) project monitoring and
                              evaluation.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project does not have a specific location and there will no financing of civil works

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  There is no relevant safeguard issue associated with the project
                                 The project was transfered to the team on December 8, 2011
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   There is no potential indirect and/or long term impact anticipated.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  Since there is no anticipated safeguard issues or indirect impact associated with the proposed project, there was no need to consider
                                 alternatives.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.

                                  on potentially affected people.

                                 consultation process involving focus group discussions with teachers, principals, business owners, and students and graduates of technical
                                 colleges and universities conducted during March 2011. These consultations confirmed the need to enhance the market relevance and quality
                                 of tertiary education programs of studies through partnerships with the business community and the willingness of tertiary education institutions
                                 and private employers to form partnerships for this purpose. Similarly, consultations with development partners indicated a strong interest to
                                 cooperate in this endeavor.
