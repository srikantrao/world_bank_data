2. Project Objectives
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve energy efficiency in heat and
power generation in selected towns in Belarus.

3. Project Description
The additional financing project will finance the following: (i)a) Conversion of an
existing steam turbine CHP plant in Mogilev to a combined cycle CHP plant by adding a
new 25 MW gas turbine and a waste heat recovery boiler. The combined cycle heat and
power plant will be used to supply heat and power to industrial and residential sectors in
the city of Mogilev. Two existing inefficient gas fired boiler houses will reduce their
heat generation after the commissioning of the new CHP. The sub-project was approved
by the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Republics of Belarus No. 194 in
February 29, 2012.

 b)   Conversion of an existing steam turbine CHP plant in Gomel to a combined cycle
CHP plant by adding a new 25 MW gas turbine, a waste heat recovery boiler, and a new
4 MW steam turbine. The project will optimize heat production and provide district
heating to a residential area in the city of Gomel. Two existing inefficient gas fired boiler
houses will reduce their heat generation after the commissioning of the new CHP.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The additional sites are located in Mogilev and Gomel.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There were no outstanding issues regarding implementation and supervision of the EMP
of the original Energy Efficiency Project. On-site supervision was done once a year, and
environmental specialist of the Bank interacted with the PIU as necessary. The proposed
Energy Efficiency Additional Financing Project is in full compliance with all
environmental requirements of the Government of Belarus and the World Bank. In
accordance with the World Bank Environmental Assessment (EA) safeguard policy and
procedures (OP/BP/GP 4.01) the original and the additional financing project have been
assigned Category B and an Environmental Management Plan is required. There are two
separate EMPs for the additional sites in Mogilev and Gomel.
 There was no land acquisition in the original project and none anticipated with the
additional financing.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
With adequate implementation of mitigation measures, no indirect or long-term negative
impacts are anticipated that would result from project activities.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
No adverse impacts are expected.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Two site specific EMPs satisfactory to the Bank have been prepared. Technical
specifications of the bidding documents for all sites should include specific provisions for
the choice of air pollution control technology (especially NOx). Site-specific EMPs
include technical guidance on such technology. The bidding documents would include
requirements for mitigation measures to be undertaken by contractors (waste
management, workers safety, site signage etc.).

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are government officials (The Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities, Mogilevenergo, Gomelenergo, the Energy Efficiency Department,
Local Environmental Authorities), local NGOs, population residing and business entities
located in Mogilev and Gomel. The Environmental Management Plans and related
information in Russian was disseminated and disclosed in Gomel and Mogilev.
