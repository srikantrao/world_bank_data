                              B. Project Objectives
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The objective of the proposed project is to #expand and strengthen the foundation of public financial management, by: (i) establishing tangible
                              improvements in transaction processing, reconciliation, and fiscal and financial reporting procedures; and (ii) improving budget management and
                              resource allocation and administrative capacity to gradually develop Liberia#s own institutional, organizational, informational, and human resource
                              capacities.

                              In order to achieve this objective, the project would support the implementation of reform actions identified in the GoL approved PFM Reform
                              Strategy under the following key themes: (i) Improving budget credibility; (ii) Expanding budget coverage and strengthening budget execution; (iii)
                              Strengthening Revenue mobilization; (iv) Enhancing transparency and accountability in PFM; (v) Enhancing Controls and Respect of the PFM
                              Legal Framework; and (vi) Strengthening Treasury Management.

                              C. Project Description

                              The preliminary description of the proposed project as outlined below provides the compelling basis aimed at supporting the holistic reforms
                              required in the public financial management and related cross-cutting areas in Liberia, consistent with the GoL-led reforms agenda.

                              The Bank's engagement in Liberia across sectors as well as on budget support operations, focus to a considerable extent, on strengthening the
                              nascent institutions that were re-established after the war. The foundation for strengthened institutions lies to the greatest extent on their capacity
                              strength as well as their overall governance. Financial management is a key ingredient to these, and the ability to put in place adequate policies
                              and good administration practices in revenue management as well as expenditure management is fundamental to assuring strengthened
                              foundation for good governance. To this end, the Bank initiated, towards the completion of the GEMAP, the IFMIS and the EGIRP operations to
                              begin a selective improvement of the economic and financial governance regime in the country. The IFMIS closes on February 1, 2012, and the
                              restructured EGIRP also closes on December 31, 2013. It is critical that the achievements made under IFMIS are not rolled-back but smoothly
                              extended beyond the Ministry of Finance to other M&As and the Counties as, by these alone, can the GoL be assured a transparent and
                              accountable financial management system that stakeholders can rely on. The plans by DPs to transition to the use of country systems for donor
                              funded operations can only be realized when the institutions and systems are right; and these objectives should be explicitly recognized in IFMIS
                              implementation and its interfacing with ancillary aid management systems that are in place or proposed.

                              Against the above background, the proposed technical assistance project was conceptualized to respond to the GoL reform strategy, aimed at
                              strengthening the overall PFM governance ranging from planning, budgeting, accounting and reporting, internal audit and controls, public
                              procurement, revenue management, external audit, and legislative and public oversight. These together constitute the core of the reforms
                              envisaged in the government#s strategy document. The AfDB is supporting in the development and roll-out of the Customs systems (ASYCUDA),
                              the IMF is supporting the core areas of reforms in the revenue mobilization and administration areas through provision of technical assistance
                              support, among others, and the USAID is supporting the public sector reform measures in some core Ministries and Agencies. The activities to be
                         supported under the proposed operation in those areas will focus on complementary reforms not catered for in those defined support programs.

                         The proposed TAL would be implemented through 5 components over a 4-year period, consistent with the Reform Strategy itself as well as the
                         GoL approved PFM Capacity Building Strategy, at an estimated total cost of about $32 million. Since each of the components will contribute to
                         more than one of the project outcomes, and there will be interdependencies between components (for instance, a strengthened legal framework
                         and IFMIS will contribute to improved budget planning and management by the MoF as well as to improved transparency and accountability),
                         these linkages will be taken into account in project management and the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework for the project.

                         #          Component 5: Program Governance and Project Management # ($6 million): As a holistic PFM reform program to be supported under a
                         joint donor partnership , a robust project management function shall be established to cater to the needs integrated coordination of the
                         implementation of the program as well as assure the appropriate sequencing of interventions across the various reform fronts. The GoL has
                         already established a PFM Reform Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Finance whose role and responsibilities have since been well defined and
                         approved by Cabinet. The objective of the component is to enable the mainstreaming of reforms across the components, operationalize the PFM
                         Operations Manual (already developed and approved) to provide an appropriate reform management routine, including administrative procedures
                         to be followed by the various component directors, and provide the tracking information for monitoring and evaluation reporting on achievement of
                         milestones and outcomes. The component will have 5 sub-components: (i) Program Coordination; (ii) Institutional & Capacity Building (including
                         HRMIS-based CSA implemented activities); (iii) Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E); (iv) communications & change management; and (iv) project
                         fiduciary arrangements. As noted above, M&E will play a critical role in ensuring coordination among linked components and subcomponents of
                         the project. The M&E framework will meet the specific monitoring requirements of the Bank, but equally importantly it will identify the linkages
                         between inputs, project activities and workplans, outputs, and outcomes. All outcomes will be related directly to the GoL#s PFM strategy and to
                         relevant PEFA performance indicators. The M&E Unit should liaise closely with the relevant PFM units of the GoL and help ensure that all
                         government workplans are fully prepared and coordinated with the PDO. The activities envisaged for implementation under the Component 5
                         include: Operational management costs of project coordination unit; technical assistance support for Project Coordination; design of SoE reporting
                         guidelines and analysis, monitoring, and reporting of SoE financial / fiscal performance; enhancing HRMIS through CSA leadership; training and
                         capacity building # PFM Training School; data collection and information collation and reporting # M&E with TA support; developing and
                         implementing a communications & change management strategy; dissemination of project indicators, intermediate and final outcomes;
                         engagement with stakeholders; project financial management and procurement arrangements & coordination.
