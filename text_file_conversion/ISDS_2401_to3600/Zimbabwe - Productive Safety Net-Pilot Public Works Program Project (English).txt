2. Project Objectives
The project development objective is to pilot a labor intensive public works program,
designed to provide temporary employment opportunities to unemployed people in
Zimbabwe, while at the same time building community assets supportive of productive
activities.

3. Project Description
This RSR grant, in the amount of US$600,000, supports the implementation of a pilot
public works program and will be executed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Services
(MOLSS) through two components; the first component consists of capacity development
for the Department of Social Services (DSS) in the MOLSS to implement the pilot; and
the second component covers the cost of labor-intensive public works sub-projects that
contribute to productive activities.

 It is expected that the payments from the involvement in the public works activities will
support the beneficiaries to address food insecurity of households and cover partial costs
for items such as food and other basic needs during the lean season; while building
community assets that address human development needs in areas such as water,
sanitation etc.
 Component 1 # Capacity Building of the Department of Social Services (US$ 120, 000)

 This component consists of capacity building of the DSS to design and implement the
public works scheme. The grant will finance technical assistance through short-term
consultants with expertise in relevant areas. A Project Implementation Support Unit
(PISU) will be set up within the DSS to coordinate the implementation of the project. The
PISU will consist of a project coordinator, an accounting assistant, and two district
coordinators at the district level. Establishment of the PISU and hiring the above staff
will be a condition of effectiveness of the Grant Agreement. Some funds will also be set
aside for short-term consultancies (such as support to the development of a simple
monitoring system) and awareness creation of the pilot among the targeted communities
to ensure efficient community involvement in the identification and implementation of
the sub-projects. This component will also cover operating costs and an audit to be
undertaken at the end of the project.

 Component 2 # Implementation of the pilot public works scheme (US$ 480,000)

 This component will consist of eligible labor-intensive public works sub-projects, as
defined in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM). It will also support the training of
Sub-project Management Committees (SMC) who will be responsible for the
management of the sub-projects, as well as training of the members of the community
who will participate in the public works activities. Details on the parameters of the public
works scheme will be agreed upon and documented in the PIM.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The pilot will be implemented in 2 districts (sub-projects to be determined during
implementation). The criteria for selecting these districts will be defined in the PIM.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no major environmental issues anticipated under sub-projects due to the small
size and rehabilitation nature of minor public works to be financed under sub-projects. To
mitigate against any potential negative environmental impact an Environmental
Management Framework (EMF) has been developed and will be incorporated into the
Project Implementation Manual (PIM) of the project. This Framework will be used
during the evaluation of the sub-project proposals to ensure that the proposals will have
no major negative environmental impact. Further, a sub-project must propose
rehabilitations/construction within the footprint of existing community assets or on public
unencumbered land to ensure that no involuntary resettlement occurs as a result of the
sub-project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There are no potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Ministry has developed an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) and held
consultaitons on this framework at different occasions. The Ministry has limited previous
experience related to safeguards. Compliance with the environmental safeguards
mitigation measures and checklists(as it is outlined in the EMF and will be outlined in the
PIM) will be supervised by the District Environment Officers. Funds will be set aside in
the project to support these officers to undertake the environmental safeguards
supervision.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders for this project are the relevant government ministries, development
partners, NGOs and potential beneficiaries of the sub-projects.

 Consultations have been held at two different occasions; (i)with potential beneficiaries
as well as district level government staff; and (ii) with different government ministries,
development partners and NGOs.
