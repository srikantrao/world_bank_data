2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective (PDO) is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through
improved energy efficiency in street-lighting on public highways in Thailand.

3. Project Description:
This carbon finance operation includes a small scale program of activities (PoA) to be
implemented by the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). The PoA aims to improve the
energy efficiency of street lights within the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) service area
by replacing 2501 watt High Pressure Sodium (HPS) units with 110 watt Light Emitting Diode
(LED) units. The total number of the HPS lamps to be replaced is estimated at 455,000. The
existing lamps are owned and managed by the Department of Highways (DoH), Ministry of
Transport, but the electricity for the lighting system is provided by PEA free of charge. The
installation of LEDs is expected to substantially reduce the electricity consumption paid for by

1
    The total HPS unit typically consumes 315 W including ballast
PEA. When compared to the HPS units, the LED system can save up to 65% of electricity
consumption and therefore result in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The PoA will be implemented within the geographical boundary of Thailand, in the following
regions: (i) North; (ii) North-east; (iii) Central; and (iv) South. The first pilot project will replace
60 units in Nakhon Pathom province.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                            x
The proposed project will only involve replacement of existing street
lighting units (High Pressure Sodium (HPS) units; the poles will
remain in place) with more energy efficient ones (Light Emitting
Diode (LED) units). It will provide long-term positive
environmental benefit in terms of energy efficiency improvement
and reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The
environmental safeguards issues associated with this project only
involve the removal, handling, storage and disposal of the removed
HPS units. Newly installed LED lamps have longer life expectancy
than HPS units, which means less waste generation in the long run.
Another advantage of LEDs is that they contain no toxic metals or
chemicals and can be completely recycled. The project is therefore
classified as EA Category C considering that it is likely to have no
significant environmental impacts provided the removed units are
disposed of as per the disposal plan. To ensure this happens, an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which includes the safe
disposal of the replaced HPS Light bulbs/units has been prepared
and disclosed as part of the Initial Environmental Evaluation for
Sustainable Development Report (IEE-SD). The implementation of
the EMP will be monitored by PEA.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The program will have a positive impact to the environment in terms of reduction of energy
consumption in street lighting system within PEA service area. The anticipated energy savings
are approximately 65%. The reduction of energy consumption leads to: i) improvement in
country’s dependency on imported fossil fuels resulting in savings in foreign exchange and
improved energy security; ii) lowering of the electricity expenses for PEA that has to be paid to
for the electricity used for the street lighting; and iii) reduction in GHG emissions, with the
anticipated GHG emission reduction of approximately 170,946 tCO2e/y or 1.7 million tCO2e in
ten years when the program is fully implemented.

Also, there are no potentially significant adverse environmental impacts associated with the
program. However, to ensure the disposal of the removed HPS light bulbs do not have any
adverse impacts on the environment, the client, PEA, has prepared a Waste Disposal
Management Plan containing the required measures to safely dispose of these units in an
environmentally friendly manner. The Waste Disposal Management Plan also has the required
measures to monitor the process for disposing of the removed lamps.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area: No long-term impacts are anticipated. N/A

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts: N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

In order to avoid or otherwise mitigate the potential adverse impacts on disposal of replaced HPS
Light Bulbs, PEA had prepared a Waste Management Disposal Plan for Safe Disposal of
Replaced HPS Light Bulbs.

Also, in compliance with the Thailand’s Environmental Laws, PEA had prepared an Initial
Environmental Evaluation and Self-Evaluation on Sustainable Development (IEE-SD Report)
and received an approval from the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (TGO)
in September 2012.

The report had been publicly disclosed locally on PEA’s website and hard copies had been
provided at PEA office, in the Thai language and also in English at the World Bank's Infoshop.
The Waste Management Disposal Plan including monitoring plan has been included as part of
the IEE-SD report.

During the project preparation, the World Bank has provided technical support to PEA on the
World Bank safeguards policies and requirements, including process of consultation and
disclosure of safeguard documents. As for the implementation of this proposed project, PEA has
set up an Office of Energy Efficiency Management (OE2M) within PEA which would be
responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the CDM Program of Activities (PoA)
including safeguards measures. The World Bank will be providing technical support during
implementation of the project as needed.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key stakeholders in addition to the public who are the direct beneficiaries of the project include
key institutional stakeholders like standards setting agencies, manufacturers, electricity
regulatory bodies, etc. that act at the national level. All the above stated stakeholders who are
direct beneficiaries of the project activity have been invited for the PoA level stakeholder
meeting conducted at the World Bank (Bangkok office) on May 23, 2011. Additional
stakeholder consultation took place in Pathumthani Province on May 25, 2012. The IEE-SD
report has been publicly disclosed locally on PEA’s website and hard copies had been provided
at PEA office, in the Thai language and also in English at the World Bank's Infoshop.
