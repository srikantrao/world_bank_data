                              submitted for the Regional Vice President’s approval and to the Board on an Absence of Objection basis:
                              •           Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Facility: to catalyze financing, risk-sharing and technical assistance to address policy,
                              legal, institutional, capacity, and informational constraints holding back MSME access to finance in the MENA region, and thereby to support
                              improvements in MSME employment, competitiveness, and incomes.

                              •         Adaptable Program Loan (APL): to improve access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises in the MENA region. The APL is
                              the IBRD financing mechanism for the MSME Facility.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed loan of US$50 million is financed by an IBRD loan within the framework of the regional APL program of the MENA MSME Finance
                              Facility, as part of the Arab World Initiative (AWI). This would be the second loan in an anticipated series of APLs across eligible countries.

                              This project will support the provision of partial credit guarantees to participating financial institutions to mitigate their credit risks on loans to micro,
                              small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).The project will be implemented through the Caisse Centrale de Garantie. The loan will be used to scale
                              up their existing MSME guarantee funds, which cater to the needs of MSMEs at different stages of their development. The first guarantee fund,
                              Damane Crea, provides guarantees for medium- and long term bank loans to start up SMEs, with less than three years of existence. The second
                              guarantee fund, Damane Dev, covers medium- and longer term loans for expansion projects of existing SMEs (more than three years of
                              existence). The third guarantee fund, Damane Exploitation, provides guarantees for working capital loans of SMEs. The fourth guarantee fund,
                              Damane Istimrar, which provides guarantees for restructured loans of SMEs.

                              The project will also support new innovative guarantee mechanisms such as CCG’s planned new guarantee fund for very small enterprises. This
                              product will be based on a principle of delegation and will cover all loan types (working capital and investment loans) of up to 1 million MAD. The
                              approval procedure for guarantees will the fully automated and standardized

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The second country loan under the MSME Facility regional APL structure will be located in Morocco. The loan will be passed on to an
                              implementing agency (the Caisse Centrale de Garantie in the case of Morocco), which will provide partial credit guarantees to participating
                              financing institutions for loans to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. These MSMEs will be in the Borrower’s regions of Tanger-Tetouan, Taza-
                              Al-Hoceima-Tatounate, Fez-Boulmane, Meknes-Tafilalt, Tadla-Azilal, Doukkala-Abda, Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer, (Greater) Casablanca, Oriental,
                              Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz, Chaouia-Ourdigha, Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hsen, and Souss-Massa-Draa, and the Borrower’s provinces of Guelmim,
                                                                                                                                                                       Page 1 of 4

                               This project will only support the provision of partial credit guarantees for Participating Financial Institutions (PFIFs), and will not involve any
                               investment of Bank funds in sub-projects through financial intermediaries.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    This project is covered by the Bank’s operational policies on Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01). No major social and environmental
                                  issues are expected to arise as a result of the Project, since the vast majority of banking loans expected to be supported by this project are
                                  extended to the commercial and service sectors and to individuals; however, there may be a small number of loans in certain sectors that apply
                                  for guarantees, which could potentially have some negative environmental and social impacts. For that reason, a Framework has been
                                  developed to screen all loans for potential impacts and mitigate them, in compliance with the World Bank’s environmental and social
                                  safeguards.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:

                                   The project triggers the Bank’s Environmental Assessment policy (OP/BP 4.01), and prepared a screening mechanism in compliance with that
                                  policy. The project is categorized “FI? (Financial Intermediary), according to the World Bank.

                                  In the event of sub-project uncovering physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11) for example historical ruins, which by their nature cannot be
                                  known in advance, national procedures for the preservation of archaeological relics would be applied. Moroccan law was reviewed by the Bank
                                  safeguards team and found to be in keeping with OP/BP 4.11 as it protects preserves and promotes the country’s historical heritage. In the
                                  event of sub-project uncovering physical cultural resources (OP/BP 4.11) e.g. historical ruins, which by their nature cannot be known in
                                  advance, national procedures for the preservation of archaeological relics would be applied.
                                  Sub-projects that trigger OP/BP 4.04, OP 4.10, OP 4.12, OP/BP 4.36, OP/BP 4.37, OP/BP 7.50 and OP 7.60 would not be eligible for financing.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                    Different approaches from a financing point of view were considered (for example loans vs guarantees; jointly with the IFC/AfDB or separately)
                                  however these had little bearing on safeguards, the beneficiaries (MSMEs) and activities to be financed being independent of the source of
                                  financing.

                                  However, the consultation process did inform the key stakeholders to restrict project financing to Category B and C sub-projects only, and to
                                  limit it to certain sectors, in the interest of avoiding substantial environmental and social impacts, and thereby ensuring that disbursements
                                  occurred at acceptably high rates.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The CCG will be required to implement the ESMF, with a screening mechanism for the loans to be covered by guarantees. The screening will
                                  be done by trained CCG staff based on the IFC's exclusion list (http://ifcnet.ifc.org/), and will include, as relevant, additional selected sub-
                                  sectors that are expected to have a significant negative environmental and/or social impact. The exclusion list will be detailed in the Operations
                                  Manual, and the WB will reserve the right to adjust the exclusion list on the basis of a review of the effectiveness of the ESMF. This review will
                                  be conducted one year after loan effectiveness. The CCG will be required to screen projects based on their environmental impact into A (high
                                  impact), B (moderate impact, mitigateable) and C (insignificant or no impact).

                                  Category A: Excluded from coverage (including any project that involves acquisition of land and involuntary resettlement). Furthermore, the WB
                                  project will not finance any projects of the aforementioned exclusion list (IFC exclusion list and selected sub-sectors).

                                  Category B: The team proposes a two track approach: A dedicated unit in CCG will be established to screen projects for environmental and
                                  social risk and impact. The unit will also be tasked with offering a tailored training module in environmental and social screening to the Credit
                                                                                                                                                                              Page 2 of 4
                              Risk Officers/Department in each of the banks that wish to have their portfolio of loans to SMEs guaranteed by CCG. Those banks that accept
                              and receive such training, whether from CCG or another acceptable source acceptable to the WB, will have subsequent claims paid swiftly with
                              no post facto review of compliance of defaulting loans with national environmental and social laws. Those banks that do not take advantage of
                              the offered training, or do not otherwise incorporate environmental and social issues as part of their Credit Risk screening process, will have
                              any Category B claim reviewed by CCG for compliance with national environmental law before the claim is paid. The WB believes the
                              Moroccan national environmental and social framework is sufficiently strong to be relied upon to cover potential environmental impacts of
                              category B projects, which are expected to be moderate for this operation.

                              Category C: The exclusion list and requirement to comply with national laws will apply. No further screening and monitoring will be required.

                              In addition, coverage of pre-existing loans, for which guarantees have already been issued, is restricted to Category C loans.

                              The IBRD will assist the CCG to build up its capacity on the management of environmental and social risks, which includes the screening of
                              projects and their classification into different risk types, as well as building up knowledge about the host country environmental and social laws,
                              and the WB's environmental and social policies. The CCG, supported by the WB, will also provide training for the banks' credit risk managers
                              on environmental and social safeguards. The banks' completion of this training will be a pre-condition for the fast-track processing of category B
                              projects of the CCG. The WB will also conduct a review of the ESMF one year after project effectiveness and reserves the right to adjust the
