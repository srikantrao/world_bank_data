                              service in Sierra Leone.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Over the years during and after the civil war the public sector in Sierra Leone has suffered progressive depletion of skilled manpower and the
                              middle level cadre of professional and technical staff. In addition to the low numbers which are largely a consequence of of uncompetitive pay,
                              there are two other problems with the functioning of the civil service. Motivation (esprit de corps) is weak because of inequitable pay and no
                              demand for performance (weak accountability). Low levels of competence, especially in senior positions, because of appointments based on a
                              combination of patronage and seniority. The Government of Sierra Leone’s public sector reform program – “Improving Productivity through
                              Management and Pay Reforms? - addresses these problems by focusing on Pay Reform, Performance Management and Recruitment and
                              Staffing. The project will support the GoSL Program through the combination of a Results-Based Investment Lending (RBIL) instrument and a
                              Technical Assistance (TA) component. The RBIL component will disburse against the achievement of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) which
                              will be a combination of results and key steps on defined reform paths in each of the three Program Areas. The TA component will support specific
                              inputs for which close technical support and supervision by the Bank is justified and has been requested by the GoSL.
                              This operation aims to support the government’s efforts as reflected in the GoSL Program document. In particular, it will establish fair and, where
                              appropriate, competitive pay across the public service to enable competent staff to be recruited and retained. This will at the same time legitimize
                              government’s attempts to demand better performance from both its MDAs and the civil servants who staff them. Sierra Leone’s poor service
                              delivery performance can be attributed to a multiplicity of causal factors including leadership, coordination, skills, rewards, and management
                              structures and processes. This operation does not attempt to address all of these problems, many of which will require tailored interventions for
                              individual MDAs. Instead, it is proposed to address the key systemic problems (as identified in the GoSL Program document) afflicting the civil
                              service which, if tackled together, have the potential to unlock performance across all MDAs. These binding problems are: (a) an inability to attract
                              and retain a critical mass of professionals capable of serving the government of the day; (b) the persistent neglect of the merit principle in
                              appointments, which has led to a progressive erosion of competence; (c) a failure to tackle the perceived inequities in pay, which has depressed
                              employee motivation and morale; and (d) a chronic failure by both governments and senior officials to hold civil servants accountable for their
                              performance.

                               The project will reward the achievement/completion of key steps/milestones along an identified path for achieving the objectives of each of the
                              three reform areas by making disbursements when agreed steps are achieved/completed with some scope for flexibility in the outer year
                              milestones. It is expected that the achievement of the objectives of each of the reform elements will contribute to addressing the functional
                              problems. The approach will allow for a locally owned and, therefore, more feasible reform program with flexibility in the implementation approach
                              and it will also help in addressing the collective action and coordination problems that have stood in the way of past reform efforts.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  No social safeguard policies are attracted. No environmental safeguards are attracted by the project. The agreed lists of both EEPs and DLIs
                                 do not include the financing of infrastructure activities to be supported under the Project. For this reason, the Project environmental category
                                 has been classified as “C? in accordance with Bank OP 4.01.

                                 Potential social issues
                                 The European Union (EU) project “Support to the Civil Service Reform Programme in Sierra Leone? which forms part of the government’s
                                 Program has a component entitled “Right-sizing the Civil Service?. This component supports the removal of dysfunctional and obsolete
                                 positions by financing severance/pension packages and the retraining of eligible redundant workers to prepare them for employment in the
                                 private sector. The rightsizing includes five elements, to be implemented in consultation with the National Social Security and Insurance Trust
                                 (NASSIT), the Ministry of Employment, Labour and Social Security and the MDAs: (I) retire all low-skilled personnel in minor grades who are
                                 currently aged 55 and above on full pension basis, plus any applicable retirement benefits; (ii) abolish obsolete posts and take appropriate
                                 redundancy action, including expeditious settlement of all payment obligations; (iii) determine optimal staffing requirements by sector,
                                 occupational category and level of staff, having sustainability and affordability in view; (iv) design strategy for filling skills gaps through the
Public Disclosure Copy




                                 appropriate approaches of recruitment, or skills development by training, coaching and mentoring, or combinations of these; (v) mainstream key
                                 professional posts currently filled through contracts for services into the public service.

                                 The EU operation aims to offset the potential opposition to these measures by, prior to the rollout of rightsizing, conducting a sensitization
                                 campaign of the various stakeholders, including the potential target employees, the relevant trade unions, and the general public. In addition, all
                                 laid-off workers who are fit for alternative work and placement will be adequately retrained to prepare them for alternative employment in the
                                 private sector. The EU is providing euro 4.45 million (us $5.99 million) for these measures, while the GoSL has committed euro 0.1 million (US
                                 $.134 million) for the sensitization campaign.

                                 To mitigate the risks associated with this, the GoSL will carry out a baseline social assessment once the list of persons to be covered by this
                                 component is finalized. A follow up social assessment will be carried out a year later.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  No potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  No alternatives necessary.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The EU operation aims to offset the potential opposition to these measures by, prior to the rollout of rightsizing, conducting a sensitization
                                 campaign of the various stakeholders, including the potential target employees, the relevant trade unions, and the general public. In addition, all
                                 laid-off workers who are fit for alternative work and placement will be adequately retrained to prepare them for alternative employment in the
                                 private sector. The EU is providing euro 4.45 million (us $5.99 million) for these measures, while the GoSL has committed euro 0.1 million (us
                                 $.134 million) for the sensitization campaign.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                  No safeguards consultations are envisioned. However, in the event that they become necessary, the main implementing agencies for the
                                 project would be consulted. These agencies include the PSRU, HRMO, PSC and Ministry of Finance.
