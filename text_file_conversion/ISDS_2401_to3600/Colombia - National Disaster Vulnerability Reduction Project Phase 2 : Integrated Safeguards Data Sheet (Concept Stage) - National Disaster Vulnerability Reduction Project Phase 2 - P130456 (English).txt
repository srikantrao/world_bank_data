                           13.      The objective is to further strengthen Colombia's disaster risk management framework
                           through: (a) the application of disaster risk analysis and management in policy making at the sectoral
                           and territorial levels, and (b) strengthening of risk reduction at subnational levels.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project concept is founded on the acknowledged need to design a project which promotes a more
                           integrated approach to disaster risk management (DRM) in Colombia, and which seeks to promote
                           institutional and sectoral coordination with the objective of strengthening the newly established
                           National System for Disaster Risk Management, passed into law on April 24, 2012. The preliminary
                           components and activities were identified based on the overall conclusions, recommendations and
                           analytical approach of the Colombia Country Disaster Risk Management Analysis (CCDRMA –
                         P129542). The CCDRMA is the first of its kind national level analysis completed by the Bank, and
                         in coordination with the Government of Colombia (GoC) through the National Planning Department
                         (DNP) and the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management (UNGRD), which comprehensively

                         evaluates disaster risk management at the country level.

                         The objective is to further strengthen Colombia's disaster risk management framework through: (a)
                         the application of disaster risk analysis and management in policy making at the sectoral and
                         territorial levels, and (b) strengthening of risk reduction at subnational levels. All preliminary
                         activities defined below are in line with the National Development Plan 2010-2014.

                         Component A: Governance. The objective of this component is to consolidate disaster risk
                         management as a priority in public policies, to strengthen institutional and financial capacity in order
                         to promote and guide investments in disaster risk management. This component will develop
                         activities for: (i) national DRM policy formulation, (ii) institutional capacity strengthening, (iii)
                         sectoral DRM policies and plans, and (iv) risk financing strategies.
                         Component B: Understanding risk. The objective of this component is to strengthen risk assessment
                         and monitoring and to promote greater awareness that supports decision making for risk reduction
                         and disaster management. This component will develop activities for: (i) technical and operational
                         capacity building for risk monitoring and early warning, (ii) risk mapping, (iii) strengthening of
                         information management, and (iv) strengthening DRM awareness.
                         Component C: Risk Reduction. The objective of this component is to decrease conditions of existing
                         and future risk through specific interventions. This component will develop activities for: (i)
                         technical assistance in land use planning and zoning, (ii) co-financing of projects for disaster risk
                         management and climate change adaptation activities* , and (iii) incorporation of risk assessment in
                         public investments. Because specific subprojects will not be selected until after Project Appraisal,
                         eligibility criteria for DRM investments will be developed in conjunction with the GoC. The
                         selection criteria will be built into the Environmental Management Framework and potential
                         subprojects that would result in a reclassification of the Project to a Category A would be eliminated.
                         Component D: Disaster Management. Given that the construction of risk is based on the historic

                         accumulation of inappropriate development practices and that despite efforts for its reduction, a
                         degree of residual risk remains, it is necessary that Colombia strengthen its ability to react to the
                         occurrence of a disaster through a phased approach to response, rehabilitation and reconstruction.
                         This component will develop activities for: (i) a damage and loss reporting system, and (ii) the
                         design of emergency and recovery plans.

                         Key results achieved through the implementation of the proposed operation will include the
                         consolidation of technical capacities across key national agencies and ministries, such as the Ministry
                         of Housing, City and Territory (MVCT) and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable
                         Development (MADS), for disaster risk management with specific emphasis on strengthening the
                         institutional capacity of the National Unit for Disaster Risk Management (UNGRD) to coordinate,
                         monitor, and evaluate an integrated disaster risk reduction program. Secondary key results will
                         include supporting the streamlining of disaster risk reduction at sector and subnational levels through
                         the inclusion of a number of newly selected agencies, ministries and urban conglomerations within
                         the project that are not currently participating in the Bank’s ongoing programmatic engagement on
                         DRM with Colombia.

                         *The National DRM Fund was created under Law 1523 with the mandate for improving local
                         capacities for implementing municipal DRM activities. The proposed subcomponent and activities
                         would therefore be contingent upon GoC co-financing through the National DRM Fund.

                           sector: the National Disaster Vulnerability Reduction project (APL-Phase 1) and the Bogota Disaster
                           Vulnerability reduction project (APL-Phase 2).

                           The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management (UNGRD) will be formally responsible for overall
                           project implementation as the designated lead institution for the National System of Disaster Risk
                           Management (SNGRD). As with other national agencies created under the Santos administration, the
                           UNGRD is currently in a phase of internal restructuring and is in the process of naming its sub-
                           directors. To date the Bank has yet to undertake a formal assessment of UNGRD’s implementation
                           and oversight capacity with respect to financial management, procurement and safeguards.
