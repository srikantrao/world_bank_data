2. Project Objectives
The development objective for the additional financing remains the same as the original
project. The project development objective is to improve the access to and, quality and
equity of education.

3. Project Description
The additional financing provides resources for an additional project component that will
support early childhood education (ECD). The original project components remain the
same with no changes. The objectives of the new component, Component 5: “Scaling Up
Community Based Early Childhood Development Activities? are: i) to expand access to
quality Early ECD programs among children unde six years of age living in rural
communities in selected provinces and districts; and ii) to establish the foundations for a
community-based ECD service delivery system that can be replicated nationwide. The
proposed component fully supports the development objective of the Education Sector
Support Project, namely, to improve access to, and quality and equity of education.
Specifically, the proposed ECD program will enhance school readiness of young children
and the likelihood they enroll in 1st grade at age six.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The proposed scaled up ECD activities will not trigger any new safeguards policies. The
parent project was classified as Category B with respect to environmental and social
consideration and triggered three safeguards policies: (i) Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP 4.01), (ii) Pest Management (OP 4.09), and (iii) Involuntary Resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12) due to the envisaged potential negative impacts related to school
construction and/or rehabilitation. Such negative impacts would include (i) the
management of wastes at the rehabilitation /construction sites, soil erosion, loss of
vegetation, rehabilitation of borrow pits, as well as dust and noise during the works; (ii)
issues around the water supply and sanitation in the schools; (iii) high demand of wood
for construction, e.g. furniture, windows; (iv) high demand for firewood for cooking; and
(v) use of chemical for the control of termites during the construction phase. The
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) addresses OP/BP 4.01 and
OP 4.09, and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) addresses OP/BP 4.12 basic
requirements.

   The ESMF and RPF were initially prepared as part of the documentation required
during project preparation for the first EFA-FTI CF grant and was reviewed by the Bank
and disclosed both in-country and at the Bank's InfoShop in August 2008. The ESMF and
RPF were designed to be the foundation instruments that provide the respective
frameworks that will apply to the parent project as well as future investments under the
Education Sector Support Program to be financed by FASE. Both the ESMF and RPF
were updated to include all the components of this new project and disclosed both in-
country and at the World Bank’s InfoShop on December 29, 2010 The ESMF for the
original project was further updated to include the Pest Management Approach and re-
disclosed both in-country and at the World Bank’s Infoshop on April 4, 2011.

   Since the current RPF and ESMF were disclosed in December 2010 and April 2011
respectively in the Bank InfoShop as well as in the country do not require any further
modifications, they will therefore be used as such for the proposed additional financing.
Environmental and Social Management Plans and/or Resettlement Action Plans will be
prepared as and when necessary.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The proposed scaled up ECD activities will not trigger any new safeguard policies. The
parent project was classified as Category B with respect to environmental and social
consideration and triggered three safeguards policies: (i) Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP 4.01), (ii) Pest Management (OP 4.09), and (iii) Involuntary Resettlement
(OP/BP 4.12) due to envisaged potential negative impacts related to school construction.
Such negative impacts would include (i) the management of wastes at the rehabilitation
/construction sites, soil erosion, loss of vegetation, rehabilitation of borrow pits, as well
as dust and noise during the works; (ii) issues around the water supply and sanitation in
the schools; (iii) high demand of wood for construction, e.g. furniture, windows; (iv) high
demand for firewood for cooking; and (v) use of chemical for the control of termites
during the construction phase. The Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) addresses OP/BP 4.01 and OP 4.09, and the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) addresses OP/BP 4.12 basic requirements.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
As indicated in the original project ISDS, there are no long-term impacts envisaged due
to anticipated future activities in the project area, from an environmental and social
perspective. All identified impacts will be adequately managed through the ESMF and
RPF.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
As indicated in the original project ISDS, no alternatives were applicable. The project
will be constructing/rehabilitating existing schools/institutions at identified locations.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
For the original project the borrower prepared both the ESMF and RPF and disclosed
both in-country and at the World Bank’s InfoSho on December 29, 2010. The ESMF was
further updated to include the Pest Management Approach and re-disclosed both in-
country and at the World Bank’s InfoShop on April 4, 2011. The ESMF and RPF provide
a framework for management of not only all potential negative environmental and social
impacts, but also streamlining the positive impacts during classroom construction and/or
rehabilitation. Officials in provincial offices work with project teams alongside with the
Ministry of Environmental Coordination (MICOA) to ensure compliance with both
national legislations and policy requirements from the World Bank safeguards policies.
Moreover, the project Safeguards team will provide the borrower with series of social and
environmental safeguards training workshops to strengthen their technical capacity. In
addition, the Safeguards team will undertake joint supervision mission with the
government to ensure timely and effective implementation of safeguards measures as
well as social and environmental clauses in the construction/rehabilitation firms.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
As indicated in the original project ISDS, the key stakeholders include the various line
ministries involved in the implementation of the Project. Both the ESMF and RPF were
prepared in close consultation with these stakeholders as well as beneficiary local
communities and the general public. Moreover, from the social development standpoint
this project aims at putting a strong emphasis on the inclusion of poor and otherwise
vulnerable children, women, and families (including to the extent possible children with
special needs). Participatory public consultation meetings aiming at raising awareness of
local beneficiaries to foster more ownership and social accountability will be organized in
all participating communities to better streamline women and poor households’
participation in the development and sustainability of this ECD program. The same
participatory approach would be applied to reach out and further sensitize local
beneficiary communities on other relevant social topics, such as HIV/AIDS prevention
and mitigation efforts and adult literacy.
