 B. Project Objectives

 The project development objective (PDO) is to develop the Micro, Small and Medium
 Enterprises (MSMEs) sector in Jordan.

 C. Project Description

 The proposed operation will be a Specific Investment Loan (as per the World Bank
 Operations Policy Directive OP 8.30) in the amount of US$ 3.5 million. The operation will be
 comprised of four main components: (i) capacity building of financial intermediaries and
 banks, (ii) development of a Consumer Protection mechanism, (iii) strengthening of the credit
 guarantee scheme, and (iv) improving the regulatory framework for micro finance
 institutions. The Bank loan will be channeled through the Central Bank of Jordan-the
  envisioned project implementing entity-which will be responsible for communicating the
  features of the loan to the financial intermediaries. The proposed project is classified as a
  Category C, as it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. No
  environmental safeguards instruments other than the Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS)
  need to be prepared for this project.

 D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
 (ifknown)

 The project will be implemented nationwide in all Jordanian governorates.

 E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

 Social. No social safeguards institutional capacity needs to be assessed. An Environmental and Social
 Management Framework (ESMF) has been developed for the Jordan MSME Development for
 Inclusive Growtb Project to identify, minimize, avoid, screen out, mitigate and monitor potential social
 and environmental impacts in compliance with both World Bank p·olicies and Jordan's applicable laws
 and regulations. The ESMF has been disclosed and adopted by the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ).

  EnvironmentaL Similarly, the sector's environmental institutional capacity was assessed in
 preparation for the Jordan MSME Development for Inclusive Growth project. Because this project
 does not finance any subprojects and consists exclusively of technical assistance, it is likely to have
 minimal or no adverse impacts. Nonetheless, it is highly suggested that capacity building of financial
 intermediaries include training on the application of Jordan's Ministry of Environment's EIA
 regulation 37/2005 to sub-project screening and standard mitigation procedures.
