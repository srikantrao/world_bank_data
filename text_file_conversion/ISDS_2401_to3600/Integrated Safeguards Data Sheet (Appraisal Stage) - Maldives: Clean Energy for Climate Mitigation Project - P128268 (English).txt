                              The development objective for this project is to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation through the use of renewable
                              energy resources and adoption of energy efficiency measures in an island community in the Maldives.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project comprises of two main components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1: Grid-connected Solar PV Systems. This investment component will finance the engineering, procurement, construction and
                              commissioning of 200 kW of roof-mounted, grid-tied PV systems on Thinadhoo Island. In addition, training will be provided to USUL staff on
                              operating and maintaining these systems over a six-month transition and handover period. The PV systems will be installed on rooftops of public
                              buildings - two school buildings have been identified as optimal locations for installation as they provide excellent solar access and visibility to the
                              community and visitors as is necessary for a demonstration project. The rooftop of USULs power plant has also been identified as another
                              possible alternative location, if necessary. Once the plant is commissioned, MHE will enter into an asset transfer agreement with USUL to transfer
                              the solar PV systems to USUL.

                              Component 2: Technical Assistance. This component will consist of the following three sub-components:

                              Sub-component 2.1: Energy Efficiency Improvement. This component will support initiatives designed to improve end-use energy efficiency on the
                              island. Consumer surveys would be undertaken to develop a baseline for energy consumption and assess the potential for electricity savings for
                              various consumer groups including at public buildings. A program for outreach and education directed at major consumer groups and key decision-
                              makers will also be developed to increase awareness on the benefits of energy efficiency and conservation. A number of energy audits will be
                              carried out and based on the results, a demonstration of energy efficiency savings and potential (which may include a range of interventions)
                              would be carried out in select locations in the island. Consultancy services will be provided to assist with design and development of some of these
                              measures, prepare an energy efficiency action plan for Thinadhoo and facilitate capacity building and training for USUL, MHE and the Island
                              Council.

                              Sub-Component 2.2: Owner's Engineer Services. A consultant will be recruited to advise MHE and USUL during the implementation of the
                              Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for the solar PV investment (Component 1). The consultant will advise MHE during
                              procurement, supply and installation, commissioning and the early months of operation of the systems. The Owne? s Engineer will also provide
                              on-the-job training for USUL staff as well as prepare guidelines, standards and model documents for use in future scaling up of distributed PV
                              systems.

                              Sub-component 2.3: Implementation Support Services and Capacity Building. A consulting team will assist in supervision and oversight of the
                              overall project and monitoring and reporting to GoM, Island Council and the World Bank. The consultants will undertake power systems planning
                              including integrating renewable energy and energy efficiency interventions into the supply/demand mix, contractor and consultant supervision,
                              communications and outreach to the community, and advising on dispute resolution, as necessary. Through on-the-job training, the consultants
                              will build the capacity of MHE and USUL in managing complex projects.

                               Thinadhoo Island is located in Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll, Upper South Province of Maldives at approximately 0°31'N latitude and 72°56'E longitude.
                               Thinadhoo is the capital city of Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll and is also the provincial capital. The current population of the island is around 7,000 people
                               about 1,000 of which are transient workers from other islands in the Maldives and from overseas. Thinadhoo also has a large sports ground which
                               attracts approximately 2,000 visitors to the island each year for several weeks. There are about 1,100 households on the island and the population
                               density is about 62.6 persons per hectare with 5.9 people in each household. The nearest inhabited islands are Madaveli (distance: 7.5 km,

                               inhabitants: 1,700 in 2010) and Hoandedhdhoo (distance: 9 km, inhabitants: 1,134 in 2010).

                               Land is scarce on Thinadhoo, although low lying coral areas are being filled to increase the land mass. The island has 1,357 allocated plots, 73
                               living plots, and 175 plots available. According to the new land use plan, a new residential area is being built on the northwestern part of the island
                               for population consolidation. Most house stocks in the residential areas are masonry built using traditional construction techniques; however, there
                               are two-storey houses recently built as well. Most building roofs are made of corrugated metal sheeting on wooden rafters inclined at 5-20
                               degrees and aligned in various directions. The settlement footprint covers 90% of the total habitable land area. As a result almost all land
                               available is currently being used for housing, economic establishments and socioeconomic infrastructure. All dwellings are connected to the
                               electricity distribution network.
