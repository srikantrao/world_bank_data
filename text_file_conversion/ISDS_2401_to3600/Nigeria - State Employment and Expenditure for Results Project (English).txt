2. Project Objectives
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the parent project is to enhance
opportunities for employment and access to socio-economic services, while improving
public expenditure management systems in the participating states (Bayelsa, Delta, Edo
and Rivers).

 The PDO would remain unchanged with Additional Financing.

3. Project Description
The project has following three components.

  A. Youth Employment and Access to Socio-Economic Services: Component A will
support three main activity areas: (1) Small public works and institutional strengthening
to generate youth employment in urban areas; (2) Technical, vocational and agricultural
training by providing grants to existing technical, vocational and agricultural training
institutions ; and (3) Community Development subprojects by providing grants to: (a)
FADAMA Community Associations and (b) Community and Social Development
Agencies (or other responsible agencies in Delta and Rivers).

 B. Public Finance Management Reforms: Component B will support carrying out
reforms by the Participating States of their public finance management systems,
processes and institutions.

 C. Project Implementation Support and Coordination: Component C will support both
federal and state levels institutions in implementation support and coordination.
Component C also provides funding for institutional strengthening of the Federal
Ministry for Niger Delta Affairs.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will focus on four states as the parent project: Bayelsa, Edo, Delta and
Rivers. In spite of its economic significance, the proposed project area is ecologically
fragile. The project area is a floodplain of about 20,000 kmÂ² including wetlands, creeks
and a net work of drainage. The area can be divided into four ecological zones: coastal
barrier islands, mangrove swamp forests, freshwater swamps, and lowland rainforests.
The major environmental and social problems witnessed in the region are those related to
the petroleum industry activities. The SEEFOR project was developed in close
consultation with the government and other stakeholders to support Youth and
Employment Initiative including training and capacity building in support of an
immediate public works
  program. This proposed project is expected to have overall positive environmental and
social impacts.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
From an environmental and social safeguards point of view, the SEEFOR is a category B
project and is not expected to change with Additional Financing. It is estimated that the
potential negative environmental and social impacts are expected to be minor, non-
cumulative, site specific and can be easily managed to acceptable level.

 Given that the Niger Delta region had been characterized by conditions of fragility and
conflict, the potential risks of conflict and elite capture associated with the identification
and selection of project sites and beneficiaries have been thoroughly considered and
discussed during early stages of implementation. As a mitigation measure, the task team
has identified an expert in the design of selection and targeting mechanisms for public
works programs, with specific experience in fragile environment, to ensure the adequate
mitigation of these risks, while improving the effectiveness of the project. Similarly,
further training to PIU on social and environmental safeguards was provided, including
on linkages between social safeguards and social accountability mechanisms for the
project.

  In addition to the safeguard policies triggered by the project as stated in PAD, one
additional World Bank safeguard policy is triggered by the project: Physical and Cultural
Resources OP 4.11. During the project preparation exact locations of projects sites and
magnitudes of sub-projects were yet to be identified. The sites for small public works
component are being identified now and include some sites of cultural significance which
triggers the Physical and Cultural Resources safeguard policy.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Same as in parent project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Same as in parent project.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Same as in parent project.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Same as in parent project.
