                              The GEF energy efficiency project will be operationally blended with electricity sector investments under the IDA financed Multisectoral Water and
                              Electricity Infrastructure Project (MSWEIP). The MSWEIP was approved by the World Bank Board of Directors on May 13, 2008, and is currently
                              been implemented by the energy and water utility REGIDESO.

                              The project development objective of the MSWEIP is to: (i) increase access to water supply services in peri-urban areas of Bujumbura; (ii) increase
                              reliability and quality of electricity services; (iii) increase water supply quality and reliability in Bujumbura; and (iv) strengthen REGIDESO’s financial
                              sustainability. The MSWEIP is helping REGIDESO to restore its financial and commercial viability and the quality and continuity of services in the
                              face of the increasing demand from individual consumers and economic agents. The MSWEIP has been designed to provide a balance between
                              immediate needs and medium- to long-term planning. It addresses to the urgent need to fill the current gaps between supply and demand in both
                              electricity and water supply. At the same time, the project supports long term planning activities and studies, as well as the strengthening of the
                              operational capacity of the main sector institutions in order to avoid or effectively reduce future gaps.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 All energy efficiency activities of the proposed GEF project are fully aligned and similar to the activities already covered under the MSWEIP
                                 safeguard instruments.

                                 The borrower will utilize the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which has already been adopted for the parent project
                                 (MSWEIP). Under the MSWEIP the following safeguard instruments were prepared and found satisfactory to the Bank: (i) an Environmental and
                                 Social Management Framework (ESMF) and (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The "in-country" disclosure took place on February 6,
                                 2008, and the documents were submitted to the World Bank’s Infoshop on February 21, 2008. Both documents were re-disclosed in country
                                 and at the World Bank’s Infoshop on June 15, 2010. No long term adverse impacts were identified in the MSWEIP safeguard instruments,
                                 specifying that the MSWEIP will not fund activities that would cause an adverse effect on the environment or any form of land acquisition, loss
                                 of valuable assets and/or restriction of access to sources of livelihoods. The potential environmental and social impacts of water and electricity
                                 infrastructure expansion and rehabilitation sub-projects under MSWEIP components 1 and 2 are assessed as small-scale and site-specific; and
                                 thus easily remediable typical of category B projects. With regards to the demand side management program under the MSWEIP component 1,
                                 which includes a first phase of CFL distribution and promotion, no potential negative impacts on the environment and impacts on people living
                                 and/or working on or near the project areas were identified in the project’s safeguards frameworks.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 Significant negative environmental and social impacts are not anticipated from the implementation of the GEF energy efficiency project.
                                 Potential minor environmental and social impacts of GEF energy efficiency activities are due to the increase of specific solid waste resulting
                                 from the replacement of old, low standard small scale appliances through more energy efficient ones (such as replacement of incandescent
                                 bulbs through compact fluorescent lights), as well as the tangible management (storage and transformation/destruction) of the CFLs. The
                                 Borrower will ensure that appliances (including CFLs) are disposed properly according to provisions in the environmental and social safeguard
                                 framework (ESMF). In addition, media and awareness raising campaigns for energy efficiency products will include consumer advice on
                                 potential environmental, safety, and health impacts of CFLs. No GEF energy efficiency activities are planned that would result in potential
                                 negative social impacts on people living and/or working on or near the project areas, such as land acquisition and potential physical
                                 resettlement and/or loss of valuable assets.

                                 Environmental and Social Management Plans will be prepared as and when necessary during implementation. Where MSWEIP project
                                 activities will potentially impact negatively on people living and/or working on or near the project areas, the procedures as described in the
                                 project’s resettlement policy framework are applied. Subsequently, a comprehensive resettlement action plan will be prepared, reviewed and
                                 disclosed accordingly and people will be compensated and/or resettled for any loss that they may incur due to project activities.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 Not applicable
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 An environmental and social specialist is already in place in the REGIDESO PIU and will be supervising the implementation of the GEF
                                 financed energy efficiency components. REGIDESO’s safeguard specialist is following up on safeguard issues as and when they arise during
                                 the two IDA financed projects under implementation. An additional safeguard consultant to support the REGIDESO PIU is currently under
                                 procurement with IDA support. The World Bank’s safeguard team is providing safeguard capacity building sessions to the REGIDESO PIU to
                                 provide advice and ensure safeguard compliance and implementation of key recommendations. In addition, REGIDESO signed a protocol to
                                 collaborate with the Ministry of Environment on water and energy infrastructure operations in 2010.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 The preparation process of the MSWEIP the following safeguard instruments (an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)
                                 and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF)) widely consulted potentially affected people in the Bujumbura capital area in both in French and
                                 in the local language Kirundi. The "in-country" disclosure took place on February 6, 2008, and the documents were submitted to the World
                                 Bank’s Infoshop on February 21, 2008. Both documents were re-disclosed in country and at the World Bank’s Infoshop on August 30, 2010.
                                 Media and awareness raising campaigns during project implementation provide for continuous stakeholder consultations, in both in French and
                                 in the local language Kirundi.
