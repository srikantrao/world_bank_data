                              Project). As set out in the Project Appraisal Document of the Tunisia MSME Development Project, the proposed Morocco loan ( APL 2 ) will be
                              submitted for the Regional Vice President’s approval and to the Board on an Absence of Objection basis:

                              •           Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Facility: to catalyze financing, risk-sharing and technical assistance to address policy,
                              legal, institutional, capacity, and informational constraints holding back MSME access to finance in the MENA region, and thereby to support
                              improvements in MSME employment, competitiveness, and incomes.

                              •         Adaptable Program Loan (APL): to improve access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises in the MENA region. The APL is
                              the IBRD financing mechanism for the MSME Facility.

                              •         APL 2 (Morocco): to improve access to finance for MSMEs in Morocco.
                              Project Beneficiaries:

                              17.       The end beneficiaries of the MSME Facility will be micro, small and medium enterprises. A wider definition of beneficiaries would include
                              Governments, regulators, and financial institutions benefitting from technical assistance. The end beneficiaries for the regional APL will be MSMEs,
                              with an emphasis on very small enterprises (VSEs). The financing of MSMEs will be channeled through eligible financial institutions based on pre-
                              agreed eligibility criteria.

                              C. Project Description

                              This project is part of the larger MSME Facility, which aims to provide a comprehensive package of financing and technical assistance for the
                              MENA region, jointly with the IFC. The APL is an IBRD regional financing mechanism that provides a structure for rolling out country level financial
                              intermediary loans (FILs). Country level loans under the APL structure can include a line of credit component and a contingent credit (risk sharing)
                              component, so that the most appropriate instrument can be applied in each market to support MSME Finance. The proposed Morocco loan is the
                              second FIL under the APL structure, following the first loan to Tunisia.

                              The APL 2 for Morocco will be a financial intermediary loan of USD 50 million, provided through the regional APL structure, in support of MSME
                              financing. This would be the second loan in an anticipated series of FILs across eligible countries. The main component of this loan will be a credit
                              line of up to USD 50 million. The project could also include a contingent credit (risk sharing) component, to be managed by the IFC or the CCG.

                              The credit line will be administered by the Caisse Centrale de Garantie (CCG) as an implementing agency, which will on lend to financial
                              institutions. The criteria for eligible institutions will be consistent with OP 8.30 and with those defined for the regional APL, and refer to legal status,
                              profitability and asset quality of the institution, commitment and track record in serving the MSME segments, and adherence to prudential
                           standards.

                           The World Bank will leverage partnerships through the MSME Facility in order to ensure comprehensive support to MSME Finance. The African
                           Development Bank is planning to finance the Morocco APL 2 in parallel with the World Bank (although the project is not dependent on this AfDB
                           financing), as with the first loan in Tunisia. A number of donors have also indicated potential funding for the technical assistance component.
                           Partnerships are being developed with non-traditional partners such as emerging networks of Arab and Diaspora investors and entrepreneurs too,
                           in order to address the demand side (MSMEs) and the shortage of pre-bank and equity financing for high potential SMEs and start-ups.

                           Policy Lending to improve the enabling environment for MSME Finance will complement this loan. The resulting policy and legal reforms will
                           strengthen the impact of the financing provided by the APL, by enabling financial institutions to offer financial services to smaller and under-served
                           MSMEs. A new Financial Sector Development Policy Loan building on successful reforms supported by previous DPLs is under preparation in
                           Morocco: The second pillar will comprise measures to enhance access to small and medium enterprises.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The second country loan under the MSME Facility regional APL structure will be located in Morocco. The loan will be passed on to an
                           implementing agency (the Caisse Centrale de Garantie in the case of Morocco), to be provided as lines of credit to eligible participating financing
                           institutions for lending to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. These MSMEs will utilize the funds towards MSME sub-projects and will be carried
                           out in the Borrower’s regions of Tanger-Tetouan, Taza-Al-Hoceima-Tatounate, Fez-Boulmane, Meknes-Tafilalt, Tadla-Azilal, Doukkala-Abda,
                           Rabat-Sale-Zemmour-Zaer, (Greater) Casablanca, Oriental, Marrakech-Tensift-El Haouz, Chaouia-Ourdigha, Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hsen, and
                           Souss-Massa-Draa, and the Borrower’s provinces of Guelmim, Assa-Zag, Tantan and Tata.

                           The operations likely to be financed under the project through medium, small, and very small enterprises (existing businesses and start-ups),
                           depending on the sector, the level of awareness of the entrepreneurs, the level of oversight by Government environmental agencies, and the
                           incentives available to businesses, are likely to have limited environmental and social impacts.

                           However, even with modest financing (for example, up to US$ 500,000 per enterprise per annum) some environmental impacts can occur (for
                           example in olive oil manufacturing; in sectors that recycle waste products; in sectors that affect natural resources; in manufacturing; in agri-
                           business) and the cumulative impacts of the entire operation could be significant. Additionally, labor issues (child labor, health and safety of
                           workers), if not managed adequately, could also pose a reputational risk to the World Bank Group.

                           For this reason, a procedurally simple system of environmental and social safeguards, a priori based on the exclusion of activities that carry high
                           environmental and social risks, would be implemented, as requested by all financing partners (Bank Task Team, the Central Bank, and commercial
                           banks). The need for simplicity arises from the narrow margins imposed by the operation, as well the limited risks associated with the proposed
                           operation. The borrower will prepare an environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) that will have to be satisfactory to the WB.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The envisaged implementing agency, CCG, has a long track record of MSME finance and a strong engagement with the Moroccan banking sector
                           through their longstanding MSME credit guarantee program.

                           Stakeholders displayed varying degrees of environmental awareness and capacity. Commercial banks ranged from being voluntarily ISO certified
                           to having no in-house environmental capacity.

                           The administration of this credit line will be supported by a Project Operations Manual, which would outline processes, roles and responsibilities
                           between the CCG, PFIs and the World Bank, and will include a chapter on safeguard policies. The client would propose an environmental
                           procedure for the project acceptable to the World Bank. Further training and TA could be considered to ensure the effective implementation of the
                           operations manual.
