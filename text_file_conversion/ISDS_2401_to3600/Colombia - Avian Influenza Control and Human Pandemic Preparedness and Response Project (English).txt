2. Project Objectives:

The ISDS is being updated for project restructuring.

The objectives of the Project are:

   i.   to strengthen the Recipient's ability for early detection of AHI cases and other Zoonosis in
        animals and humans; and
  ii.   build capacity to quickly respond and control possible AHI and Zoonosis outbreaks.

The Project consists of the following components:

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The two safeguard issues which pertain to the Project are those of environmental assessment
for technologies to be deployed for i) Strengthening the Recipient's national human health
laboratories ii) Supporting the design and implementation of an AHI epidemiological
surveillance system for early detection of AHI and other Zoonosis and iii) Developing manuals
for the disposal of culled poultry and of mitigating the negative impacts of mandated culling
of poultry on small scale backyard poultry producers.

Activities under the proposed project are not expected to generate any adverse environmental
effect as a large part of the project is geared to support prevention activities. The project
would overall have positive environmental and social impacts. The Project's environmental
and social issues relate to two main activities:

Building capacity for collection and testing of Avian Influenza virus. The Project's
investments in facilities, equipment, and training for laboratories will improve the
effectiveness and safety over existing avian influenza handling and testing procedures by
meeting international standards established by OIE. Any medical waste generated in health
care facilities will be managed using existing guidelines in the Republic of Colombia, which
are based on FAO, WHO and OIE directives. The Project would also support updating these
guidelines, training of health care workers to manage medical waste following these
guidelines, and, purchase of goods, reactives and equipments for molecular diagnostic of the
AHI virus and laboratory materials and equipment to collect and process samples for detection
of ailments in potentially affected animal species at key border health facilities
These provisions would be included in the Project Operational Manual to be prepared
prior to effectiveness.

Overall, the Project will assist the government of Colombia to develop a strategy for managing
future emerging zoonotic and infectious diseases outbreaks. As such, the project would improve
environmental and social safeguards in two areas: (i) improving training, capacity building and
bio-medical waste management systems in health facilities and adapt protocols and procedures for
the culling and disposal of animals during an outbreak, in particular by adopting O1E standards in
these areas

 2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
 project area:

Since the Project supports investments for equipment, training, sampling and handling and
analysis of samples and the safe disposal of laboratory wastes, an Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) has been determined to be necessary and has been developed with Bank assistance
by the Unidad Coordinadora del PTA at the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry with
the participation of other institutions like de National Health Institute and the Ministry of the
Environment. Even though the project does not finance culling and disposal of infected birds
and poultry, the EMP covers topics on these issues at the Bank's suggestion like
environmental screening for bird carcass disposal sites; procedures for management and
disposal of waste from laboratories; safe handling and use of disinfectants, and requirements
for surveillance and control activities related to wild bird population. All of these measures are
already a part of the national manuals for avian flu prevention in the various institutions involved
like the National Health Institute and the Ministry of the Environment and they include
guidelines for construction of small scale civil works for disposal of culled birds.

The project's EMP has appropriate provisions to cover, medical material handling and waste
management for handling and disposal of samples. The project's EMP will apply to the new
activity that is being added under the original Agriculture Transition Project. Furthermore,
revisions have been made to the EMP to strengthen the provisions for this project, and
the updated EMP has been agreed with the World Bank. The revisions made to the EMP were
relatively minor and based on discussions between SAT and the task team an agreement was
made that a further round of consultations was not necessary at this time.. However, the revised
EMP is ready for country disclosure and will be disclosed in country as soon as it is approved
by the Bank.

The project will not finance the construction of new facilities, and therefore no land will be
acquired during implementation. As a result, OP 4.12 is not triggered.

 3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
 impact

 No other project alternatives were identified

 4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
 assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

 Since the Project is assessed as a B-category project, an Environmental Management Plan has
 been prepared with all the necessary provisions to comply with bank safeguards and national
 legislation including the use of international accepted practices as those recommended by
 FAO, WHO and OIE.

 5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key stakeholders with regard to safeguard issues are:

  a)     Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development b)
         National Health Institute
  c)     Ministry of the Environment
    d)    Institute Colombiano Agropecuario (1CA)
