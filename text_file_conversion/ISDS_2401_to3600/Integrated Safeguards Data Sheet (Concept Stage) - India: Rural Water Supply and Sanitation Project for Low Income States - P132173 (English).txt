                           B. Project Objectives
                           The development objective of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project for Low Income States
                           (RWSSP-LIS) is to increase access to improved piped water and sanitation services for selected rural
                           communities in the target states through decentralized delivery systems. The key PDO level results
                           indicators for the proposed project are the following: (i) number of rural households having access to
                           piped water services; (ii) improvements in Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost recovery and
                           collection efficiency; (iii) number of Gram Panchayats (GPs) with drains and lane improvements;
                           and (iv) number of rural households adopting improved hygiene and sanitation practices.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will support the design and implementation of a ‘ring-fenced ’ RWSS program
                         in the Ministry of Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation (MoDWS) for improving piped water and
                         sanitation coverage in eight so-called ‘Low Income and Lagging States’. The Bank will support a
                         USD 1 billion first phase of this program in the states of Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand and UP. The

                         project will be implemented over a six year period through a special window of assistance under the
                         on-going GoI Program - National Rural Drinking Water Program (NRDWP). The project
                         interventions will be at all four levels: National, State, Districts, and Villages (including Blocks, as
                         appropriate). While the capacity building component will address the National and the State
                         requirements more broadly, the demonstration projects for decentralized service delivery
                         arrangements will be implemented in select districts, to be identified by each state. A district-wide
                         RWSS program with uniform policies and institutional arrangements, irrespective of sources of
                         financing, will be adopted for the identified districts under the project. Given that the different
                         project states have low and varying capacities to absorb the funds available, and given that these are
                         states lagging in implementation of ongoing RWSS programs and with below-average WSS
                         indicators, a performance-based allocation mechanism is proposed under the Bank project in order to
                         link the annual allocation of project funds with each state’s implementation progress and reform
                         achievements. Such a performance-based allocation mechanism is intended to improve competition
                         between participating states and thus encourage timely implementation of the necessary reforms and
                         efficient project execution and disbursements – with faster moving states being eligible to utilize
                         more of the project funds.

                         Key Elements of the RWSS Project for Low Income States. The RWSSP-LIS will promote
                         decentralized service delivery arrangements in the target states with increased Panchayati Raj
                         Institution (PRI) and community participation, improved financial sustainability and enhanced
                         accountability at all levels. A major shift from the ‘business-as-usual’ model currently practiced in
                         the four states will be the decentralization of RWSS service delivery responsibility to the District
                         Water and Sanitation Mission (DWSM) and the Zila Panchayat (ZP – District PRI) for Multi Village
                         Schemes (MVSs) and to the GPs for Single Village Schemes (SVSs) and the intra-village elements
                         of the MVSs. Another major focus is on strengthening policy and planning activities at the state and
                         district levels, with clear accountability to the GPs and the beneficiary communities. The existing

                         State Water Supply and Sanitation Missions (SWSMs), and the participating DWSMs, ZPs, and GPs,
                         will be strengthened and their capacity built to allow them to undertake their respective policy,
                         planning and review functions. An integrated approach to water supply, household sanitation and
                         broader environmental sanitation, along with water source and system sustainability programs, will
                         be supported by the project. Interventions for piped water supplies will be addressed through the
                         implementation of SVSs and MVSs, taking into consideration the availability and quality of local
                         water sources, along with catchment area management for improving source sustainability.
                         Sanitation interventions will address household sanitation, covering personal hygiene and household
                         toilets, and community sanitation requirements including soak-pits, drains and lane improvements for
                         disposal of sullage and wastewater. Interventions related to sanitation will be dovetailed with the
                         GoI’s Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) activities at the district level. ‘Software’ activities, including
                         information, education and communication (IEC) programs, will support the above interventions.
                         Healthy home/village surveys will be carried out periodically to assess improvements in hygiene
                         practices.

                         Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) will be explored for improving efficiency and acco untability,
                         especially with regard to the management of MVSs. International experience from Brazil and
                         elsewhere as appropriate will be leveraged for building capacity at MoDWS and, at the lower levels,
                         on monitoring and evaluation systems, on optimal agglomeration of service delivery models, and on
                         others areas of relevance.
                         Twinning arrangements will also be explored for the four target states so that they can directly learn
                         from the advances and approaches of ongoing, successful Bank-assisted RWSS projects in other

                         states in India. The proposed project will support the implementation of the sector reforms and
                         approaches in the target states, as have been demonstrated in other states. The following are the key
                         elements and approaches of the RWSSP-LIS, as discussed and agreed to date with MoDWS and the
                         four states:

                         •        Placing GPs and communities in a central role – supported by higher levels of PRI, by state
                         governments, and by local NGOs and the private sector – for facilitating, planning, implementing,
                         monitoring and providing a range of O&M back-up services.
                         •        Using sustainable, community or local government managed models for intra-GP RWSS
                         schemes and using State-PRI partnership models for MVSs.
                         •        Putting water resources security as a core theme of the new model, including increased
                         community management of scarce resources.
                         •        Moving the RWSS sector to significantly increase the recovery of O&M and replacement
                         costs, and initiating contributions to capital costs, while taking full account of affordability and
                         inclusiveness and while taking into consideration possible O&M funding available from other
                         sources.
                         •        Promoting green technologies like solar powered pumps for piped water supply schemes.
                         •        Moving towards 24/7 water supply where feasible (with bulk meters in all schemes and
                         promoting the use of household meters).
                         •        Promoting professionalized service provision management models and/or back-up support
                         functions for different market segments, based on optimal agglomerations of scale,.
                         •        Integrating water supply and sanitation with effective sanitation promotion programs for
                         achieving ‘clean villages’ and for responding to community-centric solid and liquid waste
                         management challenges.
                         •        Effective use of information communication technology (ICT) in planning, implementation
                         and monitoring of RWSS schemes.

                         •        Establishing Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) systems with independent reviews and
                         social audits.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the             safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Project interventions are being planned in four ‘lagging states’ of the country -- Assam, Uttar
                         Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. The interventions promise a huge potential for positive health and
                         environmental, as well as social benefits through supply of 'safe' drinking water and creation of
                         sanitary conditions in the village. However, given the extensive diverse conditions –physical as well
                         as socio-economic and cultural – it will be a challenge to translate the potential into reality. Of the
                         four states, two states (Jharkand and Assam) are predominantly ‘tribal’ and have substantial
                         geographical area under ‘forests’. In Bihar, mining is done extensively. In Uttar Pradesh, the project
                         is expected to confine itself to the eastern region which is characterized by high water table and poor
                         drainage resulting in high incidence of water transmitted diseases. Lastly, potable water may not be
                         available locally in a good number of habitations. As a result, water may have to be drawn from long
                         distances via large and complex multi village schemes which may necessitate special arrangements
                         for securing ‘lands’ for these interventions.

                         In summary, the project interventions are likely to interface with forests and mines as well as high
                         water table areas and lands. These issues constitute the salient features of the projects that are
                           relevant for safeguards analysis. These issues are however not new to the Bank’s RWSS team. In
                           several projects, over the last two decades, these issues have been addressed successfully.
                           Infrastructure improvements have always been integrated with human and institutional development

                           and complemented by effective Information, Education and Communication (IEC). Several social
                           and environmental mitigation measures will be included in the project design to ensure a net positive
                           effect on the environment and social development. The project itself is not expected to cause any
                           adverse impacts. However, the following key concerns will underpin safeguards management:

                           �       Water Quantity—appropriate water supplies through pipes and reducing dependence on hand
                           pumps thus reducing drudgery for women and children.
                           �       Availability of 'safe' drinking water – Quality Affected areas will be mapped and
                           interventions drawn accordingly.
                           �       Management of solid and liquid wastes to ensure good environmental health.
                           �       Weak institutions and capacity – Inclusive and Equitable institutional development through
                           capacity building and capacity support.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           Rural Water Supply and Sanitation activities are, chiefly, managed by government agencies that have
                           been mostly adopting top-down and supply-driven approaches, with hardly any community outreach.
                           Normally, these agencies are incentivized to build and re-build schemes, with little focus on
                           ‘sustainability’. As a result safeguard measures are not high on their agenda. Therefore, the project
                           will have to make efforts to bring in institutions and protocols for ensuring effective safeguards
                           management. The integration of safeguards management measures and environmental sanitation will
                           be a challenge in these states. Significant efforts will be needed by the state governments to
                           mainstream appropriate measures into the project design and implementation at the state level.

                           Capacities and ownership of the state departments will be enhanced during project preparation by
                           assigning them the responsibility for the preparation and coordination of the state level Environment
                           and Social Assessment and Environment and Social Management Framework (ESA/ESMF) in
Public Disclosure Copy




                           combination with consultant support. Furthermore, appropriate capacities will be built at the district,
                           block and GP/ village levels. The Environment and Social Management Framework will contain
                           appropriate institutional and capacity building measures for each state to be carried out during the
                           implementation phase.

                           Finally, the project will draw from the experiences of the World Bank assisted RWSS Projects
                           implemented over the past many years, especially Kerala, and Karnataka I, II., Uttarakhand, Andhra
                           Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The project will design appropriate capacity support programs as
                           well as implement the project in annual batches to learn and strengthen implementation mechanisms
                           for addressing the social and environmental issues.

                                      collect and analyze information regarding the environmental issues related to the project from
                                      each participating state in the first phase, on sample basis, and finally prepare an Environment and
                                      Social Management Framework (ESMF) to be integrated in the overall project. The aim of the EA/
                                      EMF study is to analyze the existing environmental issues related to rural water supply and
                                      sanitation and ensure that these inadequacies are addressed or mitigated in the project design.
                                      Towards ensuring accomplishing the social development objectives as well as addressing social
                                      safeguards, a social assessment will be done in each state. Subsequently, a decision will be taken
