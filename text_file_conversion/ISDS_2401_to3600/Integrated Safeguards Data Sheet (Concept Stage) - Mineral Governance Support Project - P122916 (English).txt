                              B. Project Objectives

                              The proposed PDO is to strengthen institutional capacity and accountability in the management of the mineral sector in Guinea.

                              C. Project Description

                              1.           Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              To address the PDO, the proposed project will support reforms, initiatives, and longer term capacity-building to enhance the efficiency and
                              accountability of institutions involved in the management of the mining sector. In the short to medium term, the project will help facilitate access to
                              resources to enable the realization of at least one large mine/infrastructure project. The project will also support the development of a framework
                              that promotes regional and local development of mining areas and strengthens demand for good governance (DFGG).

                              This would be done through four main proposed components:

                              Component A: Facilitating access to mineral resources ($8.0 million)

                              A1. State-owned mining/infrastructure asset management. In light of the recently adopted policy to increase state ownership of mines and
                              associated infrastructure (rail and road), this sub-component would provide urgent (i) support to setting up the Societee Guinenne du Patrimoine
                              Minier (SOGUIPAMI) to ensure that it has the governance structure, capacity, and independence from the state's regulatory functions to participate
                              as a partner with an international large-scale investor, without delaying mine and infrastructure construction and operations; (ii) training of relevant
                              government entities regarding available options for financing, ownership, access fees and operating costs of mines and infrastructure to enable
                              informed decision making, provide relevant technical and financial advisory services related to mining assets financing and management.
                              A2. Mining cadastre clean-up and reform: The objective of this sub-component is to facilitate and enhance transparency in the mineral titling
                              process and information. The project will support cleanup and resolving of status of existing titles, updating procedures related to the processing of
                              applications for mineral rights to reflect the updated mining code and regulations; and the provision of relevant training, hardware and software to
                              support a modern mineral cadastre, which would make online appropriate information available for prospective investors and other mining
                              stakeholders.
                              A3. Mining regulatory reform. This sub-component would support the implementation of the new mining code through drafting or updating
                              regulations, standards and systems to enable compliance of operations. This activity is expected to address regulatory gaps on fiscal issues,
                              health and safety standards, artisanal and small-scale mining standards; environmental and social standards; community development; and local
                              procurement of goods and services.
                              A4. Mining ancillary infrastructure. This subcomponent will also support legal and regulatory reforms needed to enable the development of mining
                              ancillary infrastructure. It will also support the work of the inter-ministerial committee on mining and infrastructure (Ministry of Transport, Finance,
                              Mines, Public Works, etc.) with longer term capacity building, negotiation skills, and the provision of appropriate advisory services. This would
                              enable informed decision-making regarding project prioritization and the management of mining ancillary infrastructure. This work would build on
                              assistance provided through EI-TAF and potentially PPIAF on mining and ancillary infrastructure in Guinea.

                              Component B. Institutional strengthening for mineral management (US$7 million)
                           B1. Institutional strengthening at the ministries in charge of mines, finance, and environment. This sub-component will follow up on the short term
                           support provided through the EI-TAF grant to assess existing contracts, titles and operations and to strengthen the capacity of the government for
                           contract negotiations following a due, fair and transparent process. This subcomponent will also support the development of control and monitoring
                           procedures, manuals and processes; and their implementation to drive the compliance of mining activities to the technical, financial, and
                           environmental accepted industry norms. It will train, equip and support staff from the above ministries in controlling mining activities in the field,
                           including those related to artisanal and small scale mining. It will also seek to strengthen the mining revenue collection systems and processes and
                           to facilitate coordination and collaboration between the ministries of finance and mines for an improved mining tax administration.

                           Recommendations from the Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SESA) feasible within the scope of this project will be addressed
                           under this subcomponent.
                           B2-Support to the Boke School of Mines. This subcomponent will strengthen the Boke Schools of Mines to increase the local supply of the large
                           demands in skilled and semi skilled labor expected from the realization of the mega projects. It will work closely with the private sector to identify
                           and target the training programs and modules in demand both by the public and private sectors. It will also provide the school with the required
                           training materials, tools and equipment.

                           Component C: Promoting economic development of mining areas and demand for good governance (DFGG) ($2.5 million)

                           C1. Public-private partnerships (PPPs)-led regional and local development: The geographical concentration of iron ore and bauxite deposits,
                           provide an opportunity for the development of potential growth corridors, if appropriate constraints to non-mining productive and employment
                           generation sectors are identified and addressed. This activity would support the government in developing plans to leverage public investments
                           and mining company social investments for poverty reduction. On a regional level, it would support the government in working with mining
                           companies to identify opportunities for other sectors of the economy, and address capacity and market access gaps. This subcomponent will
                           strengthen the capacities of local and regional leaders for an active and informed participation in their engagement with mining companies and for
                           the development of the plans discussed above.
                           C2. Strengthening demand for good governance (DFGG): The proposed project will support efforts to strengthen transparency (including EITI),
                           accountability, and participation in the management of the mining sector. Specifically, this sub-component will address the issue of availability of
                           information, disclosure and transparency. It will put in place an information sharing system (ISS) to enhance public understanding of the policies
                           and management of the mining sector. The ISS may build on and extend the EITI stakeholders approach into a mining accountability platform
                           which would aim at bringing together mining companies, government and civil society, mining communities, to work together on advancing
                           common socio-economic interests. This sub-component will support the EITI Steering Committee and the EITI process (including potentially the
                           post-validation agenda), and build the capacities of civil society, media, and parliamentarians on mining, governance, and sustainable
                           development. This work would build on current engagement with CSOs, media, parliament, and government institutions through the State and
                           Peace Building Fund Grant.

                           Component D: Project management (US$2.5 million)

                           This component will support the Project Implementation Unit, based in the Ministry of Mines, in the project management, procurement and financial
                           management of the project. It would also be responsible for project monitoring and evaluation.
