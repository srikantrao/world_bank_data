                              The development objective for this project is to reduce the dependence on imported fossil fuels for power generation through the use of renewable
                              energy resources and adoption of energy efficiency measures in an island community in the Maldives.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project comprises of two main components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1: Grid-connected Solar PV Systems. This investment component will finance the engineering, procurement, construction and
                              commissioning of 200 kW of roof-mounted, grid-tied PV systems on Thinadhoo Island. In addition, training will be provided to USUL staff on
                              operating and maintaining these systems over a six-month transition and handover period. The PV systems will be installed on rooftops of public
                              buildings - two school buildings have been identified as optimal locations for installation as they provide excellent solar access and visibility to the
                              community and visitors as is necessary for a demonstration project. The rooftop of USUL'➂ s power plant has also been identified as another
                              possible alternative location, if necessary. Once the plant is commissioned, MHE will enter into an asset transfer agreement with USUL to transfer
                              the solar PV systems to USUL.

                              Component 2: Technical Assistance. This component will consist of the following three sub-components:

                              Sub-component 2.1: Energy Efficiency Improvement. This component will support initiatives designed to improve end-use energy efficiency on the
                              island. Consumer surveys would be undertaken to develop a baseline for energy consumption and assess the potential for electricity savings for
                              various consumer groups including at public buildings. A program for outreach and education directed at major consumer groups and key
                              decision-makers will also be developed to increase awareness on the benefits of energy efficiency and conservation. A number of energy audits
                              will be carried out and based on the results, a demonstration of energy efficiency savings and potential (which may include a range of
                              interventions) would be carried out in select locations in the island. Consultancy services will be provided to assist with design and development of
                              some of these measures, prepare an energy efficiency action plan for Thinadhoo and facilitate capacity building and training for USUL, MHE and
                              the Island Council.

                              Sub-Component 2.2: Owner's Engineer Services. A consultant will be recruited to advise MHE and USUL during the implementation of the
                              Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract for the solar PV investment (Component 1). The consultant will advise MHE during
                              procurement, supply and installation, commissioning and the early months of operation of the systems. The Owner'➂ s Engineer will also provide
                              on-the-job training for USUL staff as well as prepare guidelines, standards and model documents for use in future scaling up of distributed PV
                              systems.

                              Sub-component 2.3: Implementation Support Services and Capacity Building. A consulting team will assist in supervision and oversight of the
                              overall project and monitoring and reporting to GoM, Island Council and the World Bank. The consultants will undertake power systems planning
                              including integrating renewable energy and energy efficiency interventions into the supply/demand mix, contractor and consultant supervision,
                              communications and outreach to the community, and advising on dispute resolution, as necessary. Through on-the-job training, the consultants
                              will build the capacity of MHE and USUL in managing complex projects.
