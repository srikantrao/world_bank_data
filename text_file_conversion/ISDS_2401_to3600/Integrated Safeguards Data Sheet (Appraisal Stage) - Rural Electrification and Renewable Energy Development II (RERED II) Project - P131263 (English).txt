                              The proposed project development objective is to increase access to clean energy in rural areas through renewable energy, promote more efficient
                              energy consumption, and improve the response capacity of the borrower in case of an emergency.

                              3. Project Description

                              In support of the vision of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) of providing universal access to electricity by the year 2021, the Project would
                              support the provision of renewable energy based electricity services, clean fuels, and modern cooking methods using the capabilities of NGOs and
                              the private sector. It will help reduce peak electricity demand by supporting a more effective energy-efficient lighting dissemination program. The
                              Project will support institutional development in the public sector so that the GOB can play a more effective role in increasing access to modern
                              energy services without further burdening the already overstretched public sector organizations.

                              Electricity Access Component: The Project would further scale up support to the successful Solar Home Systems (SHS) program of Bangladesh
                              for providing access to electricity to households and shops in rural areas where grid electricity has not yet reached. The target is to support
                              550,000 systems following the same implementation arrangements under the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED)
                              project. The Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) is the implementing agency of SHS program. The Project would also support
                              mini-grid schemes under the Government's Remote Area Power Supply System (RAPSS) guidelines of 2007 to meet the electricity needs of rural
                              households, enterprises, and businesses that could not otherwise be met with SHS. The implementation activities, including selecting the
                              sponsors for establishing, operating, and maintaining the mini-grids, would be undertaken by IDCOL . Sponsor equity will be a minimum of 20%
                              with IDCOL providing the balance funds (including credit and capital buy-down grant to keep the end-user tariff affordable). The least cost
                              technology options (solar PV, biomass gasification etc.) will be used depending on the resource availability in the specific locations of the mini-
                              grids. The component would also support solar irrigation pumps, and biomass and biogas based captive plants to supply electricity in rural areas.
                              The target is to support 42 mini-grids, 1,500 solar irrigation pumps, 450 biogas-based captive plants, and 28 biomass-based captive plants during
                              the Project period.

                              Household Energy Component: The Project would support the efforts of various NGOs in providing rural households with clean cooking solutions.
                              The activities supported would include: (i) awareness raising through social mobilization to ensure potential users are aware of the fuel saving and
                              health benefits associated with clean cooking; (ii) research and development to enhance product quality, performance, safety and durability; (iii)
                              setting up of performance standards, labeling system and testing facilities; and (iv) support to selected POs to generate demand and to facilitate
                              enterprise creation so that households are motivated to buy ICS or advanced combustion stoves. The Project would also provide support capital
                              buy-down grant for biogas plants for cooking. The target is to commercially disseminate about 1 million ICS and 20,000 biogas units within the
                              implementation period of the Project. Implemented by IDCOL, the component will build on the success of Bangladeshi NGOs in the areas of

                                                                                                                                                                       Page 1 of 4
                               community outreach in total sanitation programs. It will also build on the earlier work undertaken by local institutions in the areas of stove design
                               and reduction of emission of toxic pollutants from incomplete combustion of wood fuels. The implementation of this component will be in close
                               collaboration with on-going activities in the sector by NGOs, GIZ, USAID and upcoming activities that will be undertaken through the Global
                               Alliance o f Clean Cookstoves.

                               Energy Efficient Lighting Component: The Project would support dissemination of about 7 million energy-efficient Compact Fluorescent Lamps
                               (CFLs) in exchange of incandescent lamps to reduce peak demand in the country. In 2010, under the Efficient Lighting Initiatives of Bangladesh
Public Disclosure Copy




                               (ELIB) program supported by the RERED project, about 10 million CFLs were distributed to households in exchange of incandescent lamps.
                               However, post-installation surveys have indicated alarming levels of lamp failures. Rural Electrification Board, the implementing agency, has
                               claimed replacement of the poor quality bulbs from the supplier. Government of Bangladesh has expressed its strong commitment to continue with
                               the second phase and intends to initiate a re-bidding. IDA funding would cover the costs of CFL procurement including pre-award inspections, pre-
                               shipment inspections and testing, post-shipment testing; costs of distribution including training for proper distribution and documentation to comply
                               with CDM requirements; customer awareness; impact evaluation etc.

                               Technical Assistance to Power Cell: The Project would provide continued technical assistance support to Power Cell beyond December 2012
                               when the on-going Power Sector Development Technical Assistance (PSDTA) project will close. This would include, among others, support for
                               implementation of power sector reform, feasibility studies and environment and social impact assessments for various power sector projects in the
                               pipeline, and capacity building of the sector etc. This would also include support for establishment and operationalizing the Sustainable and
                               Renewable Energy Development Agency (SRDA) through the provision of office equipment and furniture, consultant services, and training, and
                               capacity building support for the energy regulator BERC.

                               Given the country's vulnerability to natural disasters, a contingent component with zero allocation is proposed to allow for the flexibility of a rapid
                               response in the event of an emergency (OP/BP 8.00). Should an emergency occur, the proposed project would finance public and private sector
                               expenditures on a positive list of goods, both domestic and imported, required for the Recipient's emergency recovery program.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The main investment components will support electricity access and clean energy services in the rural areas of Bangladesh where grid electricity
                               has not reached or is not expected in years to come. CFL bulb distribution will be restricted to rural areas only where people cannot afford to pay
                               for the high costs of CFLs.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The Project is targeted to further promote and scaling-up the renewable energy technologies and energy efficient bulbs. These interventions
                                  yield net positive environmental impacts. The project is designated as environmental Category B (partial assessment) according to OP/BP of
                                  the World Bank and only one environmental safeguard policy OP/BP 4.01 has been triggered. No significant and/or irreversible adverse
                                  environmental and social issues are expected in the sub-projects financed under the project.

                                  No public land will be used for the Project, and no land acquisition will be financed under the Project. Land required for the RAPSS sub-
                                  projects will be private lands made available by the sub-project sponsors via direct purchase or by leasing. IDCOL requires that the land for the
                                  sub-projects is free of disputes and encumbrances. All land for Project use, whether made available via direct purchase or leasing, will be
                                  screened to ensure that no physical or economic displacement of communities/persons will take place, and lands which are disputed or have

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 4
                           encroachments on them (informal settlers, non-titled entities) will not be used for the Project. It may be mentioned that such encumbrances are
                           very rare in rural areas.

                           The Project may extend facilities in areas where indigenous people (IPs) live. However, availing the facilities/services/products under the
                           components of the Project (SHS, RAPSS, household energy) is purely on a voluntary basis for all paying customers (including IPs). No
                           negative impacts are anticipated towards IPs. In cases of project activities in the IP areas like Chittagong Hill Tracts, the POs are well-versed in

                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            The major environmental concerns of this project are: (i) improper disposal/ recycling of lead-acid storage battery used in SHS; and (iii) health
                           impact of mercury from improper disposal of CFL bulbs. The implementing agencies will take several measures to ensure appropriate collection
                           and recycling of lead-acid batteries and CFL bulbs following the World Bank Group Occupational Health and safety Guidelines.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            No alternative analysis was carried out at this stage. However, alternative options will be explored during the RAPSS project identification and
                           design phase depending on the environmental and social impact assessments.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            IIDCOL has gained experience in implementing environmental management framework under the Bank financed RERED project. It has made
                           progress in establishing the Environment and Social Safeguards Management Unit (ESMMU) to institutionalize the environmental and social
                           management in its operation. IDCOL now has a full-time environment staff member who is working with POs and battery manufacturers/
                           suppliers to raise awareness about the importance of environmental and social safeguards and to discuss the environmental impacts of
                           improper disposal or recycle of lead-acid batteries. Visits are made by the staff to all battery recycling plants on half-yearly basis for ensuring
                           environment compliance. To further strengthen the ESMMU, IDCOL is in the process of appointing an additional environmental consultant to
                           guide the client in preparing and reviewing the environmental assessment/screening for subprojects.

                           Several measures have been undertaken by IDCOL to strengthen the battery recycling under the SHS component of the RERED project that
                           includes refinancing for battery replacement and enhanced incentives for POs and manufacturers for collection of expired batteries. IDCOL has
                           required the compliance of ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007 by all battery recyclers and battery suppliers. Already 12 battery
                           manufacturers out of the 13 battery suppliers of SHS program are ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001:2007 compliant, and the remaining one is
                           expected to be compliant soon. Also out of the three battery recyclers in the country, one has completed the required certification process and
                           the remaining two are in the process of obtaining certification. An annual environment audit will be undertaken to assess the adequacy of the
                           current mechanism for ensuring proper recycling of batteries.

                           For the energy-efficient lighting component, before distribution of the CFLs financed under the Project, a national guideline will be developed by
                           a team of an international consultant and a local consultant for the proper disposal of lamps and/or safe collection of waste CFL bulbs as part of
                           the ELIB program. Technical assistance provisions have been made to ensure safe disposal of CFLs distributed under the Project. IDCOL will
                           provide technical support to the manufacturers/suppliers for Environmental Improvement of Battery recycling through the RERED II Project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            An environmental management and social management framework (ESMF) was adopted under the original RERED project, which was

                           updated during the two additional financing of RERED. The ESMF has been further reviewed and revised for the RERED II Project. The
                           updated ESMF includes an assessment of the progress on the compliance of the activities undertaken in the existing ESMF. The updated
                           ESMF along with its Bangla version has been disclosed in IDCOL website (http://www.idcol.org) on July 18, 2012 and in World Bank Infoshop
                           on July 20, 2012. The environmental screening/assessment of sub-projects under the access to electricity component will include mandatory
                           consultations in the field level.
