2. Project Objectives
The project development objective of the Tunisia Participatory Service Delivery for
Reintegration (PSD) Project is to pilot participatory approaches to employment
generation through a cash-for-service program for vulnerable Tunisian households. The
program encompasses the financing of subprojects focusing on meeting social needs by
improving service delivery at the local level. The project contributes to: (i) fostering
social cohesion and stabilization among disadvantaged populations following the January
2011 revolution, and (ii) mitigating the socioeconomic risks faced by Tunisians returnees
fleeing Libyan civil strife and by Tunisian communities near the border with Libya
affected by depressed cross-border trade and commerce.

3. Project Description
The following components are proposed:

  A. Pilot Local Service Delivery Sub-Projects (US$4.3M):
  This component finances wages and consultant services under sub-projects that create
job opportunities in basic social service delivery, managed by the Implementing Agency
(IA), the Union Tunisienne de la Solidarite Sociale (UTSS).
 B. Local Service Delivery Sub-Project Training (US$0.43M): This component
supports Component A and would finance consultant services and goods for training and
skills development for workers and technical assistance to sub-project teams and local
government.

 C. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.27M): This component
would finance consultant services, goods and office equipment and supplies for the PIU
of the UTSS for day to day management and monitoring of the project. It would support
evaluating the performance of sub-projects, including periodic interim and final
evaluations. The PIU would be staffed by UTSS staff as well as consultants hired
through the proposed project for additional support.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
This project will target the regions bordering Libya of Tataouine and Medenine.
