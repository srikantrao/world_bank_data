                              The development objective of the project is to remove key constraints to business development and investment by: (i) simplifying business
                              registration and construction permitting processes; (ii) improving regulations and infrastructure underlying access to financial services; and (iii)
                              encouraging development of the mining industry, where Tajikistan has a competitive advantage.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The project consists of three components focusing on supporting:

                              (a) Strengthening the business environment,
                              (b) Encouraging the development of the mining industry; and
                              (c) Project management

                              Component 1: Strengthening the Business Environment (US$ 7.3 million, out of which US$ 1.0 million from State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
                              (SECO) is expected)
                              This component aims to make the business environment in Tajikistan friendlier to private firms and entrepreneurs by:
                              •          Continuing supporting reforms in selected areas of the investment climate, where the technical assistance provided by the Bank over the
                              last few years needs to be extended in depth and breadth.
                              •          Supporting the implementation of reforms on the ground, by complementing the technical assistance with a dedicated investment and
                              capacity building component.

                              The assistance envisioned under this component will address three specific problem areas: starting a business, obtaining construction permits,
                              and improving financial infrastructure.

                              Component 2: Encouraging the Development of the Mining Industry (US$ 3.1 million).
                              This component would aim at supporting the development of a conducive business environment in the mining sector, which has a high
                              competitiveness potential in Tajikistan, leveraging the new Competitiveness Partnerships Initiative (CPI) developed under the Finance and Private
                              Sector (FPD) network of the Bank . The component aims at (i) increasing the global competitiveness and attractiveness of Tajikistan as a
                              destination country for large mining developments and (ii) building the capacity to manage and regulate the sector, building upon a number of
                              previous Bank ad-hoc interventions in the mining sector (a mining strategy review, a review of mining legislation, and preliminary work on the EITI).
                              The project will be complemented by efforts being undertaken by the working group led by the Ministry of Finance preparing Tajikistan for
                              candidate country status for EITI, at which time it would be eligible for funding from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund to enable it to strive towards
                              compliant country status.

                              The component will build upon the preliminary steps taken by the Government of Tajikistan on mining sector reform-including the organization of a
                              Mining Technical Working Group- with a combination of TA, capacity building, and investment that would make the mining sector more attractive
                              for investment in exploration and exploitation as well as enhance the benefits received by the country from the development of mining operations.
                              Until recently the involvement of other donors has been limited, although the German aid agencies are intending to provide assistance on capacity

                               building and other issues in the near future. The Finnish government (through its Geological Survey) has also recently been providing help with
                               technical aspects such as digitization of the existing geological information. The World Bank is coordinating with both donors to build on each
                               other’s efforts and avoid duplication and in particular is cooperating with the Finnish Geological Survey on building the technological and human
                               capacity of the geological survey.

                               Component 3: Project Management (US$ 0.9 million out of which US$ 0.3 million from SECO is expected ) Component 3 will support the
                               establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the SCISPM. Project activities will be implemented with the help of a PMU to be established

                               within the SCISPM. The PMU will be charged with fiduciary functions and will include a financial management (FM) consultant, procurement
                               consultant, and a technical expert who will provide on-going support to various project activities, including those related to monitoring and
                               evaluation (M&E) of project results during the implementation. The PMU will work under the overall guidance of a Project Steering Committee
                               (PSC) composed of members of the main agencies benefiting from the project (e.g., the SCISPM, the NBT, and the Geological Survey). Key
                               project stakeholders will be represented on the PSC and appoint Project Coordinators to work with the PMU on a regular basis. Project operational
                               monitoring and supervision will be carried out by the PMU, which will work with the PSC to streamline the decision making process. Please refer to
                               Annex 5 for the diagram of the project management.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The project will be carried out in Tajikistan and all project activities will relate to the territory of Tajikistan. As the project is purely TA no physical
                               investments are planned, and thus no specific locations or physical characteristics can be identified.

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The Borrower's capacity for safeguards is low, especially the monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations is a serious challenge
                                  for Tajik environmental authorities. The key Borrower's are the lack of training, the lack of political and financial support by the Government, and
                                  the absence of a general culture of accountability and of environmental consciousness and care in Tajikistan. It is one of the declared
                                  objectives of the project to provide capacity building to the Borrower's licensing and enforcing agencies in the mining sector, which will include
                                                                                                                                                                                  Page 2 of 4
                           specific modules and activities for environmental authorities, mining agencies and the backstopping staff in their respective line ministries.
                           Synergistic effects are expected with ongoing large scale studies in the energy sector, where environmental authorities have been challenged
                           to actively engage and get exposure to assessment and evaluation procedures in line with good environmental practice.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:

                           The SESA is expected to be concluded within the first 2 years of project implementation, and it’s key results will be mainstreamed into the
                           advisory services provided under the project. The Committee for Investment and State Property Management (SCISPM) will assume the
                           responsibility and coordinative role in ensuring that all agencies and entities involved in updating and revising mining laws, policies and
                           regulations are aware of the contents and factual recommendations of the SESA, and understand their obligation under the project agreement
                           to implement the SESA results in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.

                            on potentially affected people.
                            The team recognizes that the key stakeholders for the project are heterogeneous and may have widely diverging interests and objectives.
                           They include the Government's Ministries and regulatory agencies, which will be responsible for developing and implementing the updated
                           regulations, large inert / multinational companies, who’s operations will be affected, and small scale and artisanal miners, whose livelihoods
                           could be impacted by new regulations, such as more stringent environmental requirements.
                           The team notes that the Recipient is committed to genuine consultations and welcomes the initiative to work with the Open Society Institute to
                           conduct the public consultations and engage the relevant stakeholders, including those involved in artisanal and small scale mining, who may
                           be economically affected by the policy and the legal framework reforms in the long run.

                         reviewed by the Bank team and found acceptable. These TOR describe in technical detail the analytical and advisory activities that would assist
                         the Government of Tajikistan in the parallel development of regulations facilitating the mining sector development, and of appropriate policy and
                         regulatory instruments and processes to ensure compliance with international good practice in environmental regulatory oversight. These TOR
