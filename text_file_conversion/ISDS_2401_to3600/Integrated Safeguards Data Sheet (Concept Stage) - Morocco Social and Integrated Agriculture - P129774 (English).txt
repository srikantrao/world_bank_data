Environmental Category: B - Partial Assessment
Is this a Repeater project? No
B. Global Environmental Objective(s)
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to contribute to Moroccan agricultural sustainability through the piloting of land, water, and
biodiversity conservation measures in selected projects directed to small farmers located in targeted marginal areas.
C. Project Description
0
0      Component 1: Development of the capacities of public and private institutions on land, water, and biodiversity conservation
a     Component 1 aims to develop the capacities of selected staff of public and private institutions involved in the planning and implementation of Pillar
II Projects for integrating land, water, and biodiversity conservation measures in projects directed to small farmers located in marginal areas.
0     Activities to be financed are:
.U    *       Training sessions, field visits, and study tours;
Q      *      Dissemination materials; and
 *    Awareness campaigns.
0..    Component 2: Implementation of land, water, and biodiversity conservation measures among small farmers
Component 2 aims to implement land, water, and biodiversity conservation measures among selected small farmers. For each Sub-project, small
farmers will benefit from goods, small-scale civil works, and services for the implementation of the measures, as well as training. About 15 Sub-
projects will be selected, to cover for the following incremental costs:
*       Construction of state-of-the-art drying pits in combination with PMV financed biphasic extraction units for olive oil transformation;
*       Construction of units of transformation of olive by-products into fertilizers, animal feed, and biofuel;
*       Construction of transformation units for the use of barbary fig by-product into animal feed, cosmetic products, and biofuel;
*       Construction of drying units for aromatic and medicinal plants;
*       Implementation of water saving techniques at field level (deficit irrigation and rainwater harvesting); and
*       Labeling of local products.
Component 3: Project Coordination and Management
Component 3 will cover the following:
*       Incremental operating costs for project coordination and management;
*       Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E); and
*      Audit reports.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)
The project will be implemented in targeted areas spanning over the regions of Marrakech-Tensift-Al Haouz and Souss-Massa-Draa, in Morocco.
Criteria for the identification of the areas will be defined during project preparation.


﻿E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The capacity of the borrower will be determined during project preparation. If needed, a specific capacity building program will be implemented
through the project budget.

_      Safeguard Policies                    Triggered?    Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01   Yes           In order to reduce potential risks, the borrower will prepare an Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF). The key objectives of the ESMF
are to provide a framework for the integration of social and environmental
aspects at all stages of the project planning, design, execution and operation of
various sub-components, and ensure positive social and environmental impacts
of sub-projects and avoid/minimize and manages any potential adverse impacts.
The ESMF will spell out the potential impacts in the sub-projects and outlines the
management measures required to effectively address these impacts. The
ESMF will also describe the appropriate institutional arrangements towards
implementing the measures proposed and the capacity building efforts required
that will be implemented through the project budget. In line with the
requirements of the World Bank, the World Bank's environmental and social
safeguards policies shall be applied to all sub-projects to be taken up under the
proposed operation.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04           TBD           It will be determined during project preparation (type and location of sub-
projects is not known at this time)

 III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS: 14-Sep-2012
B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and their timing
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
An environmental and social impact assessment (including and environmental management plan) will be prepared by the borrower and
disclosed both in country and at the Infoshop before appraisal. Indicative date: September, 1 2011.
