C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The SRF project supports the implementation of Rwanda#s National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics, by helping to address key areas of weaknesses and challenges faced,
SRF focuses on: (i). institutional coordination and capacity building within NISR and a few
selected MDAs; (ii). data development; (iii). promoting statistical information sharing among
data users to strengthen the quality of decision making; (iv). developing a data access and
dissemination strategy in conformity with best international standards; and, (v). investing in
statistical infrastructure and equipment. The project will build on existing technical assistance to
the statistics sector in Rwanda, currently being provided by development partners (DPs) through
the recently established basket fund and various other channels. DFID and EC are supporting
NISR through a basket fund arrangement, while other partners namely, UNDP, UNICEF,
UNFPA, Belgian Technical Cooperation, and AfDB are providing additional support through
separate but parallel processes.
