                              reforms; (b) systems development interventions including generation and use of data for increased accountability; and (c) improved governance in
                              the health sector and restructuring of the DOH to perform its enhanced stewardships functions in light of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project will use a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) financed through a Sector Investment and Maintenance (SIM) using a results-
                              based financing mechanism or possibly P4R. The project design will be based on the GOPb’s strategic sectoral plan with a robust results
                              framework and well defined qualitative and quantitative targets. The Bank anticipates providing in IDA funding US$135 million over a five year
                              period to this program, accompanied by support from the Bank’s Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (US$ 15 million) and co-financing from
                              DFID (US$ 100 million). The project will support the GOPb’s program under four components:

                              Component I – Reforms for Better Service Delivery (US$150 million). The objective is to enhance coverage, quality and access to a package of
                              essential health care services, especially for the poor and in underdeveloped districts of the province. The component will focus on districts mostly
                              in the southern part of the province, where the health outcomes are lagging. The package will include the following services: neonatal, child, and
                              maternal health, family planning, nutrition, and communicable diseases control. Primary Health care will be reorganized with expansion of 24/7
                              Comprehensive EMOC services in all RHCs and selected BHUs. The following approaches will be used: a) Contracting out - management of all
                              RHCs and BHUs in at least 15 districts with contracted management organizations responsible for health facilities including provision of preventive
                              and primary health care to the catchment area population under a results-based contract linked to achieving district-wide annual performance
                              targets for outputs; b) Contracting in - Strengthening the district health leadership in poor performing districts by deploying competitively selected
                              managers through an internal or external selection process under performance based contracts; c) District Partnership - Strengthening current
                              district health management model with a focus on delivering better results. In addition, the component will support improvement of quality of
                              secondary care services in the province through analytical work; and d) The component will also support specialized provision of preventive,
                              treatment and care services for population subgroups vulnerable to HIV infection (IDUs, MSM and sex workers) in targeted cities.

                              Component II - Reforms for Enhanced Accountability (US$85 million). The objective will be strengthening systems to enhance accountability and
                              governance. This component will focus on the following two strategic areas: a) Enhancing governance and accountability mechanisms including: i)
                              Functional/capability review, organizational restructuring; ii) Regulatory and legislative reforms including operationalization of the Punjab Health
                              Commission; and iii) strengthening social accountability through empowerment of communities/people by third part validation of results through
                              Regular Health Facility Assessments and household survey; data dissemination for greater accountability; community-based monitoring/auditing
                              using modern technologies; and facilitating development of public health surveillance system; the establishment of effective complaints
                              mechanisms; and third party monitoring and auditing of performance and results; and b)          Strengthening the DOH’s management systems
                              including: i) Human resource (HR) management systems focusing on development of HR strategy, establishment of HR cell, and separation of
                              management cadre from the general cadre; ii) Strengthening evidence based decision making with a robust (internal and external) M&E system to
                           measure and disseminate results concurrently improving quality, through third party validation and use of data from District Health Information
                           System; and iii) Improving procurement systems in the health sector through implementation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority reforms.

                           Component 3: Improving the Capacities in Technical Areas for Equitable Health Services to All (US$15 million). This component will support
                           strengthening of existing analytical capacities in technical areas and health care financing and operational research, training. Health care financing
                           aspect will focus on improving quality and efficiency of the sector expenditures, focusing on reducing OOP; enhancing public expenditures on
                           primary and preventive service provision, exploring other models to finance hospital care, increasing non-salary expenditures, and piloting

                           alternative financing models including health insurance/social protection.

                           The Bank and DFID will jointly appraise GOPb’s sector program based on the overall strategic plan of the Government and select 5-6 Eligible
                           Expenditure Programs (EEPs) out of a range of the GOPb’s budget line items that reflect the desired outcomes of the program. Determination of
                           eligibility of disbursements will be based on: i) expenditure reports (this requires adequate financial reporting arrangements); and ii) performance
                           reports to track accomplishment of pre-specified results, as measured by disbursement linked indicators (DLIs). (An agreed percentage of EEP
                           will be disbursed contingent on the verification of the achievement of agreed DLIs and achievement of agreed level of expenditures (e.g., 70% of
                           allocation) by the government. In implementing such a results-based financing mechanism, it will be essential that the DOH’s financial
                           management system be strengthened to track, record, analyze and summarize financial transactions and to provide reliable periodic financial
                           reports for the whole sector/ program rather than tracking the Bank funds only.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be implemented across the province over a five year period. The focus of the program is on the public sector with health facilities
                           located within both urban and rural areas. Sixty percent of the population of the country lives in the province ofPunjab (land of five rivers), which
                           has geographical variation from green mountains in the upper part to the rugged and barren hills towards its west. Predominantly the plains of the
                           Punjab are irrigated and are considered to be the food basket of the country. The province also has two large tracts of deserts, Cholistan and Thal.
                           The province also has five large cities with population over one million. Disposal of medical waste, which would be the prime focus from
                           environmental safeguards perspective, could therefore have implications both from geographical variation and population density.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The institutional arrangements that already exist to implement the safeguard requirements of the Punjab Government of Department of Health will
                           be reviewed during preparation for the proposed project. These arrangements work under the Director General of Health. A focal person however
                           will be identified as the environmental and social focal point, with overall responsibility for fulfilling the safeguard requirements of the proposed
                           project in the Health Sector reform unit for safeguard compliance. Capacity-building for implementing the safeguard policies will be one of the key
                           functions of the focal person.
