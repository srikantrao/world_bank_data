                              The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the productivity of key livestock production systems for targeted female and male
                              smallholder producers in selected areas of the Recipient’s territory. Specifically, the project will target selected species including cattle, small
                              ruminants (sheep and goats), pigs and poultry for smallholder producers in Eastern, Southern and Western provinces and the Disease Free Zone

                              comprising Central, Lusaka and parts of Copperbelt provinces.

                              3. Project Description

                              1.         The project’s focus will be to control livestock diseases of an epidemic nature and with trans-boundary (regional/international)
                              significance and enhance the productivity of smallholder livestock producers. The project will target production systems (see Annex 2 for
                              description of these production systems) from selected animal species including cattle, sheep and goats, poultry and pigs. The project will
                              strengthen veterinary services (public and private) and address other identified constraints by supporting productive investments (infrastructure,
                              equipment, and technologies) and improve access to advisory and extension services by encouraging the formation of groups. The use of
                              Community Livestock and Animal Health Workers and private service providers will be scaled up. The project will prioritize the introduction of
                              technologies that reduce livestock mortality particularly in young stock, and improve reproductive efficiency to enable animals to quickly reach
                              optimum slaughter weight.

                              2.         To support this effort, the project will provide equipment, ensure the rehabilitation or construction of critical public and community
                              infrastructure, and facilitate skills training of front line animal production and veterinary staff. To strengthen capacity of sector institutions, the
                              project will provide logistical support and training focused at both academic and technical/management skills training for public national institutions
                              and producer organizations.

                              3.       Targeted support will cover the major animal rearing provinces including Eastern, Southern and Western provinces including the
                              designated Disease Free Zone comprising Central and Lusaka and parts of Copperbelt provinces. The project will control outbreaks of livestock
                              diseases of an epidemic nature and with trans-boundary (regional/international) significance outside the project boundaries.

                              4.     The project will have three components: (i) Livestock Services Provision; (ii) Productive On-Farm Investments; and (iii) Project
                              Management. The project is expected to be implemented over a six year period.

                              5.          Component 1: Livestock Services Provision (IDA, US$25.45 million). The objectives of this component are to: (i) strengthen the zoonotic
                              and contagious animal diseases surveillance and control systems, including laboratory diagnostic capacities; (ii) build institutional capacity within
                              the MoAL to improve service delivery; and (iii) improve the capacity to monitor food safety of facilities (slaughterhouses, milk collection centers,
                              etc.) in the targeted project areas. This component will support the strengthening of Veterinary Services, achieving an appropriate balance
                              between public and private sector and professional and paraprofessional staff, as defined by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). It
                              will build on the evaluation of the performance of the Veterinary Services (PVS) using the PVS Tool, that was carried out in July 2008 by the OIE
                              and the subsequent Gap Analysis conducted recently where national priorities were defined. The component will support the following activities:


                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 5
                         6.         Sub-Component 1.1: Strengthening the Surveillance, Diagnostic and Control of Animal Diseases (IDA, US$9.89 million): This sub-
                         component will support the strengthening of active surveillance systems for zoonotic and major contagious animal diseases and scale-up
                         vaccinations against major diseases. It will provide support to pre-defined disease control strategies including vaccination campaigns and
                         progressive zoning approach, in collaboration with the private sector. This sub-component will also help to establish a network of Community
                         Livestock/Animal Health Workers who will be first call service providers to producers’ groups for animal health services provision. The sub-
                         component will provide short-term training, logistical support and equipment to decentralized Veterinary offices (Provincial and District Veterinary
                         Camps), as well as develop and support mechanisms for establishing private veterinarians in rural areas. It will consolidate and scale up the

                         national disease information system (LIMS) through training and using Information Technology equipment. Finally, it will provide support for
                         Laboratory Capacity Improvement through: (i) laboratory infrastructure improvement; (ii) equipment, material and consumables; (iii) training of
                         laboratory staff, and (iv) development and implementation of a quality management system to access accreditation for specific tests.

                         7.        Sub-Component 1.2: Support for Livestock Infrastructure and Access to Services (IDA, US$8.44 million). This sub-component will
                         support the MoAL and Local Authorities to establish or rehabilitate essential livestock infrastructure (e.g., Livestock Service Centers (LSCs) ,
                         markets, slaughter facilities, etc.) in agreed locations subject to an Infrastructure Inventory and Needs Assessment. Management of such publicly-
                         owned infrastructure would be covered under a contractual arrangement with the private sector as appropriate. Selection of investments to be
                         supported under this sub-component will be coordinated along with those being implemented by other donors and projects. Criteria for
                         determining the optimal type and location of public investments will be detailed in the Project Implementation Manual (PIM).

                         8.          Sub-Component 1.3: Institutional Support to MoAL (IDA, US$7.12 million). The sub-component will strengthen staff capacity in the
                         Ministry to carry out its core responsibilities, including extension and advisory services, disease control, sector monitoring and evaluation, sector
                         analysis, policy preparation and implementation. Activities under this sub-component will include: (i) a comprehensive needs assessment and
                         training plan for the Ministry as a pre-requisite to training activities; (ii) formal and in-service training of Ministry staff in selected disciplines where
                         major gaps have been identified; (iii) vehicles and office equipment to improve efficient delivery of advisory and technical services to farmers; (iv)
                         preparation and implementation of development plans of key training institutions offering tertiary and advanced level training in animal health and
                         livestock production (i.e., Zambia Institute of Animal Health, Natural Resources Development College and the Palabana Dairy Training Institute);
                         (v) assist in developing and decentralizing the LIMS, including improved analytical capacities in data analysis; and (vi) develop an M&E system for
                         the MoAL. Specific support will be also provided to develop and implement, in close collaboration with the private sector, key policy options,
                         institutional reforms and review of the legislative framework which will contribute to building an environment for sustainable growth of the livestock
                         sector. This sub-component will assist the MoAL in strengthening its collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Zambian Bureau of
                         Standards (ZABS) to identify gaps in national hygienic standards based on the Food and Drugs Act to regulate facilities such as slaughterhouses,
                         facilitate the adoption of existing ones such as dairy standards, and organize training and public awareness campaigns for private sector (farmers,
                         processors, transporters, traders, etc.) and inspectors from both Ministries on standards implementation and enforcement. It will also support the
                         joint development and implementation of surveillance plans to monitor residues, Brucellosis, Salmonellosis, etc. Finally, the sub-component will
                         provide seed money for the establishment of an “Emergency Animal Diseases Control Fund?.

                         9.         Component 2: Productive On-farm Investments (IDA, US$18.15 million): The objective of this component is to improve productivity of
                         identified production systems through support to on-farm investments. In the smallholder sector, the priority would be to introduce technologies
                         that reduce livestock mortality particularly in young stock, improve reproductive efficiency and enable animals to quickly reach optimum slaughter
                         weight. Smallholder access to services and markets would be improved through group formation, provision of essential livestock infrastructure, and
                         delivery of improved technology packages by Ministry field staff augmented by Community Livestock Workers and private service providers. More
                         specialized advisory services and technical packages would be made available through producer organizations. Support would also be provided
                         for pasture and fodder improvement and utilization and dry season feeding technologies. This component will support the following sub-

                         components:

                         10.         Sub-Component 2.1: Support for the Livestock Improvement Grant Facility (IDA, US$14.69 million): A Livestock Improvement Grant
                         Facility (LIGF) will be created to allow eligible smallholder producers (groups or cooperatives) and other livestock industry stakeholders to establish
                         productive livestock investment packages (i.e., sub-projects). These packages would include, inter alia, essential infrastructure (e.g., communal
                         cattle handling facilities, milk collection centers, feedlots, grass fodder production methods, etc.), enhanced genetic merit livestock (e.g., grade
                         dairy cattle, pigs, goats), access to improved services (e.g., veterinary, Artificial Insemination, Community Livestock/Animal Health Worker training)
                         marketing and value addition activities. Improving range productivity and on-farm establishment and utilization of pastures, including legumes, are
                         critical. This activity will offer small grants which will focus on practical range improvement measures, on-farm adaptive research, innovative
                         extension and demonstration packages, and improved dry season utilisation of crop residues. Adoption of grass/fodder production methods used
                         by farmers will also be facilitated by the LIGF. Investment packages would include both capital cost as well as limited operational cost support.
                         Technical assistance to mentor the successful implementation of the sub-projects, as well as a comprehensive training program would also be
                         included. Recipients would be expected to contribute around 25 percent of the investment costs in cash or kind (e.g., building materials).

                         11.        Sub-Component 2.2: Pasture management and forage development (IDA, US$2.20 million): Improving range productivity and on-farm
                         establishment and utilization of forage including legumes, are critical. This grant subcomponent will offer small grants to specialized institutions (i.
                         e. NGOs, training and research institutions) with successful tracked record in introducing to small-scale farmers techniques and technologies that
                         aiming at increasing feed availability during dry season (see Annex 2). Adoption of participatory range land management techniques and grass/
                         fodder production methods used by farmers will be facilitated by this sub-component.

                         12.        Sub-Component 2.3: Strengthening Capacities of Non-Public Service Providers (IDA, US$1.26 million): This sub-component will co-
                         finance activities which will specifically contribute to improved advisory, advocacy and information services for small-scale producers by
                         organizations such as the Poultry Association of Zambia (PAZ), the Dairy Association of Zambia (DAZ), and two Commodity Committees (beef and
                         pigs) of the Zambian National Farmers Union (ZNFU). Farmers who are unable to be in formal groups but require access to more specialized farm
                         management and business planning advisory services on an individual basis, as well as access to credit for on-farm investments, will be supported
                         by the project through the funding of technical assistance to enhance agri-business and technical farming skills, as well as to prepare investment
                         packages for submission to other credit agencies for funding. This sub-component will also support the establishment of an independent Veterinary
                         Statutory Body aimed at regulating the veterinary profession.

                         13.       Component 3: Project Management (US$5.4 million). The objective of this component is to ensure efficient and timely delivery of project
                         resources in accordance with its objectives. It will support the es tablishment, operation, equipment and training of project coordination offices at
                         both national and provincial levels, as well as the operational costs of the national Project Steering Committee and the Technical Committee. This
                         component will also finance: (i) implementation and administration of the LIGF; (ii) M&E activities including regular impact evaluation studies and
                                                                                                                                                                     Page 2 of 5
                         audits; management and oversight of safeguards issues; and (iii) preparation and implementation of a communication strategy for the project.
                         Project support for various components and activities would be included in the general project management.

                         4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         The project will be located in Eastern, Southern and Western provinces including the designated Disease Free Zone comprising Central and
                         Lusaka and parts of Copperbelt provinces. A common salient physical characteristic in all provinces is soils which are easily erodible and are
                         susceptible to rainfall with a high erosive power which falls during the rainy season that lasts from November to April annually.

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 Safeguard issues associated with the project will be those related to: (i) soil erosion in poorly managed pasture lands; (ii) waste and effluent
                                 management from slaughter houses, milk collection centers, Livestock Service Centers (LSCs) and markets; (iii) bio-medical waste
                                 management from pesticide use and other veterinary activities; (iv) negative impacts during construction/rehabilitation of livestock infrastructure
                                 such as LSCs, slaughter facilities and markets; and and (v) other direct or indirect impacts on natural habitats or physical cultural resources. .
                                 The project is not expected to result in large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The project includes mitigation measures to address
                                 potential environmental and social impacts, including on critical natural habitats, physical cultural resources, as well as managing adverse
                                 impacts of pest management measures.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 There are no major potential indirect and/or long term impacts anticipated due to future activities in the project area.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 There were no alternatives applicable to the LDAHP.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MoAL) has prepared an ESMF, Pest Management Plan and a Resettlement Policy Framework to
                                 provide a unified approach for addressing potential negative impacts from the project. The Ministry has been implementing projects funded by
                                 the Bank such as the Agriculture Development Support Project and Irrigation Development and Support Project, which required preparation of
                                 safeguards instruments and implementation of tools provided by the instruments for compliance with World Bank safeguard policies. An
                                 additional safeguard specialist may be required by the MoAL as the number of projects within the Ministry increases.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 The project’s key stakeholders are the direct beneficiaries who include 390,000 female and male smallholder producers in the targeted areas
                                 who rear cattle, small ruminants (sheep and goats), pigs and poultry, including members of producer organizations. They also include 560 staff
                                 members in the MoAL who will receive training using project funds. Consultations took the form of meetings with representative leaders of the
                                 communities. Community radio stations will be used for disseminating information to potentially affected people. The Zambia Environmental
                                 Management Agency (ZEMA) is mandated with the oversight role for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies/ Zambia EIA legislation.
