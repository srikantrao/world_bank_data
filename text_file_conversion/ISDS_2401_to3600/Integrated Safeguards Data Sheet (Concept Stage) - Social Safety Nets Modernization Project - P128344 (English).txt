                           B. Project Objectives
                           The development objective of the proposed project is to improve the performance of Ukraine’s social
                           assistance and social services system for low-income families, to support gradual de-
                           institutionalization of childcare services and strengthen the administration of both benefits and
                           services. The Project Development Objective would be achieved by:
                           •        Designing and implementing improved parameters of the selected social assistance programs
                           (eligibility criteria, benefits duration, recertification and intake processes) to support the living
                         standards of low-income families, especially those with children, and protect the poor from the
                         effects of energy price increases;
                         •        Establishing inter-program connections that would help increase synergy of support

                         delivered through different programs and services to the same family on welfare;
                         •        Designing and implementing family support services to strengthen the ability of families to
                         care for their children, prevent unnecessary placement of children in institutions and speed
                         reunification;
                         •        Supporting measures for more efficient administration of social benefits and services through
                         (i) strengthening performance management to be supported by the national MIS; (ii) streamlining
                         oversight and control procedures under a central unit for social inspection; and (iii) integrating
                         interfaces for various benefits and services in to a single MIS to support a one-stop shop business
                         model for local welfare offices (LWOs).
                         C. Project Description
                         The proposed project would be implemented over six years, through a Result-Based Financing
                         (RBF)/Specific Investment Loan (SIL) IBRD loan in the amount of US$ 300 million plus
                         government counterpart funds of approximately US$ 2.3 billion to finance GMI program.

                         The proposed project would consist of two inter-related components. As an RBF type operation, the
                         first component would co-finance a share of the family transfer system aimed at protecting both large
                         and single parent families, as these programs become more efficient in addressing poverty and as
                         other categorical programs are consolidated and downsized. In this component, disbursements would
                         be triggered by achievement of specific results (as discussed in more detail below). This component
                         would foster the Government reform agenda, namely (1) stronger reliance on means-tested programs
                         with higher impact on poverty and improving targeting accuracy through parametric reforms; and
                         introduction of pro-poor mitigation measures in the face of energy price increases; (2) effective
                         social support to families in need and vulnerable families through concerted provision of benefits and
                         services and supporting de-institutionalization of children services; (3) modernization of
                         administration to ensure efficient oversight and controls in both benefits and services and reduced

                         administrative costs and private beneficiaries’ costs.

                         The second component to follow standard World Bank procedures for investment lending would,
                         through an array of TA activities, facilitate the implementation of parametric and administrative
                         reforms envisaged under Component 1 and also help enhance the quality of social support with a
                         stronger link between benefits and services and their greater customization aimed at sooner social
                         activation of welfare recipients of working age but not employed, not receiving education or training
                         and not disabled as well as family preservation and child institutionalization prevention.
                         Administrative modernization would be supported with the further development of Management
                         Information System built under the previous SASMP. This TA would contribute, inter alia, to
                         improved oversight and control procedures. This component would also help to build the
                         institutional framework for outsourcing services and, by way of supporting the Governments's plan
                         for de-institutionalization of children services, would finance the investments and TA intended for
                         transformation of institutional care into family- and community-based care in two selected oblasts.
                         The relevant plans for transformation of the residential care in the two oblasts will be prepared and
                         costed under the ECA Capacity Development grant.

                         The two components are inherently linked through the definition of the results framework.
                         Specifically, technical and system improvements as well as development of new models of service
                         delivery supported by Component 2 contribute to the achievement of results that would trigger
                           disbursements under Component 1 (they represent necessary, but not sufficient conditions to achieve
                           the DLIs). With this approach, the value added would be generated from the interaction of the co-
                           financing, the results framework, implementation support, direct technical investments in SSN

                           administration, and the deeper, longer-term partnership and engagement between the World Bank
                           and the GoU on SSN reforms.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be located nationwide; the specific project sites are going to be selected during
                           implementation.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Ministry of social policy has extensive experience in implementing WB- financed operations,
                           including management of civil works under Social Assistance System Modernization project and
                           Social Investment Fund project. The proposed project will rely on institutional and safeguard
                           capacity of the Social Investment Funds to conduct civil works in two selected oblasts.
