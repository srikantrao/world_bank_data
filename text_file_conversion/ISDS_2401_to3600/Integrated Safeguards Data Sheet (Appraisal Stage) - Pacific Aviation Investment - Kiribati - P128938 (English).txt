Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component A: International Airport Infrastructure Investments: This component will invest in the aviation infrastructure at Kiribati's two currently
                              operating international airports: Bonriki and Cassidy. The project investments will complement parallel financing provided by NZAP grant (NZ$ 17
                              million) for the resurfacing of the Cassidy runway and by a Taiwan, China loan (AU$ 14 million) for resurfacing the runway. The project funds will
                              be used for: (i) replacement of the terminal at Cassidy Airport and improvements to the terminal at Bonriki Airport; (ii) resealing the road from
                              London to Cassidy Airport to maintain access; (iii) installation of new navigation aids, safety and security equipment at both airports; (iv) a security
                              fence for Bonriki airport; and (v) completion of the seawall at TRW (that was partially constructed under the Kiribati Second Climate Adaptation
                              Project); and, (vi) provision of fire safety equipment for the Police Force.

                              Component B: Sector Reform: Finance technical assistance to the MCTTD including: (i) development of civil aviation technical regulations and
                              manuals; (ii) preparation and adoption of an Air Transport Master Plan (including a policy road map for separating the roles of regulator and airport
                              operator); measures for airport security strengthening through penal code amendments and public awareness campaign; projections for air traffic
                              demand, including over-flights; identifying sources of revenue, public service obligations and gap financing; needs, and prioritization of domestic
                              airstrip needs; (iii) a Project Manager in the MCTTD; and, (iv) a short term aviation regulatory specialist to facilitate the necessary approvals and
                              establishment
                              of an independent KAL and to advise aviation staff in the MCTTD on adopting and enforcing manuals, etc as they are prepared.

                              Component C: Strengthening airport operations and management capacity: An independent public entity Kiribati Airports Ltd. (KAL) will be created
                              to for the management and operation of both of Kiribati's international airports. Due to the acute lack of local specialized capacity to operate
                              international airports capable of meeting ICAO standards, KAL will initially contract management expertise and on-site training capacity through a
                              three-year management contract covering the operations of Bonriki and Cassidy International Airports. The contract will include local staff
                              development and preparation of a transition plan in the last year of the contract. The assignment will include technical assistance to support KAL
                              with the review and implementation of the transition plan at the end of the management contract. The Board of Directors should include high level
                              GOK and stakeholders' representation.

                              Component D: Project Support and Training: This component will finance the support required by that various parties involved in the project.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Aviation plays a vital economic and social role in Kiribati's development. There are two international airports: Bonriki on South Tarawa (TRW) and
                              Cassidy on Kiritimati Island (CXI) that serve as the main links to the Gilbert and Line Island groups, respectively. The project's investments will
                              take place on or adjacent to the existing airport lands. The project will also resurface the road from Cassidy airport to London on Kiritimati.

                                 within the existing property boundaries of, or on land directly adjacent to, the airports. In summary, the main potential environmental impacts
                                 and
                                 concerns identified include: (i) construction-related nuisances such as noise, dust from construction and exhaust emissions from machines; (ii)
                                 disturbance to local traffic; (iii) construction workers' and community safety; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous materials such as
                                 used fuel and lubricants; (v) land clearance around the boundary of the airport; (vi) solid waste and wastewater management during
                                 construction and operation.

                                 Following the safeguards approach laid out by the ESMF, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared to address the afore-
                                 mentioned environmental impacts and concerns. The EMP will form part of the contract and hence the contractor will be legally bound to
                                 comply with the EMP. The EMP comprises four main components, namely, mitigation plans, monitoring plans, institutional arrangements, and a
                                 field supervision checklist. It covers the design, construction and operational phases of the project, and summarizes the budget, reporting
                                 arrangements, timing and the responsibility for its implementation and supervision. The mitigation measures are built on relevant national laws
                                 and regulations, EHS Guidelines
                                                                                                                                                                       Page 2 of 4
                           for Occupational Health and Safety, and OP4.01. The field supervision checklist will be used by the supervising engineers. The signed
                           checklists will be provided to the Head of Civil Aviation Department (CAD), who will be responsible for the compliance reporting to the Bank on
                           regular basis.

                           The land located in Bonriki airport in Kiribati, is either government owned or government leased. Land leasing is a common occurrence in
                           Kiribati, given the lack of land available in the country. Land leases are paid annually, and are updated every three years. People in Kiribati are
                           generally well informed about the land lease process, including grievance mechanisms in place. This was confirmed by the World Bank-
Public Disclosure Copy




                           commissioned social due diligence report. However, there is currently a dispute regarding the land where the terminal is located, and whether
                           this is privately or government owned land. For this reason OP4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement was triggered. A decision by the Magistrates
                           Court will be needed before any
                           project works commence in this area. Depending upon the outcome of the Magistrate's Court decision, the Resettlement Policy Framework
                           (RPF) prepared for the project and disclosed July 11, 2011 at Infoshop and July 25, 2011 in-country will provide the basis for any land
                           acquisition and preparation of Resettlement Plans (RP) if needed. While land in Kiritimati is government-owned and the road being resurfaced
                           is on the existing right-of-way, there is the potential that small assets owned by households, such as trees, may need to be acquired for the
                           project. If this is the case, the RPF that is in place will provide guidance to address these issues. However any unforeseen impacts that are not
                           part of the project plans (such as trees being damaged by a construction truck) will be covered by the EMP.

                           Given that the provision of a security fence at Bonriki Airport is not fully a resettlement/land acquisition issue but is still a project impact, its
                           mitigation measures will be covered as part of the EMP. Mitigation measures will include the provision of access gates so that people can cross
                           the airport and access lands/places that are located on the other side of airport grounds. The area is also important as it is used as a
                           recreational ground given the lack of space in the Bonriki area. The EMP will ensure ongoing consultations with communities to address these
                           issues and ensure access to the airport grounds is provided.

                           OP 4.10 Indigenous People is not triggered because people in the project area in Kiribati are not considered indigenous as per the World
                           Bank's Indigenous People's Policy (OP 4.10). The people of Kiribati are mainly a homogenous group of people from the Gilbert group. They
                           have a common language, traditions and do not consider themselves indigenous or separate to others in Kiribati.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                           The improved airport safety and facilities as the result of the project may increase the frequency of flights, and traffic of vehicles and people in
                           the surrounding area. The flight frequency, although expected to grow, will still be low. Therefore the increase in long-term impacts is expected
                           to be marginal
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           There are no project alternatives as the investments are being made at the existing airports and relocation of the airports is not feasible
                           because of the cost and limited availability of suitable land in Tarawa. Aggregates for the civil works will largely be sourced from local private
                           suppliers, and in some instances may need to be imported from overseas if no appropriate local supplies are available. Construction trucks will
                           be required to respect load limits set by the governments to reduce potential damage to roads from heavily loaded trucks. Finer aggregates and
                           sand will be transported to the construction site during off peak traffic hours, in covered transport vehicles, with water sprayed to minimize dust
                           generation.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                           An EMP was prepared and disclosed on July 11, 2011 at the InfoShop and on July 25, 2011 in-country. The EMP covers the entire project, with

                           separate sections for each individual airport. It will also apply to the investments financed by the NZAP and Taiwan, China governments as
                           these are considered linked projects. The implementation of the EMP shall be monitored by the Design and Supervision Consultant on behalf of
                           MCTDD. MELAD shall oversee environmental compliance. With the combination of the supervision consultant and MELAD there is sufficient
                           capacity to address safeguard issues. Potential risks in implementing the EMP due to local client capacity will be mitigated by having the
                           project's Design and Supervision Consultant monitor and report on safeguard compliance as part of their project supervision activities. The
                           Bank and the Design and Supervision Consultants will also provide training to the Airport operational staff and the environmental staff in Tuvalu.

                           The RPF was prepared and disclosed on July 11, 2011 at the InfoShop and July 25, 2011 in-country. The RPF implementation will be
                           independently monitored by an NGO Consultations were undertaken by the Borrower and the feedback will be used during project design.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                           The key stakeholders of the project are the people who live or work in buildings close to the airport or to the London-Cassidy road.
                           Consultations have been held to inform stakeholders of the proposed project, the potential impacts, and proposed measures and arrangements
                           to address the impacts. Consultations were also held with regard to the road resurfacing. Other stakeholders include airport passengers, aircraft
                           operators and airport service providers
