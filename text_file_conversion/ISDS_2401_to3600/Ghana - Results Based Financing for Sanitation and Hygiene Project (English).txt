2. Project Objectives
The Grant development objective is to improve the sanitation and hygiene practices of an
estimated 112,500 poor and vulnerable persons in four districts of northern Ghana.

3. Project Description
The proposed project will have four components as follows: (i) Stimulating demand for
sanitation and hygiene services through behavioral change communication (BCC), (ii)
Stimulating willingness of communities to take lead in investing in household latrines
and provision of waste collection bins and matching community contributions with
project funds to provide more improved latrine at a lower cost to households, (iii) direct
investment from project funds into school sanitation and hygiene facilities in 16 schools,
(iv) monitoring and evaluation, knowledge dissemination and project management and
administration. The project adopts the Results based financing approach, stimulates
bottom-up approach implementation and strengthens local private sector participation.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Project will be located in four districts of northern Ghana.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no long term impacts anticipated. The environmental and social impacts are
expected to be minimal, site-specific and manageable to an accepted level, this project is
thus designated as a Category B project. Potential environmental impacts have been
identified with regards to investments in sanitation facilities such as household latrines
and institutional latrines. These include on a minor scale, air and dust emissions, noise
and vibration, open pits/trenches, disposal of construction waste and public safety/health
concerns and other, more moderate impacts including improper waste water disposal
(boreholes) and sludge/fecal matter disposal (latrines). The project will require pieces of
land for the construction of the boreholes and sanitation facilities for both households and
institutions. This may temporarily affect some people. For this reason the borrower has
prepared a resettlement policy framework (RPF) that will serve as the guide to address
any possible involuntary resettlement issues related to the project. It is however expected
that there will be no major issues and possible cases would be easily addressed since land
required for household sanitation will likely be within those households and for schools
on school compounds.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There will not be any major or indirect long term impacts. From the social perspective,
the RPF will be the reference point to address any land related cases which are expected
to be nil or very negligible. On the other hand, the project is likely to lead to behavioral
changes and improve the sanitation situation in the beneficiary communities.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
In order to mitigate these potential environmental impacts of the Results-Based Financing
for Sustainable Sanitation and Hygiene, the project has prepared an environmental and
social management framework (ESMF) which identified the potential impacts and
mitigation measures. The ESMF considers institutional arrangements required to
implement the environmental actions, capacity building requirements as well as a
presentation of some monitoring indicators. The ESMF also provides basis for subproject
approval requirements and a management plan. The sub-projects will subsequently, go
through environmental clearance either by the District Assemblies (DAs) or the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All subprojects will have to meet
environmental standards as described in the Project Operation Manual (POM), ESMF and
RPF.

 The RPF sets the framework for addressing any potential involuntary resettlement
regarding land acquisition, livelihoods impact, and restriction of access and what type of
compensation or support a particular type of impact can receive. The RPF assesses the
existing legal and administrative framework, clarifies the principles underlying the policy
OP 4.12 and possible ways of avoiding negative impacts. It also considers eligibility
criteria and the principles for voluntary land donations. The RPF further identifies the
different types of possible impacts and their corresponding mitigation measures,
consultation processes and an outline for a resettlement action plan should that become
necessary during project implementation and monitoring indicators. One important aspect
of the addendum RPF is a mechanism for grievance resolution.

 Mitigation measures will be enforced through contractor performance monitoring and
evaluation as well as the overall implementation of the ESMF with participatory
supervision from the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA),
SNV(Netherlands Development Organization) and in collaboration with the EPA.
Environmental Health Officers will help to ensure that proper clearances and approvals
are obtained for sanitation sub-projects. The project uses behavior change communication
(BCC) which is highly engaging and will be used to sensitize communities on the
environmental aspects of their subprojects, and train them in the sustainable use and
application of sanitation and hygiene facilities and practices for behavioral changes.

 Safeguards will be monitored and reported on as part of the projects periodic reporting,
using monitoring indicators developed as part of the addendum RPF. This will help
identify any resettlement issues upfront and take the necessary mitigation measures.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
In the course of the preparation of the Proposal for the results-based project, there was
considerable consultation with district assemblies, communities, the EPA and other
stakeholders. Similarly, the preparation of the RPF and the ESMF consulted a number of
stakeholders including District Assembly members, officials of EPA, community
members, Community Water and Sanitation Agency officers in the regions and the
Regional coordinating Council staff. The RPF and ESMF details out the level of
consultations and issues raised during these consultation processes with a broad spectrum
of stakeholders including community leaders and institutional representatives. Some of
the concerns raised have been incorporated into the final RPF which include issues on
land acquisition, community sensitization and engagement with potential project affected
people and property owners close to project activity areas
