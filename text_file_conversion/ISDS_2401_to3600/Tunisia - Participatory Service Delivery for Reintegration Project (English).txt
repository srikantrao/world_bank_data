B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
The project development objective of the Tunisia Participatory Service Delivery for
Reintegration (PSD) Project is to pilot participatory approaches to employment generation
through a cash-for-service program for vulnerable Tunisian households. The program
encompasses the financing of subprojects focusing on meeting social needs by improving service
delivery at the local level. The project contributes to (i) fostering social cohesion and
stabilization among disadvantaged populations following the January 2011 revolution, and (ii)
mitigating the socioeconomic risks faced by Tunisians returnees fleeing Libyan civil strife and
by Tunisian communities near the border with Libya affected by depressed cross-border trade
and commerce.

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The following components are proposed:

 A. Pilot Local Service Delivery Sub-Projects (US$4.3M):
 This component finances wages and consultant services under sub-projects that create job
opportunities in basic social service delivery, managed by the Implementing Agency (IA), the
Union Tunisienne de la Solidarite Sociale (UTSS).
  B. Local Service Delivery Sub-Project Training (US$0.43M):
  This component supports Component 1 and would finance consultant services and goods for
training and skills development for workers and technical assistance to sub-project teams and
local government.

 C. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.27M):
 This component would finance consultant services, goods and office equipment and supplies
for the PIU of the UTSS for day to day management and monitoring of the project. It would
support evaluating the performance of sub-projects, including periodic interim and final
evaluations. The PIU would be staffed by UTSS staff as well as consultants hired through the
proposed project for additional support.

D. Project location (if known)
This project will target the regions bordering Libya of Tataouine and Medenine.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
No social or environmental safeguards will be triggered. Nonetheless, criteria will be described
in the OM and applied during implementation by means of a screening process to ensure that
sub-projects financed by the grant will not trigger World Bank environmental or social
safeguards.
