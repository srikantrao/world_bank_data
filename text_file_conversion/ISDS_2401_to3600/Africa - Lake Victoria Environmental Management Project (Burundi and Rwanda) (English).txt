2. Project Objectives
This second phase of the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMPII
Phase 2) shares the same project development objectives (PDO) as Phase 1, which are to:
(i) improve the collaborative management of the transboundary natural resources of the
Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) for the shared benefits of the Partner States of the East
African Community (EAC); and (ii) reduce environmental stress in targeted pollution
hotspots and selected degraded sub-catchments to improve the livelihoods of
communities, who depend on the natural resources of LVB.

3. Project Description
LVEMP II Phase 2 (FY12-FY17) is estimated to cost US$30 million, i.e., US$15 million
per country. Burundi and Rwanda are also beneficiaries of the GEF grant of US$7
million and Sida grant of about US$10 million equivalent provided under Phase 1 to
finance regional activities coordinated by the Lake Victoria Basin Commission.
Consistent with the Phase 1 of the LVEMP II, the project has four main components: (i)
Strengthening institutional capacity for managing shared fisheries and water resources;
(ii) Point source pollution control and prevention; (iii) Watershed management; and (iv)
Project coordination and management.

 Project components

 The project will focus on 4 provinces in Burundi, and 12 Districts in Rwanda, all of
which are located within the LVB.

  Component 1: Strengthening institutional capacity for managing shared water and
fisheries resources (US$3.50 million)

  This component will focus on building the capacity and increasing the effectiveness of
the existing national institutions to improve the cooperative management of shared
transboundary natural resources of the LVB, and hence contribute to the achievement of
the first PDO . Its objectives are to contribute to the development of: improved
effectiveness of key regional and national institutions through harmonization of national
policies, legislation, and standards; sustainable financing options for natural resources
management interventions; and regional frameworks for the management of key
transboundary natural resources # water and fisheries. In addition, the component will
also finance equipment and technical assistance to improve water quality monitoring in
Rwanda and Burundi, and hydromet station equipment and technical assistance in
Burundi to improve the capacity for weather and water balance forecasting, including
collection and analysis of data and dissemination of information to potential users.

 Component 2: Point source pollution control and prevention (a total of US$7.51 million)

 The main objective of this component is to reduce environmental stresses, from point
source pollution, on the rivers, wetlands, and lakes in the LVB portion of Rwanda and
Burundi, and thus contribute to the achievement of the second PDO. It will finance
feasibility studies and designs aimed at future reduction of municipal and industrial point
sources of pollution in still to be identified priority hotspots in urban areas, and also
support investments in sanitation in public facilities and capacity building for sanitation
solutions in private dwellings. These investments will complement activities supported
by other water and sanitation projects and initiatives, both forthcoming and under
implementation, in the two countries. There will be two sub-components: (i) Planning
for sewerage systems and wastewater treatment facilities; and (ii) Promotion of cleaner
production technologies.

 Component 3: Watershed management (US$13.41 million)

 This component seeks to reduce environmental stresses in the Lake Victoria Basin
through integrated watershed management, including the rehabilitation of degraded
wetlands and river banks, and the adoption of on-farm soil and water conservation
programs on the hillsides. This will result in a reduction of non-point sources of pollution
(sediment loads, nutrients, and agro-chemicals) in the LVB, thus contributing directly to
the achievement of the second PDO. In addition, in countries where agriculture
contributes a high percentage of GDP and employs most of the active population # which
is the case for Rwanda and Burundi, the rehabilitation and conservation of stable and
healthy agricultural ecosystems will help reduce stresses caused by present climate
variability, and will provide greater resilience against potential future climate change
impacts.

 Component 4: Project coordination and management (a total of US$5.59 million)

  The objective of this component is to provide complementary resources necessary for
the effective coordination and communication, and monitoring and evaluation of the
project activities. At the national level, these will be the responsibility of the National
Project Coordination Teams (NPCTs). This component will have two sub-components:
(i) Project coordination and communication; and (ii) Monitoring and evaluation.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will be implemented initially in 4 provinces in Burundi, namely Mwaro,
Gitega, Karuzi, and Kirundo; and in 12 Districts in Rwanda, namely Kicukiro, Gasabo,
Rwamagana, Huye, Muhanga, Kamonyi, Karongi, Nyamagabe, Gakenke, Rulindo,
Ngoma, and Bugesera in the LVB. Not all project activities will take place in all of the
locations above. To avoid the duplication of efforts, the project will build upon and
complement land and water management projects under implementation by other Bank-
funded projects, such as the Agricultural Rehabilitation and Sustainable Land
Management Project (PRASAB) and Agro-pastoral Productivity and Markets
Development Project (PRODEMA) in Burundi, and the Land Husbandry, Water
Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project (LWH) in Rwanda.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
While the Project is aimed and designed to have significant positive environmental and
social impacts, some of the subprojects may pose localized, and mostly temporary,
negative impacts. Therefore key potential safeguards issues raised by the Project include:
water, soil and air pollution; loss of vegetation; potential for small amounts of land
acquisition, adverse effects on livelihoods and/or restrictions on access to natural
resources in and around protected areas; and degradation of natural habitats and protected
areas such as wetlands. None of the potential impacts are expected to be significant
and/or irreversible as the investments will not be on a large scale, and measures for
effective environmental and social management will be taken under the Project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
This Project is not expected to generate any indirect and/or long term significant negative
impacts due to future activities. The project will finance the preparation of feasibility
studies and engineering designs for future implementation of wastewater treatment
schemes in medium-sized urban areas, but all studies and designs will take into account
the requirements of Bank safeguard policies in the respective TORs, studies, and designs.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Because the project is the second phase in the LVEMP II program, it shares the same
objectives and components of Phase 1. Nevertheless, taking into consideration the
relatively weaker capacity for environmental management at the local level in Burundi
and Rwanda, Component 3 under Phase 2 has adopted a strategy where larger
subprojects, especially those involving rehabilitation or construction of small
infrastructure, will be implemented by the project and not through CDD subproject
approach. In addition, the project ESMFs include screening tools to identify any potential
Category A subproject, which are not eligible for financing under Phase 2. This approach
will not have a negative impact on overall project objectives since many of such potential
infrastructure subprojects are already being implemented in the two countries through
other existing projects.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The measures taken by borrowers to address safeguard issues include having had the
relevant safeguards documents in place, prior to the appraisal mission. Since the exact
locations and types of investments, especially those to be selected and implemented by
communities, will not be known prior to Project appraisal, the following safeguard
documents have prepared: (i) Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF); (ii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF); (iii) Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) Plans; and (iv) Strategy for Participation of Vulnerable Groups (this document
responds to the requirements of OP 4.10). Burundi adopted the IPM Plan being
implemented by PRODEMA for ensuring the harmonized approach to pest management
in the agricultural sector in the country.

 The screening tools and guidelines on Natural Habitats (OP4.04), Forests (OP4.36),
Physical Cultural Resources (OP4.11), and Safety of Dams (OP4.37) are covered under
each respective ESMF. The ESMFs include screening tools and guidelines for the CDD-
type investments to address the requirements of this policy. The project will not finance
sub-projects that degrade natural habitats or forests. Instead, it will support those which
reverse degraded natural habitats, such as overexploited wetlands. CDD-type investments
may involve construction of water canals, weirs, and rainwater storage structures, none of
which would be classified as large dams. The ESMFs provide screening guidelines for
small dam investments if proposed.

  In accordance with the requirements of Projects on international Waterways (OP7.50),
the Bank notified the Nile Basin countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Sudan), on behalf of Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda, on December 27, 2007, prior to the appraisal mission of Phase 1. Only Egypt
responded on February 12, 2008, stating that it has no comments on the notification
letter. The 60-day notification period elapsed on February 26, 2008. Since the Project will
have no adverse effects, there are no additional steps needed to be taken by the EAC and
the Borrowers.

 Adhering to the recommendations of the ESMFs, the Project will support activities
designed to enhance both countries# environmental and social management capacity. The
Project will build upon experiences and capacities in the client countries obtained from
implementing other CDD activities. In addition, capacity building, training, and technical
assistance will be part of the environment and social management process of the Project.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders in Burundi and Rwanda include Government both at national and
local levels, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Community-Based
Organizations (CBOs) active in the LVB, target communities, the private sector, and
development partners. These stakeholder groups were consulted during preparations of
the relevant safeguards policies documents, and additional consultations with the
potentially affected people will be carried out during the environmental and social
screening and implementation process as outlined in the ESMF. Further, the Nile Basin
countries were notified of the proposed Project in December 2007.
