                              services. During the project preparation period the cost may be revised based on the potential review and changes to the design and models.

                              The project will consist of the following 3 components:

                           To support the operation of the project a project implementation unit (PIU) will be established to help execute the proposed project and ensure its
                           smooth implementation. This component will fund consultants, studies, technical design and the overall administration of the project

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           Project implementation involves construction of new and rehabilitation/reconstruction of existing kindergartens in Yakutsk ( 10 kindergartens)
                           and rural areas (26 kindergartens). Project sites in Yakutsk are located within city boundaries on municipal land. All sites have necessary
                           infrastructure (water supply and sanitation, heat and electricity supply) and good level accessibility. Impact of connection to engineering networks
                           will be minimal. Sites in rural areas are not part of (or located nearby) nature protected areas, hence OP Natural Habitats is not triggered.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The counterpart for the project will be the Ministry of Education of Yakutia. The Ministry has not implemented World Bank financed projects in the
                           past. Due attention is required to ensure that the World Bank procurement and safeguard procedures are complied with, especially concerning the
                           construction of kindergartens which may trigger resettlement and other safeguard policies. These operational risks will, however, be minimized by
                           the Ministry's engagement of a PIU (as required by Russian legislation) which has experience with implementation of World Bank projects. The
                           World Bank project team will also provide ongoing guidance on the Bank safeguards policies to the PIU. The Ministry will prepare Resettlement
                           Policy Framework (RPF), and ensure that adequate resources and staff are allocated to implement and monitor social mitigation and consultation
                           plans
                           An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been prepared in order to minimize potential negative environmental impacts associated
                           with project implementation. In addition, the Borrower will carry out a Social Assessment to evaluate project’s potential affect on the IPs and will
                           work closely with (a) Department of the Indigenous Small-Numbered Peoples of Russian North, which has substantial experience of implementing
                           government outreach programs, providing grants and subsidies and sponsoring cultural events for the indigenous peoples; (b) NGOs representing
                           Indigenous Peoples of Sakha Yakutia (the first initial consultation was carried out with 10 organizations representing Evenks, Evens and Yukaghir
                           groups).
