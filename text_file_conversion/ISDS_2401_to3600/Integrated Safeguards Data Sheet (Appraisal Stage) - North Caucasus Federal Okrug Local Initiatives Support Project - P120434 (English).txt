                              The project development objective would be achieved through (1) Technical Assistance and Capacity Building for developing and establishing
                              mechanisms to promote citizen and community participation and social accountability in the processes that guide the delivery of social and
                              communal services; and (2) Financial resources for community micro-projects in three participating regions of the North Caucasus Federal Okrug
                              (NCFO), transferred from the federal budget to the participating regions on co-financing basis. These resources would be granted by the regional
                              authorities to the eligible settlements to finance small scale (up to 100,000 USD) demand driven micro-projects. Funds would be awarded for the
                              micro-projects according the procedures and criteria adopted in each of the three participating regions.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The proposed Project would finance technical assistance and small-scale infrastructure rehabilitation/improvements. Micro-projects will be
                                 aimed at developing local social, communal and economic infrastructure (local roads and bridges, power networks, water supply, gas
                                 distribution networks etc.); improving access to and quality of the social services available (renovation or construction of community centers,
                                 local cultural and sports facilities, etc.); restoration and/or development of natural resources, environmental protection (rehabilitation of sewage
                                 and waste-water treatment facilities, rehabilitation of disturbed/eroded soil, waste management for communities etc.). The project would not
Public Disclosure Copy




                                 finance any large civil works, construction, land acquisition or any related activities. Therefore the project financed by the IBRD loan is not
                                 expected to have any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The proposed environmental safeguard Category is B.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  No indirect or long-term impacts expected.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  Micro-projects would finance small civil works associated mainly with rehabilitation/rehabilitation of local communal infrastructure, roads other
                                 socially important facilities. Expected environmental impacts will be small scale and site-specific.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   Ministry of Regional Development will hire a PIU to implement the project. The PIU will be responsible for safeguards compliance.The PIU
                                 will have a designated environmental safeguards specialist (either a PIU staff or external consultant) who will supervise compliance with
                                  safeguards, including preparation of EMP Checklists (for rehabilitation/reconstruction micro-projects), preparation of EMPs (for micro-projects
                                 involving new construction), and overall monitoring and supervision of implementation of micro-projects from environmental and social
                                 safeguards perspective. In case micro-projects involve new construction, an environmental assessment (EA/OVOS) will be undertaken by the
                                 borrower. The EA/OVOS will be reviewed and cleared by environmental authorities. Based on the EA/OVOS, the EMP will be drafted and all
                                 necessary approvals from local environmental and health authorities obtained in accordance with requirements of legislation prior to
                                 construction start.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                  Stakeholders would be federal, regional and local authorities and beneficiaries.

                                 Primary and direct beneficiaries would include the population of the participating NCFO regions of Stavropol Krai, Karachay-Cherkessia and
                                 North Ossetia-Alania rural and urban communities who participate in setting local priorities and would see improvements in services over time
                                 in the form of new, enhanced or rehabilitated social infrastructure.

                                 Project stakeholders would also be the settlement administrations, whose ability to work on the promotion of community participation in
                                 decision-making and oversight of service delivery would be strengthened. District (rayon) and Regional administrations as well as Federal
                                 government would establish Community Driven Development (CDD) approaches/mechanisms for regional funding of local social services,

                                                                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 3
                              delivery and social infrastructure and ultimately would make decentralization reforms effective.

                              The Federal government is a main counterpart in project design and is consulted on a regular basis. Regional and local government structures
                              are consulted as part of project preparation, and some have also participated in piloting the LISP approach (Stavropol). Local population (direct
                              beneficiaries) are consulted as part of project selection and preparation, as community participation is a major part of the project approach.

                              Prior to Appraisal the general EMP Checklists (in Russian) were posted on a LISP website and were available in hard copy at public places (e.

                              and invite any comments. After that in December 2011 public consultation meetings were organized in each region with appropriate stakeholder
                              representatives invited.

                              In order to ensure that views and concerns of project stakeholders are heard and addressed, site-specific EMP Checklists (for rehabilitation/
                              reconstruction micro-projects) and EMPs (for micro-projects involving new construction) will be disclosed and consultations with local residents
                              organize? prior to construction.
