II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project is classified as Environmental Category B as the potential environmental and
social impacts will not be adverse; as they are likely to be small-scale, site-specific and
thus easily manageable. Since no new policies are triggered in this additional financing,
the same environmental safeguards instrument of the parent project still applies. The
general environmental management clauses for civil works will be inserted into the
bidding documents and contracts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There are no potential indirect and or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Not applicable

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Additional Financing, like the original project, is classified as B indicating that
environmental and social impacts will not be adverse; as they are likely to be small-scale,
site-specific and thus manageable at an acceptable level. The Environmental Assessment
policy (OP/BP 4.01) was triggered for the original project and accordingly an appropriate
environmental safeguards instrument: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
(ESIA) was prepared and updated for the Additional Financing. With this Additional
Financing, no new safeguards policies are triggered, as the civil works proposed are
similar and in most cases extension of activities of the original project. The types of
investments (construction of classrooms, dormitories, research offices, conference halls
etc) included in the project are covered by the Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA) of the original project prepared, reviewed, approved and disclosed in-
country and at the Infoshop respectively in February 2008 and updated and re-disclosed
in August 2012 in-country and at the Infoshop. The ESIA had a well detailed and costed
Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) that is being implemented under
the original project. The Involuntary Resettlement policy (OP/BP 4.12) was not triggered
in the original project as there was no land taking, or restriction of access to assets or
sources of livelihood. This fact was confirmed by a participative social analysis carried
out during the identification stage of the original project.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
As recommended by the social analysis carried out in the preparation of the original
project, a permanent consultation group between 2iE, local administrative authorities, and
village traditional authorities was set up and has been developing and implementing joint
projects benefiting the local community.
