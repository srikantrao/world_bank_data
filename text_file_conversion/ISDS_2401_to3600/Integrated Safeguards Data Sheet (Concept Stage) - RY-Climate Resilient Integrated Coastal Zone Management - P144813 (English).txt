                           B. Project Objectives
                           12. The project objective is to improve the capacity of targeted coastal communities to plan for and
                           respond to the potential impact of climate change and variability.

                         2.       COMPONENT ONE
                         Linking ICZM/building resilience to the Government’s development planning and developing early
                         warning capacity. This component will invest in the following areas:

                         •        Develop human and institutional capacity with technical and equipment support (equipment,
                         communication, inter-ministerial cooperation, national linkages) to strengthen water resources
                         management (as the main driver of the need to adapt to climate change), land capability mapping and
                         spatial planning;
                         •        Prepare spatial plans in three project pilot areas to identify climate resilient livelihood
                         opportunities. Spatial plans will also identify priority infrastructure under threat from climate change
                         in each pilot area so that the project can and prepare feasibility studies for upgrading those most “at-
                         risk?;
                         •        Better prepare coastal inhabitants to deal with more frequent and powerful climate related
                         storm events both through development of early warning systems and training to support local
                         emergency response and response planning; and
                         •        Establish co-management of natural resources (particularly fisheries) with local stakeholders,
                         including policy/legal framework for its existence and operation.

                         3.       COMPONENT TWO
                         Support of climate resilient livelihoods. This component will use technical assistance and
                         investments to support alternative livelihoods. Related activities will also be tailored to facilitate the
                         participation of women and youth where applicable.
                         •        Develop capacity amongst local stakeholders to prepare submissions to the Project for
                         “Climate Resilient Livelihood Matching Grants? (CRLMG), and provide training for financial
                         management, procurement and implementation supervision for those individuals/groups whose
                         proposals are chosen for a CRLMG; and implementation of selected CRLMG to test climate resilient
                         coastal livelihoods which may include fisheries, aquaculture, using renewable energies . This will
                         include a public-private partnership grant facility that leverages linkages between private sector
                         investors and self-help groups that are piloting livelihood changes;

                         •        Support livelihood activities that do not require conversion of land use including, apiculture,
                         mangrove conservation, handicrafts, zero grazing livestock, etc; and
                         •        Climate resilient infrastructures and utilization of renewable energies.

                         4.       COMPONENT THREE
                         Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation System that is to use the existing PPCR
                         Program Management Framework while adding needed specific expertise and service. It will be cost
                         efficient and that coordinate activities undertaken by various ministries participating in the PPCR.
                         Within the PPCR, the PMU should serve as a guide for more permanent inter-ministerial
                         coordination to address climate resilient coastal zone management. This component will support:
                         •        Coordination of project activities, disbursement of funds, collection of performance data,
                         with local implementation teams established at each project pilot area;
                         •        Knowledge generation and lessons learning and coordination with the overall PPCR program
                         in Yemen;
                         •        Responsible for environmental and social safeguards;
                         •        Monitoring and Evaluation system with both PPCR and GEF indicators; and
                         •        Promote Transparency through providing required reports, and timely information
                         dissemination to minimize the risk that project funds, particularly the CRLMG’s, will be misspent or
                         inefficiently utilized.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           5.       The project will focus on three project sites covering four coastal governorates: Hadramaut,
Public Disclosure Copy




                           Shabwa, Hodeidah and Aden, namely: Bir Ali-Burum (Hadramaut and Shabwa governorates),
                           Kamaran-Luhaiyah (Hodeidah governorate) and the coast of Aden (Aden governorate).These
                           governorates and sites were purposely selected based on consultation with the client for the following
                           reasons:
                           i)       Both Hodeidah and Aden governorates are used as case studies for coastal zone
                           management, long-term climate risks and adaptation in the coastal zone sector in Yemen’s Initial and
                           Second (currently in draft form) National Communication to the UNFCCC Convention;
                           ii)      The potential high impact of climate change on the three sites; for example, Aden has been
                           cited as one of top 20 cities in the world vulnerable to sea level rise; Hadramaut has shown
                           vulnerability to flooding;
                           iii)     The sites have different attributes in terms of natural resource assets, development status and
                           land uses, allowing the demonstration of different adaptation measures;
                           iv)      The Bir Ali-Burum site can be used to demonstrate cross-governorate boundaries ICZM as it
                           spans across 2 governorates --Shabwa and Hadramout;
                           v)       The availability of localized coastal conservation and development management schemes for
                           the three sites as a result of previous projects. A map of project intervention areas is attached in
                           Annex III.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           6.       The borrower’s institutional capacity for Bank safeguards policies is fair and needs to be
                           strengthened. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has qualified staff who are experienced
                           in reviewing environmental assessment reports and applying national environmental legislation.
                           Thus, the EPA team should be able to adjust and successfully apply all relevant safeguard policies
                           when they receive the necessary capacity support from the Bank team. During preparation and
                           implementation, the Government team will also receive guidance from the Bank’s environmental and
