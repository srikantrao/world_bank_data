                              2.           Progress towards the PDO will be monitored using the following three core indicators:
                              •            Direct project beneficiaries, of which female (percentage)
                              •            Roads in good and fair condition as a share of total classified roads (percentage)
                              •            Share of rural population with access to an all-season road (proportion)

                              3. Project Description

                              3.           As envisaged, the proposed project would include the following three components:

                              4.          Project Preparation Facility Advance (Total Cost: US$3.0 million; IDA: US$3.0 million): This component includes all PPA-financed
                              activities, including the preparation of the design and safeguards studies for the initial 800 km of prioritized rural roads in the four selected states,
                              as well as some institutional strengthening activities to help set up the SPIUs and some other preparation studies (e.g. prioritization studies in
                              Enugu and Osun).

                              5.          Component 1 – Upgrading and Rehabilitation of Rural Transport Infrastructure (Total Cost: US$237.8 million; IDA: US$132.0 million;
                              AFD: US$105.8 million): This component will finance the upgrading and/or rehabilitation of an estimated 2,000 km of rural roads (or state roads on
                              a case by case basis with connectivity purposes) in tier-one states (i.e. Adamawa, Enugu, Osun and Niger States, as of today). An approximate
                              800 km of rural roads (200 km/state) have been pre-identified as part of project preparation. The remaining 1,200 km (300 km/state) will be
                              identified during implementation after an updating of the prioritization studies prepared in each state, with a view to promote the best possible
                              alignment with the state’s own rural development strategies and the Agricultural Transformation Agenda under preparation at the federal level . In
                              addition, about 200 river-crossings (i.e. about 50 per each tier-one state) will be financed under this component in order to ensure minimal access
                              at locations selected for their importance for agricultural productivity or to give access to social services. River crossings include causeways, fords,
                              box culverts as well as small bridges. This component will also finance road designs and construction supervision, social and environmental
                              studies as well as any activities related to ensuring the quality of the proposed works (e.g. technical and/or fiduciary audits). Design studies and
                              supervision activities will be outsourced to private consulting firms. Road standards will be determined by these design studies, based on the levels
                              of traffic measured and their projections (generally less than 50 vehicles per day) and economic justification. It is expected that most if not all of the
                              roads to be intervened under this component will remain earth roads. Civil works will be contracted out to private construction firms through
                              competitive bidding, following Bank procurement procedures. Works could be retroactively eligible as early as October 1, 2011, subject to
                              compliance with the project’s objectives and with the World Bank and the AFD’s operational policies. While this is not expected to be the main
                              mechanism to secure the maintenance of the RAMP-2 roads, this component will leave open the possibility of financing OPRC contracts, if a
                              scaling up is considered appropriate based on the Kaduna experience.

                              6.           Sub-component 1.1 (Total Cost: US$211.6 million; IDA: US$105.8 million; AFD: US$105.8 million) will finance design studies,
                                                                                                                                                                             Page 1 of 6
                         rehabilitation costs and related supervision activities for 2,000 km of rural roads in tier-one states.

                         7.        Sub-component 1.2 (Total Cost: US$26.2 million; IDA: US$26.2 million) will finance design studies, rehabilitation costs and related
                         supervision activities for 200 river crossings in tier-one states as well as other rural transport investments (e.g. OPRC contracts), in tier-one states.

                         8.         Component 2 – Community-based road maintenance and annual mechanized maintenance (Total Cost: US$48.2 million: IDA: US$33.8
                         million; sub-national counterpart funds: US$14.4 million): This component will finance the maintenance of the roads rehabilitated under component
Public Disclosure Copy




                         1, as well as a few other pilot roads to build up the maintenance system while the roads are being rehabilitated. Pilot programs will be initiated in
                         each one of the tier-one states for up to 50 km of rural roads rehabilitated through other means. Permanent routine maintenance would be
                         performed by communities leaving aside from the rehabilitated roads, organized in “maintenance gangs?. Annual mechanized maintenance – to be
                         performed at the end of the rainy season, would be performed either through global maintenance contracts contracted out to the private sector or
                         through force account. Force account would not be eligible for IDA financing. Maintenance contracts would be co-financed by IDA and with State
                         or Local Government Authority (LGA) counterpart funds (in case of LGA funds, State Authorities would have to guarantee the availability of such
                         funds), following a decreasing formula for IDA funding, in order to build up sustainability. This formula is: 100 percent IDA for years one and two,
                         50 percent for years three and four, and zero percent for year five and after). This component will also finance all related activities, such as:
                         technical assistance for the conformation of the community-based organization, external supervision, monitoring of activities and road condition,
                         and technical audits. Special attention will be granted to the gender dimension, since routine maintenance contracts could offer employment
                         opportunities to poor women living in the communities beside the roads. Routine maintenance is generally highly labor-intensive (about one full-
                         time, permanent equivalent worker per km of road) and it does not require a skilled labor force. SPIUs will be encouraged to build up a strategic
                         partnership with an existing community development program (such as the Nigeria Irrigation Project (FADAMA)) in order to help develop the
                         entrepreneurial capacity of community-based maintenance gangs.

                         9.         Component 3 – State and Federal Institutional strengthening, program’s scaling up and promotion of rural transport policies (Total Cost
                         US$12.0 million; IDA US$12.0 million): This component aims at helping addressing institutional capacity gaps at the sub-national level with regard
                         to rural road assets’ management, as well as at developing and implementing sound rural transport policies. This component will provide a
                         comprehensive institutional development package at the state and federal levels to: (i) support an effective implementation of the project; (ii)
                         design and implement sound rural transport policies; (iii) improve the planning and execution of public expenditures in rural transport; and (iv)
                         promote the dissemination of best practices, as well as to prepare a possible scaling up of the project in tier one and tier two states. Since many
                         institutional issues at the state level are not specific to rural transport (including governance, accountability and public expenditure management),
                         the proposed project will closely coordinate with other Bank-supported initiatives and projects, including the Economic Reform and Governance
                         Project (P088150). The component is split in two sub-components.

                         10.        Sub-component 3.1 (Total Cost US$8.0 million; IDA US$8.0 million) will finance activities in tier-one states, including: (a) preparation or
                         updating of prioritization studies and GIS-based road inventories; (b) operational costs, training, safeguards and fiduciary support; (c) road asset
                         management, including road condition monitoring and support to road planning and maintenance policies; (d) transport regulation including heavy
                         vehicles’ weight control, road ownership, establishment of sustainable data management systems and preparation of Intermediary Means of
                         Transport (IMT) strategies ; (e) state institutions’ reform, including institutionalization of the SPIU within states’ organizational chart for rural roads’
                         management and coordination with eventual state road maintenance agencies; (f) institutional support and training to local governments (eg.
                         safeguards enforcement, fiduciary management, governance and accountability, infrastructure planning); and (g) stakeholders and civil society
                         participation, transparency and social inclusion. This sub-component will be financed exclusively from IDA funds. Some operational costs (e.g.
                         wages of civil servants or top up allowances) and safeguards compensations will be financed by state counterpart funds.

                         11.        Sub-component 3.2 (Total Cost US$4.0 million; IDA US$4.0 million) will finance activities at the federal level, including: (i) eligible
                         operational costs, training and fiduciary support, including project audits; (ii) monitoring of non-participating states and preparatory activities for
                         program’s scaling up; (iii) dissemination of lessons learnt and best practices; (iv) baseline and impact evaluation surveys; and (v) development of
                         federal policies for the improvement of rural transport and its articulation within federal transport policies. This sub-component will be financed
                         exclusively from IDA funds. Additional activities may be financed by federal counterpart funds. Parallel financing with other donors (e.g. DfID) will
                         be further explored.

                         12.        Unallocated funds (Total Cost US$28.4 million; IDA US$14.2 million; AFD US$14.2 million): Unallocated funds represent about 9 percent
                         of the project’s total funds. They will be used to finance contingencies (financial and physical).

                         4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         The Program will focus on rural roads in Nigeria. The Program will be focusing on four states: Adamawa, Enugu, Osun and Niger. Within these
                         initial pilot states, intervention areas are selected based on the outcome of prioritization studies. These studies focus on state and rural roads that
                         serve a critical function in linking agricultural production areas to markets.

                         14.       The field visits performed during project preparation confirmed that there are likely to be no major significant negative impacts during
                         project implementation, especially as the project will rehabilitate existing roads – generally within the existing right of way, and not build new ones.
                         Minor social or environmental impacts may arise during the rehabilitation and maintenance activities, as a result of the following activities:
                         •         Storage or parking of heavy road rehabilitation equipments
                         •         Transport of equipment, gasoline and lubricants
                         •         Management of lubricants and gasoline in the areas of intervention
                         •         Construction activities which can generate dangerous traffic conditions by interfering with the regular flow of vehicles
                         •         Construction of borrow pits and disposal areas
                         •         Transport of materials until final storage
                         •         Sold waste elimination in construction areas and work places
                         •         Ground excavation in zones with archeological potential
                         •         Minor realignment of some road sections which may require some land acquisition

                         15.        Overall, the project is expected to generate positive net social benefits through enhanced access for the rural populations, as well as
                         increased agricultural productivity. On the environmental side, improved road asset management will reduce the need for frequent road
                         reconstruction. In states where soil erosion is a problem (eg. Enugu), the project will also enhance the sustainability of critical transport
                         infrastructure.
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 6

                               16.        The Program will be implemented by participating State Governments, and coordinated by the Federal Government. At the Federal level,
                               the Federal PMU in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development will be responsible for coordinating the Program. It will screen new
                               participating states, provide technical backstopping during preparation and implementation, and consolidated project monitoring reports to submit
                               to the Bank. The Federal PMU will also be responsible for providing targeted technical assistance to the states.

                               17.       The Federal PMU is currently responsible for coordination the First RAMP, and manages the PPA resources. As such, it is familiar with
                               Bank’s safeguard requirements and it should play a key role in providing oversight and coordinating support to state governments.

                               18.        The State PIUs will implement their respective components. They will be responsible for the procurement and management of all
                               contracts assigned to them, including all civil works components and consultancy services. The State PIUs will be new to Bank safeguard policies.
                               As such, there will be a need to properly assess their capacity and ensure they have the required staffing before the starting of the proposed road
                               works. Each State PIUs will be staffed with one qualified safeguards specialist who will be in charge of monitoring the implementation of the
                               project’s safeguards instruments. During project preparation, road engineers from the FPMU and SPIUs have received a specific training in both
                               environmental and social safeguards. At the federal level, two senior consultants (one social and one environmental) have been hired to train
                               project staffs at the federal and state levels in implementing the project’s safeguards instruments. During implementation, this safeguards capacity
                               will be sustained and reinforced at the federal level through either the hiring of senior consultants or of regular FMA&RD staff who will be trained in
                               Bank safeguards.

                               19.          Prior to appraisal, the following safeguards instruments have been finalized and disclosed: (i) Environmental and Social Management
                               Framework (ESMF); (ii) Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF); (iii) at least one acceptable Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
                               for initial batch of road rehabilitation works to be performed in participating states, together with the associated Environmental and Social
                               Management Plans (ESMPs); and (iv) at least one acceptable Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) or Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAP)
                               for initial batch of road rehabilitation works.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant
                                  and/or irreversible impacts:

                                  The field visits during project preparation revealed that there are likely to be no major significant negative impacts during the project
                                  implementation; especially as the project does not contemplate building new roads and will essentially remain within the existing right-of-way. It
                                  is expected that the rehabilitation of the roads would result in positive net environmental and social impacts.

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 3 of 6
                           Although no major resettlement and land acquisition is expected, the temporary establishment of borrow pit, material and equipment storage
                           facilities and waste and material disposal sites may require the rental or acquisition of land plots and possible cause the temporary loss of
                           livelihood or economic assets (eg. agriculture land). Other land acquisition or involuntary resettlement may also be needed in case of physical
                           encroachments in the existing right-of-way or if some minor realignment or road widening are needed in order to improve the geometric
                           characteristics of the rural roads and/or to improve road safety conditions. In such case, OP4.12 would be triggered and a Resettlement Action
                           Plan (RAP) or Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) would be prepared as per the procedures described in the Resettlement Policy
                           Framework (RPF).

                           The draft RPF has been received, cleared by the World Bank and disclosed, both in country and in the Bank Infoshop. Four draft ARAPs have
                           also been received for identified road works in each one of the four participating states. In addition to the RPF, one acceptable ARAP (for the
                           state of Enugu) was finalized and disclosed both in country and in the Bank Infoshop prior to appraisal.

                           The Bank’s Physical Cultural Resources policy (OP/BP 4.11) is triggered in case the proposed road works would be performed in areas of
                           cultural or archeological significance. RAMP-2 will intervene in Adamawa and Osun states which are home to Nigeria’s two UNESCO world
                           heritage sites. The project does not plan to intervene in the area of influence of these sites and no major cases have been found as part of the
                           arqueological surveys conducted to date as part of the ESIAs (apart from the possible displacement of a local shrine in Enugu state). In case
                           the policy has to be triggered, the ESMF describes how “chance find procedures? will have to be included in the ESIAs/EMPs, as well as in the
                           contractors’ contracts.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                             The field visits during project preparation indicate that there are likely to be no major significant negative impacts during project
                           implementation, especially as the project does not contemplate building new roads and since the vast majority of road works will be conducted
                           within the existing right of way. It is expected that the rehabilitation of roads would result in positive social impacts, including increased access
                           to economic opportunities; better vehicle operational conditions and better road safety. The project will also contribute to increased safety for
                           pedestrians and for inhabitants of the villages along the road. However, activities during project implementation will include civil works that
                           could expose chance finds.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            As for road investments, the operation consists mainly in a rehabilitation of existing roads so no alternative plotting is therefore conceivable.
                           However, some ad’hoc adjustments to the roads’ physical characteristics (width, alignment, presence or not of shoulders) will be considered, in
                           order to reduce the potential social impact. In particular, village crossings may require some deviations to the road standards used nationally,
                           without jeopardizing road safety conditions. Such adjustments were made for some of the identified batch of roads in Enugu state. The most
                           sustainable technical option (generally earth roads) has then been chosen with respect to the project's available resources and of economic
                           evaluation principles embedded in the HDM/RED model. The project will ensure that all mitigation measures are taken to reduce or avoid
                           environmental and socials impacts/ risks.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                             In fulfilment of the Bank’s requirements, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework
                           (RPF) have been prepared and disclosed for Enugu and Osun States in May 2008. These documents were updated to reflect the inclusion of
                           Niger and Adamawa States and have been re-disclosed before appraisal. The ESMF defines standard procedures and methods for
                           incorporating potential environmental and social impacts and their associated mitigation measures into the selection, planning and
                           implementation of all sub-projects to be carried out in the project. It also provides guidance for preparing Environmental and Social Impact

                           Assessments (ESIAs) and Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) as maybe applicable during project implementation. In cases where road
                           locations and design have been identified, and when such roads affect farms or livelihoods, abbreviated resettlement action plans (A)RAPs will
                           be prepared and disclosed. In addition, the RPF guides the preparation of (A)RAPs for roads that will be identified and selected during project
                           implementation. An environmental consultant and a social consultant have been recruited to provide technical assistance to the FPMU for the
                           update of the ESMF and RPF. These consultants will provide training to the consulting firms contracted to conduct the road design studies,
                           which include the (A)RAPs.

                           The ESMF is prepared to satisfy national and state regulatory requirements as well as the World Bank’s safeguard policies that address
                           environmental and social consequences of the project. The ESMF establishes a process of environmental and social screening which will
                           permit the institutions in charge of the implementation of the project to identify, assess and mitigate the environmental and social impacts of the
                           proposed intervention. The ESMF also determines the institutional measures to be taken during the program implementations, including those
                           relating to capacity building.

                           The RPF will contain details of the principles and objectives governing the preparation and implementation of resettlement action plans (RAPs),
                           including review, approval and disclosure of RAPs, screening for Involuntary Resettlement, establishment of baseline and socioeconomic data,
                           and the likely categories of project affected persons. Compensation arrangements for those being involuntarily resettled, including possibilities
                           for land exchange, are outlined in the RPF. In particular, the RPF also contains a mechanism for resolving disputes that may arise.

                           The ESMF and RPF will guide the preparation of Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA); resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and/
                           or other safeguard instruments that will be prepared for sub project rural roads. Some specific considerations for project implementation are as
                           follows:
                           •          Environmental and Social Management Plans: The project will consist of a set of mitigation, monitoring and institutional measures to
                           be taken during implementation and operations to eliminate adverse Environment and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable
                           levels. The ESMP should also include the actions needed to implement these measures, including the following features:
                           o          Mitigation: Based on the identified Environment and social impacts, the ESMP should describe with technical details of each
                           mitigation measure, together with designs, equipment descriptions and operating procedures as appropriate.
                           o          Monitoring: The ESMP should include monitoring objectives that specify the type of monitoring activities that will be linked to the
                           mitigation measures.
                           o          Institutional arrangements: The ESMP should provide a specific description of institutional arrangements, (i.e. who is responsible for
                           implementing the mitigation measures and carrying out the monitoring regime (for operations, supervision, enforcement, monitoring of
                           implementation, remedial action, financing, reporting, and staff training.). Additionally,
                           o          Cost estimates: The ESMP should include an estimate of the costs of the measures and activities recommended, the mitigation and
                                                                                                                                                                     Page 4 of 6
                           monitoring measures recommended and should be developed in consultation with all the affected groups to include their concerns and views in
                           the design of the sub-project.
                           •         The monitoring of resettlement plans and compensations for the populations affected by the project will be performed primarily by the
                           external consulting firms hired to supervise the execution of the proposed road works. These supervision activities will be monitored by the
                           SPIUs’ safeguards specialists. The information will then be consolidated at the federal level by the FPMU, and reviewed by the Bank’s
                           supervision missions. The associated documentation will be reviewed by Bank’s safeguards specialists during the supervision missions.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis

                            on potentially affected people.
                            As part of project preparation, a gender study and consultations with communities are being conducted to assess the challenges and
                           opportunities for the mainstreaming of gender concerns in the use of, access to and maintenance of roads. The draft report was submitted in
                           May 2012, and findings for the four states were incorporated into project design. In particular, the study provides information on:

                           -          Women’s transport needs: The study aims to assess women’s transport needs and identify ways to address such needs, including
                           during road selection.
                           -          Women’s voice in community consultation: The study aims to identify mechanisms to ensure women’s preferences are reflected in
                           community consultations, whether for consultations on social safeguards or road selection.
                           -          Women’s participation in community-based maintenance: The study aims to identify context-specific entry points and mechanisms (e.
                           g. quotas) for women’s participation in the maintenance of rehabilitated roads.
                           -          Project impact on women’s livelihoods: The study will recommend indicators or give indications on sex-disaggregation of existing

                           -          Draft project’s safeguards frameworks were presented to key federal and local stakeholders during consultation meetings held in
                           each of the participating states: Enugu (March 15, 2012), Osun (March 20, 2012), Adamawa (March 26, 2012) and Niger (March 28, 2012).
                           Participants raised issues about road safety conditions, social inclusiveness in order to avoid elite capture in selecting priority roads and the
                           need for institutional capacity strengthening. Comments were taken into consideration when finalizing the safeguards instruments.
