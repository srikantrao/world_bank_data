                           B. Project Objectives
                           16. The proposed PDO is to strengthen: (i) health financing systems in Serbia, and (ii) institutional
                           arrangements governing the Serbian health sector in order to improve the efficiency and quality of
                           the health system.
                           C. Project Description
                           This project aims to improve the capacity of key institutions and strengthen the regulatory and legal
                           frameworks that govern the Serbian health system. The project activities are centered around three
                           main components, identified as major areas of weakness in the search for greater efficiency, quality,
                           and financial sustainability. These components are as follows:

                           Component 1: Strengthen the health financing system to align provider incentives with system
                           objectives and expand the coverage of mandatory health insurance.

                           Component 2: Reform the public procurement system to increase the efficiency of procurement and
                           control healthcare expenditures.

                           Component 3: Strengthen the organizational capacity for health technology assessment and clinical
                           pathways to improve standards of quality and efficiency of care.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The location of the project is Serbia.
                           The project will not involve any civil work related activities on the facilities, except (still to be
                           determined) installation of computer hardware and related electricity works, which may be incidental
                           and specific to locations – in which case standards of good engineering practice will be applied.
                           There will be no work in protected areas, no works on or near cultural heritage sites and no works
                           outside urban areas.
