                              The program development objective for WARCIP 1-C is to contribute to increasing the geographical reach of broadband networks and reducing
                              costs of communications services in Benin.

                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1- Supporting Connectivity: The connectivity component will focus on supporting Benin to have access to Africa Coast to Europe
                              (ACE) submarine cable. Benin has a submarine landing station already – SAT-3 – but pricing and capacity limitations mean that the country needs
                              a second, higher capacity international link, to improve reliability and to service anticipated increased demand from the growing number of
                              operators in the recently liberalized market. The project will finance the cost of ACE membership fee while the Government creates a PPP
                              framework to own and manage the landing station. The government would initially pre-finance the infrastructure and the private operators would
                              pay the government back based on a payment schedule to be agreed.

                              Component 2 - Creating an enabling environment for connectivity: This component will focus on (i) the transaction design and operating model for
                              ownership and management of connectivity infrastructure using PPP frameworks, (ii) related open access principles to create an enabling
                              environment for improved connectivity and (iii) strengthening of policymaking and regulatory functions in Benin

                              (i)        Transactional design: The focus will be on designing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to own and operate the submarine cable landing
                              station (and access to cable capacity), discussion of transfer of CMA signatory rights and obligation from Benin Telecom to the new SPV and
                              support related to develop all legal and contractual instruments for the SPV. Under this activity, support will be provided to facilitate negotiations
                              with operators in landlocked countries and development of IRU agreements or any other legal documents to secure access to capacity by
                              neighboring countries.

                              (i)          Addressing policy, market and regulatory bottlenecks to maximize the benefits of the proposed connectivity agenda. Specifically this
                              activity will provide support to the regulatory authority to develop regulatory instruments for open access including support for licensing the new
                              SPV, wholesale regime for capacity and other instruments related to capacity pricing to ensure open and non discriminatory access to ACE
                              capacity. The project will also provide technical and regulatory support to ensure redundancy between ACE and SAT-3. The project will also
                              provide support to the Government to reposition Benin Telecom in the market.

                              (ii)         Institutional strengthening: Institutional strengthening support will be offered to (i) Benin Telecom SA as the company is going through
                              initial restructuring process to convert to a carrier carrier, (ii) Regulatory Authority to strengthen its capacity in regulating the sector, (iii) Ministry to
                              support policy making function and (iv) initial support to the SPV in the first formative months.

                               E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                               Benin Environmental Protection Agency has ample knowledge of Bank safeguards policies and has worked with many Bank projects in this
                               regards. The institutional responsibilities for preparing the various safeguards instruments would lie with the Ministry of communications and
                               Information Technologies, implementing agency for the project with support from the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) currently implementing e-
                               Benin Project. Earlier ICT project implemented by the PIU was a category C project. Capacity of client to implement a category B project is limited,
                               but will be reinforced by the recruitment of an environmental and social consultant. The PIU has already attended a training on safeguards
