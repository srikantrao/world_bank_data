                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed project aims to strengthen transparency and governance in the CSO sector and,
                           enhance CSO capacity to support social accountability and development.
                           C. Project Description
                           The rationale of the proposed project is to address the challenges faced by CSOs in Yemen, as
                           identified by the FY13 CSO Mapping and Capacity Assessment (P143633), and to complement the
                           ongoing FY13-14 Government-CSO Partnership Project (P144665), while at the same time
                         encouraging CSOs to respond to the broader political transition taking place in the country by
                         meeting their obligations of inculcating civic values in society and promoting social accountability.
                         The proposed approach will be a precursor to the planned local government and service delivery

                         program (FY15). It will prepare the ground for a greater role for CSOs in improving participation,
                         voice and accountability at the local level. It will also help establish institutionalized approaches to
                         grievance redress mechanisms and improve last mile service delivery modalities.

                         Development partners and Governments recognized that in order to maximize client impact and
                         results on the ground, citizen engagement has to be integrated into development operations, results
                         frameworks and monitoring tools to build an impact-focused client engagement model. This project
                         aims to strengthen citizen engagement by supporting greater transparency and channels for more
                         effective citizen voice and participation in preparation, implementation and monitoring of policies,
                         programs and projects. It will directly support CSOs in increasing their knowledge about social
                         accountability and applying it in practice, thus improving accountability of governments and service
                         providers. Moreover, programmatic consultations will be integrated throughout project design and
                         implementation to (i) validate project design aspects, (ii) build ownership of the proposed program
                         amongst multiple stakeholders, and (iii) strengthen MoSAL’s capacity to consult with CSOs. During
                         project preparation, the project team will explore different options to solicit and incorporate citizen
                         feedback including through ICT-based mechanisms to support enhancements in the E-registration
                         and monitor the preparation and implementation of the Law of association reform.

                         The CSO Mapping and Capacity Assessment results suggest that local CSOs show various areas of
                         strength but also suffer from a number of capacity constraints. The CSO community is strong in its
                         geographic diversity and the multiple-sector approach and enjoys a relatively good reputation in
                         regard to their field presence. They, therefore, have a high potential for channeling the voices of
                         citizens to government and vice versa for more inclusion and participation. CSOs also have young
                         and energetic leadership intent on improving the effectiveness of their organizations. On the other
                         hand, mistrust between groups as an outgrowth of geographic isolation, over scarce donor funds,
                         tribal/religious affiliation, and diverse capacity weaknesses inhibits knowledge sharing and

                         coordination efforts in the CSO community. Poor internal governance and a lack of transparency and
                         consistency in administrative and financial processes are also among the most difficult challenges
                         CSOs face. A strong dependence on donor funding also impacts CSO’s work with many CSO’s
                         frequently adjusting their portfolios to donor agenda rather than to their constituencies' needs and
                         priorities.

                         The proposed CSO Support Project would seek a dual programmatic approach to supporting the
                         developmental role of CSOs by: (a) improving the legal and institutional environment for effective
                         CSO participation in development and (b) building CSO capacity as viable development partners
                         with strengthened internal governance. The Yemeni ANSA-Arab World network will be an
                         important stakeholder throughout this sequenced process, supporting the integration of social
                         accountability approaches and CSOs efforts towards the establishment of a CSO self-regulated entity.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed project falls under World Bank category C classification as none of the Bank's ten
                         safeguards policies are triggered, and the proposed project activities are likely to have minimal or no
                         adverse environmental and social impacts. The proposed projectwill help with enhancing the
                         institutional capacity of CSOs in Yemen. Specific criteria detailing how CSOs will be selected to
                         attend the training and certification program will be integrated into the design. A Small Grants for
                           Action Learning managed by the Universities of Sana'a and Aden is the only sub-component that
                           entails any potential safeguards risk. The main objective of the small grants is to incentivize the
                           CSOs to apply their learning in an action-oriented way. A positive list of eligible small grant

                           proposals will reflect that project will not support any activity that involves involuntary resettlement
                           impacts or has any adverse impacts on people’s livelihood, which includes any small-scale
                           construction works. A safeguards screening checklist will be included in the operational manual to
                           ensure that funded sub-projects are within the scope of technical assistance, institutional
                           development, and training. If the possibility of funding small-scale construction works arises as the
                           project develops, the team will assess the need to modify the project category and develop sub-
                           project mitigation measures.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           MoSAL and the Universities of Sana’a and Aden are project counterparts and responsible for
                           compliance with Safeguard Policies with support from Labor Intensive Public Works (PWP) Project
                           Implementation Unit (PIU) which is the project implementation agency in charge of all financial and
                           procurement arrangements. MoSAL has no experience in safeguards implementation from previous
                           and ongoing Bank-supported operations. The Bank’s safeguards team members will assess the
                           capacity of MoSAL and provide assistance in capacity building during project preparation and
                           implementation, as and when necessary. The PWP PIU, which will support MoSAL in the project
                           management, has demonstrated its ability to screen and monitor small sub-projects with respect to
                           social and environmental safeguards.
