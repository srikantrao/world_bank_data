                           The second phase project development objective is to strengthen the capacity of CONACYT and
                           state level STI institutions to formulate innovation policies and to improve the effectiveness of the
                           Borrower's Innovation System.
                           This will be achieved by:

                         3. Project Description
                         The proposed program is divided into four components that will address some of the main issues
                         affecting the innovation system in Mexico. These are: the institutional capacity at the state level to
                         design an innovation strategy and initiatives that are tailored to local needs and context and that have
                         a large degree of buy-in from key local stakeholders; the supply of highly skilled human capital in
                         areas of science and engineering, and the improvement of quality standards of national graduate
                         programs; the linkages between universities and research centers and the private sector to facilitate
                         and promote the flow of ideas into applications with social and economic impact; and lastly the
                         systematic planning of monitoring and evaluation activities with the goal of improving effectiveness,
                         targeting and transparency of innovation policies. The choice of components responds to
                         CONACYT’s desire to continue its collaboration with the Bank to deepen some efforts and to
                         accompany them on new initiatives. It is also a pragmatic choice based on the client’s scope of
                         policy action.

                         Component 1: Strengthening sub-national Innovation Systems (US$ 35 million)

                         This component will support sub-national innovation systems by strengthening states’ capacities
                         throughout Mexico to formulate, implement and evaluate policies and programs to foster innovation.
                         Activity 1.1: Strengthening states’ capacities to design, implement and evaluate policies and
                         programs to foster innovation. This activity consists of implementing a series of training courses in
                         key issues related to innovation policy relevant to the Mexican context. These courses will be
                         implemented throughout the life of the project. The first and introductory course could serve as an
                         introduction for local government officials, policy makers, representatives from the private sector,
                         researchers and other interested stakeholders on key issues related to innovation and innovation

                         policy. Subsequent courses will cover more specific topics according to needs identified by
                         CONACYT, but potential topics include: technology parks as innovation policy, technology transfer
                         offices, entrepreneurship, incubators, technology extension services, and monitoring and evaluation
                         systems for innovation policy, among others. It is expected that the project will organize on average
                         2 courses per year throughout the life of the project. By generating these regular interactions
                         between key stakeholders, the project will strengthen the social capital and connections among actors
                         which are key to developing trust relationships that underlie successful private-public initiatives in
                         innovation efforts.
                         Activity 1.2: Support to select states to strengthen subnational innovation strategies and action plans.
                         While Activity 1.1 seeks to generate basic knowledge on innovation policy issues and to begin to
                         create interactions among stakeholders, this second activity takes the next step in that it brings the
                         relevant actors of a state’s innovation system to drive the process of thinking about their own local
                         challenges and coming up with a shared vision and strategy for achieving results according to local
                         priorities and needs. The project will select a group of up to six states to benefit from this more
                         targeted and focused assistance. One state from each region in the country will be selected based on:

                         a.      Proposals submitted to the technical committee for evaluation. The proposals must include
                         an agreement to be entered between the local government and representative members of the private
                         sector whereby the parties express their interest in and commitment to working to support and
                         improve their state innovation system by among other things participating in the strategy design


                                                                       Page 2 of 8

                         b.      Independent assessment of stakeholders’ capacity and commitment to improving the state

                         innovation system.

                         The project will support the selected states in the discussion, definition and design of a state strategy
                         for innovation to be agreed upon by key stakeholders in the local innovation system (government,
                         private sector and academia), and in the drafting of an action plan to implement the strategy. This
                         exercise will be led by local stakeholders, with the support of hired specialized consultants to
                         facilitate, structure and inform, through technical analysis and international experiences, the dialogue
                         and discussions that will lead to the design of a strategy and action plan for each state involved in
                         this activity. It is expected that these initiatives will last from 6-18 months, depending on the level of
                         capacity and social capital available in each state.
                         Activity 1.3: Support to research, development and technology innovation projects to resolve a
                         common development challenge. While the first two activities help build the capacity so that states
                         can prioritize initiatives and interventions related to innovation, this component actually funds R&D
                         projects that seek to have real social and economic impact. The project will support FORDECYT, an
                         already established program within CONACYT that seeks to encourage collaboration among states
                         and municipalities to address common challenges that can be resolved through research and
                         development projects. This push for collaboration across states on common challenges tries to avoid
                         duplication and fragmentation of resources.
                         A technical committee will review the proposals and make decisions on projects to be supported.
                         Projects will have up to 36 months to complete implementation of their activities. The project will
                         finance up to 80 percent of the total cost of the project, with the other 20 percent of funds being
                         provided by the counterparts. Eligible expenditures include: hiring of specialized services, supplies,
                         tests, software, training, purchase of specialized equipment, and small and specialized infrastructure,
                         such as laboratories, among others. The call for proposals (Convocatorias) and the agreements
                         between FORDECyT and the beneficiaries will include the procurement threshold and the obligation
                         for the beneficiaries to follow Bank procurement Guidelines and procedures. These agreements will

                         also include fraud and corruption clauses
                         The program will conduct a screening of the projects for potential environmental impact. Projects
                         deemed to have potential environmental impact will need to provide evidence throughout its
                         implementation of compliance with all necessary environmental permits and certifications to comply
                         with safeguard 4.01. These environmental requirements will be identified during the initial screening
                         process. The program will also provide support to improve the quality of projects at-entry, by
                         facilitating consulting services to help potential beneficiaries improve drafting of the project
                         proposal.

                         Component 2: Formation of Advanced Human Capital (US$ 35 million)

                         The component will build on the first phase of the APL and will continue to support the formation of
                         advanced human capital through its funding of overseas scholarships for graduate studies (Masters
                         and PhD levels) in priority areas established in the PECiTI. Moreover, the component will also help
                         improve the quality of domestic graduate programs. Activities planned under Component 4 will also
                         support efforts to consolidate mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the scholarships program’s
                         performance.
                         Activity 2.1 Support overseas scholarships in graduate science and technology programs. The
                         program will support continued efforts by CONACYT to increase the supply of graduates in priority
                         areas of science and technology identified in the PECiTI (or an equivalent plan to be drafted for the

                                                                       Page 3 of 8
                         next 5 years). The program will specifically support one cohort of PhD students and at least two
                         cohorts of Masters students seeking degrees in centers of excellence overseas.
                         Activity 2.2: Evaluation of the certification process of national graduate programs. The program will

                         support the improvement of the certification process of graduate programs (the PNPC, in its Spanish
                         acronym) in Mexico. CONACYT will seek to have the PNPC certification process assessed by an
                         international independent panel (either as an ad-hoc panel or through a more formal structure, such as
                         the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education, ENQA). The program will
                         support this effort by hiring expert consultants to help CONACYT prepare for the assessment, and
                         working afterwards to support implementation of recommendations provided during the assessment.

                         Component 3: Accelerating Technology Transfer (US$ 17 million)

                         The proposed component will build on the first phase of the APL by scaling up initiatives to help
                         transform technological developments into viable high value products and services. More
                         specifically, the component will support the consolidation and early deal flow of Knowledge
                         Transfer Offices (OTT, in the Spanish acronym being used by CONACYT), whose primary objective
                         is to help generate a market for new technologies, to link universities and research centers to the
                         productive sector and to assist researchers/entrepreneurs to bring their technologies to a productive
                         purpose through partnerships with industry, licensing and/or establishment of a new venture. These
                         types of linkages between university and the market are notoriously weak, especially so in Mexico.
                         They require public support to overcome high transaction costs inherent in these interactions and
                         incomplete information that actors have a priori on the benefits arising from these types of
                         collaborations and to maximize spillovers effects that these activities often generate.
                         Activities supported by this Component will be funded using FOINS, a trust fund run by
                         CONACYT . OTTs to be supported by the program will be selected through a competitive process .
                         The selection criteria are being discussed by CONACYT and the Bank, and clear selection guidelines
                         will be included in the Operational Manual.
                         Activity 3.1: Capacity building and support for OTTs. The program will support training activities to
                         improve the capacity of the OTTs to fulfill their role in the commercialization of research and

                         technical assistance to support the overall implementation of the OTT initiative.
                         Training modules will be tailored to identified needs, and will likely include specific training in
                         intellectual property management, technology scoping, financing, marketing, and spin offs, among
                         others. OTTs selected into the program will benefit from this training.
                         The technical assistance will consist of support to design and implement a network of OTTs to
                         facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices among OTTs and an evaluation of the
                         initiative by independent experts, with recommendations to refine and improve the program.
                         Activity 3.2: Supporting OTTs by stimulating the demand for their services. The program will
                         support the OTTs in their first years of operation to help them consolidate expertise and build a client
                         base for their projects. This support will include: i) co-financing of the costs of implementing their
                         portfolio of commercialization subprojects, and ii) co-financing of the OTTs’ assistance to private
                         firms or other institutions (such as universities and research centers) with respect to technology
                         development and commercialization subprojects to help said firms and/or institutions. The selection
                         of these subprojects will be done through calls for proposals, which for the second type of
                         subprojects will likely include multiple calls for proposals. Similar procurement arrangements and
                         environmental impact screening to that of Activity 1.3 will apply for these subprojects.
                         The portfolio of commercialization subprojects, to be developed by each OTT on the basis of their
                         identified projects with the greatest potential of achieving successful commercialization will then be
                         presented to the program for approval. It is expected that the development of the portfolio of
                         subprojects will include activities such as prototyping, market and legal studies, and product testing.

                                                                       Page 4 of 8
                         Once approved, the portfolio of projects will be evaluated on an annual basis, based on achievement
                         of milestones established in the project implementation plan. Given the inherent uncertainty over the
                         development of these subprojects, it is expected that changes to the portfolio will occur, and the

                         evaluation of the subprojects and of the portfolio as a whole should take this into account. Overall
                         project support to OTT’s portfolio of subprojects will be partial and will decrease overtime, to
                         encourage greater sustainability.
                         The commercialization services provided by the OTT that will be co-financed by the project can
                         include: (a) contract research; (b) IP management services, including preparation of patent
                         application and commercialization of patents; (c) preparations for spin-offs. Eligible activities will
                         include prototyping, market and legal studies, and product testing. For subprojects involving private
                         sector companies, the co-financing support will be focused on proposals presented by MSMEs , and
                         will cover a part of the cost of the service to be procured the first time the company seeks support,
                         and a decreasing share for repeat support . After a few subprojects (2-3), it is expected that the
                         company will pay in full for the services needed. For public sector organizations that wish to enlist
                         the OTTs services, the co-financing will follow a similar tapering support. Clear and precise
                         guidelines and rules for the support to be provided will be included in the Operations Manual.
                         Finally, the OTTs will be monitored and evaluated on a series of specific indicators that are being
                         agreed upon between CONACYT and the Bank.

                         Component 4: Strengthening CONACYT’s Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$
                         3million)

                         This component will strengthen CONACYT’s institutional capacity to plan and implement the
                         monitoring and evaluation of its portfolio of programs and instruments. This support includes the
                         implementation of important evaluations, training and capacity building activities, and technical
                         assistance in various key issues for CONACYT, including assistance to review its planning capacity
                         and ability to build a coherent and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the
                         institution . This last technical assistance in particular will support the improvement of its planning
                         capacity, by reviewing what programs and instruments should be evaluated, when they should be
Public Disclosure Copy




                         evaluated (frequency) and how (evaluation methods to be used), taking a multi-annual approach to
                         planning. This should be the basis for the subsequent review of CONACYT’s current M&E system
                         and identification of main gaps in availability of required skills, data and infrastructure that will be
                         summarized in an action plan.
                         Moreover, the project will also monitor and evaluate interventions it is supporting through
                         components 1, 2 and 3. For the component that supports scholarships, the project will be financing a
                         broader evaluation of CONACYT’s scholarship program, including both scholarships for domestic
                         and international programs, with a focus on impact in completion rates, labor re-insertion, and
                         scientific production among others. For components 1 and 3, while activities supported do not lend
                         themselves to an experimental type impact evaluation, given their likely small number of
                         beneficiaries, non-standard, demand driven and very diverse nature of projects to be supported ,
                         nonetheless, the following assessments will be carried out:
                         -        For activity 1.2, an independent evaluation by a team of expert consultant will be made of
                         the strategies and action plans developed by states supported by the project, and this will be
                         compared to potential strategies and action plans that other states not supported by this project may
                         have developed, to gauge, at least qualitatively, the value added of project support and assistance in
                         this activity.
                         -        Similarly for activity 3.2, TTOs not supported by the project will also be monitored
                         periodically, to the extent possible, so that their performance in terms of key indicators can be
                         measured and compared to the TTOs supported by the project.

                                                                       Page 5 of 8
                           Specific methodological designs for these evaluations will be developed in collaboration with
                           CONACYT by an M&E expert to be incorporated into the project team. The goal will be to provide
                           a meaningful evaluation of the activities, taking into account the difficulties inherent in the exercise.

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential l arge scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               The subprojects are expected to fall into mostly C and some in B categories, and will be subject
                              to a screening and follow up process based on a specifically developed Environmental
                              Management Framework (EMF) which will guarantee the compliance of World Bank safeguards
                              and national legislation. No potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected.



                                                                          Page 6 of 8
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                             None expected. Due to the previous types of projects supported by CONACYT and due to the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           fact that exclusion list applies, most of the subprojects will be category C and a low percentage
                           will be category B and these will be subject to follow up by CONACYT and theWorld Bank
                           according to the application of the EMF developed for this purpose with Bank assistance. No
                           indirect or long term impacts are expected.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                             N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             Since this is a category B project, the Bank supported CONACYT in the development of an
                           Environmental Management Framework (EMF) and training key personnel in its application to
                           achieve that:
                           a)       CONACYT must screen subprojects for environmental and social risks and impacts
                           b)       CONACYT ensures that beneficiaries carry out environmental assessment for their
                           respective (sub)project
                           c)       CONACYT verifies that subproject complies with local laws and is consistent with Bank
                           Safeguards Policies
                           d)       CONACYT uses the EMF developed specifically for the project and based on PPAH
                           (now EHSGs) as a benchmark for acceptable environmental performance
                           f)       CONACYT applies an exclusion list (“negative list?) to prevent financing this type of
                           projects
                           The above translates into requiring CONACYT to have an acceptable Environmental
                           Management Systems (EMS), the extent of which is commensurate with the project risks.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure

                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             The beneficiaries of the loan will be various universities and research centers that apply for
                           CONACYT´s economic support to develop their portfolios of research and commercialization
                           projects. These institutions, at least the most relevant ones, were the key stakeholders in the
                           consultation process since they will have to be aware of the EMF application and follow up by
                           CONACYT and the World Bank. Public consultation was held in CONACYT´s premises in
                           Mexico City on August 29, 2012, with videoconferencing links to many regional offices.. The
                           final version of the EMF, incorporating comments received during the public consultation process,
                           will be disclosed at CONACYT´s web page and in the World Bank´s Infoshop before appraisal.
