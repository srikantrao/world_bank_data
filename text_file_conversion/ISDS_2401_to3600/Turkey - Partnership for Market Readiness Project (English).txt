   2. Current Project Development Objectives
   The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to assist Turkey implement and operate its greenhouse
   gas Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) regulation and system in the energy and industry
   sectors, and provide analytical information for the establishment of a carbon market in Turkey.
   3. Project Description
   Objectives and main implementation phases of the PMR:
   The Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR) is a grant-based, capacity building multi-donor trust
   fund that provides funding and technical assistance for the collective innovation and piloting of
                                           Page 1 of 7
market-based instruments for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The PMR has received donor
pledges totaling about US$115 million as of April 2013. The PMR brings together developed
countries (i.e. the Contributing Participants: Australia, Denmark, European Commission, Finland,
Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United States, and United
Kingdom) and developing countries (i.e. Implementing Country Participants: Brazil, Chile, China,
Costa Rica, Colombia, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, Peru, South Africa, Thailand,
Turkey, Ukraine and Vietnam), as well as other key experts and stakeholders. The PMR provides a
platform for technical discussions on market instruments, fostering North-South and South-South
exchange, facilitating collective innovation for pilot efforts, and harnessing financial flows for
implementation and scale up. The Partnership Assembly (PA; consisting of both the Contributing and
Implementing Participants) is the decision-making body and determines the criteria for and allocation
of funding.
The PMR is country-led. It provides systemic support to enhance countries’ technical and institutional
capacities in order to implement market-based and carbon pricing instruments, such as a domestic
emissions trading system (ETS), a scaled-up crediting mechanism or a carbon tax. As the
Implementing Country Participants are at different stages of development and preparedness for such
instruments, each approaches the design and implementation of such instruments in different ways.
Some focus on building core “readiness” components, such as new systems for MRV, data collection,
baseline setting, and establishing regulatory institutions; others are prepared to go further and pilot an
appropriate domestic or international instrument. Regardless of a country’s choice, capacity building
and piloting can have cross-cutting benefits relevant to implementing non-market-based mitigation
actions, designing low emission development strategies, and identifying areas of low cost mitigation
potential.
Implementing Country Participants follow a Preparation Phase and an Implementation Phase, for a
total period of 4-6 years depending on the circumstances of the specific country and proposed
activities. The Preparation and Implementation Phases have the following roles:
     (a)     Preparation Phase: With a benefit of a US$350,000 preparation grant, each PMR
     Implementing Country formulates a Market Readiness Proposal (MRP) for consideration and
     feedback from the PA. The Implementing Country may also use the preparation grant for
     activities that continue into and overlap with the Implementation Phase.
     (b)     Implementation Phase: The Implementing Country Participant begins the PMR
     Implementation Phase once the PA allocates implementation phase funding for the activities
     outlined in the MRP. Each Implementing Country Participant is required to present its draft
     MRP within two years after the award of the preparation grant (with a possibility of extension of
     six months in extraordinary circumstances). PMR implementation funding is allocated in grant
     sizes of US$3, 5 or 8 million. The size of the funding is determined by the PA in accordance
     with a set of criteria and the availability of funding. Implementing Country Participants are
     invited to return to the PA to ask for additional funding when they can demonstrate further need.
     With the benefit of the Implementation Grant, the Implementing Country puts in place the
     readiness components outlined in the MRP, including, where applicable, piloting the proposed
     market instrument.
Turkey’s PMR activities:
Turkey joined the PMR in April 2011, was awarded the Preparation Grant in May 2011, and is
proposing an implementation phase through the end of 2016. Turkey was awarded the preparation
grant in May 2011, and the MoEU has been designated as the implementing agency. A grant
agreement – the first one in the PMR – for the recipient executed grant was signed in December 2011
between the Bank and the Undersecretariat of Treasury of the Republic of Turkey. To prepare its
MRP, the MoEU has organized consultations with stakeholders and utilized the preparation phase
                                            Page 2 of 7
grant to prepare the MRP, organize meetings, training activities, and outreach events and to establish
effective project management capacity. Turkey submitted its final MRP and was granted
implementation funding in the amount of US$3m by the PA on May 27, 2013. The PMR
implementation phase in Turkey is expected to run through the end of 2016.
Turkey’s draft MRP includes activities necessary to implement the MRV system and those that are
aimed at informing policy decisions on the use of market-based instruments. The PMR will help
Turkey in piloting, on a voluntary basis, the use of the MRV procedures within the electricity sector,
and with other willing companies and stakeholders (accreditation bodies, verifiers, etc.), if any,
between late 2013 and early 2015. With regard to the implementation of one or more market-based
mechanisms, Turkey – like most PMR Implementing Countries – is at a “pre-decision” phase when it
comes to policy choices on the possible use of market-based mechanisms. Therefore, Turkey’s MRP
includes a series of analytical studies that are aimed at producing a policy options and
recommendations document for the consideration of policy makers.
Background information on the MRV by-law:
The Turkish MRV by-law, which is based on the MRV regulation in the EU ETS, establishes an
installation-level monitoring, reporting, and verification system covering all major sources of GHG
emissions from the energy (combustion of fuels with output of 20MW thermal or more) and industry
sectors (coke production, metals, cement, glass, ceramic products, insulations materials, paper and
pulp, chemicals over specified threshold sizes/production levels). Under the MRV legislation,
operators are required to monitor their emissions in accordance with approved monitoring plans and
submit their verified emissions reports annually. The MRV by-law does not establish any emission
limitation or reduction mandate on the operators. Each obligated operator needs to submit the
monitoring plans for its installations first to an accredited verifier for review, and then to the Ministry
by June 2014. The first reporting period is set as 1 January – 31 December 2015, and the reports for
that period must first be independently verified by one of the accredited verifiers. The verified
monitoring reports are to be sent to the Ministry in April 2016.
While there are yet no accurate estimates on how many installations will be included, the preliminary
estimates are in the range of 2,000-3,000 installations (covering some 200-250 million tons CO2e
emissions, equivalent to roughly 50 percent of Turkey’s current annual GHG emissions). The MoEU
is currently working with the industrial associations to identify the relevant installations.
Implementation of an MRV system will provide Turkey with accurate information on GHG emissions
in key sectors of the economy, as well as on the technologies, fuels, and emission factors at the
various installations. This is a solid basis for designing and implementing not only climate change
mitigation policies and measures but also other energy efficiency and environmental policies, as well
as for deploying e.g. results based finance instruments. The data obtained through MRV will also help
Turkey in its negotiations on the future international climate change regime under the UNFCCC.
4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguards Analysis
    (if known)
The project does not finance any physical activity on the ground, but rather consists solely of
technical assistance activities, such as training, background analyses and studies, computer
simulations and modeling, etc. Consultants will work mostly in Ankara, in their own offices and those
of the MoEU. Delivery of the training and capacity building activities and preparation of consultant
studies may take place in various locations in Turkey.
