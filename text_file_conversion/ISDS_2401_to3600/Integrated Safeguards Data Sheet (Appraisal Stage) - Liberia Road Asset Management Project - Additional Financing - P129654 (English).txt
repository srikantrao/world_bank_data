                              The project development objective is to reduce the transport costs along the major road corridor from Monrovia to the Guinea border and to
                              maintain the road in acceptable condition over a 10-year period.

                              3. Project Description

                              a)         Component 1 is the Design, Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Monrovia (Red Light)-Ganta-Guinea Border Road. This component is
Public Disclosure Copy




                              financing a 10-year output and performance-based road contracts (OPRC) designed in two procurement lots: (i) Lot 1 Monrovia (Red Light)-
                              Gbarnga (approximately 180 km); and (ii) Lot 2 Gbarnga - Ganta to the Guinea border (approximately 69 km). This road is a vital primary road of
                              strategic importance to the nation's reconstruction connecting four of the country's five biggest cities and providing critical cross-border connection.

                              b)          Component 2 is Consultant Services, Operating Costs, and Training. This component will finance a Firm/s who will provide the
                              consultancy services for Monitoring Supervision (MC) for the OPRCs, and it will also finance the needed technical assistance for preparatory road
                              feasibility studies for other infrastructure investments, as well as for the development of sector institutions through hiring of skilled staff and firm.
                              Further, the component will provide for staff training programs, including the operating costs.

                              The project implementation progress and the progress towards achieving project objective are in general satisfactory.

                              There are no unresolved fiduciary, environmental, social or other safeguard issues. The Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and the Health, Safety
                              and Environmental Management Plans (HSEMPs) for Lots 1 of the parent project are under preparation by the contractor and are progressing in
                              accordance with the planned implementation schedules.

                              The proposed AF will be used for:

                              Foreseen cost increase for price escalation related to Component 1 civil works: Lot 1 (Monrovia-Gbarnga) and Lot 2 (Gbarnga-Guinea Border)
                              (estimated cost US$11 million). The US$220 million bid prices for Lots 1 and 2 were estimated in May 2009. The cost of the already awarded Lot
                              1 civil works contract is US$166 million and the updated cost estimate for Lot 2 is US$65 million. The additional required amount of US$11 million
                              will be provided to cover the cost increase for foreseen price fluctuation over the contract period.

                              The scale up activities:

                              2 road segments with Monrovia city center (via Tubman Boulevard and Somalia Drive). The planned activity will involve a controlled access to 4
                              lanes road, currently operating with only 2 lanes. The implementation duration of this component has been estimated to three calendar years.

                              •          Sub-component 1.3 - Additional activity. Construction of a grade separated interchange (split levels intersection) at Elwa (estimated cost
                              US$5.0 million), facilitating the sub-component 1.2. The intersection currently in use operates at its peak levels under major stress caused by
                              heavy congestions, resulting in loss of traveling time and vehicle operating costs (VOC) and represents a major cause for traffic delays and traffic
                              incidents in the city. The planned activity will create a phased improvement of the intersection by dividing at- grade turning traffic from the through -

                               be three calendar years.

                               implementation framework will effectively provide for the country direction in the development of the sector in multimodal fashion, provide the
                               investment strategy and implementation timetables, all leading to a creation of a modern and effective transport system network, emphasizing the
                               development of public transport in major urban centers and maximizing utilization of PPP possibilities.

                               From the above, it is evident that only activities under sub components 1.2 and 1.3 may have direct social and environmental impacts. However,
                               transport planning has environmental and social implications, and the TORs for the TA in sub-component 2.4 will therefore incorporate in the
                               planning process requirements for assessment of potential impacts of different options being considered, using World Bank safeguard s policies as
                               the basis for the assessment.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The project is in the rural areas of central-north Liberia, those along the key road corridor connecting Monrovia to Ganta and Guinea border. The
                               AF activities fall within the same geographical areas of the original project.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The project consists of rehabilitation within an existing right-of-way for all but the last two km of its length, where new road will be constructed.
                                  There are no sensitive features in those two km; it is an area completely disturbed by the unplanned development that typically springs up at
                                  border crossing points in Africa. Consequently, potential adverse impacts, are confined to the corridor and its vicinity, not complex, and readily
                                  manageable through good construction practices and the environmental management plan (EMP) that was prepared for this road segment in
                                  connection with the Emergency Infrastructure Project (EIP). Relocation of market stalls and more substantial structures that have encroached
                                  on the right-of-way will be necessary along some segments of the road. Activities under subcomponent 1.3 entail construction of interchange
                                  structures at Elwa junction. But this is also within the designated ROW just as rehabilitation works under subcomponent 1.2. The activities
                                  under the two sub-components may lead to minor impacts similar to those of the original project.

                                  The EMP consultant did not observe any physical cultural resources during reconnaissance of the corridor. However, OP 4.11 Physical Cultural
                                  Resources (PCR) is triggered for the Project because there is always the possibility of an unexpected discovery of PCR during construction.
                                  The EMP makes protection of chance finds a responsibility of the Contracting Entity. The Contracting Entity will be required to present a chance
                                  finds procedure in the HSEMP.

                                  From the social safeguards perspective, the proposed project will have impacts on livelihood and may lead to relocation of small businesses
                                  along the main roads for the construction activities. These impacts are manageable as the borrower has experience in handling safeguards
                                  issues.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   Long-term beneficial impacts will include: the socioeconomic benefits of more efficient transport of goods and people along the corridor;
                                  reduced environmental degradation caused by soil erosion and sedimentation where pavement and drainage are substandard; and reduced air
                                  emissions from vehicles because higher speeds and more efficient operation will be possible. The indirect adverse impact of these
                                  improvements will be increased accident hazard because of higher vehicle speeds. It is also expected that this risk will be minimized by
                                  improved safety as the construction will take into consideration the security and safety of road users especially pedestrians.
                                                                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 4
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            Deviations from the existing alignment are likely, primarily to avoid excessive resettlement. The exact alignment will not be finalized until the
                           contractor has been engaged, since final design is part of the contractor's responsibilities. For this reason, a resettlement policy framework has
                           been prepared; resettlement action plans (RAP) will be prepared in connection with the design where impacts related to involuntary
                           resettlement are identified prior to commencement of civil works.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan

                            and implement the measures described.
                            The government prepared an Environmental Mitigation Plan for road repair and rehabilitation in May 2006, and it was disclosed initially for the
                           Emergency Infrastructure Project in August 2007. The plan received approval from Liberia EPA prior to disclosure. It was re-disclosed for the
                           Urban and Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (URIRP) in September 2008 and supplemented with an addendum in connection with
                           URIRP in 2009. The plan specifically covers the Monrovia (Red Light)-Ganta-Guinea border road corridor in which the works supported by the
                           new project will take place. It has been re-designated as the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for this project.

                           The EMP will be a part of the bidding documents in order to guide each contracting entity's activity during detailed design and implementation
                           phases, particularly in developing and implementing a Health, Safety and Environmental Management Plan (HSEMP) specifically for its
                           contracted works. The government also prepared and disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for URIRP in October 2009 that
                           covers the Red Light-Ganta-Guinea Border road corridor. As the contract arrangements require final design to be done by the contractor, full
                           Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) cannot be prepared until after effectiveness when contractors have been selected and designs have been
                           done, because deviations from the existing alignment are possible. The RPF includes the procedures for determining whether a RAP is
                           necessary and the guidelines for preparing it and it will be included in the bidding documents. No physical cultural resources were identified by
                           the EMP consultant during the survey of the corridor. However, in case any are discovered during the construction, the EMP requires the
                           contractor to put in place a chance finds procedure. This will be a part of the HSEMP.

                           The Monitoring Consultant is responsible for day-to-day monitoring of the compliance of the Contractor's works with the HSEMP and RAP and
                           for reporting same in its routine progress reports. The proposed AF will not trigger any new safeguard policies, the environmental category of
                           the project will remain as category B - Partial Assessment. The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and the Environmental Management
                           Plan (EMP) prepared for the parent project will be suitable for the AF and have been re-disclosed for the additional financing in country and in
                           the InfoShop prior to appraisal.

                           The development of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for Lot 1 has been launched by the contractor under the supervision of the consultant.
                           The RAP will be completed in two phases. The first phase RAP is focusing on areas with less complicated resettlement impacts to ensure that
                           the process takes off smoothly whilst preparing for the second phase for the RAP. The first phase draft RAP is scheduled to be submitted for
                           review by June 15, 2012 prior to clearance and in country disclosure.

                           The IIU, with the assistance of the WB, has been working to improve its safeguards capacity from various fronts: to develop needed staff skills;
                           to carry out prudent and frequent field supervision missions to assess and address issues early on, and to devise a framework to resolve
                           potential conflicts and non-compliance with agreed safeguards policies. The unit includes two full-time safeguards specialists, one of whom has
                           been actively and effectively involved with the Bank's infrastructure portfolio in Liberia for the past three years. He is thus familiar with Bank
                           safeguards policies and has himself prepared a RAP for another project and an addendum to the original Environmental Mitigation Plan. The
                           second safeguards specialist joined IIU on May 1, 2012. In addition, the Bank has undertaken safeguards workshop for consultants,
                           contractors, and project staff as part of safeguards capacity enhancement for the project as part of project activities.

                           Other Bank infrastructure projects are also supporting capacity strengthening within the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which to date
                           has included: engagement of a legal advisor to assist with development of regulations, purchase of office equipment and vehicles for EPA's
                           county offices, a validation workshop for eight environmental regulations including air quality, and four guidelines that are expected to be issued
                           in the first quarter, and procurement of consulting services to audit environmental compliance at 35 industrial facilities.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             The key stakeholders are the road users and roadside residents and businesses. The EMP and RPF were both made available for public
                           comment at IIU, and their availability was advertised in Liberian newspapers. The EMP requires the contractor to coordinate activities with local
                           land users and to coordinate traffic management with local authorities. The contractor's HSEMP will be reviewed to ensure that it provides
                           adequately for communications. The RPF specifies the requirements for participation by project-affected persons and businesses in
                           resettlement planning.

                           As part of the development of the RAPs, extensive consultations will be held with project stakeholders including PAPs. Their concerns and
                           issues raised will be factored into the final RAPs. In addition, the project grievance redress mechanism included in the RPF has been shown to
                           be effective in other projects.
