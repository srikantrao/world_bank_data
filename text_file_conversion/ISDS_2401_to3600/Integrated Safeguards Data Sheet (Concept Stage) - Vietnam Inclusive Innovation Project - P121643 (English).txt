                           B. Project Objectives
                           The Project's Development Objective (PDO) is to help strengthen Vietnam's capacity to undertake
                           inclusive innovation for improving the lives of the Bottom of Pyramid population. This will be
                           achieved by: (i) Adopting, upgrading and developing inclusive innovationtechnologies; and (ii)
                           Strengthening SMEs' technological and innovation capabilities thereby enhancing their
                           competitiveness.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will focus on developing high-performance and affordable solutions to address the needs
                         of the BoP, as well as providing support to SMEs to acquire,                                    adopt,
                         create and use technology and innovation. The project will use a pilot a
                         pproach to reduce risk, focus on achieving some early wins and scaling-up a few

                         pilot technologies, while building long-term capacity in selected institutions t
                         o carry out inclusive innovation in Vietnam. The project will support tools to e
                         ncourage and incentivize collaboration between stakeholders, especially, among t
                         he business and research and universities sectors. In order to expedite the deve
                         lopment of high-performance and cost effective solutions, collaboration with app
                         ropriate global R&D organizations will be supported. The project support will be targeted at priority
                         needs filling gaps only, with due consideration given to a void duplication of efforts being supported
                         under the FIRST project and/or other donor initiatives.

                         The project, estimated to cost around US$60-75 million, will consist of three components:

                         1.      Developing Inclusive Innovation Technologies
                         2.      Upgrading Enterprise Technological Capabilities
                         3.      Knowledge Transfer and Capacity Building

                         Component I: Developing Inclusive Innovation Technologies

                          Under, this component, the project will support the development of inclusive innovation
                         technologies that will help address the problems of the BoP society. Whi le developing actual
                         solutions, project will also provide ancillary benefit in t he strengthening of the overall institutional
                         capacities (see Component III) of the participating institutions. Initiatives to support could include:
                         (i) develo ping technological solutions to address National Development Challenges (NDCs); and
                         (ii) acquiring, adopting, upgrading and creating inclusive innovation techno logies.


                          (i)      Developing Technological Solutions to address National Development Challenges. Under
Public Disclosure Copy




                         this initiative, the project will support solutions for two priority Na
                         tional Development Challenges that are important to address the problems of the
                         BoP.

                          (ii)    Developing, Adopting and Upgrading Inclusive Innovation Technologies. Under this
                         program, the project will provide funds to RDTIs, enterprises and grassroo                 ts
                         innovators to bring forward existing research and/or prototype technologies f         or
                         development of (pilot) products up to the level ready for commercialization. This program would
                         focus on upgrading available research/ technologies (both nat                        ionally and
                         globally) for faster outcomes and would not include support for gree                         n field
                         research. The priority areas would be identified by Authorities in cons
                         ultation with stakeholders and international experts.

                         Component II: Upgrading Enterprise Technological Capabilities

                          This component would provide support to the small and medium enterprises to upgrade their
                         technological capabilities in order to improve competitiveness and pro                 ductivity. This
                         will include support for: (i) the acquisition, adoption and use of technologies and innovation
                         available domestically as well as globally; (ii)                    commercialization and sustainable
                         production of inclusive innovation technologie                       s including spin offs and start-ups;
                         and (iii) scaling-up of a few inclusive tec                     hnology enterprises. The project will
                         focus support on certain key SME sectors w           ith significant untapped potential for
                         improvement. Depending upon the particula         r activity, the project would provide matching grants

                         and/or loans.

                          The project would assist business sector to convert inclusive innovation pilot technologies (coming
                         out of initiatives under Component I) into commercially viab                le and affordable high-
                         performance products for sustainable production. In order                to ensure the pilot technologies
                         developed are acceptable to industry (i.e., co             mmercially viable), the institutions
                         (supported under Components) will be requir                ed to interact with the relevant business/
                         industry sector in the early stages of taking these products/services from the development stage to the
                         commercial sta              ge. The program would be open to all private enterprises and would
                         provide suppo              rt in a broad range of areas such as protection of intellectual property rights
                         (IPR); global best practices on development and commercialization (such as the p rovision of a
                         license, by a government, for scaling up production of a technolog                y that would expire if
                         the enterprise does not move forward with production with                 in a certain time frame).

                         Component III: Knowledge Transfer and Capacity Building

                          The project would provide funding for, inter alia, knowledge transfer, training, study tours,
                         feasibility studies, technical expertise, collaboration and twinin g arrangements with global
                         institutions, program design and execution, project m anagement, monitoring and evaluation, etc.
                         This would include provision of exper t assistance to the relevant Ministries (such as MPI) and
                         implementing agencies, technol ogy licensing, IP protection, technology extension services to
                         enterpris es, skills upgrading, etc. If needed, this could also include preparation of imp ortant
                         feasibility studies such as MSTQ infrastructure upgrading. Consideration could also be given to
                         funding inclusive innovation fellowships to graduate stud ents, awards, and research chairs (at RDTIs
                         and universities) all focusing on in clusive innovation technologies and solutions. The project support
                         would be targ eted at priority needs filling gaps only, with due consideration given to avoid

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), as representative of the Government, will have the
                         overall responsibility for project implementation and coordina                              tion
                         through the Enterprise Development Agency (EDA). The EDA will be responsib
                         le for the preparation and management of the project in close coordination with
                         FERD and other relevant MPI departments, sector ministries (e.g. MoST, MoH), and
                         specialized implementing agencies. EDA is the responsible agency for the planni
                         ng, coordination and monitoring of government support programs for the developme
                         nt of SMEs in Vietnam.

                          The project will be implemented in a decentralized manner by relevant agencies (based on the
                         contents of the programs) under the overall coordination and oversi
                         ght of MPI.
                            The safeguard capacities of EDA have not yet been evaluated but it is possible they will not be very
                           familiar with either World Bank or GoV safeguard policies.                                    As
                           determined necessary during project preparation, support will be provided und

                           er the project to ensure they have sufficient safeguards capacity. To the degree
                           that subprojects will be decentralized to other agencies, safeguard capacity (i
                           f any is needed) will liky vary substantially. In all cases however, EDA would b
                           e ultimately responsible for ipmlementation of the EMF.
