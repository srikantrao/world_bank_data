2. Project Objectives
The objective of the Project is to increase access to water supply services and to improve
the quality of water supply and wastewater services in selected urban areas in six
participating oblasts of the Borrower.

3. Project Description
The project consists of three components:

 Part A:       Rehabilitation of Water Supply and Sanitation Systems (US$53.75m)

 1.    Provision of goods, works and consultants services for rehabilitation and
construction of deep wells, pumping stations, transmission mains, distribution network,
ground and elevated reservoirs and iron removal plants, and other water supply facilities.
 2.    Provision of goods, works and consultants' services for rehabilitation and
construction of wastewater collection systems and wastewater treatment plants and other
water sanitation facilities.

 Part B:      Support to the Preparation of Investments (US$6.05m)

 Provision of works, goods and consultants' services for: (a) feasibility studies,
preliminary and detailed designs, bidding documents, assistance with bidding and
evaluation review; and (b) construction management, including supervision, monitoring
physical implementation, monitoring and evaluation.

 Part C:      Project Implementation and Management (US$0.20m)

 Strengthening the management capacity of the PCT to monitor and administer the
Project implementation, including training and financial audit.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The implementation of the project is taking place in 20 municipalities in all six oblasts
(regions) of the country: Brest, Grodno, Gomel, Minsk, Mogilev and Vitebsk. Population
of these municipalities range between 7,000 and 350,000, with seven large cities
exceeding 100,000 inhabitants. Most project works will be implemented within the
footprint of existing water supply and wastewater treatment utilities and landscapes
(mostly urban) already modified by human activity.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Impacts of the project are associated with works on rehabilitation and construction of
water supply and waste water treatment infrastructure. Most of the impacts are taking
place at existing footprint of utilities or adjacent areas (mostly urban). While land
acquisition was not anticipated under the project, the ongoing detailed engineering
designs, suggest that in the selected sites permanent or temporary acquisition of land may
be possible. This is due to the design of the alignments of pipes in densely populated
areas and the works related to rehabilitation or expansion of water supply and sewerage
facilities.
 Bank's Involuntary Resettlement policy OP/BP 4.12 was not triggered under original
project and is triggered now in this first order restructuring. Physical displacement is
currently anticipated under one subproject activity, affecting one household. RAP will be
prepared should that subproject become part of the final design. The government has
prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework and disclosed it in the local language in the
country in December 2011.

 Policy on Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.12 is as well triggered in this
restructuring with regard to a single sub-project (Mogilev). The location of prospective
works is in the area of historic and cultural significance "Troitsky Settlement".

 The OP/BP 7.50 International Waterways applies to water projects that involve "the use
or potential pollution of international waterways." The policy exempts from the
notification requirement "minor additions or alterations" to existing schemes that
"adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other riparians." This
project seeks to improve water quality, reduce wastewater flows and improve the quality
of wastewater discharges, therefore meeting the definition of the policy. The reduced
downstream flow of pollutants into both the Black and the Baltic Seas has positive
regional/global impacts. The "Exemption to the notification of riparian states" was
prepared and approved by the Bank Legal Department and ECA Region RVP on
December 5, 2007.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There are no indirect and/or long term impacts associated with this project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The contractors will be required to comply with project EMP. A Management Plan for
Physical Cultural Resources will be prepared by the client and agreed with interested
stakeholders. Continuous archeological supervision of works will be undertaken by a
group of archeologists from Mogilev State University. In case of chance finds, the items
found will be handled (described, photographed, registered and placed to local historic
museum for museufication/exhibition or storage) according to established procedures
related to management of artifacts. Upon completion of works the report on the results of
archeological supervision will be produced and provided to the Customer (Mogilev
Vodokanal) and the National Academy of Science of Belarus. The client prepared a
Resettlement Policy Framework and will prepare Resettlement Action Plans for any sub-
project, which could necessitate land acquisition.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The Ministry of Housing and Communal Services, the National Ministry of Nature
Protection, the participating municipalities, the water companies and project beneficiaries
are the key stakeholders. The consultations took place with the main stakeholders. The
project EMP was prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal. The Resettlement Policy
Framework was prepared and disclosed in local languages.
