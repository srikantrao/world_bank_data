    B. Project Objectives
    The PDO is to strengthen Infant and Young Child Feeding policies and programs in eight South Asian countries through
    improved policies and programs, increased investments, and building capacities of governments and other stakeholders.

    C. Project Description

    The prevalence of child undernutrition in South Asia is very high. The rates are much higher than those in Sub-Saharan
    Africa (46% in South Asia v/s 26% in sub-saharan Africa). India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nepal are
    among the 36 countries in the world which account for 90% of the global child malnutrition burden. With iron deficiency in
    under-fives ranging from 55% and 81% in Bhutan, India, Nepal and Bangladesh, and sub-clinical Vitamin A deficiency
    in children under six years ranging between 28% and 57%, South Asia is also home to persistently high levels of
    micronutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin A and iodine). Poverty alone cannot explain South Asia’s undernutrition story.
    Despite rising household incomes, undernutrition continues to be high, even amongst the richest quintiles (e.g. 26% of
    children in the highest wealth quintiles in India, 26% in Pakistan and 30% in Bangladesh are underweight). One of the
    explanations for this “Asian Enigma? is its association with women’s over all status, as well as their nutritional status
    throughout their lives, from childhood through adolescence and adulthood, early marriage and early and frequent
    childbirths.

    Optimal infant and young child feeding practices (IYCF) remain very critical to child care. Optimal IYCF practices,
    especially breastfeeding, play a significant role in reducing diarrhea, pneumonia and thus stunting, as well as in preventing
    child undernutrition and deaths from neonatal infections, diarrhea and pneumonia. IYCF practices in South Asia remain far
    from satisfactory, and action to strengthen policy and program support to enhance optimum IYCF practices across South
    Asian countries is both urgent and important.
    This task, to be implemented by the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) Asia, will support activities to
    enhance IYCF practices, particularly breastfeeding, in South Asia (Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal,
    Pakistan and Sri Lanka) with focused activities in four countries (Afghanistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal). The activity
    will have the following components:

    Component 1: will include 3 key activities: World Breastfeeding Conference, 2012; South Asia region IYCF workshop;
    and National workshops and advocacy meetings in four focus countries (India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan)

    Component 2: will include further continue advocacy at national/State levels with a primary focus on India and three other
    countries (Bangladesh, Nepal and Afghanistan from Phase 1. These include Media events, Capacity building, a study to
    estimate cost of scaling-up breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and a SAR workshop in 2014.

    D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)
    The project will be implemented in the South Asia region. The major of the activities will be implemented in four south
    Asian countries, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Nepal. The project focuses on policy advocacy, capacity building and
    analysis to promote breastfeeding and complementary feeding. No physical structures or facilities are planned to be
    undertaken
.
    E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
    Environment: The BPNI has not had any prior experience of working with the Bank. They are a policy, advocacy and
    training organization and their work typically does not involve undertaking activities that are likely to impact the
    environment. Given the nature of their activities and the activities proposed to be undertaken through the project, a need to
    build the capacity of the recipient is not anticipated.

    Social: The recipients work is focused on promotion, protection and support for breast feeding through strengthening
    policies and programs, including those that would provide universal maternity benefits to women especially those engaged
    in the non-formal sectors, or those without family or social support. In addition, they engage other stakeholders, such as
    civil society organizations, the media and the government in creating awareness of the need to support all women to
    breastfeed their babies and practice optimal complementary feeding of babies beyond six months of age.
