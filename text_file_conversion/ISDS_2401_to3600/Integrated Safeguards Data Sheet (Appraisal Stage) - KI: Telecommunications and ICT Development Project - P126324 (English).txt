Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed Project is a Technical Assistance program, covering a five-year program of support to the Ministry of Communications, Transport
                              and Tourism Development (MCTTD) and the Telecommunications Authority of Kiribati (TAK). The Project focuses on the enabling environment for
                              telecommunications and ICT service provision and on the institutional development of the MCTTD and TAK. Further, through support for enabling
                              infrastructure in the Outer Islands, the Project will increase the availability of telecommunications infrastructure and enable the more widespread
                              application of ICT services supporting improvements in economic and social development. Specifically, the Project will support the: (a) transfer of
                              policy-making, legal, regulatory, and technical expertise to help develop fully-functional oversight institutions for the ICT sector; (b) transition from a
                              monopolistic to a liberalized telecommunications market, including strategic options for the incumbent service provider, Telecom Services Kiribati
                              Ltd (TSKL); and (c) design and implementation of a sustainable connectivity program for the Outer Islands.

                              Proposed Project Components.

                              1.         Component 1. ICT Policy and Legal Support (MCTTD). US$ 1.2 million. The Project will provide assistance to MCTTD in the following
                              areas:
                              (a)        ICT policy review and coordination: including (i) updating sector policy in line with industry developments and Government objectives,
                              including second-generation reforms and application of ICT in other sectors, and monitoring ICT sector development; (ii) supporting the
                              preparation of legislation and regulations necessary to give effect to Government policy; and (iii) leading the Government#s work on international
                              agreements related to telecommunications; and
                              (b)        TSKL transformation: in coordination with the MFED, identifying and implementing options for restructuring TSKL which may include the
                              introduction of an equity investor or other strategic partner for TSKL; this will entail contracting a transaction/financial advisor.

                              2.         Component 2. ICT Regulatory Support US$1.2 million. This envisages a medium term program of technical assistance and capacity-
                              building (including on the job and formal training) for the TAK in the following areas:
                              (a)        New market entry: assist in the design and conduct of a selection process for new telecommunications service provider(s) that will permit
                              a second operator to offer mobile services, to be undertaken in coordination with the MCTTD;
                              (b)        General regulatory support: technical assistance and capacity-building for the TAK to regulate a competitive market with multiple
                              operators, consistent with the new legal and regulatory framework, including (but not limited to) assistance in the following areas:
                              #          issuing licenses and other authorizations, monitoring compliance and enforcing sector legislation and regulatory instruments;
                              #          establishing and regulating the technical aspects of the wholesale access regime, including the interconnection regime;
                              #          regulating competition; limiting anti-competitive behaviour;
                              #          in coordination with the MCTTD, drafting regulations, rules and other subordinate instruments as needed for the effective management
                              and implementation of ICT sector legislation, including consumer protection and consumer codes of practice;
                              #          resolving disputes between operators, and between operators and users of telecommunications services;
                              #          allocating, assigning and supervising radio spectrum, numbering, and other technical regulation matters (including development of a
                                                                                                                                                                             Page 1 of 4

                         3.         Component 3. Outer Islands Connectivity US$2.0 million. This will finance:
                         (a)        Phase 1: Technical assistance to MCTTD and TAK for: (i) development of an appropriate Outer Islands connectivity policy and strategy,
                         including technical and financial feasibility analysis, and stakeholder consultations; (ii) identification, analysis and evaluation of possible coverage
                         extension projects and possible financing/risk-sharing mechanism (such projects might include voice and/or data; broadband/backbone
                         infrastructure and/or access facilities); (iii) development of the necessary regulatory instruments, instructions and practical procedures to

                         implement the regulatory regime (including legislative and licensing obligations) in relation to Outer Islands coverage; (iv) preparation of project
                         documentation, selection process for identifying and contracting with an operator for the supply of specified services; and ongoing monitoring and
                         audit of the service being subsidised, possibly including specialised equipment and software; and (v) design and implementation of awareness-
                         raising and training programs for Outer Islands communities on the use of telecommunications and ICT services to improve livelihoods.

                         (b)        Phase 2: Outer Islands connectivity subsidy. Based on the above strategy, the Project is expected to finance a subsidy for Outer Islands
                         communications service provision, to be bid competitively, led by the private sector. The implementation of Component 3(b) will depend on the
                         extent of commercial rollout and connectivity gaps, as noted above, and the identification of Outer Islands sub-projects that require subsidization. If
                         Component 3(b) goes ahead, based on the findings of the policy/strategy developed under 3(a), then the Project will also provide the TAK with
                         implementation support. The detailed project description in Annex 2 sets out the methodology for the least cost subsidy model which has been
                         developed to assess possible subsidy scenarios regarding the costs of providing telecommunications services throughout Kiribati, including in the
                         Outer Islands.

                         4.         Component 4. Project Management US$0.6 million. This will finance the inputs needed to support the effective administration of the
                         Project. Overall Project administration will be handled by the central Fiduciary Management Unit (FMU) within the Ministry of Finance and
                         Economic Development (MFED). This Project will procure and finance the incremental services needed to handle the administrative tasks specific
                         to this operation, including:
                         (a)        Project management consultants, including: Procurement specialist, Financial Management specialist, international procurement
                         specialist and communications specialist (it is envisaged that the communications specialist will be located with the MCTTD);
                         (b)        Computer and office equipment for Project management;
                         (c)        External audit; and
                         (d)        Incremental operating costs.

                         4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         The primary location for the project is the main population centre of Tarawa. The project may include a subsidy component for outer islands
                         connectivity (component 3 (b)) to be determined in the course of project implementation based on needs assessment.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  The proposed project will have very minor, if any, impacts on the environment, land and on people. The project mainly consists of policy and
                                 regulatory support and technical assistance to the Government of Kiribati to improve the reliability and affordability of telecommunications
                                 services. However, Component 3 may involve subsidies for provision of connectivity in outer islands, which would either finance maintenance of
                                 existing networks or minimal civil works. These works are expected to be small, such as installing communication towers or satellite dishes and
                                 will require very little construction and land. Therefore the safeguard issues are considered to be small. The Government of Kiribati has
                                 prepared an Environmental Code of Practice (ECOP) and a Compensation Framework (CF) to inform the process of any construction and land
                                 acquisition that is required under Component 3 of this project. These documents provide procedures to ensure that any environment or social
                                 impacts are properly avoided or mitigated.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  Improved connectivity throughout Kiribati is expected to help Kiribati citizens to have greater access to information and provide improved
                                 communications facilities to the Outer Islands. Improved connectivity may support economic activities e.g. tourism, and improved service
                                 delivery e.g. health and education. Social benefits are expected to be positive. There are no significant long term environmental impacts
                                 related to the telecommunications infrastructure.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  Not applicable.

                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The recipient has prepared an ECOP (Environmental Code of Practice) and Compensation Framework (CF) which were disclosed in country
                                 on February 17, 2012. These documents are specific to Component 3 of this project as it is the only component potentially involving civil works.
                                 Implementation of the ECOP and the CF will be the responsibility of the service provider granted the subsidy to install the backbone/broadband
                                 infrastructure and MCTTD (working with MELAD).

                                 The Government has limited institutional capacity for implementation of World Bank environmental and social safeguards policies. The local
                                 agency in-charge of environmental matters is the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development (MELAD). They have full time
                                 staff who regulate and monitors activities with potential environmental impacts. The Government of Kiribati has passed regulations which
                                 mandate environmental assessment for projects with potential impacts on the environment.

                                 The Government also has existing institutional capacity for addressing land acquisition, particularly if done at a small scale. They are able to
                                 identify affected people and pay compensation payments, and a grievance mechanism that allows people to file complaints at courts is in place
                                 throughout the country. This is particularly the case when land acquisition is led by MELAD. However, these systems can be overburdened and
                                 slow. Meanwhile MCTTD is working on land acquisition in two World Bank projects. It is important that they get implementation support from the
                                 World Bank, as well as service providers and MELAD, as needed, to ensure any land acquisition impacts are promptly mitigated.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                  The key stakeholders of the project are TAK, TSKL, other potential service providers, and all the people of Kiribati who would benefit from
                                 improved access to telecommunication services. Given the uncertainty of Component 3 activities at this stage, consultations on the ECOP and
                                 CF have been limited to relevant government ministries, service providers and Outer Islands representatives. The ECOP and CF were
                                 disclosed in Tarawa on February 17, 2012 and are available at <www.tak.gov.ki>
                                 <www.environment.gov.ki>. Once subprojects under Component 3 are clear, further consultations directly with the affected people will be
                                 conducted. These consultations will be the responsibility of the service provider, MCTTD and TAK.
