                              IA. Proposed Development Objective
                              The original project’s development objective (PDO) is to increase the use of a defined package of health services by pregnant women and children
                              under the age of five. This proposed Second Additional Financing would change the PDO to the following: to increase the use of a defined
                              package of health services by pregnant women, children under the age of five and couples of reproductive age. As the Results Based Financing
                              (RBF) services package would be expanded to also include family planning services and services against malnutrition, at tariffs that are at

                              sufficiently high levels.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project is fully consistent with the ongoing decentralization policies and strong focus on the district level service provision. It will
                              achieve its development objectives of increasing the use of a defined free package of health services by pregnantwomen and children under-five,
                              as well as couples of reproductive age.

                              The proposed Additional Financing (AF) would go mostly towards Result-Based Financing (RBF) payments for the health sector in Burundi,
                              providing AF for Subcomponent 1A of the original project. The RBF program under the second AF would continue to emphasize the services
                              covered by the Free Health Care policy for pregnant women and under-five children, as has been done so far under the ongoing project. But the
                              scope of the RBF program would be expanded, to also emphasize other services that are particularly vital for the country’s economic development
                              – i.e. services directly addressing the problems of low contraceptive use and high malnutrition..

                              The remainder of the AF funds would provide further financing for similar activities as are already being financed under Subcomponent 1B and 2 of
                              the original project. These activities consist of verification activities for the RBF payments, as well as community-level activities to increase the
                              demand for health services (working on the demand side); various other types of capacity building and technical assistance (TA) activities; and
                              surveys and other M&E activities. Certain critical items will also be provided, namely selected nutritional products, selected basic health equipment
                              and small-scale incinerators (see below).

                              In all cases, the implementation arrangements will remain the same as those that are currently in place, for all of the above activities. The AF will
                              enable the closing date of the ongoing project to be extended further.

                              The proposed second AF will consist of:

                              •           Additional financing for Subcomponent 1A of the Original Project (US$20 million from IDA) – Transfer of Resources on Basis of RBF:
                              The proposed AF will support a package of RBF services under Subcomponent 1A of the parent project, and will be administered using the same
                              implementation, fiduciary and safeguards arrangements. The transfers will reimburse health facilities for the provision of specified services. The
                              scope of the RBF services would be expanded, as mentioned above, to also include services directly addressing low contraceptive use and high
                              malnutrition – services that are eligible under the ongoing project but have not in fact been financed except at very basic levels (see above). The
                              activities under this component will follow the implementation details specified in the national RBF Program Manual, and changes to this Manual
                              will have to be approved by the Bank.

                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 6
                               •          Health facilities will be paid a pre-agreed tariff for each of the services specified under the program, in accordance with contracts to be
                               signed by the health facilities. The tariff will reflect an estimate of the incremental recurrent cost of providing the service and other indirect costs.
                               Because health facilities in many remote and disadvantaged areas have a harder time attracting staff, these facilities will receive additional equity
                               payments. In addition, payments given to health facilities will be adjusted according to a quarterly quality score. Health facilities will have
                               substantial autonomy to spend the RBF payments but based on pre-agreed guidelines. There will be strict controls and a solid verification structure
                               for the reported levels of services and of quality (see below), to minimize the risk of falsification or errors. All of this is in line with what was agreed

                               under the original parent project and what is now happening on the ground. In addition, key managerial units that are involved in the RBF pro gram
                               will receive results-based payments, on the basis of their performance (as under the ongoing project).

                               •           Additional Financing for Subcomponent 1B and Component 2 of the Original Project (US$5 million from IDA) – Capacity Building and
                               Institutional Strengthening: Financing will also be provided for: (I) community-level activities to increase the demand for health services (working on
                               the demand side); (II) various other types of capacity building and technical assistance (TA) activities; (III) surveys and other M&E activities; (IV)
                               verification activities for the national RBF program; and (V) selected critical items, namely (a) nutritional products, especially micronutrient and
                               mineral products such as “sprinkles? (micronutrient powder sachets); (b) selected equipment to be provided to selected health facilities to address
                               critical constraints preventing them from significantly enhancing their performance under the national RBF program; and (c) small-scale
                               incinerators to be provided to hospitals to facilitate the treatment of medical waste in an efficient and cost-effective manner (see below). The
                               community-level activities will include the use of community mobilization entities (called facilitating agencies). The TA (including training) activities
                               will focus on supporting various aspects of the national RBF program and the project, including fiduciary, procurement, safeguards and M&E
                               aspects. The project financial audits will be financed under this component. The surveys to be financed will include household and health facility
                               surveys to be conducted every two years. (The community-level activities are ongoing activities under Subcomponent 1B of the original project,
                               while the other activities are ongoing under Subcomponent 2 of the original project.)

                               The verification activities will include: (i) “ex-ante? verifications – conducted by verification teams under the newly created Provincial Verification
                               and Validation Committees (PVVCs) – and validation activities on the part of the PVVCs, as well as associated activities supporting these units;
                               and (ii) third-party “ex-post? verifications conducted quarterly by an external agency, on a randomly selected sample of health facilities, and on
                               patients selected randomly from the facilities’ registers. This external agency will, among others, verify whether invoices from the facilities
                               correspond with the amounts that appear in the registers, and visit the homes of the selected patients to verify if they exist and if they received the
                               reported services.

                               This is the second proposed AF for this project. The first AF, solely from a first round of HRITF financing, provided further financing for
                               Subcomponent 1A and for the verification activities of Component 2 of the original project, without any change in the PDO or in the scope of RBF
                               services.

                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The parent Project had triggered two safeguards policies, namely OP/BP 4.01 (environmental Assessment) due essentially to the generation
                                  of biomedical waste at designated health centers, and OP/BP 4.10 (Indigenous Peoples) due to the potential impacts and span of coverage of
                                  the project which includes the poor and most vulnerable groups among whom Indigenous Peoples such as the Batwa population.
                                  Consequently, the project has been assigned the environmental and social safeguards category B.

                         o         The activities related to respectively upgrading and installation of incinerators (4+1) included in the Burundi: East Africa Public Health
                         Laboratory Networking Project (P111556) have not been implemented yet. The visits on the ground have shown that it might be more
                         appropriate to build small scale/low cost incinerators- SSLCI (of the De Montfort type) considering the inability of the hospitals to supports the
                         higher maintenance and operation costs of electrical incinerators as well as the general lack of technical capabilities to operate properly these
                         incinerators-SSLCI. Consequently it is now recommended to include in this proposed operation the construction of new incinerators SSLCI in
                         the number of 20 (4 in Bujumbura and 16 in each of the other regions of which 4 are going to be financed under the lab project ).
                         �         The project will contract one or several contractors for the construction of these 16 incinerators-SSLCI.
                         �         A specialized company will be contracted to supervise the construction of these incinerators-SSLCI and to monitor their use after 6
                         months and after 1 year.
                         o         Management of waste streams within the hospitals need to be upgraded through:
                         �         Provision of initial packages of the equipment and material for handling medical waste and for individual protection will be provided to
                         the 20 hospitals above
                         �         Training programs as described in the MWMP will be developed and implemented targeting hospital staff
                         �         Awareness campaigns will be developed as described in the MWMP will be developed and implemented targeting hospital staff as
                         well as hospital patients.

                         �         Conduct an audit of the 20 hospitals mentioned above to determine gaps and corresponding corrective measures in the MWMP
                         procedures and practice implemented in these facilities.

                         In consequence, the MWMP prepared for the parent project and for the first additional financing operation (The MWMP was revised and
                         updated in April, 2012 for the first AF), has been slightly revised to reflect current status of mitigating measures identified in the MWMP. During
                         supervision of this project proper attention will be given to the implementation of health care waste management measures prescribed in the
                         MWMP.

                         Application of the RBF approach has led to the definition of indicators measuring adherence to good environmental and waste management
                         practices. So, results-based payments to health facilities now are partly based on adherence to these practices, and this does appear to have
                         had an impact in improving these practices already, with an increased awareness and ownership on the part of health facilities regarding
                         safeguards issues, and improved practices. Under the second AF, the safeguards indicators used partly to determine the amount of results-
                         based payments have been reviewed and improved over the previous version. It is also proposed that in the next round of revision of the
                         weight of the indicators, the weight of the environmental safeguards related indicators be increased from 100 (out of a total of 1000) to 150 or
                         200 to reflect the needed emphasis on these aspects of hospitals ‘performances.

                         On the social aspects:
                         The original Public Health Sector Project triggered among others the World Bank’s Indigenous Peoples Policy OP 4.10 due to the span of
                         coverage of the project which includes poor and vulnerable groups among whom indigenous peoples such as the Batwa. During the
Public Disclosure Copy




                         preparation of the original project, an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) and a MWMP were prepared to ensure proper assessment and mitigation
                         of potential adverse environmental and social impacts. The present Additional Financing has triggered the same safeguards policies and
                         applies similar implementation methods with slight improvement in the approach. All three safeguards documents will be slightly updated to
                         capture both the good practice lessons learnt from the parent project as well the vision of this ne additional financing and ultimately disclosed in
                         country and at the Bank’s Info Shop prior to Appraisal.

                         During the implementation of the Indigenous Peoples Plan, concerted efforts were made by the Government of Burundi to implement the
                         recommendations of the plan albeit with some difficulty due primarily to the complexity of some of the issues particularly as they relate to the
                         Batwa.

                         The following have been achieved during the implementation process:
                         •           All medical facilities have integrated Batwa in both the health committees and the community health agents where they already play
                         an important role of sensitizing their peers in the importance of using health facilities;
                         •           Roughly 60% to 70% of Batwa are now using medical facilities, especially the medical package being provided by the project (giving
                         birth, pre to post natal care, Children under five care, etc.);
                         •           Most provinces are facilitating the issuance of birth and marriage certificates to Batwa families and communal authorities continue to
                         encourage a nationwide approach to such an effort;
                         •           Access to hospitals for Batwas who have been provided with a “Carte d’ Indigence? is being facilitated through the deliverance of
                         vouchers by the Ministry of Solidarity permitting hospitals and clinics to provide emergency treatment for the concerned Batwa families. The
                         “Carte d’Indigence? is delivered by the Commune and Chef de Colline for the needy families (i.e. any Burundian family recognized as not being
                         able to afford the 500 Fbu to pay for the medical insurance);
                         •           The Community and Social Development Project funded by the World Bank, provides the Batwa with housing and school registration;
                         •           The Batwa have also been sentisized to participate in the nationwide vaccination campaign, during which time Batwa representatives
                         in the health committees and the community health agents play an important role of awareness raising;
                         •           The Batwa are being integrated into the Health Committees in all Health Centers, making it possible for them to participate in the
                         sentizisation of other Batwas to be vaccinated, to use mosquito nettings and other health improving methods such as improved nutrition ;
                         •           The issue of providing the Batwa with National Identity Cards and National Insurance Policies has been initiated by the Government
                         of Burundi albeit with some difficulty. About 10-20% of the Batwa population have so far been issued with National Identity Cards and it is
                         hoped that the issuance will continue to increase.
                         •           The Use and Involvement of a nationally recognized civil society organization, namely UNIPROBA (Union pour la Promotion des
                         Batwa) as a Service Provider has been instrumental in achieving and maximizing the benefits achieved so far.

                         While great improvements have so far been made in the implementation of the Plan, there are some implementation constraints which the
                                                                                                                                                         Page 3 of 6
                           Government of Burundi is grappling with particularly in regards to the full integration of the Batwa population in the national socio economic
                           mainstream. The Government of Burundi with continued Bank assistance is committed to continue with the drive putting the Batwa on the
                           national map. Continued implementation of the recommendations of the IPP is one of several ways the Bank and Government will apply to
                           move the Batwa issue forward.

                           Two key documents were recently finalized and officially released by the Ministry of Health and Fight Against HIV/AIDS, on community health
                           activities (documents outlining an overall strategy and manual of procedures for these activities). The integration of the Batwa community was a
Public Disclosure Copy




                           key aspect of these documents.

                           During the preparatory mission of the Lab Project in February 2012, and in the July 2012 preparation mission of this additional financing, the
                           Bank and National Safeguards team visited all the sites and confirm that all 20 incinerators will be built within the hospitals’ grounds and that
                           any activities involving potentially affected people or livelihoods will not occur as the hospital premises, and more specifically the incinerators
                           areas, are fenced and guarded against street vendors and any such economic activities. These site visits therefore confirm that the World Bank
                           Policy on Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12 is not triggered by this additional activity.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            No long term impacts are anticipated due to anticipated future activities.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                             As stated earlier, the Government of Burundi has updated its existing MWMP and IPP prepared under the existing Bank-financed Health
                           Sector Development Support Project (PADSS- the parent-project) which is being implemented satisfactorily although the pace of progress
                           regarding waste management issues needs to be improved. As a result of an assessment of the situation on the ground as well as recent
                           learning of what works and what does not work in low-income settings, a decision was made to equip selected hospitals in the country with
                           small-scale low-cost incinerators. These are appropriate for low-income resource-constrained settings like Burundi since operating and
                           maintenance costs are relatively low, operation is not complicated, sustainability over the longer term is much higher, and yet these types of
                           incinerators are still very effective in these settings. Providing these incinerators at selected sites would help accelerate progress on waste
                           management (the MWMP and IPP were updated for the first AF in April, 2012 and have both now been revised and updated for this second AF
                           to account for actual difficulties on the ground and propose appropriate modifications to the original plan). The updated MWMP and IPP have
                           been disclosed both in country and through the Bank infoshop.

                           The construction of these incinerators (typically 8ftx8ft brick structures about 10 to 15ft high) will not entail any negative environmental impacts
                           in itself neither will the fencing of the area, which is only to prevent scavenging. The MWMP includes reference to state of the art construction of
                           these incinerators (following the De Montfort University design) and specifies the need to give proper attention to the fencing issue (section
                           VIII.5.1).

                           There is already a dedicated team of staff in the Ministry of Health (MoH) working on social and environmental safeguards issues for the Health
                           Sector Development Support Project. The same team will be entrusted to further implement satisfactorily the safeguards for this AF Project. As
                           already is the case, the Social & Environmental Team (SET) will be guided by and work closely with the World Bank safeguards team during
Public Disclosure Copy




                           supervision and throughout the project life cycle. Moreover, as already agreed upon during the mid-term review mission (MTR), the SET will
                           work in tandem with “Union pour la promotion des Batwa? (UNIPROBA), a well established national civil society organization specialized in
                           working with the Batwa to successfully implement the IPP, as per the terms of the new memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between
                           UNIPROBA and the PADSS. The team and UNIPROBA will further benefit from additional technical capacity building provided by the Bank
                           team through series of workshop and in-field training.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             The primary beneficiaries are medical practitioners and local communities benefiting from and using medical facilities, including the poor and
                           most vulnerable groups such as the Batwa. During preparation of the previous operation discussions were held with a number of key
                           stakeholders starting with members of the project implementation units of the other member countries and their Burundian counterparts, staff of
                           the World Bank Resident Mission responsible for the project, staff of the National Institute of Health and the staff of the University Hospital in
                           Bujumbura. These meetings provided detailed information on the project design, proposed implementation plan and the safeguards documents
                           prepared for the Burundi Health Sector Project (IPP and MWMP) and the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) of the
                           East Africa Laboratory Network Project (that includes Burundi) plus other important project related information afferent to this AF project.
                           Additional important discussions were also held at the University Hospital and INSP (Institut National de la Santé Publique) on the effective and
                           responsive planning and management of medical waste and the sustainable implementation of the existing MWMP under the ongoing Burundi
                           Health Sector Development Project and the new AF.

                           During the preparatory mission of the proposed second Additional Financing in July 2012 , renewed consultations were held on the continued
                           implementation of the IPP plan under the proposed project with the effective support from UNIPROBA (Union pour la Promotion des Batwa,
                           one of the leading national civil society organizations on the Batwa) recently procured to streamline the sustainable inclusion of BATWA.
                           Included in those consultations were, among others, several government officials, members of several Batwa communities and of UNIPROBA,
                           Batwa and other health workers, Batwa and other community health agents, and Batwas who are members of health committees, as well as
                           those working for the “facilitating agencies? hired by the original parent project. These agencies are NGOs paid by the project and those funds
                           will be replenished in the Additional Financing to allow them to continue with the task – to enhance community demand and awareness
                           regarding basic health services, and to enhance access by vulnerable groups including in particular the Batwa.

                           The key issues raised in these consultations were mainly the ones reported on in Section 1 above (where one is asked to “describe any
                           safeguards issues and impacts…?). A major reason for the positive findings reported above is clearly the impact of the activities of the
                           “facilitating agencies?, which have been working closely with health committees, community health agents, local community organizations and
                           leaders of the local “communes? to achieve their goals. As a result of the activities of these “facilitating agencies?, major progress has been
                           made on issues such as inclusion of the Batwa in health committees and among community health agents, and regarding awareness raising
                                                                                                                                                                   Page 4 of 6
                           among the Batwa about the desirability of accessing basic services (e.g. via vaccination campaigns), especially those covered by the Free
                           Health Care policy.

                           As has been clearly articulated in the original project design and successfully implemented, the proposed second Additional Financing will
                           continue to finance the activities of the “facilitating agencies?, to ensure that progress continues along these lines. The “facilitating agencies? will
                           also work with local “communes? to increase the distribution among the Batwa of National Identity Cards and “Cartes d’Indigence? in particular
                           (the “communes? are in charge of distributing these cards), and to enhance awareness among the Batwa of the need for these cards. The
Public Disclosure Copy




                           National Identity Card is needed to access the Free Health Care policy for pregnant women and under-five children, and the “Carte d’Indigence?
                           is necessary to access basic health services on the part of indigent groups other than pregnant women and under-five children. The proposed
                           second Additional Financing will also finance the use of the media (e.g. radio) to enhance awareness and demand among vulnerable groups,
                           including in particular the Batwa, regarding basic health services.

                           Field investigations comprised visits to some of the selected sites in Bujumbura, Kayanza and Muyinga in the north, and Rumonge and
                           Makamba in the south of the country during preparation of the first additional financing for the Burundi: East Africa Public Health Laboratory
                           Networking Project, and in Kayanza, Nozi, Muravya dn Gitega during the preparation mission for the second AF for the Health Sector
                           Development Support Project. Discussions were held with hospital and laboratory staff at the National Health Institute in Bujumbura, the
                           National Tuberculosis and Centre for Disease Control also in Bujumbura and all hospitals visited in the different parts of the country. The team
                           then had detailed discussions with the staff of the Burundi Health Sector Development Project, (i.e. the TTL and resident Health Specialist) and
                           Bank experts in Maputo and Washington on the safeguard documents and their revision and implementation.

                           Hence, as stated above, the update conducted in April (for the first AF) and most recently (for this second AF) of the two safeguards
                           instruments, namely the MWMP and the IPP involved complementary consultations in the form of interviews of health care practitioners to
                           review the proposed approach regarding ways to improve the management of health care waste.

                           As consultation and participation is rather an iterative process, thus there will be more consultation with contractors and implementation units at
                           subproject level, precisely during implementation of each of the sub projects.

                           Finally, under the Additional Financing, the revised safeguards instruments have been re-disclosed both in country and in the Infoshop so that
                           concerned parties can have access and monitor the action plans contained in these safeguards instruments.
