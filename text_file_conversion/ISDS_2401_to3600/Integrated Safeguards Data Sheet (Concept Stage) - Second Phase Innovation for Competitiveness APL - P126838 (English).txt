                              The Innovation for Competitiveness program, supported by an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) structured in three phases, seeks to assist the
                              Government#s efforts to improve competitiveness of the Mexican economy by enhancing its innovation system.
                              The proposed second phase of the APL will seek to reinforce key pillars of the Mexican innovation system by:

                               #           accelerating technology transfer to the productive sector;
                               #           continuing to support the formation of advanced human capital; and
                               #           strengthening research capacity through investments in research infrastructure.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed program would include the following components:

                              Component 1: Regional Innovation Systems: The component would support subnational innovation systems by strengthening the capacity of
                              subnational governments throughout Mexico to formulate, implement and evaluate policies and programs to foster innovation. This would involve
                              three types of support: (i) the implementation of core capacity building programs that will reach all states, and the development of a monitoring and
                              evaluation framework and capacity building for states to apply it; (ii) more targeted support to a smaller group of states (3-4) to strengthen their
                              subnational innovation strategies and implement new programs on the basis of the revised strategies, which will serve as a demonstration effect
                              for other states; and (iii) the implementation of programs that will bring together the capacities of several states in the resolution of a common
                              development challenge.

                              Component 2: Accelerating Technology Transfer: The component would help transform technological developments into viable high value products
                              and services. The component would support the establishment and early deal flow of Technology Transfer Offices (OTTs), whose primary
                              objective is to help generate a market for new technologies and assist researchers/entrepreneurs to bring their technologies to a productive
                              purpose through partnerships with industry, licensing and/or establishment of a new venture. More specifically, the program could support capacity
                              building activities for the OTTs, including formal training and on-the-job learning through exchanges with their international partners and other
                              institutions and potentially the program could also support stimulating the demand for OTTs services through a cost-sharing scheme to generate
                              the first demonstration effects.

                              Component 3: Formation of Advanced Human Capital: The component would build on the first phase of the APL and will continue to support the
                              formation of advanced human capital for the knowledge economy. More specifically, the component to would work to enhance the relevancy and
                              quality of domestic and foreign scholarship programs and to consolidate mechanisms to monitor and evaluate their performance. In terms of
                              relevancy, the efforts would be targeted at further strengthening linkages between scholarships programs and the priorities of the PECiTI and the
                              National Innovation Plan. In addition, the component would support strengthening of CONACYT#s certification process of graduate programs by,
                              inter alia, promoting the inclusion of international experts in the certification panels.
                           Component 4: Upgrading of Research Infrastructure: The component would support the implementation by CONACYT of its new program on large
                           research equipment and the financing of research equipment in line with identified priority needs. Institutions acquiring the equipment will be
                           responsible for their maintenance and will become #open hubs# making it accessible to other research groups. New guidelines and evaluation
                           procedures for allocating the equipment and ensuring adequate maintenance and sharing with other institutions will be put in place.

                           Component 5: Monitoring and Evaluation: support the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation efforts at CONACYT, including the activities
                           supported under Components 1-4 of this proposed operation, as well as other initiatives and programs to be defined during project preparation.

                           CONACYT complies with all national and international rules governing safeguard issues. Any specific guidelines and implementation
                           arrangements that will apply to this project will be developed during project preparation. This may include a screening process forsubprojects to be
                           supported by the project. This screening process would be developed with the Bank assistance and would provide CONACYT with the tools to
                           establish the adequate Environmental Management Framework (EMF) for each group type of subprojects. As needed, training on the use of this
                           screening tool would be provided to relevant technical and nontechnical personnel within CONACYT.
