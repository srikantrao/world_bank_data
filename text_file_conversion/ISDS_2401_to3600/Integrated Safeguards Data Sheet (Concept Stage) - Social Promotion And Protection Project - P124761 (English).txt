                              The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the capacity of the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) to achieve its mandated functions by:
                              (i)         establishing and supporting an effective national mechanism in MOSA to finance community developed and driven projects; and
                              (ii) supporting the institutionalization of the National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP).

                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed Social Promotion and Protection Project will consist of two components, with the first component focusing on Community Social
                              Development (CSD), and the second component focusing on National Poverty Targeting Program (NPTP).

                              Component I would firstly support the establishment of a National Community Social Development Mechanism in the MOSA by: (a) providing
                              support to the "Social Development Directorate" in MOSA, which would manage a transparent process of outreach, screening and prioritization,
                              financing, and monitoring and evaluation of the sub-projects, including the promotion of community participation and empowerment; (b) building
                              the capacity of MOSA staff at all levels (including the Social Development Centers) and other relevant government staff (i.e., municipalities and
                              sector ministries), and NGOs/CBOs; (c) establishing a National Social Database that will would include a social map of the country, information on
                              beneficiaries, projects, and resources and increase the MOSA's ability to coordinate CDD interventions; and (d) supporting the ongoing
                              introduction of criteria for quality assurance and accreditation for NGOs/CBOs and welfare institutions contracting with MOSA. This component
                              would, secondly, finance community-driven sub-projects which will entail the provision of grants to local communities whose projects have been
                              selected through the National CSD Mechanism. Projects eligible for financing must have the objective of either enhancing the provision of social
                              services or increasing income-generating opportunities.

                              Component II - the NPTP Phase II - will provide support to the NPTP team (Central Management Unit at the Prime Ministry and the MOSA NPTP
                              Unit) to fully develop and institutionalize the program. To this end, the project will enhance the quality of this program's implementation, including
                              further development of the NPTP business processes, such as maintenance of the database, the management information system, updating of the
                              PMT formula based on the 2011 Household Budget Survey, establishment and fine-tuning of the fraud and corruption and complaints
                              mechanisms, enhancement of connectivity of the Social Development Centers (SDCs), among others. The design and implementation of a high-
                              quality Monitoring and Evaluation system will also be supported. Moreover, training will be provided to the social workers to improve their capacity
                              to conduct home visits. The project will also support mechanisms for benefit distribution (whether they be social services as currently decided or
                              cash benefits). The project will provide support to the Inter-ministerial Committee for Social Policy (Social-IMC) and its Secretariat (located in
                              MOSA), to enhance its ability to coordinate social policies, and develop poverty reduction and social strategies. In addition, support will be
                              provided to the Central Administration of Statistics (CAS) to conduct periodic household budget surveys. Finally, to ensure that NPTP does not
                              create dependency for work-able beneficiaries, this component will pilot a case management system in one area in Lebanon, where SDC social
                              workers work directly with NPTP beneficiaries to plan their exit from the program. Such a strategy can entail linkage of NPTP beneficiaries to
                              complementary social programs, such as skills training, as well as job search assistance.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Project location is to be determined during preparation.
                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           It is unlikely that the implementing agency will have a proven track record of monitoring safeguard policies or the capacity to implement any
                           environmental management measures in general. Capacity may need to be strengthened for ensuring compliance with provisions of the ESMF;
                           such capacity strengthening measures will be financed by the project and clearly outlined in the ESAF.
