                           C. Project Description
                           The purpose of the proposed grant is to finance the costs of transitioning PASO from its current
                           operations to the new structure and operations. During appraisal of the regional program, IDA
                           confirmed that PASO is a regional organization that meets the eligibility requirements for receiving
                         Regional IDA Grant financing, and that funds could be provided directly to PASO. Grant funding in
                         the amount of US$1.15 million equivalent is being sought to finance the estimated transition costs
                         associated with human resources, institutional capacity development, and office operations costs,

                         including information and communication technologies. No physical infrastructure investments will
                         be undertaken.

                         Component A: Transitional Management and Support. Finance will be provided for: (i) a transitional
                         part-time manager to assist PASO through the restructuring; (ii) human resource costs associated
                         with implementation of the new organizational framework; (iii) costs associated with the PAIP
                         ‘Technical Fiduciary Services Unit’ (TFSU) providing support to PASO through the transition
                         period, including procurement and financial management support; (iv) costs associated with
                         dissemination and support to PASO member countries through the transition process, including
                         helping to ‘market’ new services from PASO to ensure uptake by member countries; (v) costs
                         associated with establishing and initial operations of the Board Committee (Finance and Technical
                         Committees); and, (vi) other costs as appropriate to achieve the outcome.


                         Component B: Establishment of a Pool of Regional Aviation Inspectors. The objective of this
                         component is to establish a pool of inspectors to be used by PASO to oversee aviation safety and
                         security. This will be done by: (i) establishing a comprehensive Register of Inspectors for the region
                         available for PASO-related services and their service specialties; (ii) establishing a ‘National
                         Inspectorate Program’ which would build and assess inspector capacity from member states; and,
                         (iii) providing the necessary training for inspectors to ensure that the inspectors meet the necessary
                         skill levels for providing services to PASO members.

                         Component C: Quality Assurance System for PASO. Establish and implement an appropriate formal
                         quality system for PASO, along the lines of ISO 9000, and ensure that all inspectors are fully trained
                         in the use of the system.

                         Component D: PASO Information Management System. A cloud-based system, with associated
                         back-end hardware, will be implemented in PASO to: (i) meet the ICAO requirement that states
                         capture, store and aggregate data on accidents, incidents and hazards; and, (ii) providing a document
                         management system as a central repository to all documentation required for the PASO members to
                         manage their regulations and other key files.

                         These grant activities will provide critical support to ensuring continuity over the initial four years of
                         the restructuring process.

                         Lessons Learned: The Bank’s previous experience with Regional Aviation Safety Oversight
                         Agencies (RASOAs) under the West and Central Africa Air Transport Safety and Security Project
                         will be incorporated for the restructuring of PASO. The project will also draw upon the findings of
                         the recent reviews and Technical Assistance provided to PASO by the ADB and other agencies such
                         as AusAID and the South Pacific Commission.

                         Sustainability: The sustainability of PASO will be supported through the regional ‘Safety and
                         Security Levy’ which is being introduced under the PAIP. The AU$ 5 per departing passenger is
                         hypothecated to be used only for safety and security oversight and other activities. It will provide
                         sufficient revenue for countries such as Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu to finance the ongoing PASO
                         oversight costs. Lower trafficked countries such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will require supplemental
                               funding from government budget or donors. The PAIP will be undertaking a study specifically aimed
                               at establishing long-term sustainability of aviation in PICs and safety oversight will be one
                               consideration in the study.

                               analysis (if known)
                               The project is located at the PASO office in Port Vila, Vanuatu. All investments will be in salaries
                               for staff and consultants, as well as office operations costs, such as software and computer hardware.
                               No infrastructure investments will be done. There are no significant risks that require a social
                               assessment.
                               E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                               There is no capacity and no experience with safeguards in PASO. However, the Technical and
                               Fiduciary Services Unit (TFSU) has experience with Safeguards and will provide any support as
                               necessary.
