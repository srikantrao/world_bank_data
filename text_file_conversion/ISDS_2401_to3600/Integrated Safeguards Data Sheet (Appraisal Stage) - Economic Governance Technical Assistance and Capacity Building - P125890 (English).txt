                              have been identified concerning public finance management, including public procurement, and civil service management.

                              The pronounced uncertainty surrounding the country’s transition to democratic governance and representative civilian-rule, and the fluid national
                              and regional situation, require a focus on the basics as well as maximum design flexibility and adaptability during implementation of project
                              activities.

                              Project Beneficiaries: key government ministries include: Economy and Finance, Budget, Employment and Public Administration, and the financial
                              administrations of line ministries including Defense and Interior.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project directly supports the governance reform agenda of the first democratically elected government in Guinea’s history. The
                              project is addressed to the first pillar of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that aims to improve governance and strengthen institutional
                              and human capacity. This operation is closely linked to the Interim Strategy Note for 2011-2012 (ISN) endorsed in March 2011 with a special focus
                              on the areas of public financial management and public administration management. This project complements the DPO approved in March 2011
                              with strong focus on governance reforms.
                              1.         Building a functioning and transparent administration and establishing the public financial management are the key development
                              challenges that the Republic of Guinea faces. The project focuses on supporting improvements in the country’s governance environment, re-
                              establishing and strengthening basic systems and practices to improve the mobilization, management, transparency and accountability of public
                              financial and human resources in the administration. The actions highlighted are a key element to restore the population’s trust in the government’s
                              capacity to manage Guinea’s affairs in a way that is consistent with the broad public interest.

                              2.          Thus, the project development objective is to re-establish and strengthen basic systems and practices to improve the mobilization,
                              management, transparency and accountability of public financial and human resources in the public administration. The project has two critical
                              areas: (i) strengthening public financial management (PFM) through reinforcing capacity for the budget preparation, execution, monitoring and
                              evaluation and establishing the Financial Management Integrated System (FMIS) ; ensuring effectiveness of procurement procedure in the
                                                                                                                                                                      Page 1 of 3
                               government across the board including the security sector; and establishing the Investment Fund, and (ii) improving public administration
                               management by supporting a biometric census, establishing a human resource management system connected to the payroll system and
                               reinforcing management oversight and control.
