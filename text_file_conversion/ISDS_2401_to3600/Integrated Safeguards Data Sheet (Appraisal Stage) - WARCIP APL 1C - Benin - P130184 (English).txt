                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1- Supporting Connectivity-(US$30.5 million): The connectivity component will focus on supporting Benin to have access to Africa
                              Coast to Europe (ACE) submarine cable. Benin has a submarine landing station already – SAT-3 – but pricing and capacity limitations mean that
                              the country needs a second, higher capacity international link, to improve reliability and to service anticipated increased demand from the growing
                              number of operators in the recently liberalized market. The project will finance the cost of ACE membership fee while the Government creates a
                              PPP framework to own and manage the landing station. The government would initially pre-finance the infrastructure and the private operators
                              would pay the government back based on a payment schedule to be agreed.

                              Component 2 - Creating an enabling environment for connectivity: This component will focus on (i) the transaction design and operating model for
                              ownership and management of connectivity infrastructure using PPP frameworks, (ii) related open access principles to create an enabling
                              environment for improved connectivity and (iii) strengthening of policymaking and regulatory functions in Benin

                              (i)        Transactional design: The focus will be on designing a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to own and operate the submarine cable landing
                              station (and access to cable capacity), discussion of transfer of CMA signatory rights and obligation from Benin Telecom to the new SPV and
                              support related to develop all legal and contractual instruments for the SPV. Under this activity, support will be provided to facilitate negotiations
                              with operators in landlocked countries and development of IRU agreements or any other legal documents to secure access to capacity by
                              neighboring countries.

                              (ii)         Addressing policy, market and regulatory bottlenecks to maximize the benefits of the proposed connectivity agenda. Specifically this
                              activity will provide support to the regulatory authority to develop regulatory instruments for open access including support for licensing the new
                              SPV, wholesale regime for capacity and other instruments related to capacity pricing to ensure open and non discriminatory access to ACE
                              capacity. The project will also provide technical and regulatory support to ensure redundancy between ACE and SAT-3. The project will also
                              provide support to the Government to reposition Benin Telecom in the market.

                              (iii)        Institutional strengthening: Institutional strengthening support will be offered to (i) Benin Telecom SA as the company is going through
                              initial restructuring process to convert to a carrier carrier, (ii) Regulatory Authority to strengthen its capacity in regulating the sector, (iii) Ministry to
                              support policy making function and (iv) initial support to the SPV in the first formative months.

                              Component 3 - Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation-(US$ 1.25 million)
                              This activity will support strengthening the capacity of the Government to implement the connectivity project, including incremental cost for the e-
                              Benin PIU which will implement this project (cost of additional year of implementation as e-Benin is expected to close before WARCIP- Benin, cost
                              for hiring additional technical expert for the PIU) and other incremental operating costs, audits, communications, M&E, and environmental and
                              social studies, including their implementation and monitoring.

                               The Project will involve installing an ACE submarine cable in Cotonou, Benin. The choice of the landing site was based on the marine survey and
                               confirmation of the topography of the seabed and the locations of the marine geophysical structures. The marine environment between the two
                               locations sustains sensitive ecosystems but there are no proposed or established protected areas documented along the ocean part of the cable
                               route.
                               The project is a Category B project.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The project triggers Environmental Assessment (EA) (OP/BP 4.01) – This policy requires analysis of project impacts and measures to prevent,
                                  minimize, mitigate or compensate for the adverse impacts. The Environmental Impact Assessment, in this case the ESMP of theproject is
                                  based on the likely route the marine cable will take between the two landing stations. The current EIA/ESMP (i) surveys the topography of the
                                  sea bed and the locations and formations of the marine geophysical structures. (ii) provides guidance on the cable’s likely area of influence or
                                  potential area of impact, (iii), shows that the potential impacts on habitats which lie in close proximity of the cable path will most likely result
                                  from the construction activities in laying the cables.

                                  Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) the project route selection is done in such a way that it will not be allowed to adversely impact these areas. This
                                  will be done by confirming in the marine survey phase when the cable route is being finalized, that the selection of the final cable route will be
                                  made in outside the cable’s area of influence / corridor (requires a trench of about 1 m over a length of about 700 m, or about 700 m2). This will
                                  ensure that any critical natural habitat areas are not impacted by the cable during construction.

                                  Physical Cultural Resources (PCR) (OP/BP 4.11) – This policy seeks to avoid the disturbance and/ or destruction of physical cultural resources
                                  by the project’s activities. During construction and maintenance / phases, the cable will not be laid closely on land to the physical cultural
                                  resources in such areas as places of worship, buried artifacts, cemeteries, and archeological assets, etc.

                                  The project triggers OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement due to the potential impacts: of a) ten (10) properties affected belong to six (6)

                           PAPs, out of which four (4) PAPs are individuals (persons); one PAP has experienced three impacts (house ramp, shop, garage ramp), a
                           private institution (private school) is impacted on three levels (access ramp, kiosk, front entrance) and a public institution; Benin Telecom (main
                           entrance).
                           Some construction may cause demolition of permanent or temporary structures. There is expected land acquisition issue at the site the landing
                           station crosses public domain. There will be temporary inconveniences during the construction phase and economic loss to some business
                           concerns especially those run by SMEs. There will be some expected disturbances of quality of life and/or businesses due to permanent or
                           temporary relocation.

                           Since the number of PAPs (10) is less than 200, an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan (ARAP) should be prepared. However, the consultant on
                           the country team suggested maintaining the RAP to facilitate the overall presentation since the project has not yet been included in a
                           Resettlement Policy Framework.
                           In order to address these impacts a Resettlement and Compensation Plan has been prepared which outlines the mechanisms in place to
                           address compensation when needed. A grievance redress system is put in place to address any issues that may arise. Consultations took
                           place with potentially affected people in Cotonou and their views have been integrated in 2011.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            NA
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            During the assessment, the consultants surveyed potential alternatives in the process of determining the final cable route so as to avoid the
                           environmental impacts on. The current choices appear to be the best to mitigating social impacts and that is going through the unpaved road to
                           FIYEGNON I district and the option to build the terminal station in a virgin compound of KIPE instead of a market area.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            The implementing agency; eBenin PIU, is committed to ensuring that environmentally responsive practices are carried out during construction
                           and maintenance operations of the project in KIPE and FIYEGNON I. Measures envisaged during implementation include: (a)incorporating
                           environmental considerations in the planning, management and operational activities; (b) hiring an Environmental and Safety Coordinator/
                           consultant responsible for environmental and safety issues during construction and maintenance, (c) building individual and institutional
                           capacities if the in-country staff and the implementing agency, and; (c) allocating resources for addressing safeguards issues.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            The Key Stakeholders include current inhabitants (KIPE and FIYEGNON 1) of landing sites, the Environmental Protection Agencies of Benin,
                           businesses and civil society grassroots technical services, local communities, and general populations in Cotonou. Issues raised in the
                           consultations have focused on local involvement in the environmental and social management of the project and ensuring adequate capacity to
                           supervise safeguards implementation.

                           Public Consultation: meaningful and participatory consultations were held in both KIPE and FIYEGNON with potentially affected people (PAPs)
                           and broader stake holders including NGOs, civil society during the preparation of the ESMP and ARAP to inform about the project. The
                           consultation process also informed the affected people about the grievance procedures.

                           Among the environmental NGO communities which supported the project, concerns were raised about potential impacts and resettlement

                           Subsequently to these concerns, the recommendations of the PAPs to mitigate the negative impacts associated with relocation are:
                           •          good assessment;
                           •          compensate per loss
                           •          Warn people on time to allow them to prepare;
                           •          Insure the income lost during construction;

                           •          ensure that the work does not last disrupting activity over a long period
                           •          restore the property affected at its initial state.
                           •          resettle in the area in order to secure regular customers;
                           •          Involve PAPs in the process
                           These concerns have been addressed.
