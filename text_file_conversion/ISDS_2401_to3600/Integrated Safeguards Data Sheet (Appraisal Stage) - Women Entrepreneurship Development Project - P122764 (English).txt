                              3. Project Description

                              The Project has three components with a total investment of USD 50 million, each described below:

                              Component 1: Access to Microfinance. The aim of the component is to facilitate access to financial services for female growth oriented
                              entrepreneurs by providing working capital and investment finance through a dedicated line of credit. At the same time, the component aims at
                              improving the capacity of existing MFIs to serve female growth oriented entrepreneurs with tailored financial products. The component is based on
                              a two-tier structure where the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE) will act as an MSE finance wholesaler engaged in the business of lending to
                              qualified Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) with the specific requirement of on-lending only to female-owned or partly female-owned micro
                              and small enterprises. The PFIs will engage in the retail distribution of sub loans to this specific target of MSE clients.

                              Subcomponent 1a: Credit facility. This sub-component will consist of a credit facility in DBE for on-lending to PFIs for the purpose of on-lending to
                              female-led MSEs and providing them with financial products tailored to their needs. To avoid further distortions of the market, the subcomponent
                              will promote lending and saving practices in line with best commercial practices and OP 8.30.

                              Subcomponent 1b: TA facility. A critical success factor and a key goal of the project are to build the institutional and human resource capacity of
                              PFIs to effectively service the female MSE client market. An assessment study of selected Ethiopian MFIs conducted in December 2011 revealed
                              a number of institutional weaknesses which need to be addressed in order to ensure that PFIs are able to properly utilize funds received through
                              the program and support the WEDP target group with convenient, timely services. In order to make the credit facility effective, PFIs will receive a
                              mandatory, specific, high-quality, technical assistance, including TA to manage potential environmental and social impacts in the business plans,
                              by an international consulting firm before credit is provided.

                              Component 2: Entrepreneurial skills, technology and cluster development. The aim of this component is to develop growth oriented women
                              entrepreneurs’ skills, facilitate their access to more productive technologies that can raise their incomes, and help unleash synergies from
                              clustering. This will be achieved through designing and implementing a capacity building technical assistance program to strengthen the capacity
                              of the institutions that will provide direct services to the WEDP participants, particularly the One Stop Shops and TVET colleges, and the
                              supporting/coordinating institutions such as the City MSE Development Offices.

                              Subcomponent 2a: Entrepreneurship skills development. This subcomponent will build capacity to ensure delivery of basic and advanced
                              entrepreneurship training, support in utilizing more productive technology, coaching and mentoring and business information to growth oriented
                              women entrepreneurs eager to develop their entrepreneurial skills, improve the quality of their product and services, and invest in more productive
                              technology or access new markets. The initial needs assessment of training and related services will be conducted by One Stop Shops (20 in
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 3
                               Addis Ababa and 5 for each of the other cities). A more comprehensive training needs assessment of the entrepreneurs will be conducted by the
                               TVETs colleges. This will result in more specific training recommendations to the entrepreneur and in providing feedback to the TVETs for further
                               development of the training program to better suit the WEDP members’ needs and will cater for at least 20 000 women entrepreneurs.

                               Subcomponent 2b: Cluster Development. WEDP will support cluster development according to best international practice and in a way that spur
                               income and employment growth for female owned/partly female-owned MSEs. Industrial clusters are the concentration of economic activities of a
                               certain sector in a certain location producing similar and closely related goods. Industrial clusters provide a wide range of advantages that enable
Public Disclosure Copy




                               enterprises become competitive and profitable. These advantages could be generated either through unplanned positive externalities such as
                               industry specialization, labor pooling, and knowledge spillovers or through deliberate joint actions. Such joint actions may include bulk purchase
                               and storage of raw materials, combined marketing campaign, joint advertising, joint purchase and hiring of equipment, joint lobbying of local
                               authorities, joint application of credit, etc. Joint actions in clusters do not emerge automatically and require efforts for the identification and
                               achievement of shared goals and depend on the gradual process of trust building and coordination.

                               Component 3: Project Management, Advocacy and Outreach, Monitoring and Evaluation and Impact Evaluation.

                               Subcomponent 3a- will establish a National Project Management Team (NPMT) within FeMSEDA under the Ministry of Urban Development and
                               Construction. The operational responsibility for the project implementation in the regions will rest with the City Offices, MFIs and TVET colleges
                               using OSS as the entry point.

                               Subcomponent 3b - Communication, Advocacy and Outreach will build awareness; expand the outreach and understanding and acceptance of
                               WEDP among (1) the beneficiaries and (2) relevant stakeholders, especially the husbands of the participants who will receive a tailored information
                               package to ensure consent. Potential WEDP participants will be given detailed and thorough information about the different components of the
                               program and the respective application and selection procedures, including WEDP the aims and the requirements of participants.

                               Subcomponent 3c - Monitoring & Evaluation The NPMT will be responsible for developing and establishing a suitable monitoring and evaluation
                               system to accurately track and assess the progress of WEDP implementation. This includes the identification of mechanisms and methodologies to
                               continuously benchmark the main inputs and outputs as well as to measure outcomes on the basis of the objectives and targets.

                               Subcomponent 3d: Impact Evaluation: Making impact evaluation an integral part of the WEDP reflects the desire expressed by stakeholders to
                               systematically investigate the effectiveness of the project. Such analysis will not only allow for a comprehensive stocktaking and review of the
                               project's achievements but it will also help to identify the underlying mechanisms and constraints affecting its mode of functioning.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               WEDP will be a national urban project covering the four regional capitals of Tigray, Amhara, SNNP and Oromiya and the two chartered cities,
                               Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa. Neighboring suburbs and satellite cities may be included based on the available capacity for program
                               implementation. The project will undertake a resource and implementation assessment of Harare and the four emerging region (Afar, Somali,
                               Benishangul-Gumuz and Gambela) during project implementation to come up with the specific design elements to expand the project activities in
                               these four regions.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The WEDP will only support micro and small enterprises and will not cause large scale environmental impacts. Most MSEs will either be in the
                                  service sector, or in the supply chain. However, while the expected actions will be small, in the absence of the specific nature of the MSEs there
                                  could be potential impacts related to waste management, agro-processing etc. In this context the program is considered as potential category
                                  “B”.
                                                                                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                There are no potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated activities in the project.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                NA
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan

                               and implement the measures described.
                                As the MSEs to be financed under the project are not defined, the client has prepared an Environmental & Social Safeguards Management
                              framework (ESMF) as an instrument to manage any potential adverse environmental and social impacts. The overall purpose of the ESMF is to
                              ensure that all activities within the MSEs supported by the project are environmentally sound and are in compliance with the requirements of
                              pertinent Ethiopian laws and regulations as well as World Bank environmental safeguard policies (OP4.01) bearing in mind the characteristics
                              of MSEs development interventions.
                              The implementing agency for the Access to Credit component will be the development bank of Ethiopia (DBE). Under Subcomponent 1b: TA
                              facility, a critical success factor and a key goal of the project is to build the institutional and human resource capacity of Participating Financial
                              Intermediaries (PFIs) to effectively service the female MSE client market. In order to make the credit facility responsive to mitigating adverse
                              environmental and social impacts of MSEs, PFIs will receive a mandatory, specific, high-quality, technical assistance by an international
                              consulting firm to help build capacity in Environmental & Social Assessment of the MSEs. In the meantime, the client has prepared an ESMF as
