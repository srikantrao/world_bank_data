2. Project Objectives: The objective is to support the Armenian government to prepare an
investment plan for developing renewable energy in the country and securing funding from the
Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program (SREP) fund. The plan should be comprehensive, clear
and effective in demonstrating how SREP resources and other donor and private sector financing
would be used in Armenia to overcome current obstacles to the wider penetration of renewable
and low carbon energy.

3. Project Description: The project will have the following components:

   A. Preparation of SREP Investment Plan: This will include technical assistance for
      preparation of SREP investment plan, including review of the framework for renewable
      energy in Armenia; comprehensive assessment of renewable energy technologies
      applicable in Armenia; stakeholder consultations to agree on prioritization of renewable
      energy projects; environmental and social screening to identify and flag key positive or
      negative impacts of individual renewable energy technologies when pursuing
      development of renewable energy in the specific country context; and preparation of the
      Investment Plan in the template recommended by SREP.
   B. Project implementation: This will include financing of incremental operating costs of the
      implementing entity.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project will finance only technical assistance aimed at the development of a renewable
energy investment plan for consideration by the SREP for funding. No physical works will be
supported.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The grant will finance exclusively technical assistance activities aimed at assisting Armenia in
scaling up its use and scope of renewable energy sources. The key output of the project will be
an investment plan intended for consideration by the SREP for funding, which will be based on
the general analysis of potential for developing various renewable energy technologies for power
generation and heat supply in Armenia. The analysis will be carried out based on the desk-top
study of available country information and the literature covering prospects of reviewable energy
use in Armenia. The technologies may include geothermal energy, wind, solar/ PV, biomass,
solar heaters, heat pumps and any other technology deemed to be worth assessing.
The project activities will not have any direct environmental impact, but their results will
influence the future investment decisions and play an important role in determining the
directions of developing renewable energy technologies. Therefore the development of the
investment plan will include identification of the environmental and social risks and benefits of
the technologies proposed for adoption and/or further development in Armenia, environmental
assessment of the available pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, and planning of site-specific
environmental assessment work for individual projects found in an advanced stage of
preparation.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

The main long term impacts of implementing the investment plan to be produced under the
project are expected to be positive due to reduction of the proportion of carbon- and emission
intense fossil fuels used in Armenia.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

None. The TA itself will identify and analyze various alternative scenarios of scaling up the use
of renewable energy.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 Fund), acting as the project
implementing entity, prepared the TOR for developing an investment plan for the SREP funding,
which includes: (i) identifying environmental and social risks and benefits of various types of
reviewable energy technologies considered as potentially suitable for Armenia; (ii) pointing out
gaps in the coverage of environmental and social aspects of the reviewable energy generation by
already produced sectoral studies and reviews; (iii) carrying out environmental/social assessment
of the available pre-feasibility and feasibility studies and revising their findings and
recommendations as required; and (iv) developing TORs for specific environmental/social
studies for already identified individual projects being in an advanced stage of preparation for
funding from SREP.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key stakeholders are the Government of Armenia, national and international Civil society
organizations/Non-government organizations, and the private sector. The draft TOR for the
development of the investment plan was disclosed in-country and through the InfoShop, and the
stakeholder feedback was sought. The priority list of renewable energy investment projects to be
included in the investment plan will be determined in consultation with the key stakeholders
through round-table discussions and the draft investment plan will also be disclosed to seek
broader public feedback.
