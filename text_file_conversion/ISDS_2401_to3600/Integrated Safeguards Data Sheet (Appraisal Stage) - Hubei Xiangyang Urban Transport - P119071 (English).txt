                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 Similar to other urban transport projects, adverse environmental impacts during construction are mainly noise, dust, waste disposal,

                           These impacts are moderate and mostly of temporary nature with standard measures and engineering code of conduct to mitigate. Major
                           negative impacts during operation include air pollution, noise and small amount of sewage from bus depots that will be discharged to sewer
                           system.

                           The project has adverse impacts related to the need for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement; though in some cases displaced persons

                           viewed the housing demolition as an opportunity to improve their living conditions significantly. The project will require the acquisition of 898.1
                           mu of village land (including 388.59 mu of cultivated land). The project would also require the demolition of 132,440m2 of existing structures,
                           including houses, enterprises and private shops. The land acquisition of the project would affect 3079 people in 752 households; the house
                           demolition would affect 541 people in 124 households, 592 people from 138 households will be affected by both land acquisition and house
                           demolition.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                           More long term and indirect impacts occur during operation, mainly air pollution, noise and vibration caused by traffic on roads built or
                           rehabilitated by the project. Measures to address these negative impacts include strengthening road-side spot check, phase-out of non-
                           compliant polluting vehicles, tightening vehicle testing and maintenance, keeping and increasing tree belt along roads, and erecting noise
                           barriers or insulation where necessary. Development along new roads will be well planned and effectively controlled by the authority in order not
                           to add new sensitive receptors.

                           Resettlement of residence and relocation of industries due to the project might cause indirect secondary environmental impacts if not managed
                           properly. The Environmental Assessment (EA) provides an inventory detailing people resettled and industries relocation, their amount, nature,
                           potential site contamination and status of municipal service in receiving areas to ensure no new pollution will be transferred as a result.

                           The city has planned to develop Panggong Area into a new city center in the future. A comprehensive land use plan has been developed for the
                           Area based on the overall urban master plan of the city. An environmental impact screening required by Chinese regulations on environmental
                           assessment at the planning stage was conducted, as part of the land use planning process to avoid or minimize negative environment impacts
                           caused by planned land development. Additionally, the Bank team also provided advice to the plan to promote public transport friendly land
                           development which would prevent the Area from becoming a car-dependency city, which in long term, as shown in many American cities, could
                           cause severe local and global environmental problems.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           Sound project design is crucial in avoiding or minimizing negative impacts from the outset. Alternative analysis of different design options were
                           undertaken including a without project scenario. Different lane configurations including the existing ones were analyzed for most new and
                           rehabilitation of roads. Alternatives with less land occupation and resettlements, wider green belt or that can keep as much as possible existing
                           good quality greenery were recommended.

                           For new roads, comparison was made for different alignments in terms of their impacts on the environment (e.g. green space), resettlement and
                           engineering aspects. A slightly adjusted alignment was recommended to some roads to avoid the loss of existing well-grown street trees and
                           associated social-economic disturbance and cost in felling or removing and replanting. Efforts had been made to minimize resettlement impact
                           during project alignment choosing.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan

                            and implement the measures described.
                           The Project Management Office (PMO) hired EA unit of the No.4 Chinese Academy of Railway Design, a top-level certified EA institute in the
                           province, which has recent experience of preparing EA for similar Bank projects, e.g. Wuhan Urban Transport-II Project in 2009. The PMO has
                           staffs that have experience with other ongoing or just completed Bank funded projects in the city. They received further training from the Bank
                           team on safeguard requirements and practiced throughout the EA process.

                           To effectively implement the outcomes of the EA process and comply with relevant policy and legal requirements, an Environmental
                           Management Plan (EMP) was developed in close collaboration with the PMO. This ensures the

                           its implementation in future.

                           The EMP specifies mitigation measures to address all potential adverse impacts during preparation, construction and operation of the proposed
                           investments, based on the past experience and incorporated recommendations from public consultation and social safeguard related work of
                           the project. It also outlines the institutional arrangement and responsibility of each party (PMO, owner, contractor, supervision engineer,
                           operator, regulating government bodies) from design, construction to operation. It details environmental monitoring for construction and
                           operation phases, including parameters to be monitored, sampling methods, locations, frequency, monitoring agency and budget estimate. The
                           EMP also includes budgeted monitoring plan and training plan which are integrated into the overall implementation plan of the project.

                           The environmental monitoring has been integrated and budgeted into the overall monitoring and evaluation of the project. The EMP will also be
                           incorporated into bidding documents and contracts to ensure their implementation. As the result, the EMP will become mandatory to contractors
                           and EMP training is required to be held prior to the commencement of construction.

                           Following the relevant Chinese laws, regulations and World Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement, the Xiangyang Project Office has
                           prepared a RAP. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was also prepared since the location of some of the roads has not yet been finalized
                           by appraisal. The resettlement planning work was carried out by the line agencies under the guidance of a team from Wuhan University with

                            5. economic surveys and consultations describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                              Two rounds of Information Disclosure of the EAs were undertaken. The first round took place at the beginning of EA preparation. The second
                              round was carried out after the draft EA was completed. Information about the project, as well as the location and timing for public access to
                              the draft EA was disclosed through major local newspaper, official, websites and bulletins at local communities. The EA and EMP have been
                              posted at the World Bank InfoShop.

                              Public consultation of the EA was undertaken following each round of information disclosure. These consultations took various forms, mainly
                              through questionnaires, interviews and meetings with the public and experts. About 150 people were surveyed and a dozen of organizations
                              were consulted. The majority has expressed strong support for the project which they believe will improve transport and quality of life in
                              Xiangyang. Major concerns raised include social disturbance during construction and noise and automobile emissions during operation. The EA
                              and EMP incorporated counter measures to address these concerns.

                              PAPs were fully consulted during the RAP and RPF preparation. Mitigation measures were agreed by PAPs.
