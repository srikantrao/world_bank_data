2. Project Objectives
Project development objective is to: (i) improve the administration of the public pension
schemes; and (ii) develop administrative systems for safety nets interventions, with focus
on targeting and benefit payment delivery, while delivering cash benefits to the poorest
families in targeted districts.

3. Project Description
The proposed Additional Financing would provide additional support to the original
project Components but would have their structure modified to support strategy of the
Government of Afghanistan to scale up the administrative reforms of the public sector
pension schemes; and develop administrative systems for safety nets interventions and
support further development of the evolving Afghanistan Social Protection Program
(ASPP) . The revised components are as follows:

      Component 1 (Pensions) will have two sub-components: (i) designing and
implementing administrative modernization of the publi pension system that was
introduced by the Civil Service and the Military Pension Regulations, including
systematizing and cleaning records of the old schemes; and (ii) designing and
implementing administrative modernization of the Martyrs and Disabled Pension
System.
        Component 2 (Safety nets) will have two sub-components: (i) developing
administrative systems for safety nets interventions, including mechanisms of targeting
and beneficiary selection, benefit delivery, monitoring, grievances, and conditionality;
and (ii) delivering targeted benefit payments in selected districts.
        Component 3 (Capacity building and project management and evaluation) will
support three sub-components: (i) strengthening the policy, strategies and
implementation capacity for design and management of the pensions and safety nets
programs within the Ministry structure; (ii) implementing targeting, process, and impact
evaluations of the safety net interventions; and (iii) supporting project management,
including managerial, operational, FM, and Procurement support to the Ministry through
a team national consultants of the Project Support Team (PST).

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The physical works under the project relate to renovation of existing government
buildings at Kabul and minor works at the provincial level will be located on government
land. Hence, there will be no land acquisition under the project. Since some buildings
may have been non-functional for years or currently used for alternative purposes,
documentation is required that the building/land is free of encroachments, squatters,
encumbrances and other claims prior to renovation or rehabilitation.
