                              power generation from solar energy and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and local environment impact.

                              C. Project Description

                              The project will support the construction and initial operation of a proposed 50 MW CSP plant, as part of the Tunisian Solar Plan. The plant is a
                              public sector project to be implemented by STEG. The approach being adopted by the company is to go with a size and configuration that will
                              minimize technical risks, while allowing STEG to gain significant expertise in developing, operating and maintaining CSP plants. STEG is already
                              considering developing a second 50 MW CSP unit, as part of the MENA CSP IP.

                              Technology and cost. Several options are currently being reviewed by Lahmeyer, which is preparing a feasibility study (Lahmeyer already
                              completed a pre-feasibility study, where several possible sites and configurations were assessed ). The technology of choice is likely to be
                              parabolic trough, with gas auxiliary firing (for about 15% of generated power, as is the case in many existing CSP plants in Spain), without storage.
                              The project cost is currently estimated around USD 200 million.

                              Financing. The development of the STEG CSP Project is being supported by KfW. This donor is also interested in financing the project, as are the
                              African Development Bank, the World Bank and other European institutions (EIB, AFD). STEG will also be investigating possible carbon finance
                              revenues.

                              Timetable. The draft conclusions of the feasibility study is expected by early 2012. An EPC contractor will be selected in 2013. Commissioning is
                              planned in 2015.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Two sites have been preselected, one near the sea in the Gabès area, the other one inland between Gafsa and Tozeur. The final selection will
                              take place by end 2011 or early 2012, when the on-site insolation measurement campaign starts).

                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              STEG is experienced in developing, financing and operating large scale generation projects, involving multiple donors, international banks and
                              export credit agencies, as well as major international suppliers. Recent announced projects include several 400 MW combined cycle gas-plants.
                              Regarding renewable energy, STEG has developed several wind farms, in Sidi Daoud, Métline and Kechabta. A photovoltaic program was
                              launched in 2009, involving the acquisition of 3,000 units of 1 kWp each.

                              The capacity of STEG in the area of environmental and social safeguards will be assessed during upcoming preparation missions, and appropriate
                           capacity building measures will be recommended, if necessary. As part of the requirements for World Bank lending, environmental and social
                           assessment capacity will be determined. STEG will have to commission and submit to the Tunisian Ministry in charge of environment a project EIA
                           with appropriate mitigating and monitoring measures. The capabilities of STEG will be fully assessed with the assistance of reputable technical
                           advisors. The process will be supervised and the evaluation report submitted to the World Bank and other donors and financiers for no-objection.

                                This rating requires that a full fledged environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) be carried out on behalf of STEG by an
                                independent third party consulting firm, according to Terms of reference approved by the World Bank. The ESIA will be reviewed and cleared
                                by the World Bank, and it will be disclosed by InfoShop and in country, in a language and form accessible to the public, at least 120 days prior
                                to the Board of Directors meeting of the World Bank. Furthermore, public consultation should be carried out at least twice during the ESIA
                                process: once during the scoping stage, and once when the draft ESIA report is ready.
