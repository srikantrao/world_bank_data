                              The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen the human resource, institutional, and infrastructural capacity of the Servicio
                              Meteorológico Nacional to meet the increasing demand for timely and accurate weather and climate information for the purposes of water
                              resources management and disaster risk management in the face of climate change and climate variability.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The Project will support increasing the pool of skilled meteorologists and climate scientists available to SMN, either as in-house staff or as
                              contractors. It will provide technical and analytical support to support improvements in SMN#s capacity to communicatedata and forecasts to its
                              clients. It will finance rehabilitation of current weather and hydro-climate observation networks, as well as the acquisition of new radars and
                              instrumentation to measure atmospheric and soil humidity, so as to improve the scope and quality of weather, hydrology and climate information.
                              It will finance the acquisition and/or development of new technologies and models to help SMN improve its data base management and the accura
                              cy of its weather, hydrological and climate forecasts. Actual and future knowledge products to better understand hydro-climatic processes and
                              trends in Mexico for planning and policy decision purposes will be supported through the creation of the National Climate and Environment
                              Forecasting Center (CENPAC) with participation of national and international scientific institutions. Finally, it will support SMN#s strategy for
                              decentralizing its functions by financing the development of five Regional Centers to carry out data collection, analysis, and foreca
                              sting, with particular emphasis on providing early warnings for storms and flash floods to strengthen civil protection.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Improving weather and climate information and forecasting will contribute to improving climate change modeling, integrated water management
                              and strengthening disaster risk management –including the effective operation of the recently expanded parametric insurance for agriculture- and
                              vulnerability reduction. Most of the institutional development and technical activities will take place in the SMN headquarters in Mexico City, while
                              the construction of the Regional Centers, rehabilitation of weather stations, and radars or other observation instrumentation will take place in
                              existing facilities nationwide, including a number of locations in administrative offices in biodiversity reserves agreed with the Natural Protected
                              Areas National Commission.
                              CONAGUA—of which SMN is a managing unit—has knowledge and experience in applying the social and environmental safeguards policies of
                              the Bank through a number of Bank-financed projects, and through the Water Quality Managing Unit (Gerencia de Calidad del Agua, GCA), which
                              will also be the responsible unit for environmental compliance of the SMN investments.
                              For this purpose, an Environmental Assessment and an Environmental Management Framework were commissioned. The Environment
                              Management Framework is a practical guide that includes information on the equipment, description of support structures and the environmental
                              requirements for the installation or replacement, and the required measures to dispose of old equipment—including the national bylaws and
                              regulations, and the provisions for complying with Bank standards. Both for cases of the installation of new equipment or the replacement of old
                              equipment, the Framework provides the procedure to assess whether or not the measures required have been followed and the formats to
                              document and report.
                              Equipment specifications are included in the framework to guide—from an environmental impact perspective—the criteria and measures on the
                              selection, acquisition, transportation, and installation of new equipment; and on the disposal of replaced equipment and parts that may contain
                              such things as mercury, lead batteries, battery acids, and alkaline materials from hydrogene generators utilized in meteorological balloons.
                              The framework guides the user through the national legal framework, the Bank’s regulations, and the international treaties signed by Mexico
                                                                                                                                                                        Page 1 of 4
                               regulating production, use, transport, and disposal of hazardous materials, to identify risks and appropriate measures to avoid use, minimize,
                               mitigate, or contain potential impacts, and report accordingly.
                                A detailed list of the existing inventory, together with the proposed 2011–12 acquisitions, allows the Framework to specify techniques, materials
                               for installation, and packaging, handling, transportation, and final disposal arrangements.
                                The Framework describes the current arrangements and responsibilities within CONAGUA for complying with the above-mentioned regulatory
                               frameworks, including the required communication and coordination among SMN, GCA, and the Environment Ministry (SEMARNAT), to ensure
                               screening, scoping, compliance, and reporting.

                               Finally, the Framework has been disclosed in CONAGUA´s webpage and distributed in advance to the participants in a public a focus group
                               discussion where relevant institutions like the National Institute of Ecology, Semarnat, the Agriculture Ministry, conservation NGOs, and
                               universities were invited, including the multisector working group led by WWF, that assisted CONAGUA in developing a National Norm on
                               Ecological Flows. The Project will deliver periodic training for CONAGUA and SMN officials involved in the MoMet.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    As a precautionary measure OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) is triggered, due to the possibility that construction of Regional Forecasting
                                  Centers and New Radar installation results in land acquisition of the displacement of informal users and occupants from construction/
                                  installation sites. The project design includes no activities with the potential to harm indigenous peoples or communities. Radar installation and
                                  facilities construction will not take place on sites owned or used by indigenous people or communities.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   There will be no long term resettlement impacts or impacts on indigenous people due to future activities in the project areas.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 4
                               The possibility of excluding the option of land acquisition and resettlement for radar installation and facility construction was considered, but
                              rejected. Even though all sites are located on public land in remote locations, there still may be instances where sites are used for crop
                              production.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                               A Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared that includes compensation and resettlement assistance measures for eligible PAPs, a

                              grievance redress and complaints handling process, and a monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The implementing agency (ConAgua) has a
                              dedicated social unit with experience of the resettlement policy, and handling project related conflicts and grievances.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                               The resettlement instrument was disclosed on the ConAgua website, and was discussed during the stakeholder meeting held on February 2n
                              2012.
