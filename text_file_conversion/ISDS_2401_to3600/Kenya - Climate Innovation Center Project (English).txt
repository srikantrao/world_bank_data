2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the CIC is to support Kenyan SMEs involved in developing locally-appropriate
solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation.

3. Project Description:
 The outputs produced that will achieve this result are: technical advisory services to SMEs,
reports that explore and recommend government policies that will create a regulatory
environment that increases the prospects and possibilities for such SMEs, provision of
information helpful to the SMEs in the form of websites, written reports, and
workshops/conferences that discuss the market potential of relevant technologies, the latest
developments for the relevant technologies and other areas; and the provision of technical and
office facilities (including communications and utilities) that selected SMEs can use.

The impact of the CIC will come in the number of relevant SMEs that are assisted in their efforts
to develop and deploy innovative solutions to climate change that meet local needs. This will be
assessed with measurements on the quantity of SMEs that are active recipients of the outputs
described above.
There will be substantial knowledge generated by the activities of the CIC. This knowledge will
relate to best practices to support the development, transfer and deployment of advanced climate
technologies and business models in a way that directly supports local capacity to do so,
targeting the essential SME community in its key role in the innovation process and ecosystem.
This knowledge will be disseminated directly through the CIC in written reports, local
conferences and a website, and also internationally (via the same methods) through the planned
East African regional community of CICs and related actors and globally through the network of
CICs.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
 The CIC will be housed in the Strathmore Business School Building in Nairobi – a 8,000 square
meter green building in Madaraka, 4 kms from the City Centre and 1 km from Industrial Area.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Kenya Climate Innovation Center will have major positive environmental impacts as it will
support innovators develop and disseminate clean technologies for the domestic industry
resulting in a cleaner environment.

The project will have a direct positive social impact as it aims to improve quality of lives by
supporting job creation. Additionally it is designed to promote economic development
countrywide including rural areas which has a significant population of poor people engaged in
agri-business.

The project will not involve construction or rehabilitation of facilities. The CIC will be housed in
a brand new LEED certified building which is already built, and office partitions will be set up
on some of the floors of the building to separate out the workspace.
Anticipated negative impacts of the project include temporary disturbances in noise and
air quality and public health and safety issues during the implementation of climate
technology solutions. These impacts are expected to be very limited and appropriate
screening will be managed through the Environmental Impact Assessment checklist as
and when required developed by the Client. Where required, permits for proposed
project activities (e.g. setting up office partitions) will be obtained according to Kenya
NEMA rules.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
 N/A

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
 N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:
 N/A

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
 In addition to PwC Kenya, GVEP International, Strathmore University, and Kenya Industrial
Research and Development Institute, the project stakeholders will include Small and Medium
Enterprises in Kenya and other Kenyan businesses, entrepreneurs and innovators working with
CIC.
