                              The Project development objective (PDO) is to modernize Armenia’s tax administration in order to (i) increase voluntary tax compliance, (ii) reduce
                              tax evasion, (iii) reduce compliance costs; and (iv) increase administrative efficiency. This objective will be achieved by:

                              •           introducing modern, integrated information technology to support SRC operations;

                              •           improving data exchange between the SRC and other agencies to enhance better risk management and targeting of compliance
                              activities (“third part information?);
                              •           reengineering and automation of business processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness; and
                              •           expanding eGovernment, including e-filing and e-payments to lower the compliance burden for the private sector.

                              3. Project Description

                              The project provides the framework and financing to support a comprehensive modernization of Armenia’s revenue administration. The project will
                              finance critical investments in the basic ICT infrastructure of the State Revenue Commission (SRC). These investments will enable the SRC to
                              modernize its business processes, expand the use of e-governance, including electronic filing of tax returns, and to introduce a more targeted, risk
                              based compliance strategy, based on voluntary compliance. The project is organized into four components. Component 1 is aimed at improving
                              the organizational structure, strengthening strategic planning and human resource management, including technical and managerial training for
                              SRC staff as well as enhancing SRC’s internal control environment. Component 2 will support strengthened operations and compliance
                              management by supporting introduction of risk based audit methodologies and improved tax payer services, including implementation of a modern
                              service centers and a centralized call centre which will allow for cost –efficient service delivery and more effective quality assurance in the
                              responses provided to tax payers. Component 3 will enhance SRC’s IT environment to support modernized business processes, automation and
                              business intelligence, including establishment of a centralized data processing centre, data warehouse, disaster recovery facilities and improved
                              networking capacities. Component 4 will support the client in implementing the project in compliance with Bank procedures and to address change
                              management challenges.

                              The Government of Armenia has expressed a preference to use IDA funding for investments in tangible assets and predominantly utilize grant
                              financing and own revenues to fund technical assistance and consulting services. IDA financing is therefore focused on financing investment in
                              ICT infrastructure and system upgrades, while technical assistance components have been minimized. To ensure a comprehensive reform
                              approach, the project will be implemented in close collaboration with the USAID Tax Reform Project – a grant to finance a four year program of
                              technical assistance to the SRC and Ministry of Finance.
