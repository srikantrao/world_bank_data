                              C. Project Description

                              Loan amount, lending instrument and project duration. The proposed loan in the amount of US$60 million is designed as a Specific Investment
                              Loan (SIL) using a SWAp modality. In each sector, SWAp funds will contribute to government programs in a catalytic and focused manner to
                              support Salta’s achievements of its development goals. The Project implementation period will be three years, between January 2013 and
                              December 2015. The Project would be presented to the Board in FY13 Q1, along with the new Argentina CPS (2013-15).

                              Components. The proposed Project will be implemented under two modalities: A US$54million SWAp that will disburse against eligible expenditure
                              programs (EEPs) and a US$6 million Technical Assistance (TA) that will disburse against statements of eligible expenditures. The project will
                              include three components: two SWAp components in health and education that will be implemented by the provincial Ministries of Health and
                              Education, respectively; and a TA component that will be managed by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) located at the Provincial Ministry of
                              Finance and Public Investment.

                              Component 1: Improve access to primary health services and provide support for evidence-based clinical practice. This component will support the
                              provincial program of Primary Health Care Services which aims at improving the coverage of primary health care services. The program amounts
                              to a total of about US$71 million during 3 years , against which the SWAp will disburse about US$24 million in the three years of project duration.
                              The main objective of this component is to expand access to health services of people in rural areas, especially in geographically isolated areas
                              through the implementation of a Telemedicine Program, including the use of telemetric tools in selected areas. This technological innovation will
                              help to reach populations living in remote areas with effective health services delivery, optimization of the emergency system and the
                              enhancement of the patient interfacility transfer processes. In addition, its implementation would improve the quality of health service delivery
                              throughout the network through the promotion of the use of standardized evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and protocols for
                              Telemedicine services and the use of a new information management system to support evidence-based clinical practice. Participation of
                              beneficiaries during the design and implementation of these new services will ensure they are responsive to gender, equality and multiculturalism.

                              Component 2: Improve access to secondary education of rural population. This component will support the Provincial Program of Secondary
                              Education which aims at improving the coverage of secondary education services among the poor and create the conditions to enhance service
                              quality. The program amounts to a total of about US$112 million a year , against which the SWAp will disburse about US$30 million over three
                              years. In particular, the component will support: (i) the implementation of an education information system capable of producing basic variables
                              such as dropouts, enrollment, number of teachers, school infrastructure, and repetition, among others for the education system as a whole and at
                              the department and school levels; (ii) the development and implementation of a training program for school principals on how the use of education
                              information system to improve school-based management, (iii) the design of pertinent vocational and virtual education models to increase the offer
                           of secondary school in rural areas, and (iv) special training for teachers working with students with special needs: hospital and home-based
                           education and bilingual teaching assistants.

                           Component 3: Strengthen the provincial core public management systems and develop information-tools for policymaking. This component will
                           support the strengthening of key provincial public management systems, consolidating and deepening the progress made in recent years in
                           planning, budgeting, procurement and the production of information for policy-making. In particular, the component will provide technical
                           assistance in the following areas:
