                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project will fund the conversion of existing diesel based generation in Indonesia’s islands to renewable-diesel hybrid systems, invest
                              in greenfield solar PV and potentially in mini-hydro systems, and fund network expansion to improve electricity access.

                              The main components of the proposed project are as follows:

                              Component 1 –Renewable energy generation (US$ 200 million) with specific subcomponents: (i) investment in cost effective solar PV generation
                              in grid connected mode at PLN’s isolated diesel-based generation plants and in the main regional network systems ; and (ii) investment in
                              standalone solar PV and potentially in mini-hydro generation for electrification at numerous new locations.

                              Component 2 – PLN network extension (US$ 50 million) comprising of 300 km of medium voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) distribution lines for
                              increasing access coverage through island grids to be serviced by renewable diesel hybrid systems, and at new solar PV, and mini-hydro locations
                              where component 1 investments are being mobilized - including MV line extensions, LV network strengthening, and new customer connections (to
                              be funded by PLN).

                              Component 3 – Technical assistance (US$ 5 million) to support PLN during the initial investment phase to immediately take advantage of both
                              Indonesian experience and expertise, as well as international best practice and experience in the design and engineering of solar PV systems, PV
                              diesel hybrids, and mini-hydro plants - to build internal capacities over a wide range of technical areas that are critical for the long term
                              sustainability of these types of investments. In order to handle the rapid scale-up of renewable energy technology in its operations under the
                              project, PLN would also require staffing skills with the requisite core competencies that would need to be acquired, mobilized, and strengthened
                              rapidly to address the scale of this activity.

                              A separate grant in the amount of US$ 700,000 is being sourced from AusAID and ASTAE for technical assistance (TA) to PLN in least-cost
                              electrification planning. The output of the TA will be a spatial least cost sector-wide investment program and technology mapping. It will also
                              include outputs related to relevant technical aspects, institutional development, and post-operational sustainability. This TA will create a delivery
                              platform for all stakeholders interested in the sector to assist PLN in scaling up electricity access by using renewable energy technology. This
                              leveraging of World Bank support would be an important result of this operation.

                              The total estimated project cost is US$ 255 million for which an IBRD sector investment loan (SIL) of US$ 105 million is proposed, in addition to
                              which US$ 100 million is proposed to be funded by a KfW loan, with the remaining US$ 50 million to be financed by PLN for network rollout. The
                              proposed project is expected to be prepared during calendar year 2012. Subject to the successful implementation of the first Renewable Energy
                           for Electrification Project (REEP) SIL, and subject to Government approval, the Bank and KfW plan to follow-up with a series of SILs during
                           calendar 2013, and 2014. The relative size of each SIL will be based on the strength of the proposed investment program that PLN will have
                           prepared for implementation for each year of the loan in accordance with the agreed criteria and processes.

                           Based on PLN's initial estimates, under the REEP program comprising of the proposed series of SILs of which the current loan is the first proposed
                           lending activity, PLN has thus far identified 402 solar PV plants with an installed capacity of 60,564 kWp. PLN has also requested that mini-hydro
                           plants be considered for funding under the SILs. The Team will explore the potential for integrating mini-hydro sub-projects into the current and

                           future loans under the REEP program.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The number of locations for the current loan in the series of SILs will be based on the strength of the proposed investment program (US$ 255
                           million) that is currently being prepared by PLN. To speed up planning and implementation of the loan, PLN is selecting those sub-projects that
                           would have a relatively minor impact from both an environmental and social standpoint.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           PLN’s Environmental and Social unit within the Directorate of Corporate Planning has experience in dealing with World Bank safeguards policies.
                           PLN has implemented Bank projects in the past and its staff have received training over time on the Bank's environmental and social safeguards
                           policies and their implementation. For this project, environment and social safeguards related issues will be covered by various units within PLN
                           based on the status of project activities e.g. during project preparation, the responsibility for environmental and social safeguards matters will be
                           under the Environmental and Social unit which will be supported by PLN's branch offices, and by the regional Development Center Units (UIPs) for
                           the preparation of safeguards documents. During project construction, the environmental and social safeguards matters will be the responsibility of
                           the Head of the Division for Construction with ongoing monitoring by the Environmental and Social unit. During operations, the environmental and
                           social issues (in particular those relating to monitoring and evaluation) will become the responsibility of the Head of Division, Regional Operations
                           with reporting requirements to the Environmental and Social unit.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and their timing1
                                  should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                    The project will prepare the following safeguards instruments:
                                    1.        Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), which will provide guidance for the preparation of EMPs i.e. a single
                                    EMP for all Solar PVs, and a single EMP for small mini-hydros (if included) in the first loan; stand-alone individual EMPs for the remaining
                                    solar PV and mini-hydro locations with safeguards issues; roles and responsibilities of the institutions, and timing of the subprojects.
                                    Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOP- standard environmental specifications for contractors) will be developed for physical works under

                                    2.        Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework (LARPF) which will provide guidance for preparation of LARAPs (if needed),
                                    roles and responsibilities of the institutions and timing of the subprojects.
                                    3.        Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) which will provide guidance for the preparation of the Indigenous Peoples Plan (if
                                    needed), roles and responsibilities of the institutions and timing of the subprojects.
                                    4.        LARAPs for all subprojects in the first loan that involve land acquisition will be prepared and appraised during project preparation.
                                    5.        Due diligence will be carried out for subprojects for which land has already been acquired by PLN either directly or from local
                                    governments. The due diligence will identify the timing and procedures according to which PLN or local governments had acquired the land.
                                    6.        An Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) for those subprojects that trigger the Indigenous Peoples Policy in the first loan will be prepared
                                    and appraised during project implementation in accordance with the IPPF.

                                    All three frameworks (ESMF, LARAF and IPDF), the EMPs and LARAPs will be prepared and submitted to the Bank by end-September 2012.
