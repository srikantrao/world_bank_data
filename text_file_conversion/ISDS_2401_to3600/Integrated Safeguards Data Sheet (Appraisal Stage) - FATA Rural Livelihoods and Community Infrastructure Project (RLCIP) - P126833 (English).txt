                              The project aims to improve the well-being of un-served and underserved low income communities starting with two agencies (Mohmand and
                              Bajaur) and possibly in c                                    luster of villages in the southern agencies that are becoming accessible after m
                              ilitary operation and where families are being facilitated by the Government to                                     return and reestablish their
                              livelihoods. The project components include: Compon                                         ent A- Community Development and Social Capital Building:
                               This would include social mobilization of local communities through the locally based indigenous organizations. The project would also support
                              extensive capacit                                    y building of locally based indigenousorganizations through training, peer learn
                              ing and mentoring by more established organizations.

                               Component B - Community Infrastructure and Services:
                               This component would focus on infrastructure development in water and sanitation; agriculture # including irrigation; and livestock development
                              sub-sectors. Und                                      er these sub-sectors the project would finance rehabilitation of existing infras
                              tructure, the construction of new infrastructure, and operation and maintenance                                        (O&M) of schemes but not limited

                              and sanitation, solid waste management, and additional schemes that are identif                                         ied by local communities as
                              priority.. The type and priorities for infrastructur                                e schemes would be, however, flexible and established through
                              participatory proc                                    esses.

                               Component C - Livelihoods Support:
                               This will include generating livelihoods opportunities within the agriculture and livestock sectors through asset development and matching grants.
                              The project w                                   ould support smallholder farmers with critical inputs to ensure direct support f
                              or their livelihoods beyond subsistence farming and development of value chains                                       forselected products.

                               Component D - Institutional Strengthening, Monitoring and Evaluation and Project Management: Interventions under this component would
                              include establishment of s                                ystems and procedures for participatory planning, introduction of new/innovative
                              approaches for community-government partnerships, and building linkages with ot                                   her programs. This would also
                              include technical assistance, impact assessments,                                 third party monitoring, communications strategy, and
                              complaints handling system.

                               and neighboring countryAfghanistan. The insurgency and counter insurgency action                                        s in 2009 led to a
                               displacement of approximately 3 million people in FATA and th                                     e neighboring Khyber Phaktunkhwa (KP) regions,

                               sense of deprivation among the masses resulting from decades of weak governance                                          and the inadequacy of

                               amongst the poorest and                                      underdeveloped parts of Pakistan with over60% of its population living below nat
                               ional poverty line. Though livelihood of majority of people depend on subsistenc                                    e agricultureand livestock,
                               however, support to these sectors through infrastruc ture development, institutional strengthening, and community participation has remained
                               minimal. FATA also lags behind other provinces across a wide range of so                                      cial and economic indicators, with alag
                               even more pronounced when viewed through                                         a gender lens.

                                b. FATA region is basically a hilly terrain with dominant dry barren mountains. Figures for forest cover in FATA are unreliable, ranging from 1% to
                               8% of the to                                    tal reported area (FATA Directorate of Forest, 2005) and is declining rapidly du

                               retain soil and water is not only causing l                                 and erosion in the area but affecting the quality and quantity offodder for

                               s. Quality of fresh water resources is also under stress due to over exploitatio                                  n and inappropriate disposal of
                               wastes.

                                  (Component B and C) could potentially cause adverse environmental and social impacts triggering Bank#s environment policy OP 4.01. RLCIP
                                  has, therefore, been ra                                  ted as Environment Category B project. Most of the environmental impacts are lik
                                  ely to occur during theproject construction stage and may include water and soil                                      contamination; higher dust
                                  and noise levels; temporary odor issues; some minor                                      loss of productive land etc. Some of the operations
                                  related impacts are health r                                  elated and may result due to the inadequate water source for water supply scheme
                                  s, water contamination due to inadequate water distribution system, and localize                                      d water logging dueto poorly
                                  maintained irrigation channels etc. Most of these i                                  mpacts are expected to be temporary and confined to local
                                  environment and would                                     be direct, reversible and of short duration. In order for the project to mitigat

                                   b. The project will exclude those sub-projects that may require land acquisition and/or displacement or damages to private assets/public
                                  utilities. There are no                                    indigenous people residing in the project area so none of the Bank#s social saf
                                  eguard policies will trigger. All efforts will be made to avoid using/taking pro                                  ductive land for any sub-project
                                  investments. It will ensured that the land dona                                    tion do not cause adverse impacts onthe income of any
                                  households. In case, if la                                    nd may come up as an issue for a priority investment, the procedures for essenti
                                  al consultations and agreements with owners/affected persons will be laid down i                                        n the Operations Manual. In
                                  case of disagreements with owners/affected persons,                                        the project will not take/used such lands.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                                                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 4
                           No indirect or long term adverse environmental impacts are expected to be associated with the proposed project interventions, otherthan those
                           related to the usa                               ge/operation and maintenance of the services/infrastructure. No involuntary rese
                           ttlement impacts will occur due to this project.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           a. The only other alternative is #no-project# option, which could have detrimental effects by denying basic services to the rural population of the
                           project area                                   s. In addition the restoration of such services is linked with enhancing confide
