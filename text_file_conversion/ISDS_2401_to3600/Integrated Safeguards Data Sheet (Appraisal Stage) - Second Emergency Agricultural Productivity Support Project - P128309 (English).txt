                              Activities under the proposed project will be organized around the following three components:

                              Component 1: Rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation and storage infrastructures in selected rice producing areas (USD 7.0
                              million). This component aims at increasing the productivity of irrigated rice production systems in targeted areas through the rehabilitation and
                              improved management of irrigation and drainage infrastructures. Specific objectives include: (i) improved water control through the rehabilitation of
                              degraded works and equipment that will allow abandoned or low yielding perimeters to be used more productively, in some cases allowing double
                              cropping; (ii) enhanced capacity of the water user associations for the management and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure ; and (iii)
                              improved storage and marketing capacity through the rehabilitation and construction of storage facilities and threshing platforms, and
                              strengthening the storage management and marketing capacity of the farmer groups.

                              Component 2: Access to improved inputs, technical support services and post-harvest equipment (USD 11.0 million). This component aims to
                              improve smallholders’ access to improved inputs, advisory services, and small scale post-harvest processing equipment to increase the yields of
                              targeted commodities and enhance the productivity of value-added activities. It will have two sub-components which are: (i) Sub-component 2.1:
                              Distribution of crop technology packages and poultry vaccines that will consolidate the successful farmer-based seed multiplication system for rice
                              that was supported under the PUAPA-1 by creating a demand for certified commercial seed, and it will broaden its scope to include maize and
                              cassava. The sub-component will also include a vaccination campaign for traditional poultry; and (ii) Sub-component 2.2: Support to improved
                              post-harvest processing (USD 1.5 million), which aims to increase the value-added of agricultural products by improving private small primary
                              processing activities.

                              Component 3. Capacity Building, Project Coordination, and M&E (USD 2.0 million). This component will ensure: (i) the effective management,
                              coordination, monitoring and evaluation of the Project; and (ii) capacity building activities for implementing agencies, including CNOP-G,
                              ANPROCA, BSD and DNGR. The Project will finance: (i) contractual personnel to reinforce technical coordination and fiduciary oversight; (ii)
                              incremental operating costs; (iii) vehicles and equipment for project implementation; and (iv) studies, training, and study tours.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will intervene in 17 (of 33) prefectures which are distributed across the four agro-ecological zones of the country. The perimeters
                              proposed for rehabilitation are located in 8 of the 17 prefectures: 900 hectares in Boffa prefecture (Lower Guinea); 665 hectares in Tougué
                              prefecture (Middle Guinea); 309 hectares in Mamou prefecture (Middle Guinea); 46 hectares in Pita prefecture (Middle Guinea); 1,100 hectares in
                              Siguri prefecture (Upper Guinea); and 600 hectares of small scale community-based rehabilitations in the prefectures of N'Zerekore, Yamou and
                              Kissidougou (Forest Guinea). The Middle and Upper Guinea sites are in the watersheds of the Senegal and Niger River Basins respectively.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The project has been categorized B with four policies triggered: OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment; OP 4.09 on Pests Management; OP
                                 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement; and (iv) OP 7.50 on Projects on International Waterways. Activities that are likely to induce adverse
                                 environment and social impact/risk are related to the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and the distribution and use of yield increasing
                                 technology packages (improved seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides). In this regard, the ESMF identifies the following categories of risks and
                                 impacts to be prevented or monitored during project implementation: (a) site-specific vegetation loss during rehabilitation works; (b) soil erosion
                                 as a result of the exploitation of pits and the development of access roads to rehabilitated areas; (c) pollution from fluid and solid wastes during
                                 rehabilitation works; (d) pollution of water resources due to inappropriate use of fertilizer and pesticide; (e) increase in invasive plant species
                                 and/or salinization of irrigated areas due to inadequate water management; (f) conflicts arising from appropriation of rehabilitated areas; and (g)
                                 pressure on resources and infrastructure due to immigration of new farmers.

                                 Since the project will intervene on small size plots scattered over 17 prefectures, none of the above-mentioned risks and impacts was found to
                                 be significant or irreversible. Furthermore, the amount of water uptake from the Niger and Senegal watersheds for the irrigation of rice lands will

                                 have no significant impact on their ecological flow. Since the project is only financing the rehabilitation of existing small scale schemes and
                                 does not finance works that would change the nature or expand the scope of the original schemes, an exception to the riparian notification
                                 requirement under OP7.50 was sought and approved by Bank Management.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The residue of chemical compounds in crops and water resources, as a result of the inappropriate use of fertilizer and pesticide, is a risk but it
                                 is manageable. The sensitization activities and supports to be implemented through the Pesticide Management Plan (PMP) will help prevent or
                                 lower the occurrence of this type of indirect impact/risk.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The Borrower has prepared an ESMF, a PMP and an RPF to address any potential adverse effects of the project interventions under the
                                 Project’s Component 1 (Rehabilitation and improved management of irrigation and storage infrastructures in selected rice producing areas) and
                                 Sub-component 2.1 (Distribution of crop technology packages and poultry vaccines), including adverse environmental effects, resettlement, and
                                 land take. These safeguard documents (ESMF, PMP and RPF) have been disclosed in country (May 17, 2012) and in the Bank’s Infoshop
                                 (June 26, 2012).

                                 The approved Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) entails specific measures aiming at preventing the risks and impacts.
                                 These are: (i) screening proposed rehabilitation sites (sub-projects) and preparing specific ESIAs and /or RAPs as needed, prior to their
                                 implementation; (ii) no category A subproject will be funded under the project; (iii) capacity building of the main concerned institutions (PIU,
                                 Ministry of Environment, CRD) for the implementation, monitoring and reporting of the environmental and social mitigation measures.

                                 The screening of proposed sub-projects will be conducted by a qualified part-time safeguard consultant. This process is designed to: (i) identify
                                 PUAPA-2 activities which may have negative socio-environmental impacts; (ii) determine appropriate mitigation measures for activities with
                                 harmful impacts; (iii ) identify activities that require separate EIA; (iv) describe the institutional responsibilities for analysis and approval of
                                 results selection, the implementation of proposed mitigation measures, and the separate EIA report preparation; and (v) ensure environmental
                                 monitoring during the implementation. In addition, the RPF document outlines the principles and procedures for resettlement and/or
                                 compensation of subproject-affected people, and establishes standards for identifying, assessing and mitigating negative impacts of program
                                 supported activities. The RPF will also guide the preparation and implementation of resettlement action plans (RAPs) for each individual sub-
                                 project that triggers the involuntary resettlement policy.
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 2 of 4
                           Furthermore, the safeguard documents (ESMF, PMP, RPF) also provide guidance in terms of capacity building of institutional stakeholders
                           (BGEEE, ANPROCA, DNGR, DNSPV, CNOP-G) and farmer organizations, through training and sensitization. Finally, a total budget of about
                           US$ 373,000 has been approved to support the estimated cost of the implementation of the provisions of each of the three safeguards
                           instruments (US$ 121,429 for the ESMF; US$ 40 686 for the RPF; and US$ 211,643 for PMP). This amount has been budgeted in the overall
                           project cost and earmarked accordingly.

                           A review of the institutional capacities of the implementing institutions revealed that there are substantial concerns about the regulatory
                           framework for environmental and social management at national and local levels. The capacities of the Bureau Guinéen des Etudes et
                           Evaluations Environnementales (BGEEE), the national institution responsible for the enforcement of the safeguard procedures, and the
                           Services National de Protection Végétaux et Denrées Stockés (SNPV-DS), the national institution responsible for phytosanitary regulation
                           remain very weak for the implementation and supervision of mitigation measures. Significant institutional and technical capacity for
                           environmental and social management still needs to be strengthened at all levels. To ensure full-fledged compliance with safeguard provisions
                           during project implementation, a qualified part-time expert will be contracted to support the project coordination institution (ANPROCA) mainly
                           for the screening of sub-projects and the implementation and follow up of the approved mitigation measures.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             The key stakeholders for the processing of the safeguards instruments are the BGEEE, ANPROCA, DNGR, SNPV-DS, the CNOP-G and
                           their federations and unions (representing the farmers), and the local governments (Communes Rurales ). All them have been consulted during
                           the preparation of the safeguards instruments, and they have been updated on the requirements of both the Bank safeguard policies and the
                           National legislation on environmental management as well as on their own responsibilities in the implementation, related recommendations and
                           measures. Furthermore, a workshop comprising key stakeholders was organized in March 2012 to share the findings and approve the
                           recommendations before the Minister in charge of Environment issued the permits (Certificat de Conformité Environnementale). Concerns and
                           recommendations have been reflected in the final design of the projects activities. The final versions of the instruments (ESMF, RPF, PMP)
                           were disclosed in the following local newspapers on May 16 and 21, 2012 : (i) La Lance n° 796 on May 16, 2012; (ii) l’Observateur n° 595 on
                           May 21, 2012 ; and (iii) Le LYNX n° 1049 on May 21, 2012).
