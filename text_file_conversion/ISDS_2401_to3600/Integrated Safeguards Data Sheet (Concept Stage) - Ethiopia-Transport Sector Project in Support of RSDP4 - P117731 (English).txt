                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The specific roads to be upgraded are:
                         A. Konso - Yabelo, 107 km.
                         This road starts in Konso town, some 600 km south of Addis Ababa, and runs east to Yabelo ending at the Moyale Junction about 4km past
                         Yabelo. Total length is 107 km. The first 37 km (Konso - Brindar) is dry weather road with no drainage structures; while the next some 65 km
                         (Brindar-Yabelo) is a gravel road; and the last 5 km is asphalt. The 10 km section before Yabelo is hilly. Although the route has undergone
                         previous realignment to an acceptable standard, there is scope for further improvement. Administratively, the first 20 km lies in Konso Special
                         Wereda of the Southern Region and the remaining part in Teltele and Yabelo Weredas of Borena Zone, Oromia Region. Population of the project
                         area is : Konso Special Wereda 241,801; Teltele 71,721; Yabelo 105,355. The principal economic activity of the project area is agriculture.

                         Farming is the main activity within Konso wereda (cereals such as maize and sorghum), while livestock rearing (cattle, goat, sheep, camel,
                         equines and poultry) is the main activity for the lowland areas around Borena Zone. The major negative environmental impact identified is soil
                         erosion.

                         Like in other regions, the RoW is 30 m in town sections and 50 m in rural areas, the adverse impacts will be due to acquisition of land for road
                         alignment and construction camps and quarries. As the road traverses through three relatively big towns with dense population, the impact will be
                         loss of houses, community infrastructures, fences, trees and land. Common properties will include water sources, religious places, cemeteries,
                         market places, etc. The land acquisition in the initial assessment has revealed that a mosque at Yabelo, a Protestant Church at Brindarsabian, a
                         Holy Spirit Church at Yabelo town and two burial houses of St. Mary Church at Yabelo would be affected. The list of affected assets is as follows:
                         •          Number of house : 217
                         •          Affected Fences under : 5003 meters
                         •          Number of fruit and commercial trees situated: 122
                         •          Land requirement for various purposes: 387.3ha

                         B. Kombolcha - Bati - Mille, 133 km
                         The construction of the project road will improve the livelihood of the local area. It could potentially contribute to economic activities and
                         development of trade and urban centers. There will also be improvement of crop and livestock production and its marketing network. The road is
                         133 km in length and is located in the Northern part of Ethiopia, traversing Afar and Amhara Regions. The road starts at Kombolcha town, about
                         380 km north of Addis Ababa and passes through Bati town to Mille. The project road is mainly gravel surfaced, with a 42 km section between
                         Kombolcha and Bati paved surfaced with asphalt concrete, all of which is currently in poor condition. The ROW width is 30 meters in rural sections,
                         20 meters in kebele towns and 23 metres in wereda. The road is a major link between two trunk roads, namely Addis Dessie - Woldiya and Addis
                         - Mille - Dobi - Galafi. It also connects Ethiopia to Port of Djibouti. The total population in the project influence area is about 472,108. Kombolcha is
                         the largest town along the route with a population of 39,500 inhabitants and Bati which is a small town has 16,450 inhabitants. People in the
                         Amhara region are mainly crop farmers while those in the Afar region are pastoralist and agro pastoralists. Major crops grown are Sorghum, maize
                         and teff. This road section is characterised by scattered and bushy vegetation. It is envisaged that there will be only a minor impact on this
                         vegetation by the road construction. The project will have negative social impacts such as, loss of homes, productive assets, including strips of
                         farm land & income. In the rural sections of the project road corridor, no households will be displaced from their farmland permanently. However,
                         there will be a small number of households who will permanently lose strips of their farmland along the road frontage although the affected
                         households will be able to continue their livelihood within the remaining plot of land but will be compensated as per the guidelines in the
                         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for loss of crops, trees, and perennial crops. No household will require resettlement due to full expropriation of
                         their land by the project road.

                         Following is a list of PAPs and assets:
                         •         Total Project Affected Persons :2928 (886 Female, 1986 Male)
                         •         Government & Religious Institutions: 56

                         •         Area of Farmland to be affected: 31.5 hectares (4.5 permanently 27 hectare temporarily)
                         •         Number of houses to be affected: 962
                         •         Number of Timber trees:        25,351
                         •         Number of Perennial crops (Fruit Trees): 1,145
                         •         Number of cash crops ( Chat, Coffee, etc ):2,184
                         •         Number of Electricity poles: 645
                         •         Number of Telecommunication poles:444

                         C. Debre Birhan - Ankober, 41 km
                         The upgraded road will have positive impacts, the road will open up market opportunities, provide access to improved and better social service
                         facilities, create improved communication, growth and development of eco-tourism, increase in the supply of agricultural inputs, create investment
                         and employment opportunities, contribute to income generating activities, and improve the opportunities for women by creating access to transport
                         and other facilities. Debre Birhan - Ankober is a gravel road located in the Central part of Ethiopia in Amhara Regional State. The project road
                         starts at Debre Birhan town, about 130 km from Addis Ababa, and then it heads in an easterly direction towards Ankober with a total length of
                         41km, and a ROW width of 30 meters in the urban towns and 50 in the rural areas. The road is a major link road and an extension of the Ankober -
                         Awash Arba road project which connects two important trunk roads, Addis - Awash with Addis - Debre Birhan - Dessie. The project road provides a
                         shortest access to Djibouti port for the Central and for some of Northern regions of Ethiopia. Subsistence farming is the mainstay for about 85% of
                         the population of the project area. Livestock keeping is also one of the economic activities in smaller scale. The major types of crops grown in the
                         area include Teff, Wheat, Barley and Legumes. Although the road route will follow an existing alignment, expansion in some locations will impact
                         on forest lands and soil erosion.

                         The population in the influence area of the project road is estimated to be about 287,194, of which, 50.3% are male and 49.7% are female. The
                         urban population is about 14.9% of the total population in the project road corridor. This reveals that the project area is predominately rural and the
                         majority of the population is dependent on subsistence farming. The potential negative social impacts includes; involuntary resettlement, loss of
                         houses (residential and commercial), loss of business and income, community severance and risk for vulnerable groups, loss of productive
                         resources, loss of farming and grazing land and the disruption of social, cultural and economic ties and networks. A total of 91 households will be
                         impacted, with 31 household located in the Ankober town losing their homes permanently to be relocated within the same town, and the remaining
                         60 will move temporarily during construction and will return back of their present houses. Majority (83%) of the affected households will lose a strip
                         of their land ( less than 5%), and will be able to continue their livelihood in the remaining plot of land; however they will be compensated as per the
                         RAP guidelines for the loss of their crops, trees, and some other perennial crops. The remaining 17% of households will lose more than 20% of
                         their land have to be allocated equivalent land, so as to at least maintain their pre-resettlement livelihoods. As this is a densely populated region
                         there is scarcity of cultivable land and hence, the client will have to ensure they reach an agreement with the Wereda administration to allocate
                         replacement land. The total land required for the restoration of livelihood for the 17% of the households will be 42 ha. In addition to loss of homes,
                         the construction will also affect crops, farmland, electricity poles and lines, telecommunication poles and lines, and also different types of tree
                         species.

                         The list of affected assets is:
                         •           Number of individual households losing housing structures: 85
                         •           Number of Government and other organizations losing House: 6

                         •           Number of Electricity poles to be affected: 183
                         •           Number of Telephone poles to be affected: 8
                         •           Number of Water supply lines and points: 8

                         D. Ambo - Weliso, 63 km
                         Ambo - Weliso road is located in the Western part of Ethiopia in Oromiya National Regional State, and connects two important trunk roads namely,
                         Addis - Jimma and Addis - Nekemte trunk roads. It will allow connections between the western and southern parts of the country bypassing the
                         capital. The existing gravel road is in poor condition over its 63 km length. The road will provide easy access to highly populated and agriculturally
                         productive areas of Ambo, Wenchi and Wolisso Weredas, as well as to areas with high potential for tourism development like Wenchi Crater Lake.
                         Population of the project area is 508.649, distributed as follows : Ambo Town 67,514; Ambo 110,796; Wenchi 119,736; Wolisso 149,874; Wolisso
                         Town       60,729. Agriculture is the mainstay for the project area. Mixed farming predominates, with crop production and livestock rearing common
                         in the area. Smallholder subsistence agriculture is the main character of crop production which is rain fed and traditional style. The major crops
                         produced in the area are Cereals, Pulses and Oil seeds. Since most parts of the project corridor is densely populated and intensively used for
                         agriculture, the negative impacts of the project on flora and fauna is minimal. The detailed Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
                         includes mitigation measures to avoid impact on scattered indigenous tree species and its associated fauna. The Environmental Management Plan
                         in the ESIA proposes mitigation measures to reinstate borrow pits and quarry sites.

                         The road passes through ten small villages with settlements and two towns (Haro-Wenchi and Chitu) starting from Ambo until it reaches Wolisso
                         town. As these towns and villages have a relatively high population density, the social impact, both negative and positive, on the project affected
                         people will be high. The upgrading project is expected to have both positive and negative impacts. The positive impact is likely to reduce vehicles
                         operating costs, transport and time costs for passengers and freight, and improvement in the availability of motorized transport services. Moreover,
                         the project is envisaged to create development impacts in facilitating socio-economic and cultural activities. In the long term the project is
                         envisaged to change the quality of life of the people residing along the project influence area for better.

                         The proposed 62.3km’s road with 30m of ROW in rural areas and 20m of ROW in urban areas will likely incur negative impacts on residential
                         houses, farmlands, institutions and business installations along its corridors. Although it is temporary, the project impact will be felt also in
                         possession of lands for the purpose of ancillary works, (ie quarry sites, borrow pits, camps and detour roads). The social survey indicates that
                         upgrading of the road will affect a total of 1016 household (comprising 6096 house-hold members) and 52 Government and public buildings.

                         Following is the total asset loss either permanently or temporarily:
                         •         Total residential houses and other buildings that will be fully affected: 39

                         E. Mizan - Dima, 92 km
                         Mizan - Dima Road section (91.6km) as a part of Mizan - Dima - Boma road and is located in the South Western part of Ethiopia. The project is an
                         extension of Addis - Jimma - Mizan trunk road which will connect South Sudan to Ethiopia. The project will benefit six Weredas: Mizan - Aman,
                         Debub Bench, Guraferda, Surma, Bero and Dima Weredas. The first five Weredas are found in SNNPR while Dima is located in Gambela region.
                         The total population of the project area is estimated at 256,430 (July 2011). Population density is sparsely populated in comparison to other
                         regions in the country. The livelihood of the majority of the project population is agricultural dependent. Farmers produce crops and undertake
                         livestock production side by side. The major crops grown are Teff, barley, wheat, millet, rice, maize, sorghum, beans, peas, Soya bean, chickpea,
                         sunflower, sesame, noug & rape-seed. The road will cut through natural forests and woodland. It is envisaged that alternatives will be sought
                         through the ESIA to minimize impacts on natural vegetation.

                         The project area around Mizan - Aman, Guraferda and Mizan has a population of about 77,751; of which 53% is urban and 47% rural with an
                         average household size of 5. The settlement pattern of the Wereda population is dispersed. The population densities vary from the 14 person/km2
                         in Guraferda Wereda to 11 person/km2 in Gambela Wereda.

                         The project area is sparsely populated area with large parts as uncultivated land. There are a number of towns traversed by the project road. The
                         towns are characterized by a high density area like Mizan Teferi and low density area of Guraferda and Dima of the country and the region. The
                         Road mainly involves upgrading to Asphalt Concrete from Mizan to Dima which is 9.6 km, its overall impact on physical environment is not severe.
                         However, due to the development of towns and settlements close to the existing road, its impact on social environment could be significant.
                         Several houses are already constructed within 30 m of road right of way at different stretches of the road. It is estimated that a total of 1329 house
                         will be affected due to the project for different reasons. Other impacts include loss of farm and grazing land destruction of natural vegetation
                         situated within the 30 m ROW and lose of road side eucalyptus plantation in most of the road adjacent. Details included below:
                           •         Number of households who lose house fully: 71
                           •         Number of households who lose house partially: 401

                           On the positive side, the Project is expected to reduced vehicles operation costs, save travel times, improve potential for economic activities
                           (especially cash crop production), improve environmental conditions, increased nonagricultural employment activity and improved access to
                           markets, schools and health facilities.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Ethiopian Road Authority (ERA) has established Environmental and Social Management (ESM) and Quality Assurance Teams. The ESM
                           Team is currently staffed with six professionals: one Environmentalist (Team Leader), one Senior Ecologist, two Sociologists, one Hydrologist and
                           one Geologist. There are also two experts working exclusively on HIV/AIDS prevention and control at ERA workplaces. The major duties and
                           responsibilities of ESM includes setting and implementing ERA’s environmental guidelines in support of and in line with the national level
                           requirements, playing the role of advisory, coordination and supervision aspects that are pertinent to the road environmental impacts and
                           implication assessment, and co-ordination with the respective ERA district offices. In addition, it represents ERA at different levels in the areas of
                           environment and road safety matters. The Quality Assurance Team focuses on safety issues.

                           Although ERA has Teams working on environment, social and safety issues, performance of the Team in enforcing Environmental Management
                           Plan and supervising the implementation of Resettlement Action Plans is rated as unsatisfactory. It will be critical to build the capacity of the
                           Teams based on need assessments to ensure satisfactory implementation of EMP and the RAP for these projects in the pipeline.
