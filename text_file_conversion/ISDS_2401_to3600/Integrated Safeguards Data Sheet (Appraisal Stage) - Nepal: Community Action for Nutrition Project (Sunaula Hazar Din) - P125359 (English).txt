                              The Development Objective for the Project is to improve attitudes and practices known to improve nutritional outcomes of women of reproductive
                              age and children under the age of 2. Changes in attitudes and practices would address the key risk factors for child malnutrition and create
                              demand for nutrition related services and products. The supply of these services and products will be provided through existing public sector and
                              donor-funded programs, the private sector and, to a limited extent, financed through the Project.

                              3. Project Description

                              The Project will roll out a social mobilization initiative through a community-driven “Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiative? (RRNI) where each ward in
                              a selected VDC will commit to a series of pre-defined nutrition relevant goals, each to be met within a 100-day period. The achievement of the
                              goals will be the responsibility of Rapid Results (RR) teams, one for each ward, supported by a coach who will support all RR teams in one VDC.
                              The Rapid Results approach will be introduced early in a few wards, before Project Effectiveness, to inform details to be included in the
                              Operational Manual. It will then be rolled out under the proposed Project in a sequenced manner across 15 districts in the country. These districts
                              have been selected on the basis of a) stunting levels; b) population size; c) poverty levels; and d) the absence of interventions by other partners
                              that focus on social mobilization for improved nutrition outcomes. Within selected districts, VDCs will be selected on the basis of poverty
                              indicators, with an estimated 25% of VDCs (900 – 1000) participating in the project given the project’s financial envelope.

                              Component 1 (estimated US$34.93 million): Rapid Results for Nutrition Initiatives at the ward level. This component will support the entire Rapid
                              Results process. It will start at a Ward Citizen Forum where key nutrition challenges of the community will be discussed. Assisted by a coach at
                              the ward level, the ward will select a nutrition relevant goal from a menu of goals. A Rapid Results (RR) team would be selected at the ward level
                              that will set an appropriate and realistic target for meeting the goal and pledge to achieve the goal within a 100-day period by mobilizing the
                              community and finding the best approach to achieving the target in their particular context. The RR team will prepare a Work Plan which will
                              outline the needed inputs to achieve the goal.

                              The Work Plan will be submitted for review to the Nutrition and Food Security Steering Committees (NFSSC) at the VDC level if the total value is
                              below US$1,000 equivalent and to the NFSSC at the district level if the total value is between US$1,000 and the maximum of US$3,000
                              equivalent. There will be a mid-term assessment by the RRNI team with assistance from the coach and an end-of the 100 days initiative
                              evaluation by the team of whether it was able to meet the goal and a presentation of the results to the Ward Citizen Forum. At the same occasion,
                              the RR team will account for the use of inputs, financial or otherwise, and the end-of the 100 days initiative evaluation will effectively serve as a
                              public audit of the initiative as well. Modalities for sustaining and expanding the achievement will be an important topic during the evaluation of the
                              100 days initiative.

                              Component 2 (estimated US$5.07 million): Project Management, Capacity Building, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component will provide
                              support for the implementation of Component 1 by (i) building the necessary capacity of staff involved at all levels of project implementation; (ii)
                              providing necessary inputs for effective project management; and (iii) ensuring monitoring and evaluation of the Project, including the evaluation of
                              the Rapid Results process as well as whether the expected outcomes of the Rapid Results initiatives were achieved.

                               At the National level, support will be provided by a Project Management Team at the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD) to ensure effective
                               management of the project. At the Regional level, support will be provided to the Local Governance and Community Development Program
                               (LGCDP) Cluster units responsible for districts where the Project will be implemented. At the district level, support will be provided by the NFSSCs
                               which will be responsible for reviewing RRNI Work Plans and coordinating the supply of necessary inputs for the RRNIs. Similarly, NFSSCs at the
                               level of VDCs will receive training and project management support to ensure that they are able to review and process work plans and secure
                               necessary supplies at the village level. Support to NFSSCs at district and VDC levels would go beyond Project specific activities and include
                               support in coordinated planning and budgeting for nutrition relevant activities across sectors to be incorporated in the district block grants.

                               Support for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the Project will include regular collection of data on the implementation of the Rapid Results for
                               Nutrition Initiatives, data on the behaviors and practices which the RRNIs are expected to change, as well as data on the nutritional outcomes.
                               The component will finance the costs of a mid-term evaluation focusing on the changes in attitudes and practices and an end-of-Project impact
                               evaluation focusing on outcomes among the five main populations targeted under the Project. The component will also include a third-party
                               independent verification of results of the RRNIs. On an annual basis, there will als o be a Nutrition Learning Forum organized by the National
                               Planning Commission where results of the project will be presented and discussed, where innovative RRNIs and project lessons would be
                               highlighted and where selected communities would be honored for their special achievements.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               Project interventions will be supported in 15 districts, selected on the basis of: (a) stunting levels; (b) population size; (c) poverty levels; and (d) the
                               absence of interventions by other partners that focus on social mobilization. The project districts are in the central Terai: Parsa, Bara, Rautahat,
                               Sarlahi, Mahottari, and Dhanusa; in the Central Hills: Dhading, Nuwakot, Makwanpur, Sindhuli and Ramechhap; in the Eastern Terai: Siraha,
                               Saptari, and Sunsari; in the Eastern Hills: Udayapur.

                               These districts, selected on the basis of poverty and health indicators, are spread throughout the country and do not possess any physical
                               characteristics that would be particularly relevant for safeguard analysis. Similarly, no large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected.
                               Therefore, the project is expected to be Category B.

                               The main environmental and social safeguards policies to be triggered under this project are: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP/
                               BP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that the indigenous people receive
                               culturally appropriate social and economic benefits.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    This project is classified as Category B because it is likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. There might be occasions
                                  when the RR team decides to engage in small-scale civil works such as construction or rehabilitation of latrines in schools, start fisheries, small-
                                  scale drinking water supply, construction of improved stoves, etc. However, these are envisaged to be limited in numbers, of very small scale,
                                  localized, and none are expected to have irreversible impacts. To prevent, minimize, mitigate and improve environmental performance,
                                  ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’ is prepared for each of the sub-projects envisaged under the project
                                  which includes parameters for environmental assessment.

                                  The construction-related activities will also be limited mostly to existing school buildings, health posts, etc., thus the purchasing of additional

                                                                                                                                                                               Page 2 of 4
                           land for the project is not envisaged. Any additional land required under the Project will be voluntarily donated. The 'Environmental and Social
                           Management Framework' includes provisions assuring that any voluntary land donation is adequately recorded and a verification mechanism is
                           in place to monitor (and report) any violation of commitment by the government to only use voluntary land donation.

                           The project triggers OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous People (IP). While the whole project has been designed to benefit vulnerable groups, including
                           the IPs, it is not ex-ante whether the wards where the program will be implemented coincide with those where there is a significant presence of
                           IP groups. To ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and these groups are able to access project benefits

                           which are also culturally appropriate social and economic beneficial, the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management
                           Guidelines’ developed for the project includes measures for these vulnerable groups and women which will help mitigate these risks and
                           impacts, and enhance project benefits to these groups.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            There are no expected indirect and/or long-term impacts of the project.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            Given the nature of this project, only small scale infrastructure works, if any, are being considered. Further, the project addresses some key
                           equity issues directly in the project components, implementation arrangements and results framework. Thus, no overall project level
                           alternatives were considered.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            To ensure that any adverse social and environmental impacts are avoided or minimized, an 'Environmental and Social Management
                           Framework' has been prepared for the project which include measures to mitigate the risks and impacts of the project, and also incorporates
                           activities and processes for public consultation and participation, monitoring mechanisms, grievance redress, and measures to enhance project
                           benefits to communities, including vulnerable groups, through the design and implementation of sub-project activities.

                           For each of the 11 possible sub-projects envisaged under the project, ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’
                           are also prepared which include parameters for environmental assessment and vulnerable communities (including IPs), and also measures to
                           mitigate the environmental and social risks and impacts of the sub-project activities.

                           The implementing agency, the Ministry of Local Development (MOLD) has extensive experience in implementing Bank-led projects. Further, at
                           the regional level, the Local Governance and Community Development Program (LGCDP) cluster units that is responsible for districts where
                           the project will be implemented, has been planning and implementing the Asian Development Bank’s safeguard policies, which are closely
                           aligned with those of the World Bank.

                           However, depending on the expertise available within the Project Management team at the MOLD set up for this project, and the coaches and
                           RR teams at the local levels that will be responsible for incorporating safeguards measures in the work plans for the sub-projects, orientation
                           trainings might be required for the team.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            The 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' developed for the project and the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and
                           Management Guidelines’ for the sub-projects will be shared by the Ministry of Local Development with all concerned institutions, government

                           agencies, and civil society organizations at the national, regional and local levels. Further, at the local level, consultations will be held at the
                           Ward Citizen Forum, and the Rapid Results (RR) team selected at the ward level will incorporate relevant elements/aspects from the framework
                           and the guidelines while setting up targets and preparing a work plan for attaining the nutritional outcomes, mobilizing the community, and
                           monitoring and evaluating results.

                           The draft 'Environmental and Social Management Framework' and the ‘Environmental and Social Risk Screening and Management Guidelines’
                           will be uploaded on MOLD’s website prior to April 20, 2012, to invite comments from relevant stakeholders. The final guidelines will be
                           uploaded prior to negotiations. The framework and the guidelines will be disclosed in Nepali and English by the MOLD, and in English at the
                           World Bank’s InfoShop.
