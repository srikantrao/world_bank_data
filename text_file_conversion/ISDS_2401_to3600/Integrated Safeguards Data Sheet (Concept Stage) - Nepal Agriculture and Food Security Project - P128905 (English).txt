                              The proposed Project Development Objective is to enhance selected aspects of food and nutritional security in pilot areas. Food security will be
                              enhanced through improved food availability made possible by increasing productivity of agriculture (crops, livestock and fisheries). Nutritional
                              security will be enhanced through improved nutritional status of adolescent, pregnant and lactating women and children under two years of age.
                              Finally, the project areas will lie in the mid- and far-west regions of Nepal.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project is based on grant proposal submitted by the GoN for funding under the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program
                              (GAFSP). The proposal was approved by the Steering Committee of the GAFSP and awarded a grant amount of US$ 46.5 million.

                              Overall Design: In order to achieve its PDO, the project will seek to address the inter-locking problems in the project through following coordinated
                              interventions: adaption (customization/validation) and release in specific agro-ecologies of relevant on-the-shelf technologies to boost productivity
                              and climate resilience of agriculture; enhancing local availability of improved seed and livestock breed; supporting farmers to adopt improved
                              management and husbandry practices and use modern inputs; improved water conservation and use, including for domestic purposes; support for
                              local infrastructure and value-chain development; enhancing livelihood options for wage labourers and landless farmers; increasing access to
                              protein and micro-nutrient rich foods; use of nutritional supplements and behaviour change communication. Accordingly, the project will have four
                              technical components.

                              Component 1: Technology Generation and Adaption: This component will support the PDO by adapting and making available for project farmers
                              the technologies and management practices that will increase yields and production intensities of crops and fish. It will address one of the major
                              constraints to agricultural growth in the project area which is insufficient supply of locally relevant technologies and practices. There will be two
                              main sub-components: (i) technology generation/adaption for crops (viz., rice, wheat, maize, pulses, oilseeds etc); and (ii) technology generation/
                              adaption for fish. Activities to be financed under this component include: evaluation and release of new/improved crop varieties; brood stock
                              improvement and development of pure breed lines in fish; development/refinement of location-specific crop husbandry practices; adaptive trials of
                              aquaculture technologies; and training and capacity building. The main expected outputs from this component will be release of improved crop
                              varieties and improved production packages for crop and fish production.

                              Component 2: Technology Adoption: This component will support the PDO by enabling farmers in the project area to sustainably adopt improved
                              agricultural (crops, livestock and fisheries) production technologies and management practices. This will enable them to increase productivity as
                              well as intensify and diversify agricultural production. The component will do so by enhancing farmers knowledge and skills base, improving
                              availability of quality seed/breed at farmersevel, improving on-farm water management, strengthening extension-farmer linkages and augmenting,
                              as appropriate, their productive assets and social capital base. The component has five sub-components: (i) crop production support; (ii) fish
                              production support; (iii) livestock production support; (iv) local water conservation and management; and (v) group/community productive assets
                              and activities. Activities to be financed under the project include: (a) mobilization, training and empowerment of farmers groups; (b) strengthening
                              MOAC's extension capacity and outreach to farmers; (c) demonstrations and adoption support (through provision of key inputs) for farmers; and
                              (d) demand-driven productive assets and local infrastructure.
                           Component 3: Livelihood Enhancement: This component will support the PDO by enhancing cash (earned) income and diversifying the livelihoods
                           base of the poorer (landless and marginal farm) households. This is the most robust way of increasing food and nutrition security of these typically
                           food-deficit households. The component will seek to increase the return to labor of these households by either upgrading their skill or capital stock,
                           or enabling them to diversify into some micro-enterprise or trading role. There will be three sub-components: (i) skill enhancement, along with
                           provision of complementary tools/assets as appropriate; (ii) agriculture value-chain development (including relevant capacity building in handling,
                           packaging, grading, processing and marketing); and (iii) (group) micro-enterprise development, typically in conjunction with a relevant service

                           provider or support organization.

                           Component 4: Nutritional Status Enhancement: This component will support the PDO by improving the nutritional status of women at conception
                           and during pregnancy (in terms of maternal BMI) and of children aged 6 to 24 months (in terms of underweight, wasting and stunting). There will
                           be three sub-components: (i) increasing use of micro-nutrient rich and animal protein foods (relevant complementary production support activities
                           will be undertaken under Component 2; this component will create awareness and demand in terms of prioritizing domestic production and
                           consumption decisions - for these foods); (ii) service delivery of multiple micro-nutrient powders to children 6-24 months of age, integrated with
                           community Infant and Young Child Feeding; and (iii) behavior change communication on optimal maternal, infant and young child feeding and
                           care.

                           Component 5: Project Management: This component would finance all aspects of project management at the national and regional levels,
                           including M&E. Activities to be financed under this component include: (i) establishing and supporting project units at the overall and regional
                           levels; (ii) specialized support services relating to key activities such as independent external M&E, external audit, financial accounting and
                           procurement; and (iii) training of staff involved in project implementation.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will primarily focus on seven districts of the mid-western and far-western development regions namely Dolpa, Jumla, Humla, Kalikot,
                           Mugu or Karnali zone, Bajhang and Bajura. They have been selected for project implementation as most lagging areas by all indicators of
                           development in the country. The proposed project districts are remote and rural relatively untouched by modern development, industry and
                           infrastructure: thus there is little pollution of land, water and air. These are all hilly/ mountain districts, which have diverse climates and rich in
                           ecological diversity and biodiversity including agro-biodiversity, medicinal herbs/ NTFPs; as well as are physically fragile susceptible to landslides
                           and erosion risks. There are protected areas in the region and good forest cover. Traditional subsistence agriculture, which is largely organic, is
                           the dominant livelihood activity.

                           As apparent at the PCN stage, the project will support small scale physical infrastructures for increasing agriculture yield and linking with markets
                           (micro-irrigation, rain-water harvesting, short link/access roads etc), storage facilities, improved/new variety of seeds and technology, new breeds
                           of livestock, micro-enterprises for improving livelihood, soil & nutrient and water management activities.

                           As the activities are likely to be small scale and dispersed in wide areas, it is envisaged that potential social and environmental impacts are likely to
                           be small and limited: hence the project is expected to be Category B.

                           Safeguards policies that are likely to be triggered include: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment; OP 4.09, Pest Management; OP/BP 4.12,
                           Involuntary Resettlement; and OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous People. OP/BP 4.12 is triggered as a precautionary measure in connection with possible
                           need for additional land and resettlement during the construction of small scale physical infrastructures; rehabilitation of local irrigation

                           infrastructure, rainwater harvesting, etc; construction/upgrading of storage facilities, research facilities and farmer service centers; rehabilitation of
                           community infrastructure including for improving rural access, postharvest management, marketing, etc; and infrastructure support for the
                           establishment of collection centres. OP/BP 4.10 is triggered to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that
                           IPs receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits. Similarly, since, control of disease and pests is one of the activities that would be
                           undertaken under the project, Pest Management (OP 4.09) is also triggered.

                           In addition, since it is possible that some of the activities are dependent on resources from natural habitats and forests, and/or may use water from
                           rivers that flows to India (although quantity may be very small), International Waters (OP/BP 7.50), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04), Forests (OP/BP
                           4.36), are also triggered.

                           The specific locations of activities/ subprojects are not known at this stage. Hence, as part of project preparation, the MoAC will assess key social
                           and environmental risks, potential impacts, and accordingly develop a Social and Environmental Management Framework (SEMF) to mitigate
                           these risks and impacts. The SEMF will seek to provide guidance and procedures to identify, screen, and evaluate key social and environmental
                           risks. Based on the nature of risks identified, a Social and Environmental Management Plan (SEMP) and a monitoring plan will accordingly be
                           developed for each site/facility.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The main implementing agency for the project is the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MoAC). The MoAC has Gender Equity and
                           Environment Division: however the division may not have hands-on operational experience and expertise in addressing environmental and social
                           safeguard issues. However, the Ministry is implementing IDA supported PACT project: through this project safeguard awareness and capacity at
                           the district and entrepreneur levels within the PACT area are being strengthened through activities such as orientations, training and human
                           resources support. These will have to be complemented by further incorporating capacity strengthening measures.

                         Baseline survey/situational assessment:

                         The purpose is to establish credible baseline information to facilitate measurements of the net contributions of the project to sustainable
                         agricultural productivity and livelihood improvement of target households. The ➃ before-the project➃?➂?➃?➂?➃?➂?➃?➂ data/information is
                         important to determine the outreach and impact of the project. The survey should capture among others:

                         a.          The basic household level data, capacities (skills, education levels, literacy); assets (land holding, livestock, equipment, access to
                         irrigation/water ); details of crop and livestock production; household income and sources; patterns of migration and remittances; period of
                         food insufficiency, health and nutrition related indicators especially for pregnant and lactating women, children and adolescents. This will be
                         done with a view of different groups, particularly the poor and vulnerable groups.
