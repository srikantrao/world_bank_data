2. Project Objectives:

The project development objective is to demonstrate that local governments can successfully
apply national policies that promote integration of children with disabilities into the mainstream
education system.

3. Project Description:

The proposed project would integrate children with disabilities into their community hub-schools
and into community social activities. It would achieve this through local planning to apply
national policies for inclusion of children with disabilities and through 20 demonstration (pilot)
sub-projects to adapt mainstream schools, and to educate teachers and parents.

The 20 pilot sub-projects would support investments that appear in the district plans to improve
education of children with disabilities in a hub-school. The following investments would be
eligible for financing:




                                                 1
       Modification and refurbishment of school facilities to integrate children with disabilities
        for instance by construction of ramps for wheelchairs, modifications of doors, installation
        of hand rails, and modification of toilets.
       Engineering and architectural studies for the modification and refurbishment of school
        facilities;
       Supply of furniture, learning aids, software, and miscellaneous goods to accommodate
        the diverse needs of children with disabilities and to facilitate their learning;
       Teacher training on how to include and teach children with disabilities;
       Initial support to teachers from special education specialists;
       Parent training to help their children with disabilities to learn; and
       Community education on integration of children with disabilities into mainstream
        schools.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis

The sub-projects to be supported by the grant will be identified and screened during the
implementation stage and will be implemented countrywide based on demand for proposed
activities. Project activities will not be located in protected or culturally/socially sensitive areas.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

       The proposed project is rated Fl (Financial Intermediary) with primarily category C
subprojects but also possibly some Category B subprojects (rehabilitation of facilities).
       The activities supported by the project would trigger the World Bank's environmental
safeguard policy and procedures (OP/BP/GP 4.01) because of their potential environmental
impacts. However, no major environmental issues are anticipated in the project due to small size
                                                   2
and rehabilitation nature of the subprojects. The proposed project does not entail any new
construction. It would support rehabilitation of decayed community infrastructure such as
schools.
        The possible environmental impacts may be summarized as follows: (a) degradation of
the air quality, mostly through emissions from mobile sources of pollution, as well as the
emission of dust particles, as the result of construction activities; (b) noise due to the
rehabilitation activities; (c) dumping of construction wastes, accidental spillage of machine oil
and lubricants. All these potential environmental impacts are minor and could be easily
managed during the project implementation.
        The project would bring positive social impacts as the proposed activities would improve
social conditions for the disabled children.
        As all proposed activities are to be implemented within the settlement boundaries, the
sub-projects will not have an impact on wildlife and natural habitats and thus, OP/BP 4.04
(Natural habitats) is not triggered. There will be no impact on physical cultural resources, as
most of the subprojects to be supported are related to rehabilitation activities.
        The project will not support any activities that require land acquisition.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

       The proposed project is not expected to have any indirect or long term environmental
impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

       The project team has analyzed the alternative of no project. Without the project there
would be negative social impacts, - no improvements in the access of the disabled children to
mainstream schools.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

        The proposed project would be implemented by Moldova Social Investment Fund
(MSIF), which has already large experience in conducting project Environmental Assessments
and in ensuring implementation of environmental safeguards. MSIF employs experienced
managers and engineers who are capable of enforcing safeguard policies through application of
Environmental Guidelines. The Bank will supervise implementation of the EG during its regular
missions.
        A mechanism for screening and assessing potential negative environmental impacts of
the subprojects as well as developing mitigation plans was developed and implemented under
MSIF II. Details of the procedures to be followed for environmental assessments and mitigation
plans are described in the MSIF Project Operational Manual (POM) that was reviewed and
accepted by the Bank.
        Each proposed subproject would follow a preliminary environmental assessment based
on the World Bank’s Environmental Management Plan/Checklist for Small Works for

                                                 3
Building, Repair and Remediation that identifies potential issues and indicates the mitigation
measures to address them. Application of EMP-Checklist would then be used for subprojects’
detailed designs preparation, bidding and award of the works contracts, and, subsequently,
implementation of subprojects. Detailed design would include specific environmental provisions
with direct reference in the bills of quantities. The works contracts would define contractors`
obligations vis-a-vis the environmental mitigation measures during the construction.
        An evaluation of implementation of the on-going IDA-financed MSIF II project found
that environmental aspects are being implemented well overall

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

        During the implementation of MSIF II project there has been close cooperation with
various stakeholders. The EG were disclosed and consultations were held in the country.
Participation of stakeholders in setting safeguards mechanisms continued during almost 10 years
of project implementation.
