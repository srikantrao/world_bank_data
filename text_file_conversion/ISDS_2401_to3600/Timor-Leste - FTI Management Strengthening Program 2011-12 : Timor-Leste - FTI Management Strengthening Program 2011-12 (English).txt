To strengthen capacity and systems to effectively deliver education services and implement the

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
5.       The Management Strengthening Project (MSP) will support the Ministry of Education to
achieve the National Education Strategic Plan by: (1) building long term capacity to manage the
education sector, and (2) providing the Ministry of Education with supplementary short term
implementation and technical advisory capacity for its ongoing programmes funded by GOTL
and its donor partners. The project will continue and expand support for implementation of
donor funding with the aim of leveraging support from donors to support the service delivery
goals of NESP. The project will build on achievements and lessons learnt from previous
activities in the area of management support, including strengthened Ministry management,
planning and monitoring of support based on evidence. The project will contribute to a broader
Management Strengthening Programme aligned to all the NESP Management Reform Priority
Programmes which will be a focus for coordination by the Ministry of donors support. A Public
Financial Management Reform Matrix and Management Strengthening Action Framework will
be key tools for prioritising support. The following NESP Priority Programmes (PPs) will be
targeted by this project, with an aim to increase quality of budget expenditure and plan
Implementation to leverage more GOTL and donor funding:

 i)    PP 8: General management systems ensuring the implementation of the Strategic Plan.

 ii)   PP 12: Achieving planning and budget excellence.

D. Project location (if known)
Timor-Leste (national). Focus of project activities will be the Ministry of Education complex in
Vila Verde, Dili.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
Institutional capacity is limited but increasing. Inclusive Education, Policy Development and
Infrastructure standards capacity has all been developed in the Ministry of Education. A focus of
project support will be supplementing limited capacity to strengthen management of external
support according to participatorily defined management standards.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
   would be prepared: N/A

B. For projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS:
   08/19/2011
C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
   August - September 2011. This step is not expected by the Task Team to be necessary as the
   project is focused on management strengthening at the central Ministry level. The focus on
   management strengthening includes inputs chiefly of technical assistance and training. No
   safeguards are expected to be triggered and no physical investments are planned in the
   proposed project
