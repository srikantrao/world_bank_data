2. Project Objectives:

This carbon offset operation corresponds to the investments under IDA project P073089 and its
Additional Financing P111366.

The overall goal of this Carbon Finance project is carbon sequestration through municipal solid
waste management through composting. It is estimated that the overall project will generate on
average 83,700 metric tonnes CO2 equivalent per annum for the first 7 year crediting period.

3. Project Description:

The project will provide access to carbon markets to the National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA). The Composting projects are implemented by the individual urban

                                               1
authorities. Each of these compost projects is considered a CDM Programme Activity (CPA).
The urban authorities transfer their CER rights to the NEMA in lieu of the investments received
for the CPA. NEMA sells the CERs to the CDCF. The Memoranda of Understanding signed
between the urban authorities and NEMA has provisions for sharing of financial benefits
accruing from the sale of emission reductions. The NEMA is the Coordinating/Managing Entity
(C/ME) for all the CPAs under the Programme of Activities (POA), which currently includes
8 CPAs (except Mbarara, which is expected to be registered in early 2012). All 9 sites, as
described below, are included in ERPA.

The carbon project is a component of an investment project P073089 and its Additional
Financing P111366.There will be no additional investment for this carbon component.

Urban population has been increasing at over 3.8 % per annum in Uganda, with urban population
accounting for 12 % of the total population in 2002. One of the significant environmental
concerns of the growing urban areas has been the management of municipal solid wastes. So far
as disposal of municipal solid waste is concerned, the common practice in Uganda is to dispose
the wastes in landfills (controlled and uncontrolled dumpsites). These landfills generate and emit
significant amount of methane to the atmosphere. Through its activities the project recovers the
organic matter (80 % of the waste is organic in nature in Uganda) from municipal solid waste,
which degrades as compost and reduces considerably methane emissions.

Urban authorities (municipalities and towns) generating up to 70 tons per day (TPD) of organic
waste receive support to improve collection efficiency and process the wastes at existing landfill
sites. Selection criteria reflect considerations of scale (with towns generating 50-70tpd waste
over the next 5 years), collection capacity (with towns demonstrating ability to collect and
dispose of some of their current waste stream), land availability (having available a suitable site
of at least 8 acres in extent that is or could be licensed by NEMA), and political will and
commitment.

A total of 9 urban authorities (selected using the above criteria and due diligence fact-finding
inspections by the NEMA and the World Bank teams) participate in the project: Mbale, Mbarara,
Lira, Soroti, Jinja, Kabale, Mukono, Kasese, and Fort Portal. Each of the 9 town / municipal
councils handles from about 25 tons of waste per day up to 100 tons of waste per day, this
quantity can increase through improved collection and due to the urban population growth.
Based on a standard composting plant of 70 tons per day, typical waste handled would be about
25,550 tons per annum, resulting in the production of about 5,000 tons of compost per annum
and the generation in average of 8,370 ton of emission reduction per year.

The urban local body undertakes improvement of its waste collection systems within the
municipal area with National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) support. The wastes
collected are transported to the compost facilities, which, in most cases, are located adjacent to
the landfills/ solid waste disposal sites, where the wastes would usually be disposed off in the
absence of the program. The incoming waste is aerobically composted in a composting facility.
The facility is covered with a roof to avoid run-off and excess leachate generation due to
rainwater percolation through the wastes. The leachate from the waste is collected in a covered
tank and used for wetting the windrows. The mature compost is screened using simple manual

                                                2
sieving equipment, which would be upgraded as required in future. The compost produced is
used by farmers or municipal services, recyclables are removed and sold, and the rejects from the
process are disposed of at the landfills/disposal sites.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

Carbon generating activities are undertaken on licensed landfill sites of the following urban
authorities: Mbale, Mbarara, Lira, Soroti, Jinja, Kabale, Mukono, Kasese, and Fort Portal.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The Community Development Carbon Fund resources will help promote sustainable municipal
solid waste management in Uganda. Thus, the project is conceived and designed to have
significant positive environmental and social impacts.
The project will not result in any potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts.

The carbon offset operation corresponds to the investments under P073089 and no additional
investment will be needed. All necessary safeguards have been conducted under the parent
project and disclosed under the same.



                                               3
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

No negative long-term impacts are anticipated due to project activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

N/a

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

Strong capacity exists for safeguard issues - the project is managed by experienced technical
staff in the national environmental management agency, who deal with the national
environmental safeguards in their daily work, mainstream them as part of the core activities, and
have received the Bank safeguards training.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key stakeholders are the communities surrounding project sites. They are consulted in the
course of preparing safeguards instruments under the related Specific Investment Loan (SIL)
operation in accordance with the requirements of the Government of Uganda and the World
Bank. Additional consultations are held by the urban authorities with the following objectives:
(i) to ensure that stakeholder concerns are incorporated in project design and planning; (ii) to
increase public awareness and understanding of the project; and (iii) to formulate community
benefit plans with direct involvement of the communities.
