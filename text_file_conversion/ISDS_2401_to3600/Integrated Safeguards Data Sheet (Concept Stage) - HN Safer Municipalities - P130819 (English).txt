                           B. Project Objectives
                           This project aims to contribute to improvements in citizen security14 in Honduras by: (i)
                           strengthening capacities of national and local actors in violence prevention, and (ii) investing in
                           integrated approaches that address risk factors of crime and violence in selected urban municipalities.
                           C. Project Description
                           This project would consist of three components:

                           Component 1 – Institutional strengthening of national-level violence prevention institutions (approx.
                           US$1 million). This component would provide technical assistance (and some equipment) to
                           strengthen the capacity of three national institutions that are instrumental to the implementation of
                         the Safer Municipalities program:
                         � The Sub-Secretariat of Prevention: to strengthen its capacity to coordinate, mainstream, and
                         systematize the violence prevention agenda across the different sectors and levels of government –

                         via their coordination of the national “Safer Municipalities Program? and by serving as the Technical
                         Secretariat of the newly-created National Citizen Security Council – with the ultimate goal of
                         strengthening the link between municipal efforts and national policy.
                         � The National Citizen Security Council: to develop a national violence prevention policy and
                         generate agreements to support specific projects or priorities identified in municipal citizen security
                         plans. This Council’s membership includes all the main relevant ministries for prevention and the
                         government plans to add civil society representation. It will be headed by a presidential delegate with
                         the capacity to be a primus inter pares. This council has the mandate to promote greater civic
                         engagement in citizen security
                         issues through information and awareness campaigns.
                         � The National Violence Observatory: to improve its capacity to collect and analyze accurate and
                         reliable data at the national and municipal levels to promote evidence-based policymaking.
                         Municipal observatories in the targeted municipalities will also be strengthened or created,
                         emphasizing geo-referencing of crime and violence data, and carrying out victimization, attitude and
                         social cohesion surveys in hot spot communities, as well as basic infrastructure and equipment.

                         Component 2 – Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention at Municipal and Community Level
                         (approx. US$8 million). This component would strengthen the capacity of municipalities to design
                         and implement integrated crime and violence prevention plans, policies, and ordinances. Under this
                         component, two sets of activities would be financed: (i) technical assistance to targeted
                         municipalities in the development of integrated and multi-sectoral municipal crime and violence
                         prevention plans, policies, and ordinances; and (ii) a package of local investments identified in the
                         municipal crime and violence prevention plans that complies with a negative menu (which excludes
                         activities such as policing). This package will include the integrated delivery of evidence–based
                         crime and violence prevention interventions addressing the main risk factors identified in ‘hotspot’
                         neighborhoods. Interventions will combine small-scale community based infrastructure with a wide
Public Disclosure Copy




                         range of “soft? interventions related to social and legal services, and community mobilization. They
                         will give priority to at-risk children, youth, and women. Special attention will be paid to mobilizing
                         different groups in the community to participate actively in problem identification and solving,
                         building on the methodology developed by Barrio Ciudad. On the infrastructure side, possible
                         interventions include street lighting and paving of certain streets, recovery of abandoned spaces into
                         parks and playgrounds, and building or refurbishing of community centers and schools. On the soft
                         side, they could include parenting training, after school activities, job training for youth that includes
                         life skills and internships, mentoring, recreational activities, community conflictresolution and legal
                         aid. The integrated delivery of soft interventions at the community level will be defined during
                         project preparation, one of the options being considered is to rely on existing or new/rehabilitated
                         community infrastructure facilities to act as one stop shop centers. Importantly, this component
                         would also seek to link relevant national social safety net programs (such as Bono 10,000, Mi Primer
                         Empleo, as well as the JSDF Employment Generation grant) with eligible beneficiaries in the
                         targeted neighborhoods. Preliminary consultations and assessments have revealed that there is
                         capacity in the government, NGO, and private sector to provide services and investments needed to
                         implement an integrated approach. Barrio Ciudad project, for instance, was able to pull together a
                         rich set of social and infrastructure interventions provided by a diverse set of public and private
                         agents based on community demands. The Safer Municipalities project will build on the experience
                         gained by Barrio Ciudad and similar efforts done by USAID and other donors to identify and
                         organize upfront an improved model for provision of these services, taking into account
                           sustainability considerations after project ends. A more thorough capacity assessment is being
                           conducted as part of preparation which should inform the design of this model. While the integrated
                           approach proposed by this operation focuses on violence prevention aspects, efforts will be made to

                           complement it with the criminal justice component of IDB’s operation which will finance integrated
                           justice centers and community police stations in a number of municipalities.

                           Component 3 - Project Administration and M&E (approx. US$1 million). This component would
                           include: project staffing and management costs for the PIU in FHIS, and a robust monitoring and
                           evaluation system. Given that this operation supports the first phase in the roll out of the Safer
                           Municipalities Program, special attention will be paid during preparation to the development of a
                           strategy for monitoring and evaluation that allows the government to learn operational lessons about
                           what works and what doesn’t during project implementation.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the           safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           This project would be implemented in three municipalities in geographic areas with different socio-
                           environmental characteristics, which would meet the following agreed criteria: high homicide rates,
                           high poverty levels, and located in urban areas.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           Three implementing agencies have been indentified which will be responsible of project monitoring
                           and implementation: (i) the Vice Ministry for Prevention and Coexistence (within the National
                           Security Secretariat); (ii) the Fondo Hondureño de Inversion Social (FHIS); and (iii) Municipal
                           Governments. The Vice Ministry for Prevention and Coexistence will be in charge of the overall
                           institutional coordination, while FHIS will be the agency responsible to for overall project
                           implementation activities, including: technical assistance to municipal governments, procurement,
                           disbursement, accounting financial reporting, safeguards supervision, auditing, monitoring and
                           evaluation. Municipalities’ role in safeguards supervision will be determined during preparation.
                           FHIS has extensive experience managing social and environmental risks within the context of the

                           relevant Bank safeguard policies, as it has been the implementing agency for several Bank projects,
                           among these the Barrio Ciudad Project (P088319), which has financed some similar interventions to
                           the proposed project. This project has as safeguard instruments an Environmental Framework,
                           environmental manuals which could be used as basis for the safeguards instruments for the proposed
                           project, as well as a Resettlement Framework. FHIS also has an environmental unit with two staff.
