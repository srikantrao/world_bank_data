                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural
                           hazards and climate change impacts in Saint Lucia and in the Eastern Caribbean subregion.
                           C. Project Description
                           Component One: Prevention and Adaptation Investments (US$14 million)

                           This component would be designed to reduce physical vulnerability and pilot adaptive measures to
                           build resilience to current and future climatic changes both at the national and regional levels.
                         Activities to be financed would include a suite of civil works activities that would have national and
                         regional benefits, such as the following:

                         a)           Rehabilitation of Critical Bridges: The Government has identified four bridges (Grand
                         Riviere Bridge, Thomazo Bridge, Bonne Terre Bridge and Ravine Poisson Bridge) as priority bridges
                         based on the principle of greatest loss avoidance and a focus on rehabilitating damaged assets before
                         they fall to a level beyond repair;
                         b)       Riverbank Stabilization: The Marchand River flows through a highly urbanized area and
                         requires approximately 700 meters of riverbank stabilization and 300 meters of new riverbank
                         construction;
                         c)           Construction of Retaining Walls along the National Highway: Following Hurricane
                         Tomas, road embankments were cut off due to landslides along the national highways; Ten areas
                         remain highly vulnerable and given that the main National Highway is the primary road network, the
                         proposed slope stabilization works are a priority for the Government;
                         d)       Retrofitting of selected schools and community centers/emergency shelters;
                         e)           Small community-based disaster risk mitigation investments in highly vulnerable areas;
                         f)           Flood mitigation interventions at the international and regional airports and the Castries
                         and Vieux Fort sea ports. These investments would have regional benefits as the ports function as
                         regional infrastructure critical in the region's emergency response capacity.

                         In addition to the urgent repair and retrofitting investments identified above, a prioritization of
                         further vulnerability reduction and adaptation investments based on a multi-criteria evaluation would
                         be carried out. Baseline information on critical facilities and lifeline infrastructure in health,
                         education, transport and social safety sectors (including their characteristics and current condition) as
                         well as information on hazards and potential climate change impacts along with geospatial
                         information (i.e. data sets that include information of specific at-risk areas) would be collected. By
                         combining these sets of information and under integration of further criteria [ex: the importance of
                         the specific infrastructure in the respective sectors/system such as the health system or transportation
                         network], number of affected/beneficiary population, etc.), an additional set of mitigation

                         investments would be identified.

                         Component Two: Regional Collaboration Platforms for Hazard and Risk Evaluation,Geo-spatial
                         Data Management, and Applications for Improved Decision Making (US$5 million)

                         This component would finance a series of capacity-building, knowledge-building and technical
                         assistance interventions at the national and regional levels to support disaster risk management and
                         climate change adaptation. There are specific areas that have been identified as high priorities for
                         intervention. At the national level, activities would include, inter alia: i) enhancement of national
                         hydro-meteorological monitoring networks; ii) development of an integrated watershed management
                         plan for flood mitigation; and iii) technical assistance for the establishment of maintenance
                         monitoring systems that would integrate natural hazards and extreme events considerations for
                         bridges and public buildings.

                         In view of Saint Lucia' s leadership currently in the Eastern Caribbean on several disaster risk
                         management (DRM) related topics such as geospatial data management and sharing (GeoNode) for
                         disaster management and that some of the national priority interventions (e.g.: the establishment of
                         maintenance monitoring systems for bridges and public buildings) would be of strong interest for
                         replication in other countries of the sub-region, the following activities would be performed at the
                         regional level, i) facilitating regional collaboration including, knowledge sharing and learning
                         process to develop and enforce harmonized infrastructure codes, standards and methods for critical
                         public infrastructure and especially bridges; ii) building the regional capacity for assessment of
                         natural risks and integration of such assessment into policy and decision-making process for the

                         development of disaster risk mitigation and disaster response investments across sectors; and iii)
                         creation of a regional backbone technology infrastructure and collaboration mechanisms that would
                         allow countries and regional technical entities to collaborate on sharing of geo-spatial data for DRM
                         and other purposes  specific activities would include: data collection and establishment of data
                         sharing protocols and capacity building for generating and interpreting risk assessments.

                         Component Three: Adaptation Financing Facility (US$5 million)

                         This component would assist in the creation of a Climate Adaptation Loan Facility (CALF) to
                         provide readily accessible concessional loans to private sector entities, including firms, enterprises,
                         community groups and households for investments and/or livelihood activities that support climate
                         adaptation and/or disaster vulnerability reduction. Consultations conducted during the preparatory
                         phase of the PPCR (phase 1 PPCR) with private sector and civil society highlighted the need/demand
                         for financing options for private businesses, community groups and individuals to build resilience to
                         climate change. A feasibility study will be conducted to assess the market conditions, including a
                         demand and supply side analysis to determine current needs and financing constraints in Saint Lucia.
                         The study will provide the main inputs to decide on the most suitable design of the CALF (i.e. credit
                         line, matching grant).

                         The Saint Lucia Development Bank (SLDB) has been proposed by the GoSL as the financial
                         intermediary to implement the on-lending component. Preliminary financial management (FM)
                         capacity assessment conducted by the Bank during project identification has confirmed that SLDB
                         possesses adequate FM capacity. In accordance with Bank policy for Financial Intermediary
                         Lending/OP 8.30, a comprehensive institutional assessment would be conducted during preparation
                         to determine SLDB's eligibility as participating financial institution, and an institutional
                         development plan for SLDB may be developed, as needed, before the project's Decision Meeting.

                         Component Four: Emergency Recovery and Rehabilitation Mechanism (US$1 million)

                         Due to the high risk of a catastrophic event in Saint Lucia, a provisional component would be added
                         under this project designed as a mechanism that would allow for rapid response in the event of an
                         emergency. Following an adverse natural event, and subject to the Bank's satisfaction that a situation
                         of national emergency exists and the Government's declaration of emergency in accordance with its
                         national law, the contingent component would be activated and implemented following the rapid
                         response procedures governed by OP/BP 8.00. The component facilitates rapid re-categorization of
                         financing and additional financing request under streamlined procedures during an emergency,
                         should the Government so requests.

                         Preparatory work would be undertaken for the design of the component, including i) preparation of
                         an agreed preliminary emergency recovery Action Plan of activities; i) compilation of a positive list
                         of eligible critical imports/needs; ii) ToRs and contracts for technical services to support the scoping
                         and design of the emergency recovery and reconstruction subprojects; and iii) a list of firms (national
                         & regional) that have a demonstrable track record in emergency response activities related to the
                         anticipated nature and scope of those required.

                         Component Five: Project Management and Implementation Support (US$2 million)
                         This component would finance the provision of support to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) -
                         overseen by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, Planning and
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Social Security - to conduct overall project coordination, evaluation, supervision and
                         implementation, including: (i) the strengthening of the PCU's capacity to comply with its
                         responsibilities as will be set forth in the project's Operational Manual, including the hiring of
                         specialized staff, such as a financial sector specialist and a community/social development specialist;
                         and (ii) the carrying out of project audits and project studies, including performance reviews and
                         impact evaluations. In addition, staffing within the Sustainable Development and Environmental
                         Department, which would be the Project's technical advisory unit within the Ministry of Public
                         Service, Sustainable Development, Science, Energy and Technology would also be financed under
                         this component, including the hiring of a Climate Change Coordinator and a Civil Society Officer.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the               safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         Project works would be undertaken on the island of Saint Lucia. Works under consideration relate,
                         but are not limited to, the repair and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, possible new facility
                         construction, limited application of erosion control and new construction of river defense structures
                         to protect human settlement, and possible support for community-based small mitigation works
                         (slope stabilization, community drainage systems, etc.). Some of the project activities, including
                         riverbank reconstruction and slope stabilization, would entail relatively minor construction works
                         with some potential environmental impacts.

                         Saint Lucia shares similar disaster vulnerabilities with other OECS countries, including volcanic
                         eruptions and seismic activity, sea level rise, and changes in rainfall variability and storm intensity.
                         Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines share common hazard profiles for flooding,
                         landslides, storm surge and coastal erosion, and are the subject of the Disaster Vulnerability and
                         Climate Risk Reduction APL1 Program (P117871). Commonalities in hydro-meteorological
                         monitoring network data, watershed management practices, construction techniques and contractor

                         logistics will be applied as lessons learned from these related projects. Environmental management
                         programs and practices common to the sub-region will be evaluated and incorporated in safeguard
                         analysis and instruments in the Saint Lucia project (APL2).
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         The Project Coordination Unit (PCU), under the Ministry of Finance, would manage the project
                         activities. The PCU has managed several World Bank projects investing in public infrastructure,
                         including most recently the Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project (P125205). The PCU has
                         performed satisfactorily in the past and continues to perform well, as documented in the November
                         16-19, 2011 Support Mission to Santa Lucia. Previous performance of resettlement and
                         compensation of affected persons in past projects, such as the Second Disaster Management Project
                         (P086469), will be closely examined in the project appraisal stage as an opportunity to benefit from
                         lessons learned and to improve the design and implementation of the Resettlement Policy
                         Framework.

                         Management and coordination of all safeguard requirements are planned to be performed by the
                         PCU. During appraisal, the Bank will review the PCU's overall implementing capacity in view of the
                         proposed project, including an assessment of the safeguards management capacity. Given the broad
                         geographical coverage of the project, the proposed ESMF and institutional arrangements will provide
                         for systematic supervision, technical assistance, and strengthening of capacities to manage
                           safeguards as appropriate.

                           A review of past safeguards instruments used in Bank projects in Saint Lucia and of the APL1

                           project will be conducted during project preparation and addressed in the appraisal stage ISDS,
                           including the development and implementation of the Saint Lucia ESSAF (Environmental and Social
                           Screening and Assessment Framework) and RPF (Resettlement Policy Framework) that were
                           developed for the Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Project in 2011. Particular emphasis and
                           focus will be placed on the environmental and social management systems of the St. Lucia
                           Development Bank to evaluate if there are any gaps in the screening, assessment and supervision
