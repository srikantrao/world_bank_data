                              Project development objective: To support rural communities and producer organizations in increasing (i) the production of selected crops and
                              livestock species in selected areas of the Recipient’s territory; and (ii) the use of sustainable land and water management practices in climate
                              vulnerable ecosystems.

                              3. Project Description

                              Component 1. Provision of agricultural inputs is aimed at increasing access to seed and animal feed.
                              Component 2. Support to food production will finance basic infrastructure to benefit local communities, as well as productive assets needed to
                              enhance agricultural and livestock production and productivity to benefit producer organizations and women’s groups.
                              Component 3. Sustainable land and ecosystem management will support integrated issues of forest and biodiversity in the larger ecosystem
                              landscape related to agricultural expansion and vulnerability to climate change.
                              Component 4. Capacity building and institutional support to public services will complement Component 1, 2 and 3 and provide institutional
                              support to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, the Ministry of Pastoral Development and Animal Production, and the Ministry of Environment
                              and Fisheries, their related decentralized services, and Apex producer organizations.
                              Component 5. Project coordination and management will support project implementation activities, and the establishment and operation of an M&E
                              unit and communication mechanism.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   From the standpoint of environmental and social safeguards, the Project is classified as a Category B, because the potentially adverse
                                 impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas are assessed as being low. Potential negative impacts of the Project include
                                 the following: (i) depletion and deterioration of water supply; (ii) deterioration of soil quality; (iii) surface water and groundwater pollution risks
                                 due to increased use of pesticides; (iv) loss of vegetation and landscape transformation following the installation of infrastructures (pastures,
                                 irrigations schemes, rural roads, storage facilities); (v) risks of conflict between herders and agriculturalists; and (vi) risks to protected areas.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  The environmental and social impacts will be local and very limited, and specific mitigation measures have been defined in project ESSAF.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  N/A

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 4
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            An ESSAF has been prepared for the Project and addresses the following issues: (i) minimization of environmental degradation, (ii) protection
                           of human health, (iii) prevention or compensation of any loss of livelihood, and (iv) enhancement of positive environmental and social
                           outcomes. As stipulated in the ESSAF, the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will prepare and monitor implementation of Environmental and
                           Social Impact Assessments / Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), a Pest Management Plan (PMP), a Resettlement Policy
                           Framework (RPF), and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). The PCU will ensure the selection and the training of focal points on these plans.

                           Within the national PCU, a small Environmental Team (ET) consisting of an Environmental Specialist (ES), a Monitoring and Evaluation
                           Specialist, and an Accountant will be established and charged with coordinating the implementation of Component 3. The ET will prepare
                           annual work plans for the activities to be financed under Component 3 of the Project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            The Project will target three main groups of beneficiaries. (i) Emergency relief activities to be financed under Component 1 will benefit
                           agriculturalists and herders in zones heavily affected by drought. (ii) Micro-project financing to be provided under Component 2 will be made
                           available to selected communities in vulnerable areas in the Sahelian and Sudano-Sahelian zones of the country. (iii) Sub-project financing to
                           be provided under Component 2 will be made available to eligible producer organizations and women’s groups in the same target areas.
                           Procedures used to identify, prepare, evaluate, and approve micro-project and sub-project proposals will include mandatory screening
                           measures designed to ensure compliance with all applicable safeguards policies. These procedures will be publicly disclosed in Chad and well
                           publicized to the target communities, including all aspects relating to safeguards. In cases where compliance with safeguards policies
                           engenders additional costs, these will be fully budgeted in micro-project and sub-project proposals.
