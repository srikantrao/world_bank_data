                              The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to: (i) upgrade and rehabilitate the secondary and local roads network; and (ii) increase the capacity
                              of the Roads Department and the local governments to manage the road networks in a cost effective andsustainable manner.

                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed project follows the successful implementation of the ongoing Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP). Additionally, Government
                              is continuing to review more efficient options to manage the road network and is especially interested in piloting new methodologies that have
                              worked in other countries. Under the ongoing Kakheti Regional Roads Investment Project (KRRIP) Government is applying project savings to pilot
                              a Design-Build contract on a secondary road. Government requested the Bank for support to also pilot the introduction of performance based
                              contracts (PBC) for a selected road network in Kakheti Region. The aim of such a PBC would be to use contractors to implement economically
                              efficient management of the condition of a road or network over an extended period of time (typically 5 to 7 years). The economic efficiency of the
                              PBC is achieved by transferring construction responsibility and the respective risks to the contractor. Through the PBC, the contractor bears the
                              risks associated with poor design and construction. By transferring these risks, the PBC contractor is expected to make optimal decisions
                              regarding the maintenance and construction quality.

                              The PBC contractor would be responsible for ensuring the road remains in a specific condition irrespective of the type of work (construction,
                              rehabilitation and/or periodic maintenance, as well as routine maintenance) over a medium # long period of time. The service condition at which
                              the road should be maintained at is agreed in advance with the contractor deciding what to do when and where. Payments would be made as
                              fixed monthly sums provided that the service conditions are met. The transfer of responsibility leads to more efficient management of the road
                              assets and application of modern construction and optimal road maintenance practices. The application of the PBC in other countries has
                              demonstrated that this can achieve up to 30 percent cost reduction while significantly improving the service condition of the road network over the
                              contract period.

                              The selection of the road network to be contracted under the pilot PBCs would be governed by two considerations: (i) the road network should be
                              long enough to provide sufficient contract volume; and (ii) the network should include a mix of roads in good, fair and poor condition to allow
                              contractors to apply the variety of civil works ranging from rehabilitation to routine maintenance of some parts of that network.

                              Based on the above considerations and the Government program to develop Kakheti region, part of the eastern Kakheti region road network has
                              initially been selected to be contracted under the PBC. The network will be about 200-250 km long and includes roads in good, fair and poor
                              condition to provide scope for innovations in road maintenance and rehabilitation.

                              The proposed project would consist of two components:

                               Component 1: Secondary and Local Road Improvement (about US$ 56 million). This component will include the rehabilitation of roads in the
                              same manner as under the ongoing SLRP (about US$36 million to 150 km of selected roads throughout the country) and a pilot PBC for about US
                              $ 20 million to finance about 200 km of secondary and local roads of eastern part of Kakheti region.
                            Component 2: Capacity Building and Advisory Services (about US$ 2 million). The aim of the component would be to increase the Roads
                           Department (RD) capacity in managing PBC and will also build on the good progress made with institutional strengthening supported under the
                           ongoing transport projects. The component will include; consultancy services to the RD to assist it in the implementation and monitoring of the
                           PBC contract performance, ad hoc individual advisors to the RD on as needed basis. The details of the advisory service will be identified at the
                           project appraisal stage.

                           The project will cover the selected sections of roads throughout the country (Component 2), while implementation of its Component 1 will be
                           confined to the eastern part of Kakheti region, Georgia.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           RD of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Regional Development will be the implementing agency for the project. RD has ample experience in
                           carrying out environmental category A and B operations financed by the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral institutions, though its in-
                           house capacity of safeguards supervision is still not sufficient and making proper arrangements for supplementing it with external consultant
                           services would be critical for achieving satisfactory performance. Provider of such consultant services must be well qualified, have sufficient budget
                           for regular site visits, and be given clear reporting responsibilities.
