                              B. Project Objectives

                              To strengthen capacities of the East African Community partner states to harmonize medicines registration systems and to improve efficiency and
                              enhance transparency in medicines registration.

                              Promoting the harmonization of medicines registration in Africa as a means to increase access to safe, effective, and good-quality essential
                              medicines is an integral part of a well-functioning health system and therefore has a strong strategic fit with the health systems strengthening

                              (HSS) focus of the Bank. Furthermore, there is a strong economic justification to be made as harmonizing registration systems and protocols
                              across several countries helps in reducing inefficiencies. This is expected to promote growth of local pharmaceutical industry and make the region
                              more attractive for potential foreign investors/manufacturers.

                              The success of the AMRH initiative is expected to result in a continuum of change, starting with the use of harmonized protocols by the countries
                              and gradually moving towards a system of mutual recognition by countries within the regional economic block. Finally, it could result in a broader
                              harmonized regulatory environment that extends beyond the EAC to other RECs in the African region.

                              C. Project Description

                              To achieve the development objectives, the proposed project has two components:

                              a)        Regional Coordination and Capacity Building for Medicines Regulatory Harmonization (USD 5.80 million): This activity will be led by the
                              EAC and includes the establishment of t regional steering Committee, project coordination team, regional technical working groups, regional
                              capacity building at EAC level and support to country focal points for developing harmonized protocols for medicines registration and GMP
                              inspections. The intermediate outcomes will include harmonized guidelines, standard operating procedures and manuals by 2012, and the
                              establishment of the EAC Commission on Medicines and Food Safety by 2015. The activities supported will include, regional workshops/meetings
                              and incremental operating costs at the EAC level but most of the funds are expected to be used for the direct benefit of the NMRAs in the EAC
                              countries

                              The EAC will contract an ICT consulting agency to undertake a comprehensive systems requirement study for medicines registration at the
                              national and regional levels, and to develop a national and regional web- based data management information system for effective sharing of
                              information on medicines registration by 2013. Countries are expected to start using the information management system for medicines
                              registration from 2014.

                              b)         Institutional Development and Strengthening of National Medicines Regulatory Authorities (USD 4.2 Million): The support to NMRAs will
                              be based on the institutional assessments undertaken by NEPAD and WHO. The project will support additional staff for newly established NMRAs
                              and training of staff in areas of project management (25); quality assessment and safety of medicines (24); GMP inspections (24); and
                              assessments and exchange visits for regulatory staff within and outside the region. The project will also support twinning of newly established
                              NMRAs with existing NMRAs in the region including implementation of quality management systems as well as internal and external audits to
                              enable a number of the NMRAs to achieve ISO certification in quality management system by 2015.
                              The activities supported include personnel, training, consultant support, supply of ICT equipment and software, ISO certification, country level
                              workshops and meetings. The project will support appropriate ICT hardware and software procurement, consultant support including licensing,
                           maintenance and training at NMRA and EAC levels and any required capacity building activities. It is expected the NMRAs will be using a common
                           information management system for medicines regulation from 2014 onwards.
                           Among participating NMRAs, the project will support the development of regional centers for regulatory excellence s covering areas such as
                           Quality Management Systems, ICT, Registration, Pharmacovigilance and GMP. It is expected that from 2013, these centers of excellence will
                           serve as training facilities for in-service training of the regulatory staff and help the countries to move toward effective implementation of the mutual
                           recognition policy frameworks and guidelines.
                           The project does not support any civil works, nor does it involve medical waste, and thus there are no adverse environmental and social impacts.

                           Also, there is no land acquisition/involuntary resettlement in the project, nor will project activities lead to restrictions of access to resources or
                           livelihoods.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be implemented in all five EAC countries, namely Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.


                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Capacity is limited but the project will not have any major safeguard issues.
