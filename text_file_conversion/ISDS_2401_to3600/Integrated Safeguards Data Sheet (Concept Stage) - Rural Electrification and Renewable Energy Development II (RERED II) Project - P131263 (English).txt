                              B. Project Objectives

                              The proposed project development objective is to increase access to modern, reliable energy by households and enterprises in rural areas through
                              renewable energy and improve the response capacity of the borrower in case of an emergency.

                              The proposed project takes a holistic approach to improving the quality of life and livelihoods of rural households by providing access to electricity
                              through renewable energy and cleaner cooking fuels and cooking methods. This would be achieved by leveraging the capacities of the private
                              sector and NGO communities, while the GOB would be playing an essential market-enabling role.

                              By extending access to electricity and to modern energy services, the proposed project would contribute to improving livelihoods particularly of
                              rural women. Access to modern energy services can play a catalytic role in enhancing the development of productive activities and can increase
                              the impact of social programs. As it stands, lack of access to modern energy services represents a lost opportunity of income generation for
                              women and limits their overall participation in community activities. The lack of access to modern energy services also means that health facilities
                              are rudimentary; assistance during childbirth is basic and occurs in poorly lit environments with candles or kerosene lamps with virtually no modern
                              health equipment. This results in high infant and maternal mortality that can be largely prevented.

                              C. Project Description

                              In support of the vision of the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) of providing universal access to electricity by the year 2020, the proposed project
                              would support the Solar Home Systems (SHS) and mini-grid options for providing access to electricity in areas where grid electricity is difficult,
                              expensive, and will take years to reach. In continuation of the Bank support to the successful SHS program of GOB, the proposed project would
                              extend support for another 550,000 systems following the same model and institutional arrangement as has been proven successful under the on-
                              going Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development (RERED) project.

                              The proposed project would also support GOB’s efforts of implementing renewable energy based mini-grids through the private sector in rural
                              areas as stipulated under the Remote Area Power Supply Systems (RAPSS) guidelines. The RAPSS component would be based on the least
                              cost option (solar photovoltaic, biomass gasifier etc) for the consumers building on the lessons learned from the pilots supported under the on-
                              going RERED project. Providing grid-quality electricity from renewable energy sources in the RAPSS areas will serve the commercial needs of the
                              rural markets and small enterprises, where the potential consumption of electricity is much higher than the basic lighting and electricity needs of a
                              typical rural household that could otherwise be met by SHS. Identifying areas where such mini-grids are the least cost option, GOB plans to offer
                              licenses through a competitive process for owning and operating the RAPSS schemes.
                               The proposed project would contribute towards increasing access to modern energy by scaling up adoption of more efficient cook stoves. The
                               proposed household energy component would build on activities currently being undertaken by a number of NGOs and aims towards a scaling up
                               of improved cook stove production, dissemination, and sustained use. The proposed component would include: (i) awareness raising and
                               community outreach, to ensure potential users are aware of the fuel saving and health benefits of higher performing cook stoves (i.e improved
                               cook stoves and possibly advanced cook stoves in urban areas); (ii) research and development to enhance product quality, performance, safety
                               and durability; (iii) setting up of performance standards, labels and testing facilities; (iv) design of an operational funding facility to support initial

                               capital costs for large-scale stove production and distribution facilities; and (v) development of innovative and pragmatic funding procedures to
                               attract new players into the sector, capitalizing on carbon finance and using a blend of loans and grants.

                               In addition, the proposed project would support implementation of the second phase of the Compact Fluorescent Lamp (CFL) component with the
                               objective of introducing more efficient energy consumption.

                               Finally, the proposed project would provide continued technical assistance for sector reform and capacity building.

                               Given the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters, the proposed project would include a contingent component with zero allocation to allow for
                               the flexibility of a rapid response in the event of an emergency. Should an emergency occur, the proposed project would finance public and private
                               sector expenditures on a positive list of goods, both domestic and imported, required for the Borrower’s emergency recovery program.

                               D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The SHS and RAPSS components of the proposed project would be implemented in rural areas where grid electricity is difficult, expensive, and
                               will take years to reach.

                               E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                               The main implementing agency Infrastructure Development Company Limited (IDCOL) has an environmental consultant overseeing the
                               environmental issues (mainly battery recycling of the SHS program). An Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was adopted
                               under the on-going RERED project that required measures to strengthen the capacity of IDCOL on environmental and social management. Some
                               steps have been made by IDCOL for establishing an Environment and Social Safeguards Management Unit (ESSMU) and a full-fledged unit is
                               expected to be established by June 30, 2012.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and their timing1
                                  should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:




                         1 Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the InfoShop and (ii) in country, at publicly accessible locations and in a
                          form and language that are accessible to potentially affected persons.
                              Under the ongoing RERED project, an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been developed that will continued to be
                              used under the proposed project. The ESMF will be updated to include the two new components (the RAPSS and the household energy).

                              Discharge of lead sulphate in the local environment during recycling of used SHS batteries is a concern. The 2009 additional financing of the
                              RERED project required the battery manufacturers to adopt ISO 14001-2004 (Environmental Management Standard) and OHSAS 18001:1999
                              (Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems) certifications by June 2011 for proper handling of recycled batteries. Out of the 12
                              battery manufacturers supplying batteries to the SHS program, 7 large suppliers have already complied with the requirements and the rest are

                              expected to comply by June 2012. The battery recycling facilities (a total of 3) are also expected to meet the certification requirements by
                              June 2012. Several incentives have been introduced by IDCOL to ensure that the expired batteries are sent to the approved recycling centers
                              and not by backyard smelters. These include introducing: i) a refinancing scheme for customers to purchase replacement batteries so that the
                              old batteries can be easily replaced by the customers after the end of their useful lives; and ii) a mechanism for compensating the Partner
                              Organizations (POs) and the recycling centers for collecting the old batteries from the customers and send it back to the recycling centers. An
                              annual environmental audit would be undertaken to check compliance with the environmental safeguards measures outlined in the ESMF and
                              the report will be submitted to IDA by June 30 of every year.

                              To address the mercury in the CFLs proposed to be financed under the proposed project, a national guideline for safe disposal of CFLs is
                              being developed. Consultant appointment process will be initiated soon.
