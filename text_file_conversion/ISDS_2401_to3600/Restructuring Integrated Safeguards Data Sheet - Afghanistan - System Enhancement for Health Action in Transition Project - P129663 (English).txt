A. Summary of Proposed Changes
In its letter dated January 13, 2013 , the Ministry of Finance has requested an extension of the closing
date of the Health Results Innovation Grant Agreement (TF095961) in order to mainstream the Results-
Based Financing (RBF) schemes financed by the Trust Fund under the System Enhancement for Health
Action in Transition Project (SEHAT, P129663) which was approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on February 28, 2013. These RBF schemes have been financed by TF095961 and piloted
under the Strengthening Health Activities for the Rural Poor Project (SHARP, P112446) which closes
on September 30, 2013. The RBF activities to be financed by the trust fund will remain the same under
SEHAT, and the Grant was included in the costing of the SEHAT project. The Grant Agreement will be
amended to: (i) extend the trust fund closing date to June 30, 2018, in order to align it with the closing
date of SEHAT; and (iii) revise the name of the Project from SHARP to SEHAT. This will be the first
extension of the trust fund.
B. Project Status
The trust fund finances activities that aim to improve millennium development goals (MDG) 4 (to
reduce child mortality) and MDG 5 (to reduce maternal mortality) by implementing interventions that
provide performance payments for health workers in order to: i) increase key maternal and child health
outputs; (ii) further improve the quality of health care services; and (iii) ensure that patients and
communities are increasingly involved. The RBF scheme involves providing performance payments to
health facilities based on quantity and quality of health services. Payments for quality of services are
made both at primary care and hospital services. Results from HMIS data are promising both in terms of
quantity and quality of services. The preliminary data suggests a remarkable increase in utilization of
services in facilities implementing RBF (treatment facilities) as compare to those that were not
implementing RBF (control facilities). Although quality of health services at the hospital level has been
mixed, quality of health services in primary care has consistently shown improvements.

Explanation:
Given the Ministry of Public Health plans to mainstream the Results-Based Financing schemes financed
by TF095961 under the recently-approved System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition Project
(SEHAT), an extension of the Grant closing date is necessary in order to align the Grant Agreement with
the closing date of the Financing Agreement of the System Enhancement for Health Action in Transition
Project (SEHAT, P129663).
