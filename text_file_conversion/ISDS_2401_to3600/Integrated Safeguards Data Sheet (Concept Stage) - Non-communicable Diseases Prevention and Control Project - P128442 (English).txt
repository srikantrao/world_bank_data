                              detection, and management of selected non-communicable diseases.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed Project will comprise four components as follows:

                              1.          Component 1: CVD and Cervical Cancer Screening. This component would aim at improving prevention and management of (a) CVD
                              through increased screening coverage of the adult population over 40 years old, particularly those with hypertension and high cholesterol. Some of
                              the activities could include revision of CVD reference guidelines and protocols, training of PHC staff on CVD management, etc.; and (b) cervical
                              cancer through increased screening coverage of women at age 30-60. Activities could include revision of guidelines and treatment standards,
                              training of staff at PHC facilities and women consultations, provision of laboratory (cytology) equipment and supplies at secondary hospitals, etc.

                              The project will introduce a RBF approach (supply-side only) to support the PHC-based interventions with the intent of promoting quality, and
                              accountability for results. A more traditional input-based support will also be used for building capacity at the primary (primary health care
                              facilities), secondary (marz multi-profile hospitals), and tertiary levels (specialized hospitals such as oncology centers) and for project
                              management.
                              The Project will provide resources to increase bonuses to PHC service providers for the implementation of specific NCD screening programs.

                              Overall, it is expected that using a supply-side RBF approach for the screening programs will encourage PHC providers to promote and deliver
                              preventive care and create incentives to improve the coverage and quality of priority PHC services in the context of NCD prevention and control.

                              Component 2: Capacity Building at Specialized Hospitals. This component would aim at improving capacity in the treatment of selected NCDs at
                              specialized tertiary level hospitals. The project could finance major reconstruction of the Onco-Hematology hospital and the establishment of
                              tertiary level Radiation Treatment Center, provision of equipment, training of staff, revisions and development of clinical guidelines and treatment
                              standards. The possibility of developing a PPP scheme under this component is being explored.

                              Component 3: Health Promotion and NCDs Surveillance. This component would aim at reducing NCDs risk factors through increasing public
                              awareness on major risks associated with NCDs and through population based actions to encourage behavior change. The component would
                              finance public information campaigns, policy development on mechanisms that restrict marketing foods high in saturated fat, trans-fatty acids,
                              sugars and salt, anti-smoking measures. It would also finance risk factor surveys, training, etc.

                              Component 4: Project Management. This component would support day-to-day project management, including fiduciary tasks and monitoring and
                              evaluation.

                               Ministry of Health of the Republic of Armenia is an implementing entity for the project. Health PIU, established under it for the purposes of the
                               former Bank-supported operations, will provide day-to-day management of the project and will carry direct responsibility for due application of the
                               safeguard policies. Ministry of Health, acting through the PIU, has demonstrated adequate capacity in implementing safeguards measures as
                               planned under the ongoing Health System Modernization Project (APL2) and its Additional Financing. Safeguards rating of ALP2 are Satisfactory.
                               The Health PIU has one designated staff member, who provides oversight on the environmental compliance of the PIU-managed operations.
                               Quality of record-keeping on the environmental monitoring of physical works needs enhancement, which will be achieved through close
                               supervision and guidance on behalf of the Bank Task Team, especially at the early stage of the project implementation.
