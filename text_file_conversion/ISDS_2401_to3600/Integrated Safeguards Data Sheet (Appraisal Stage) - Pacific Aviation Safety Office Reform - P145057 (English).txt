                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                The project is focusing on institutional reform so there are no safeguard issues.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                                There are no potential safeguard impacts anticipated by the project.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                                Not appropriate.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                                Since no safeguard issues are anticipated, no measures are warranted.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                              on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                                The list of stakeholders include: (i) governments and their respective regulatory bodies
                              overseeing air transport; (ii) national agencies and authorities managing airport operations; (iii)
                              commercial and private aviation operators; (iv) population at large, whose livelihoods and national
                              economies depend in large part on air connectivity as a regional public good. Since there are no
                              safeguard issues, no consultations are necessary.
