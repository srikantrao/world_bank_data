B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
The proposed project development objective is to improve the commercial and financial
performance of the restructured utility EAGB through sector reform and private sector
participation in its management.

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The proposed project would have the following three closely linked components:

  #     Technical assistance for the transformation of EAGB (US$1.5 million). Technical
assistance mainly of a legal nature is needed to transform EAGB from a public-sector entity to a
limited liability company operating under commercial law. The reformed entity would remain
for the duration of the proposed project entirely state-owned.
 #      Retrenchment plan (US$6 million). The objective of the soon to be launched human
resources study (funded by the EEWRP) is to evaluate EAGB#s employees and identify those
who are suitable to continue working under the new entity. The study will set out the
circumstances, under which a contract of employment can or shall be terminated, the procedural
guidelines for termination in certain circumstances and ensure that termination criteria are fair
and consistently applied. The goal is to ensure that: (i) termination action is taken in the interests
of both EAGB and its employees; (ii) equitable practice and consistency of action are applied;
and (iii) legal principles are adhered to. The nature and content of the severance package are still
to be worked out. The estimated figure of US$6 million is based on preliminary consultant
reports, but it needs to be refined through the human resource study.

 #       Management contract (US$6.5 # 8.5 million). The next phase of the reform plan is to
attract a private firm to manage the reformed utility through a management contract for at least 3
years. IFC Advisory Services is helping the government in preparing this contract and attracting
a suitable private operator. It is expected that this contract would start in early 2013, with the
objective of improving the technical, commercial and financial performance of the new entity
until the point where further private sector participation can be achieved. Given the current lack
of profitability of EAGB and based on IFC#s experience with similar management contracts, it is
expected that the cost of the management contract would have to be supported by the
government through donor support.

D. Project location (if known)
The project is located in Bissau. The project does not include physical investments, so no
adverse environmental impact is expected. However, utility reform and the associate
retrenchment plan will need to be handled carefully. The goal of the retrenchment plan is to
ensure that: (i) termination of some employment contracts is taken in the interests of both EAGB
and its employees; (ii) equity and consistency are applied in compensating those employees
whose contracts may be terminated; and (iii) legal principles are adhered to. The exact nature
and extent of the retrenchment program are still to be worked out. The Bank team will seek
assistance internally from social development and legal specialists who are experienced in
handling such retrenchment plans in relation to state-owned company reform.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The Beneficiary#s operational safeguard capacity was recently strengthened under the recently
approved EEWRP. Nevertheless, the project will ensure that any direct or indirect
environmental and social adverse impact is mitigated.
