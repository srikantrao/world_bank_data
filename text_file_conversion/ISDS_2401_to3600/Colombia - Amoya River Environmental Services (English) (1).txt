2. Project Objectives

The development objective is “to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission from the power sector in Colombia through the promotion of an 80MW, run-of-
river, generation facility. Once in operation, the project is expected to displace an
estimated 1.87 million metric tons (Mmt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) up to
2012, and an estimated 4.56 Mmt CO2e up to 2019. It will also support an environmental
and social program that will contribute to improvements in the welfare of the community
in the area project, and the protection of the local environment?.


3. Project Description

The project consists on a run of the river power plant, with a nominal capacity of 80 MW
and an anticipated generation of 510 GWh/year. The turbines and other ancillary facilities
are being installed underground, along one side of the river, thus minimizing impacts on
the landscape. The power plant will be connected to the grid through an 18km
transmission line.

Moreover, the project will support the implementation of a Social and Environmental
Program that will contribute to improvements in the welfare of the community in the area
project, and the protection of the local environment. The Environmental and Social
Program will be financed with 20% of the value of the carbon credits.


4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis

The Project is located in the mid range of the Amoya River at 1,400 meters above sea
level. The project site is downstream of the National Park Paramo de Las Hermosas
where the headwaters of the Amoya River are found.

The Amoya Hydropower Project has an installed capacity of 80 MW and a design flow of
18 m3/s. The project will affect about 14 km of the Amoya river flow. The project will
maintain 1 m3/s as ecological flow downstream of the dam. This ecological flow is
expected to improve with the discharge of two small streams (3.3 m3/s). The project is
located in a narrow cannon covered with agricultural land and patches of riparian
vegetation. The conduction of water is completely underground (12 km) which has
reduced significantly the project environmental impacts. The powerhouse is also
underground. The transmission line is 18 km long and mainly crosses agricultural land.
The water of the Amoya river is very clean.

The Amoya River Environmental Services Project is located in the municipality of
Chaparral in the south of the department of Tolima at the Colombian Central Andes at an
altitude ranging from 800m to 4,500m. Chaparral has a population of 41,052 habitants,
51% of which live in urban areas. In the rural areas, the main activities are agriculture,
with the most important crops being coffee, sugar cane, corn, and cattle.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The agreed Environmental Program in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) (which
included activities to conserve and research the paramo ecosystems of Las Hermosas
National Park) is not going to be implemented as agreed before, mainly because the
ownership changed and the current Project Entity (PE) will implement directly their own
social and environmental programs. The new programs will be agreed with the
communities after a consultation process, and will be in accordance with WB operational
policies.

O.P. 4.01 - Environmental Assessment
The environmental impacts have been monitored and the environmental management
plan has been followed. The project has complied with all the terms of the environmental
license. Most environmental impacts which were identified in the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) are generated during the construction phase of the project. The main
impacts include increased levels of air, soil, water and noise pollution and solid waste.

O.P. 4.04 – Natural Habitats
The Amoya Hydropower project affected aquatic and terrestrial (forest land) natural
habitats for the construction the different components of the project. Aquatic
communities have been affected during the construction of the dam and will also be
affected during the operation of the project in a stretch of about 14 km. The project is
located 7 km downstream of the National Park boundary; the project does not affect
critical habitats. The project is implementing a very good aquatic monitoring program.


The following safeguards were not originally triggered in the planning phase of the
project, but need to be triggered now:
O.P. 4.10 – Indigenous People
In 2010, four settlements (El Escobal, La Virginia, Rionegro and Cimarrona Alta)
changed its legal status to be considered indigenous settlements by the Ministry of Justice
and Interior. Due to these new circumstances ISAGEN will have to provide the Bank
with an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) as per OP/BP 4.10. According to World Bank
Safeguard Advisory Team (SAT), the IPP should include a summary report of the
consultations made to the 4 indigenous settlements and the indigenous communities’
endorsement of the proposed IPP.

O.P. 4.11 – Physical Cultural Resources
The project had to intervene many sites along the Amoya River (terraces) to place many
tons of blasted rocks from the tunnel construction, and many excavations were needed for
the project construction. Some archeological artifacts were found in the area. ISAGEN
will have to provide the Bank with an updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP),
including an annex with a list of preservation and protection measures, and chance find
procedures.


O.P. 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
The construction of the power plant has led to relocation of five families, with whom land
and housing purchase arrangements have been made. The Project Entity (PE) ISAGEN
has handled the issue with adequate standards that are at the level of the Bank policy and
has provided the Bank with the resettlement compensation plan. See attached table.

The PE is building a transmission line with the total length of 18.6 km, requiring 20m
wide right of way throughout. The line goes through 79 properties. The construction of
the transmission line does not require relocation of houses or farms and does not entail
land acquisition. Even after the transmission line is completed, the area will remain in the
hands of the owners and they are free to continue all activities, apart from growing tall
trees and building permanent structures closer than 10 meters to the transmission line on
both sides. ISAGEN has finalized the process of negotiating the compensations with the
property owners. ISAGEN has reached legal agreements with 67 owners but 12 have not
accepted ISAGEN offers, and are currently been processed in the judiciary following the
country legal procedures. The Bank has received evidence of these agreements.

O.P. 4.36 – Forestry
The project needed to cut about 70 ha of riparian vegetation along the Amoya River in
order to build some of the project infrastructure. The Regional Environmental Authority
established several measures to compensate this environmental impact. ISAGEN will
have to provide the Bank with an updated EMP, including an annex with a description of
the Forestry Program (species to be protected, areas to be restored, strategy to follow with
the local communities, etc.).


O.P. 4.37 - Safety of Dams
This policy needs to be triggered since the project is building a dam and associated water
retention tanks to store about 9.000 m3 of water upstream of local infrastructure and the
project management camp sites. The project will install dam safety instrumentation and
will prepare an emergency and maintenance plan to comply with the policy. ISAGEN
will have to provide the Bank with an updated EMP, including an annex with documents
related to the maintenance and safety of the dam.


The updated EMP and the IPP should be developed by ISAGEN and delivered to the WB
team no later than March 31, 2012. The new ERPA to be signed before January 31, 2012,
will include a condition precedent of receiving a revision of Amoya's EMP and IPP to the
satisfaction of the World Bank Team


2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

Some permanent impacts are related to (i) the construction of the run of river dam which
has reduced the river flow of about 14km of the Amoya River which will cause long term
impacts to the river aquatic communities, and (ii) the creation of rock disposal sites along
the river banks. In the long term, the project will not change the current trends in land use
in the area.

The project demonstrates the sustainable use of the natural resources in the area,
illustrating the linkages between protection and sustainable use of the resource water for
power generation and the generation of a stream of revenues. In addition the project will
contribute to global sustainability by reducing GHG emissions from the power sector in
Colombia. Domestically, the project contributes to sustainable development by
promoting diversity in the infrastructure and sources of energy for the power sector and
increasing its security of supply while advancing an alternative mode to the expansion of
the sector.

At local level, ISAGEN signed a two-year agreement of US$53.500, with the Special
Administrative Unit of the National Natural Park System to support Las Hermosas
Natural Park, and committed to coordinate the implementation of environmental plans.
Moreover, ISAGEN agreed to invest 20% of the carbon revenues into the implementation
of Environmental and Social Programs which will be agreed with the community. This
program will contribute to improvements in the welfare of the community in the area
project and the protection of the local environment.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

Basis for Carbon Finance (CF) project selection. The project was selected based on rules
adopted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
parties for eligibility to the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and
it meets all of the eligibility criteria of the NCDF which will purchase the CREs. In
addition, the project supports the carbon finance portfolio strategy of achieving diversity
across countries and regions with emphasis on renewable energy.

Several alternatives were considered for the location of the plant and ancillary facilities,
rated capacity and technology. Alternative locations were rejected based on perceived
environmental risks, ease of implementation and hydrological (net hydraulic head)
potential. On the site, seven alternatives were examined for optimal location of the intake
and discharge points. A hydrology analysis has confirmed the generation potential. The
rated capacity was selected to take advantage of the maximum power potential. The
technology (Pelton turbines) was selected on the basis of reliability and documented
experience. The Feasibility Study conducted by GU, confirmed the viability of the
project.

ISAGEN is the sole owner of the project. ISAGEN's participation ensures a partner that
knows the electricity business in the country and has the financial clout to carry the
project to completion.


4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The environmental license was granted on December 16, 1999. It included a water
concession of 50 years. The construction permit was authorized on June 27, 2000. The
Environmental review was done and approved by CORTOLIMA. The Bank reviewed the
study. A social assessment serving as the basis for the social program was prepared. A
fraction of the carbon revenues will be used to finance the environmental and social
programs.


5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

ISAGEN has carried out a number of workshops and consultations in the region. The
local community has indicated a strong ownership and support to the project. The social
assessment was the basis for the social program and it was based on an exhaustive
consultation program with the local community.
