                              13.        The project development objective is to improve the design and implementation of the land registration system in the project areas. The
                              project area is defined as municipalities, villages and project committees in the Dura district and in an adjacent area of not less than 180,000
                              dunums.

                              B.         Project Beneficiaries
                              14.        Project beneficiaries would include (i) owners in the project areas targeted for systematic land registration (Dura and an adjacent area)
                              (estimated 80,000 owners ); (ii) the public using the services of the regional office targeted for improved service delivery (Hebron, Jericho, Nablus
                              and Jenin); (iii) businesses, lawyers and other private sector interests that require access to land registration information in the project areas
                              targeted for systematic land registration (Dura and an adjacent area) and in regional offices targeted for improved service delivery (Hebron,
                              Jericho, Nablus and Jenin) areas; (iv) PA institutions, included municipalities and the Ministry of Finance, who would benefit from the fiscal impacts
                              of the land registration process.

                              C.        PDO Level Results Indicators
                              15.       Achievement of the PDO will be measured using the following indicators: (i) increase in customer satisfaction with the services provided
                              by the PLA in the project areas; (ii) decrease in time required for land transactions processing in at least 4 PLA offices; (iii) reduction in costs of
                              SLR activities in the Project areas by at least 60% by end of Project.

                              3. Project Description

                              Component 1: Systematic Land Registration in Selected Areas (US$, 6.9 million, of which US$ 2.4 million financed by WBGTF, US$ 4.15 million
                              co-financed): This component will provide resources to the PLA to complete systematic land registration in at least 180,000 dunums of land in the
                              West Bank to be implemented in two phases, and to develop their capacity to further implement SLR in the rest of the West Bank. Phase 1 would
                              register 90,000 dunums of land in the Dura district over 24 months. Phase 2 would extend the systematic land registration process to at least an
                              additional 90,000 dunums of land in an area most likely in the southern West Bank. The possibility of including an area greater than 90,000
                              dunums will be reviewed towards the end of phase 1, depending on the work progress of the SLR process.
                              The procedures refined through the implementation of this Component would be institutionalized within the PLA for implementation across the
                              West Bank .

                              Component 2: Institutional Development of the PLA (US$ 0.63 million of which US$ 0.28 financed by WBGTF, US$ 0.35 co-financed): This
                              component will assist the PLA in effectively implementing its mandate and, in particular, managing systematic land registration, through
                              institutional strengthening, capacity building and provision of enabling technology.

                              Sub-Component 2.1: Institutional Strengthening of the PLA will assist the PLA in (i) conducting an institutional needs assessment; (ii) formulating a
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 3
                               corporate strategy and subsequent annual business plans, (iii) establishing a monitoring and evaluation system, (iv) improving service standards
                               through re-organization of work processes and training, (v) improving its public relations and outreach and (vi) formulating a human resources
                               development strategy; (vii) provision of subsequent required training.

                               Subcomponent 2.2: Implementation of Enabling Technologies will assist the PLA in i) preparation of an IT Strategy; (ii) development of software to
                               extend the computerized land registration system (CLRS); (iii) extension of the CLRS to four regional offices (Hebron, Jericho, Nablus and Jenin);
                               (iv) improvement of the land registration process; (v) a feasibility study for a Continuous Operation Reference System (CORS); and (vi) upgrading

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   N/A
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   N/A
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                   N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.

                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                                This project does not trigger any of the Bank’s safeguards policies thus the issue of project affected people consultations on safeguards
                              policies does not apply. The impacts of the project are expected to be positive and are expected to result in increased tenure security,
                              including for women, the poor and vulnerable. The main project beneficiaries include (i) owners in the project areas targeted for systematic land

                              registration (Dura and an adjacent area) (estimated 80,000 owners); (ii) the public using the services of the regional offices targeted for
                              improved service delivery (Hebron, Jericho, Nablus and Jenin); (iii) businesses, lawyers and other private sector interests that require access to
                              land registration information in the project areas targeted for systematic land registration (Dura and an adjacent area) and in regional offices
                              targeted for improved service delivery (Hebron, Jericho, Nablus and Jenin) areas; (iv) PA institutions, including municipalities and the Ministry
                              of Finance, who would benefit from the fiscal impacts of the land registration process. While not related to safeguards compliance, the project
                              nonetheless has an array of consultation and dispute resolution mechanisms. A Social Facilitation team, comprising of a lawyer, a social
                              scientist and a trainer, will provide public awareness, community training, information activities and advice throughout the project and in parallel
                              to the demarcation team. During the course of systematic registration, block representatives - one woman and one man - will provide advice to
                              the demarcation team, helping to ensure that owners or their representatives are honestly advising on the ownership and boundary information.
                              If disputes arise, the demarcation team will refer the case back to the settlement officer for mediation initially by a local village or neighborhood
                              land committee. If mediation fails, the case will go to the settlement officer for resolution according to the established procedure outlined in the
                              law and the settlement manual. If necessary appeals can be made to the settlement judge and then the high court as provided for in the law.
