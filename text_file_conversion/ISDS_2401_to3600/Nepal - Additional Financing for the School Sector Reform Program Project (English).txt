2. Project Objectives
The Development Objective is to increase access to and improve quality of school
education, particularly basic education (Grades 1-8), especially for children from
marginalized groups.

3. Project Description
The original project uses a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) to support the implementation
of the Government of Nepal's (GON) School Sector Reform Program (SSRP). The three
main components of the program are Basic Education, Secondary Education and
Strengthening Institutional Capacity. The program finances both the recurrent and the
development expenditures (investments) for school education.

 The proposed Additional Financing (AF) will support the GON in the implementation of
the seven year SSRP through the same three original components. The AF will also
support restructuring of the original project to address key quality, governance and
accountability challenges in the school system. The restructuring will include: (i)
introduction of Incentive Linked Indicators (ILIs) to partially finance the Annual
Workplan and Budget (AWPB) in order to further improve service delivery and enhance
key quality and governance and accountability outcomes; (ii) revision of the Results
Framework; and (iii) extension of the original project Closing Date from December 15,
2014 to July 15, 2016, in order to fully implement the governance and accountability
measures. The proposed Closing Date would align with the Government's 7-year
timeframe for School Sector Reform Program (FY2010-2016) and the GON's fiscal year.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The SSRP aims to provide access to, and equity in, quality basic education programs. The
program will be implemented nationwide. No irreversible or large scale environmental
impacts are foreseen. Civil works to be supported under the Additional Financing are
typically small scale and may include construction/upgrading of small school blocks or
new/additional classrooms or may be related to providing drinking water or sanitation
facilities. An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) was prepared by the GON
for the original project and is adequate to provide environmental guidance to the
Additional Financing as well.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The Additional Financing of the School Sector Reform Program will not be associated
with any large scale, irreversible environmental damage. Any environmental concerns of
the Additional Financing are related to the civil works. The type of civil works to be
supported remains the same as in the original project. These include construction or
upgrading of small school blocks or new/additional classrooms or may be related to
providing facilities such as drinking water and sanitation. These works are relatively
small-scale, spread in different parts of the country, have low environmental risks, and
are therefore categorized as Environmental Category B. Hence, the provisions in the
Environmental Management Framework (EMF) of the original project are adequate to
provide environmental guidance to the proposed Additional Financing.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No expected indirect or direct long term impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
No alternative proposals were feasible for the small scale infrastructure being considered
under this program.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The GON prepared an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) for the original
project and some training on the EMF has been carried out. Recently, the Department of
Education recruited a full-time dedicated Environmental Officer to provide country-wide
oversight on implementation of the EMF. The structural design of the two and four room
blocks consider earthquake risks. Water supply and sanitation facilities are provided if
they do not exist already. With support from the Department of Water Supply and
Sanitation, the quality of water supplied to schools is being checked. The review during
preparation of Additional Financing indicated that further effort is needed to fully and
effectively implement the EMF. For example, additional targeted orientations and
trainings on the EMF are needed. In addition, the DoE Environmental Officer and an
independent agency/person need to monitor the implementation of the EMF to ensure that
the School Improvement Plan incorporates environmental considerations. Finally, printed
copies of the EMF need to be disseminated to all stakeholders/ users, and each new
school block must use EMF environmental criteria for siting, planning, design and
construction.

 The Vulnerable Community Development Framework (VCDF) prepared under the
original project to ensure that the most vulnerable groups including girls, Dalits,
disadvantaged Janajatis, etc., benefit from the implementation and outcomes of the
project activities will apply under the AF. The VCDF was developed based on national
policies/strategies and the SSRP with the aim of meeting IDA's OP/BP 4.10 on
Indigenous Peoples (IP) and to ensure that there are repeated opportunities for free, prior,
and informed consultations specifically with IP groups, and more generally with other
marginalized and disadvantaged groups during program implementation. The VCDF has
been reviewed and remains valid for the AF. As in the parent project, there will be no
involuntary land acquisition under the program, and hence, the AF will not trigger OP
4.12 on involuntary resettlement. However, since there will be voluntary land acquisition,
a set of guidelines acceptable to IDA for such acquisition were prepared by the GON for
the original project. The same will apply for the Additional Financing as well.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The EMF has been shared by the Ministry of Education with other concerned institutions,
Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, and civil society. The Department of
Education has re-disclosed the EMF, the VCDP and the Framework for Land Acquisition
on its website. The EMF was translated into Nepali. The EMF was included in the
original project's Program Implementation manual. DOE will disseminate the EMF to
stakeholders including engineers / sub-engineers, district education officers, etc.
