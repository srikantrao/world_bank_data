                           B. Project Objectives
                           The objective of this project is to reform and strengthen Agricultural Advisory Services (AAS) in
                           accordance with FAAP principles towards increasing agricultural productivity and food security. The
                           expected outcome is more effective national AAS systems that are responsive to the needs of farmers
                           in their roles as producers, members of farmers’ organizations, consumers of agricultural inputs, and
                           marketers of agricultural outputs. MDTF resources will also support AFAAS to strengthen its own
                           capacity, governance and management systems.

                           AFAAS will use MDTF resources to build viable networks among AAS providers to significantly
                           reduce the isolation they have experienced over the last several decades and will foster partnerships
                           at national, regional and international levels between agricultural advisory services and other
                           institutions, contributing to sustained growth and transformation of agriculture. The capacity of
                           country-level advisory service stakeholders to determine their own priorities and to improve their
                           advisory service systems will be strengthened. AFAAS will also ensure that country-level CAADP
                           processes sufficiently involve advisory services providers in strategy development, work planning
                           and implementation, contributing to making these services more effective and relevant. A strategy
                           and mechanisms for ensuring the availability and accessibility of appropriate and up-to-date
                           knowledge on advisory services from a range of sources in Africa and worldwide will be formulated
                           and implemented.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           AFAAS headquarters in Kampala, Uganda, however, AFAAS will support the emergence and
                           strengthening of CF of AAS stakeholders at the country level. AFAAS’ membership includes North
                           African and Sub-Saharan African countries, and existing Country Fora include Benin, Malawi,
                           Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Sierra Leone. The project does not involve activities with

                                  The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                      No Bank Safeguard policies are triggered by this project, therefore no safeguard-related studies are
                                      envisaged.
