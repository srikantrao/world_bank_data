                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed PDO of this recipient executed technical assistance grant project is to enable China to
                           design a national carbon emissions trading scheme.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project is to be financed by a US$ 8 million grant from the Partnership for Market
                           Readiness and counterpart funds. The PMR is a grant-based, capacity building multi-donor trust fund
                           that provides funding and technical assistance for the collective innovation and piloting of market-
                         based instruments for GHG emissions reduction. Background on the PMR is provided in the Annex.
                         China participates in the PMR as an Implementing Country, and has developed its proposal with
                         support from the PMR, which was endorsed by the PMR’s governing body in March 2013. This

                         PCN requests the second step where the proposed project will be prepared by the NDRC Climate
                         Change Department based on the PMR proposal, following World Bank policies and procedures,
                         appraised by the Bank team and approved by the Bank’s Regional Vice President. A Trust Fund
                         Grant Agreement will be signed after approval.

                         Based on the endorsed Market Readiness Proposal for China’s national ETS, the proposed Project
                         components are:

                         Component 1: National ETS Scope and Coverage: The proposed component would support policy
                         research and analysis, technical studies, and workshops to develop proposals for (a) ETS inclusion
                         criteria and implementation plan and (b) covered greenhouse gases under the national ETS and
                         incorporating standards for enterprises and installations.

                         Component 2: National ETS Data Collection, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification Systems and
                         Registry: The proposed component will support policy research and analysis, technical studies, and
                         workshops to develop proposals for (a) a national ETS statistics system; (b) sector specific guidelines
                         on MRV of GHG emissions from installations; (c) a framework on relations between national and
                         local registries. This component will also draw on the project financed by the Norwegian
                         Government through the United Nations Development Program that will propose a national ETS
                         registry.

                         Component 3: National ETS Component Design: The proposed component will support policy
                         research and analysis, technical studies, and workshops to develop proposals for a national ETS: (a)
                         cap setting methodology and program; (b) an initial allowance allocation methodology; (c)
                         compliance mechanism; (d) price containment mechanism options; (e) offset mechanism, including
                         options for basic requirements for linking national ETS with other systems; (f) policy

                         recommendations on treatment of participants and trading products.

                         Component 4: National ETS Institutional Framework: The proposed component will support policy
                         research and analysis, technical studies, and workshops to develop: (a) policy recommendations for a
                         management system governing the national emissions trading market; (b) a basic legal framework for
                         the national ETS, including administrative rules; (c) a market oversight system plan, including scope,
                         designated authorities, targets and rules.

                         Component 5: Key Enterprise and Sector Topics for National ETS: The proposed component support
                         policy research and analysis, technical studies, and workshops to (a) assess barriers and propose
                         measures to facilitate inclusion of State Owned Enterprises in the national ETS; (b) propose scope,
                         cap setting methodology, MRV, and key supporting policies, regulations and mechanisms supporting
                         emissions trading participation of the power sector. State-Owned-Enterprises (SOEs) are special
                         enterprise groups with distinctive characteristics in China and the DCC proposed in its MRP to
                         include a special component. SOEs share features different from private businesses in property
                         rights, operation model, industrial structure and regulatory system. These characteristics of SOEs
                         have implications on effective participation of the SOEs in the ETS. The other key topic in this
                         component is the power sector, which accounts for most of the country’s emissions. Pricing
                         distortions, such as the difficulties in passing through price increases to end users, are key issues
                         identified in the MRP for study.
                           Component 6: Stakeholder Consultation and Engagement, and Project Management: The proposed
                           component will support hiring of outside experts for advisory support, meetings, international and
