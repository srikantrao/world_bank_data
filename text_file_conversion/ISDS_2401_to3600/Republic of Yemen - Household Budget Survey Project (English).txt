  2. Project Objectives
  The Project Development Objective is to fill the knowledge gap in Yemen on social and economic indicators and poverty by
  developing and implementing the next round of the Household Budget Survey (HBS). This will be achieved through
  supporting the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) of Yemen in survey design, sampling, enumeration, and data entry
  and processing.

  3. Project Description
  The purpose of the task is to support the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) in Yemen in successfully carrying out the
  different components of the HBS (which receives financing from a Multi Donor Trust Fund managed by the World Bank).
  The CSO would need to (i) to revise and finalize the household and community questionnaires (in Arabic and in English); (ii)
  pilot test the questionnaires; (iii) hire and train the field supervisors and enumerators; (iv) undertake a listing operation
  (census of households in selected enumeration areas); (vi) plan, implement and supervise the field work; (vii) develop the
  data entry program for the survey and arrange for data cleaning and entry; and (viii) produce datasets and final
  documentation including a statistical abstract of the data.


  The survey will carry out structured face-to-face interviews. A main focus of the survey is on expenditures (consumption)
  and incomes of households. The survey will also collect information on many dimensions of well-being, sources of
  livelihood, access to services, participation in the labor market, gender issues. As such, it is an integrated household survey
  with multiple purposes and uses. The new HBS questionnaire will be adapted to integrate comments received from various
  stakeholders, including government agencies, donors and NGOs. The questionnaire will have sections on: (i) household
  roster and dwelling conditions; (ii) health and education; (iii) economic activities; (iv) migration and remittances; (v)
consumption and expenditures; (vi) income; (vii) durable goods and loans; (viii) social assistance; (ix) gender; (x) subjective
questions on wellbeing. A separate community questionnaire will collect community level information.

Several key innovations on survey implementation have already been decided upon to improve survey quality and
reliability, and to account for the prevailing security related uncertainties.

- The CSO has agreed to integrate computer-based quality controls to field work. Data entry specialists will accompany
survey enumerators in the field, enter the data daily, and apply consistency controls on a household –by-household basis so
that errors and inconsistencies are solved by means of eventual re-visits to the households. The quality-assured databases
will be transferred to survey headquarters bi-weekly (or more often). This will have a significant impact on the quality of data
because errors and inconsistencies will be corrected while the interviewers are still in the field. The fast transfer of data
also gives the survey managers the ability to effectively monitor field operations.

- The CSO is optimistic of accessing all parts of Yemen as its survey enumerators are local. However, given the prevailing
and unpredictable security situation in Yemen, the CSO will have to adopt a survey implementation approach which allows
for temporary and localized disruptions. The CSO will coordinate closely with international survey and sampling experts
who have experience in dealing with such replacements in fragile contexts.

- The CSO will simplify the administration of the consumption module (by shortening the data collection period from four
weeks to two weeks), which will make the survey easier to administer and is expected to improve the quality of consumption
data, which is central to creating poverty statistics.
