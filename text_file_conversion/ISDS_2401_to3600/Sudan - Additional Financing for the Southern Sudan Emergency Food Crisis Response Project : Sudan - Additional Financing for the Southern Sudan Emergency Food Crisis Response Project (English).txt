2. Project Objectives
To support adoption of improved technologies for food production by eligible
beneficiaries, increase storage capacity for staples, and provide cash or food to eligible
people participating in public works programs in selected counties in South Sudan.

3. Project Description
The original project was formulated in the context of the 2007-2008 food price crisis and
was designed to extend the reach of the MDTF-funded projects in the agriculture sector.
As restructured, main project activities include providing farmers with technologies to
increase production of selected staples and provision of food-insecure households with
cash and/or food for work to implement public works that promote agricultural
productivity, like patching of feeder roads, construction of grain storage facilities.

 a) Component 1: Support to Agriculture Productivity (US$5.70 million)

 This component aims at reducing vulnerability to food price escalation through
increased own production and improved postharvest handling and management of food
crops. The component also supports increasing cropped acreage by farmers working as
cooperatives and/or groups through provision of inputs and tools. The component
supports the construction of low-cost food banks and granaries at household and
community levels.

 b) Component 2: Strengthening Community Safety-Nets (US$3.70m)

  The objective of this component is to increase access to food by food insecure
households through the markets. The component supports a cash-for-work and/or food
for work program in which the most food insecure households receive cash and/or food
transfers in exchange for labor and participation in construction of public assets (roads,
village storage facilities etc.) that enhance agricultural productivity.

 (c) Component 3: Support to Project Implementation Arrangements (USD 0.80m)

 This component finances the operational costs of the implementing agency including,
procurement, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of activities under the project.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Project is located in the following States: Western and Central Equatoria State, Western
Bahr el Ghazal, Warrup and Unity.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The ongoing project is a Category B for environmental safeguards. This category will not
change. Activities planned under the additional financing will not trigger any new
safeguard policies (Field observations during supervision of the parent project led to
triggering OP4.04 and OP 4.36. These policies have now been triggered under the
proposed additional financing). No significant irreversible environmental and social
impacts from project activities are envisaged.

 Apart from the covenant related to the preparation and adoption of a satisfactory
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Pest Management Plan
(PMP), the project has complied with all legal covenants. Compliance with the
aforementioned safeguards covenant was affected by capacity weaknesses in
management of safeguards in the implementing agency as is the case for the entire World
Bank portfolio in South Sudan. Although there have been no cases of displacement
and/or migration reported of the participating farmers thus far, such displacement is
possible. There have been increases in population movement following South Sudan’s
independence. There is also the possibility of bringing idle lands under cultivation as a
result of the project.

  An Environmental and Social Management Specialist has been recruited to provide
required safeguards support to the project. The specialist will finalize the preparation of
an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), an environmental and social mitigation
and monitoring plan, a sectoral ESMF, a PMP, an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP), and a
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) as required. In light of observations during field visits,
the task team triggered OP/BP4.04 on Natural Habitats and OP/BP4.36 on Forests. The
proposed ESA together with the other environmental and social safeguard tools stipulated
will redress any environmental and social impacts as reflected by triggered policies prior
to project closing. The safeguards documents will also address vulnerability, in case there
is impact on migratory people.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No long term risks or impacts are anticipated.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
n/a

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower will commit to undertake the following:

 a) The client will finalize and adopt a sectoral Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF);

 b) The client will complete an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) study to
ensure that potential impacts are identified, alternatives presented and appropriate
mitigation measures are considered;
 c) The ESA report will include the Environmental Management Plan and Pest
Management Plan;

 d) Preparation of an Indigenous Peoples Plan and a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) if
the ESA reveals the need.

 e) After the completion of the ESA report the Borrower will disclose the output of the
ESA report to the communities residing in and around the project area when necessary.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders will include the: Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives and
Rural Development and the communities residing in and around the project area.
