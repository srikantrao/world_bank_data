2. Project Objectives:

The objective of this project is to provide the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) with an upgraded
disaster and climate risk information platform and to develop an associated series of risk
management applications for enhanced disaster risk reduction, risk management, risk adjusted
development planning, and risk financing decisions under Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment
and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI)- phase 3. This project will achieve this objective as part of
the larger PCRAFI that is supported by a series of parallel projects and technical assistance
programs.

3. Project Description:

This Project will support Phase 3 of the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing
Initiative to further develop the Pacific Risk Information System (PacRIS). The GIS platform
will be used as the database infrastructure to develop selected applications for better disaster risk
reduction and risk management. It is proposed that, this Project, the SPC/SOPAC executed part
ofPCRAFI Phase 3, will support the following three components:
Component 1. Strengthening of the Pacific Risk Information System. The Pacific Risk
Information System has been set up at SPC/SOP AC under the PCRAFI. It houses the most
comprehensive historical catalogue of earthquakes and tropical cyclones, database of geo-
referenced fixed assets, and probabilistic analyses and mapping of risk earned out to date. It
provides open source GIS tools to make these data and risk analysis products available for public
use. Phase 3 of the PCRAFI will further build and refine the Pacific Risk Information System by
(i) strengthening the capacity of technical agencies at national and regional level in its use and
maintenance (ii) strengthening the risk information and underlying data, and providing analytics
on additional hazards and future risks, (iii) strengthening the data-sharing platform at
SPC/SOPAC in order to achieve expanded reach and allow access of PCRAFI data and
information to the wider Pacific community -and beyond. The component would finance
consultants, travel, workshops, data collection and limited office and computer equipment.
Component 2. Institutional capacity building on disaster and climate risk financing. This
component will offer institutional capacity building on disaster and climate risk financing to the
five PICs participating in the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Pilot, namely Samoa, Tonga, RMI, SI
and Vanuatu. Others may be added based on demand and available resources. Technical
assistance will be provided to the ministries of fmance Qf the PICs to fine tune their financial
strategy against natural disasters. Country-specific tools and analyses on disaster risk financing
will be developed to help the PICs assess their fiscal exposure to natural disasters and take
informed decisions for their financial management, including domestic reserves, contingent
credit and catastrophe risk insurance. This component will also review the post-disaster budget
execution process and will provide recommendations to ensure timely and efficient post-disaster
budget (re)allocation for early recovery, for example through the establishment of a national
disaster funds. This will also include disbursement methods for funds acquired under the Pacific
Catastrophe Risk Insurance Pilot. This component would fmance consultants, travel, workshops,
and data collection.
Component 3. Rapid disaster impact estimation. The aim of this component is to provide
disaster managers and first responders with tools and information to quickly gain an overview
shortly before and following a disaster on the areas and population affected and the likely
severity of the event in terms of potential fatalities, injuries and building, infrastructure and crop
damage. This would provide vital information in a timely fashion for a more targeted response
and deployment of field teams. This component would finance consultants, travel, workshops,
data collection, and post disaster surveys.


4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The project would cover the fourteen participating Pacific Island Countries: Cook Islands,
Federate States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New
Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. A fifteenth country,
Timor-Leste is also included. The project would support i) the enhancement of data and
applications to the Pacific Risk Information System, ii) technical assistance support to a risk
fmancing information in Samoa, Tonga, RMI, SI and Vanuatu, and iii) the development of a
modeled rapid damage assessment protocol.

The project will not result in any physical interventions but will mainly focus on institutional
capacity building and the development of tools and information to facilitate quick responses to
disasters. Specifically the three components of the project will finance consultants, travel,
workshops, data collection, post disaster surveys and limited office and computer equipment. No
safeguard policies will be triggered by the proposed grant.
