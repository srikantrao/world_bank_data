                              7.         The project#s main objectives are to improve water productivity. Improved water productivity will translate into greater agricultural
                              output per unit of water used, and will be achieved through improved physical delivery efficiency, irrigation practices, crop diversification and
                              effective application of inputs. The project#s objectives would contribute to increased agricultural production, employment and incomes, higher

                              living standards and positive environmental outcomes.

                              C. Project Description

                              The project is likely to consist of the following components:

                              Component A: Installation of High Efficient Irrigation Systems (US$202 million and IDA US$125.5 million). This component would aim to improve
                              irrigation efficiency through (i) improving water use through drip irrigation systems and the field level; and (ii) to reduce waterlogging and improve
                              water efficiency through laser-land leveling. These two objectives would be met through two subcomponents. The first would focus on the
                              installation of drip or bubbler/sprinkler irrigation systems at the field level for high value horticulture and floriculture crops. Experience with these
                              systems has shown that high efficiency irrigation systems typically reduce input costs by 20-35%, increase yields by 20-100%, lower irrigation
                              labor up to 30%, diversify cropping patterns and save up to 75% water. The irrigation systems would likely be installed by a service provider on a
                              shared cost basis. The second sub-component would provide laser land leveling, which has been shown to save up to 30% irrigation water, and
                              result in uniform seed germination, and increases fertilizer use efficiency resulting in enhanced crop yields (up to 20%). The equipment is
                              expected to be provided by service providers to farmers who could complete the land leveling, where applicable.

                              Component B: Ungarding of Community Irrigation System (US$199 Million IDA US$137.1 million). The component would consist of three
                              subcomponents. The first sub-component would improve around 6,500 watercourses in canal commanded areas where farmer organizations have
                              been established, and where the management of the minor canal level has been transferred. Watercourses would be improved by improving the
                              existing technology of brick lining, or by introducing concrete lining, where preferred. The second subcomponent would improve around 4,000
                              watercourses that were partially improved under previous programs. The costs of improvement would be shared with the farmers. The third sub-
                              component would improve watercourses in rainfed areas that have localized irrigation schemes. An estimated 4,000 watercourses would be
                              covered under the project in Barani areas.

                              Component C: Improved Agriculture Technology/Practices and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 10.3 million). This component would consist of
                              two subcomponents. The first sub-component would include research and extension services, training, demonstration and assistance, and the
                              establishment of information centers to promote technologies and practices introduced under other components. The second sub-component
                              would finance a monitoring and evaluation system to track progress of the project and to provide a continuous feedback loop to improve project
                              performance.

                              Component D: Project Management, supervision, technical assistance, training and Strategic Studies (US$27 million). This component would
                              cover the costs associated with project management and supervision of the project#s activities, and for financing strategic studies and pilot
                              projects that would be identified during the project implementation. In addition, this component will finance training of project staff, especially
                           training of trainers in topics such as crop diversification, shift to horticulture, vegetable and floriculture crops, operation and maintenance of the
                           irrigation systems, and units installed under the project, etc.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Punjab is considered to be food basket of the country and produces more than 70 percent of
                           wheat, which is the main staple food of Pakistanis. Agriculture in Punjab has been affected grossly with waterlogging and salinity and government
                           has implemented number of waterlogging and salinity control projects over the past years. Central and southern Punjab, where rainfall is more

                           sporadic and agriculture is irrigation dependent, are also the cotton basket of the country. Central and southern Punjab are also world#s leading
                           producers of Kinoo (a variety of citrus) and mangoes. The proposed project interventions would result in improving irrigation efficiencies and
                           enhancing water productivity.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Borrower and Implementing Agency have worked with the Bank before and are well versed in the Bank#s Safeguards Policies. They would
                           prepare EA and SA reports using their own staff which would be validated by an independent experienced consultant. The borrower is preparing
                           the environmental impact assessment report, which besides other matters, also assesses the existing institutional capacity for the safeguards
                           implementation. Capacity development and training of staff on safeguards is also an integral part of the institutional development program under
                           EIA.
