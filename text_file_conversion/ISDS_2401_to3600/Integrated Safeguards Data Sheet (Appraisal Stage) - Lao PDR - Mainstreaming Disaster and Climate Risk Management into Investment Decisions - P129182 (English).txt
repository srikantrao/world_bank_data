                              Component 1: Risk Assessment
                              This component will focus on the identification of risks and integration of risk scenarios in the development planning and policies.

                              Component 2: Mainstreaming Disaster and Climate Risk Management into Investments
                              This component will provide assistance to Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) , transport, urban planning, and irrigation at all levels to
                              develop guidelines and strategies to mainstream disaster risk management and climate change adaptation into the planning cycle and budgeting
                              processes.

                              Component 3: Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building
                              Activities under this component will focus on building capacity of the technical staff members at both central and provincial levels in the areas of

                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 4

                         Project location

                         The Department of Roads (DoR) under the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) and the Department of Irrigation (DoI) of the Ministry of
                         Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) will implement the small scale civil works under the Component 4. The MPWT has experience in the Bank
                         safeguard policies through the on-going Lao Road Sector Project (LRSP), and MAF has implemented Environmental and Social Safeguard
                         Management Framework ( ESMF) for small scale civil works under the KDP Additional Financing. The project made adjustment to the existing
                         safeguard instruments under the LRSP and KDP Additional Financing to ensure that investments financed under the project would be
                         implemented in compliance with Bank’s safeguard policies. Under LRSP project, MPWT established two divisions which are in charge of
                         environmental and social safeguards: (i) Technical and Environmental Division (TED) under DoR, and (ii) Environmental and Social Division (ESD)
                         under Public Works and Transport Institute. The capacity of provincial staff of MAF will still have to be developed so they are able to implement
                         environmental safeguard instruments properly.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   This project is classified as Environmental Category B. However, due to technical glitch, the Basic Information page mentions that
                                 theenvironmental category is category C.

                                 The grant may be implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live. It is anticipated that they will benefit from the improved disaster resilience
                                 of infrastructure due to the implementation of the grant, and that no significant negative impacts will result. Nonetheless, the Ethnic Group
                                 Policy Framework (EGPF) has been prepared which describes the methodology to identify ethnic minorities that may be affected under the
                                 grant, sets out principles and procedures to conduct free, prior and informed consultations with affected ethnic minorities leading to broad
                                 community support, and provides measures to ensure that affected ethnic minorities will receive project benefits in a culturally appropriate
                                 manner and mitigate negative impacts. The grant will not be implemented where broad community support is not ascertained, and the Ethnic
                                 Minority Plans will be developed if and where ethnic minorities live in project areas as per provisions under EGPF.

                                 Works under the grant will be small in scale and will largely be limited within the existing road or irrigation alignments. The pilot activities under
                                 this project will not likely cause any physical relocation of villagers or loss of their assets. However, a Compensation and Resettlement Policy
                                 Framework (CRPF) has been prepared which set out policies and procedures that will apply when private land has to be acquired, private
                                 assets need to be damaged or income sources will be lost, so the grant will be implemented in line with OP 4.12.

                                 The environmental impacts anticipated from such small scaled civil works are minimal and temporary during construction and operations. No
                                 significant adverse impacts are anticipated from the civil works.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The potential or long term impact of this project is expected to be significant and positive, as the grant will improve the disaster resilience of
                                 infrastructure and help minimize disruption of services.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                  The Ministry of Planning and Investment (PMI), together with the Department of Roads (DoR) under the Ministry of Public Works and
                                 Transport (MPWT) and the Department of Irrigation (DoI) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF), developed the EGPF, the CRPF

                                 and the EMF which have been reviewed by the task team and found to be in line with the relevant Bank social and environmental safeguard
                                 policies.

                                 The civil works will be carried out by the DoR and MAF. Both agencies have stringent environmental and social safeguards policies in place
                                 and are familiar with the World Bank’s safeguards policy requirements pertaining to road and irrigation works due to their long engagement in
                                 implementing the World Bank financed infrastructure related projects

                                 For road infrastructure and housing related civil works, the agency responsible for social and environment management is the Technical and
                                 Environmental Department (TED) at the central level, and the environment and Social Unit (ESU) of DPWTs at the provincial level and the
                                 Environment and Social Office (ESO) at district level. The ESD and the TED will monitor safeguard compliance of road related investments.
                                 For irrigation related civil works, although MAF has familiarized with the World Bank’s safeguards instruments, capacity building on
                                 environmental and social safeguards monitoring and evaluation will be conducted for the DoI and its safeguard focal person, since no
                                 environmental unit is in place.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                   The DoR under the MPWT and the DoI of the MAF will implement minor scaled civil works under the Component. TED staff, together with
                                 ESOM consultant under ESD and relevant provincial government staff, will conduct consultation meetings with affected communities including
                                 in particular ethnic minorities prior to the commencement of civil works. As for investments under MAF, the project coordinator assigned by
                                 DOI has been responsible for consultations with affected communities including ethnic minorities.
