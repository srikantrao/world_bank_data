                              Partnerships between TEIS and businesses will be promoted through a competitive system of grants that the MOEHE will promote among West
                              Bank and Gaza Tertiary Education Institutions(TEIs) in order to motivate them to work together with the private sector inthe development and
                              implementation of apprenticeship type schemes. Through the MOEHE's Quality Improvement Fund (QIF), the project will finance a round of
                              competitive grants to TEIs aimed at improving the transition to work of higher education graduates. Specifically, TEIs would be invited to partner
                              with the business community to develop and implement work-integrated learning programs aimed at (i) providing students with practical training,
                              and (ii) improving the quality and relevance of the curriculum and teaching practices of TEIs professional programs.

                              The proposed project consist of a single competitive system of grants component which will be implemented by the Ministry of Education and
                              Higher Education (MOEHE) through its Quality Improvement Fund (QIF) with the support of the MOEHE's Project Coordination Unit (PCU).

                              The proposed US$5.0 million project will enhance education-to-work transition by improving the quality and relevance of targeted tertiary education
                              programs that are in high demand in West Bank and Gaza. The types of investments to be supported by the project include:
                               (i)      funds to finance innovative labor market relevant education programs that have strong partnerships with private sector businesses
                              through QIF, including but not limited to centers for collaborative teaching, curriculum improvement in the areas of professional, entrepreneurial,
                              general and life skills; teaching materials and equipment; teacher training and mentoring;
                              (ii)      international and local technical assistance and related consulting services for capacity building of TEIs to form partnerships with private
                              sector businesses;
                              (iii)     consulting services for targeted research, data collection and program evaluation;
                              (iv)      awareness and information campaign, and dissemination of good practices; and
                              (v)       management of the fund.

                              By focusing on TEIs, the proposed project complements the forthcoming EU/GIZ support for TVE institutions (secondary and post-secondary) and
                              also the proposed World Bank Palestinian Market Development Project (PMD) by promoting apprenticeship partnership between TEIs and the
                              private business sector.

                              Although this type of partnership between TEIs and the business community has not been fully tested in WB&G, successful international examples
                              exist in countries such as the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK.
