                              education sector.

                              3. Project Description

                              In order to support the efforts of the Government of Moldova in strengthening the quality of education while supporting the efficiency reforms being

                              implemented in the education sector, the Moldova Education Reform Project (MERP) would include three key priority areas of action, organized as
                              components: (i) Strengthening the Quality of Education; (ii) Improving the Efficiency of the Education Sector; and, (iii) Improving the Ministry of
                              Education's Capacity to Implement Education Reform.

                              For the first two components, a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) has been established. The DLIs have been structured around two of
                              the Government of Moldova’s priority pillars of strengthening the quality of education and improving the efficiency of the sector. The third
                              component, which is technical assistance, would follow traditional disbursement methods.

                              Component 1:        Strengthening the Quality of Education (US$ 18.5 million under a results based approach)

                              The objective of this component is to contribute to the strengthening of the quality of education in the General Education sub sector in Moldova.
                              Support to the strengthening of quality would be provided in four main areas: (i) the implementation of quality assurance standards for receiving
                              schools; (ii) the establishment of teacher and school directors training and remuneration systems; (iii) improvement in the student assessment
                              systems (both national and international); and, (iv) improvement in the quality of data and management information systems.

                              Component 2:        Improving the Efficiency of the Education Sector (US$9 million under a results based approach)

                              The objective of this component is to improve the efficiency of the sector by eliminating excess capacity and creating a leaner education system,
                              which would be better equipped to provide education that meets the demands of a modern economy. Through this component the MoE would
                              ensure the implementation of reforms in the area of school network reorganization and the nationwide rollout of per-student education financing
                              down to the school level.

                              Component 3:        Improving the Ministry of Education’s Capacity to Monitor the Reform (US$1.5 million under traditional disbursement methods)

                              The objective of this component is to finance technical assistance (TA) for the MoE to support the Project and assist the Ministry monitor the
                              education reform defined in the Action Plan for Education Structural Reform Implementation.

                              This component would provide adequate resources and expertise to finance key activities in the Project in the reaching of its DLIs. This component
                              follows the TA provided in the IDA financed Additional Financing to the Quality Education in the Rural Areas of Moldova Project which was
                              approved on March 20, 2012 and will be implemented until November 30, 2013.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   There are no safeguards issues in this Project. Due to the nature of the reforms being supported by the Project which have to do with the
                                  closure of schools, the reallocation of teachers and movement of children from small schools to larger ones outside of their villages, a non
                                  safeguard social assessment was undertaken at preparation and will be repeated at mid term as part of Project supervision.

                                  The social assessment looked into a range of potential social concerns with school optimization which included the availability of information
                                  and understanding of the reform by parents, students and teachers as well as vulnerability to drop-out and perceptions on school quality as
                                  related to the reform. The assessment concluded that there is no overwhelmingly positive or negative attitude towards the reform. However,
                                  from focus group discussions and interviews, it is clear that social attitude seems to be very closely linked with: (i) the level of parents’
                                  participation in decision-making; (ii) the availability of clear rules, grievance mechanisms, and, (iii) timely information on school closures as well
                                  as details of student transfer. The importance of parents’ support and participation in making the reform successful also means that students

                                  living without parental supervision, from single-parent families for example, require very close monitoring and support. The Project would
                                  incorporate the findings from the social assessment especially in the public communications campaign activities and continued consultations
                                  planned at the local level. The public communications campaign which receives continuous support from the Bank through implementation
                                  support and technical assistance as part of the on-going Project--Quality Education in the Rural Areas of Moldova (QERM), would be further
                                  honed to ensure that it is realistic and consistent, letting parents know of their rights and obligations and encouraging them to take active part in
                                  planning all details of the process in their communities. All findings and recommendations of this social assessment would be incorporated into
                                  Project design.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   N/A
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                   N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   N/A
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                    A non safeguards social assessment was conducted and found that there would need to be more intensive consultations with stakeholders on
                                  the reform measures being implemented by the Government of Moldova and supported by the Project. All findings and recommendations of this
                                  social assessment would be incorporated into Project design.
