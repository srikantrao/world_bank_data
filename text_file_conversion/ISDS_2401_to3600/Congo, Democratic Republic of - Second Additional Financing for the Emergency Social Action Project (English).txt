2. Project Objectives
The development objective of the project would be unchanged: To improve access of the
poor to social and economic services and increase the availability and management of
development resources at the community level. Outcome indicators will remain the same,
but the targets have been updated to reflect the increased funding.

3. Project Description
The proposed second Additional Financing would help finance the costs associated with
scaling up successful activities of a well performing project that has led to substantial
increase in access to basic social services. A total of US$ 6.8 million will be allocated to
this second Additional Financing. The activities to be financed under the proposed
Additional Financing comprise: (i) rehabilitation and construction of small-scale
community based infrastructure; (ii) capacity building primarily for beneficiary
communities and local executing agencies; and (iii) project coordination and
management.
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will continue to be national in scope. However, the proposed second
Additional Financing will focus on local communities living in the Seke Banza territory
in the Bas-Congo province.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
No large scale adverse environmental impacts are anticipated for the additional financing
investments; potentially negative impacts will be limited and site specific, due to the
nature of investments. The second Additional Financing will focus on the construction or
rehabilitation of about 50 community economic or social infrastructures including
agricultural roads, micro-irrigation, water supply, agricultural inputs, and the
rehabilitation of small markets. The maximum subproject size for the second additional
financing will be $100,000. No large-scale, significant or irreversible impacts are
anticipated.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No long term or cumulative adverse impacts were identified in the Environment and
Social Management Framework (ESMF) and, in the Resettlement Policy Framework
(RPF) or in the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP). The second Additional
Financing will support an estimated 65 small sub-projects that can only have positive
long term impact on the population, including access to basic social services.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Under the original project, the borrower laid the foundation for sound environmental and
social management of project investments. The measures developed to address safeguard
policy issues in the original project include (i) an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF), (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and (iii) an Indigenous
Peoples Development Plan (IPDP). Under the first Additional Financing, the ESMF for
the original project was modified slightly to make it more efficient and effective. This
revised ESMF is still valid for the new proposed Additional Financing, , as well as the
RPF and IPDP. Environmental and Social Management Plans and/or a Resettlement
Action Plan will be prepared as and when necessary.

 The FSRDC has an environmental specialist in the national coordination office in
Kinshasa who is responsible for ensuring the compliance to safeguard policies together
with one designated staff in each of the 11 provincial offices (including Bas Congo where
the second additional financing proposes to scale up activities developed capacity).
Moreover, relevant staff of FSRDC and many local executing agencies have been trained
in the implementation of the various safeguard measures.

 The second additional financing will benefit from improvements made to the safeguards
documents during the first additional financing, whereby FSRDC simplified and
strengthened the guidance provided to beneficiary communities. This process included
the development of a clear negative list of activities and sub-project characteristics that
are not eligible for support, as well as the adoption of environmental and social
management guidelines for specific types of subproject. This process helped reduce the
burden of subproject screening, and refocused safeguard efforts on providing
communities and partner NGOs with concrete guidance on mitigation measures built into
subproject design.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The design of the Emergency Social Action Fund project has participatory at several
levels: at national level; at local government level and at donor community level. At
project implementation, participation is a necessary condition for all project investments.
Subprojects supported through the second additional financing will be identified by the
beneficiary communities, and will receive implementation support from local executing
agencies and FSRDC that will include the consultative development of environmental
and social impact mitigation measures.The preparation of the ESMF, the RPF and the
IPDP included recurrent consultations with local governments and local communities.
