                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The National Initiative for Human Development 2 (INDH 2) includes five Subprograms including: (1) the Rural Subprogram (US$374 Million); (2)
                              the Urban Subprogram (US$410 Million); (3) the Cross-cutting Subprogram (US$331Million); and (4) the Vulnerability (précarité) Subprogram (US
                              $168 Million); and (5) the “Territorial Upgrading? Subprogram (US$602 Million).

                              Bank's involvement focuses on activities related to the three following Subprograms: (1) Rural Subprogram; (2) Urban Subprogram; and (3) Cross-
                              cutting Subprogram. Bank-financed activities include the following four Components:

                              (1)        Enhancing Access and Quality in Service Provision. Support in this area will be geared towards :
                              (a) ensuring that sector departments are aligned towards provision of complementary inputs (e.g. personnel, equipment, maintenance costs) to
                              and co-financing of INDH investments in order to increase the sustainability of INDH investments;
                              (b) Re-orienting the INDH planning and M&E systems to better track outputs and focus on actual outcomes (e.g. utilization rates, enrollment rates,
                              etc.);
                              (c) Increasing the performance of INDH basic infrastructure projects by establishing systems for technical quality control and standardized
                              operations & maintenance (O&M); and
                              (d) Ensuring that INDH priority target groups (e.g. women, youth, etc.) benefit adequately from INDH sub-projects.

                              (2)        Strengthening Participatory Local Governance and Social Accountability. Support actions to empower INDH targeted communities and
                              strengthen social accountability through:
                              (a) Further decentralizing implementation to the local level;
                              (b) Ensuring that civil society representation on local level decision making bodies is via elected rather than appointed Associations;
                              (c) empowering civil society representatives in INDH local governance bodies by giving them explicit social accountability functions, relevant
                              training, networking possibilities, and appropriate resourcing;
                              (d) introducing demand side governance tools (e.g. social audits, community scorecards.) to help civil society and government monitor and track
                              the efficiency of local-level INDH-supported activities;
                              (e) Increasing youth and women's representation on INDH Governance bodies;
                              (f) Further strengthening the participatory planning process by building the capacity of civil society and expanding their scope for engagement,
                              particularly at the local level; and
                              (g) Putting in place formal responsibilities for participatory governance and social accountability at the local and provincial levels.

                              (3)        Enhancing Economic Inclusion: technical assistance and DLIs in this area will be geared towards
                              (a) strengthening technical support to the project’ sponsors (usually associations and cooperatives) so that they are commercially viable and linked
                         to promising value chains;
                         (b) Simplifying procedures for accessing funds with clear scoring criteria;
                         (c) Introducing targeted support for youth skills training and placement; and
                         (d) Strengthening the job creation potential of INDH infrastructure and AGR projects.

                         (4)          Supporting Capacity Building and Systems Improvement: support to:
                         (a) MIS and M&E – streamlining data requirements, adding critical information, easing access and use by local governments, increasing

                         information transparency, and supporting the next round of impact evaluation;
                         (b) Environmental and social management systems – simplifying existing frameworks with an emphasis on cumulative environmental impacts and
                         land acquisition issues;
                         (c) Facilitate training and capacity development for actors responsible for fiduciary processes;
                         (d) Grievance redress mechanisms – setting up procedures for standardized receipt, sorting, and resolution of complaints, appointing
                         responsibilities, increasing awareness, and establishing a centralized database for complaints, consistent with sound social accountability; and
                         (e) Targeting - revision of criteria and targeting unit for the urban component, and the insertion of headcount poverty criteria for the rural
                         component.

                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         Bank financing will target defined geographical areas that will be further agreed upon with the Government and shall include both rural and urban
                         areas among those selected to receive INDH 2 support.

                         Environmental and social frameworks to screen selected subprojects and identify possible mitigation measures were set up for the purpose of the
                         implementation of INDH 1 and are expected to be further reviewed and assessed in view of using them for the purpose of INDH 2. They will be
                         improved to include assessment and mitigation of any cumulative impact under INDH 2. As most INDH subprojects are small and their potential
                         for generating substantial environmental impacts is generally limited. However, multiple sub-projects in some areas and basic infrastructure works
                         imply risks related to possible cumulative impacts.

                         Safeguards are to be addressed as:

                         In addressing environmental and social impacts of INDH 2 activities, the Borrower is drawing on the lessons learned from the INDH 1 and other
                         Borrower's practices in environmental and social management for similar activities. Activities that will be supported through INDH 2 will be
                         assessed against the range of environmental and social tasks to be performed and the scale of potential impacts. The Borrower shall develop and
                         provide an overall screening process and Environmental and Social Impact Framework (ESIAF) which will describe: the principles, rules,
                         processes and outcomes for environmental and social assessment and review of sub-projects to be financed under INDH 2. The ESIAF shall take
                         into account, all organizational aspects and processes which are relevant to the environmental and social management of the INDH 2 activities,
                         including the applicable regulatory and policy framework and institutional arrangements. The expected outcomes will include appropriate required
                         mitigation measures and/or Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and monitoring systems as appropriate. ESIAF, mitigation
                         measures and ESMP shall be built in accordance with OP 4.01 requirements, the Morocco's legal and regulatory framework applicable to INDH 2
                         activities and lessons learned from INDH 1. As the INDH 2 involves numerous sub-projects that might not be of substantial impacts by themselves
                         but would have a significant cumulative impact, a cumulative impact assessment will be required and reviewed. Finally, the ESIAF and ESMP shall
                         be developed in coordination and consultation with all institutions and stakeholders involved in INDH and shall be subject to disclosure.

                         Some subprojects may require land acquisition and will trigger involuntary resettlement policy. Under Phase 1, a Resettlement Policy Framework
                         was adopted to screen and govern land acquisition for subprojects, but no involuntary resettlement occurred. Generally, Government systems for
                         land acquisition and redress mechanisms are in place and are being implemented satisfactorily by the Government under its comprehensive slum
                         upgrading program which reduces risks of forced displacement. For the purpose of any potential land acquisition and involuntary resettlement,
                         INDH 2 shall be equipped with a RPF in compliance with OP 4.12 and the Morocco's legal and regulatory framework.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                         Morocco has developed its overall environmental management capacity over the last decade in a dramatic way including the adoption of a
                         comprehensive legal and regulatory framework and the establishment of institutions to monitor implementation and enforce environmental laws,
                         regulations and standards and norms. Human capacity has also increased in environmental sector both at national, regional and corporate level
                         within large national corporations. Morocco is also engaged in a continuous capacity strengthening program assisted by several donors and under
                         various projects. INDH 2 will benefit from such engagement as did INDH 1. Some weaknesses in the level of environmental and social safeguard
                         capacities which were observed at provinces and communes’ levels will benefit from the ongoing process of deconcentration of technical experts
                         from the Environment Department at provincial level. INDH 2 will, among other activities, help refine the screening processes and build
                         environmental management capacity of INDH stakeholders.

                         As mentioned above, Government systems for land acquisition and redress mechanisms are in place and are being implemented satisfactorily by
                         the Government under its comprehensive slum upgrading program which reduces risks of forced displacement. The draft ICR mentions that the
                         implementation of INDH 1 was done under a participatory approach and the involvement of local communities, elected representatives from
                         communes and wards, and other civil society representatives. Training was provided and capacity built to deal the implementation of the needed
                         mitigation measures to address environmental and social impacts of the INDH1 activities. Government commitment and stakeholder involvement
                         were strong. Sub-projects were identified largely by a bottom-up, participatory process in which local communities were to be empowered to have
                         a say in both decision making and implementation of all INDH1 investments. INDH1 experience including lessons learned shall help define the
                         modalities, processes and rules for the implementation and monitoring of mitigation measures and enhancement of environmental and social
                         positive impacts of INDH2. In doing so, a specific attention will be put on building upon the strong participatory process implemented under the
                         INDH 1 and on the development of instruments and processes to further strengthen consultation processes to ensure that they will be designed to
                         facilitate the participation of vulnerable groups taking into account cultural sensitivities and language skills.
