                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed Project Development Objective is to enhance water resources management and
                           irrigation service delivery for the benefit of water users and the nation as a whole. The project will
                           finance technical assistance to the water sector until 2020 with a focus on management of water
                           resources in the irrigation and drainage sub-sector, which accounts for 90 percent of water use in the
                           Kyrgyz Republic. The project will have four components: (i) strengthening national water
                           management capacity and implementation of the Water Code; (ii) improving irrigation service

                           delivery; (iii) supporting water users’ organizations; (iv) project management. The project will be
                           financed by SDC through a Recipient-Executed Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The TA project will be implemented nationwide, covering all river basins, government-run off-farm
                           irrigation systems and WUAs, with localized initiatives to test and develop specific processes and
                           procedures.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The borrower has a proven its technical and managerial capacity, based on experience with OIP-1
                           and OIP-2, to effectively address safeguard-related issues. As it did under OIP-1 and OIP-2, the PIU
                           will likely employ a national environmental specialist on a part-time basis to review and TORs and
                           reports prepared under this project to make sure that follow-on recommendations on investments
                           stemming from the TA are consistent with the safeguards policies of the World Bank. Technical
                           assistance for the development of river basin plans, will ensure that these plans are in line with an
                           Environmental Management Framework prepared prior to project appraisal.
