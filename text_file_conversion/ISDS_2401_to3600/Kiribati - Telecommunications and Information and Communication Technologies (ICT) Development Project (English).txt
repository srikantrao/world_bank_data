                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed financing instrument is a technical assistance grant of US$4.0 million, co-financed by a Recipient-executed grant from AusAID
                              through the PRIF Trust Fund of US$1.1 million, covering a five-year program of support to the MCTTD and TAK.

                              Component 1. ICT Policy and Legal Support (MCTTD) US$ 1.3 million. The Project will provide assistance to MCTTD in the following areas:
                              (a) ICTpolicy review and coordination: including: (i) coordinating and updating sector policy in line with industry developments and Government
                              objectives, including second-generation reforms and application of ICT in other sectors, and monitoring ICT sector development. and (ii) leading
                              the Government’s work on international agreements related to telecommunications and ICT.
                              (b) TSKL transformation: in coordination with the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) and TSKL, identifying options and
                              recommendations and then implementing the Government’s preferred options for restructuring. Options could include introduction of an equity
                              investor, or other strategic partner for TSKL, or privatization. The Project will finance the options assessment and technical assistance for
                              implementation, but will not provide direct financial assistance to TSKL.
                              (c)        Legal and regulatory advice: legal and regulatory advice, as needed from time to time, including advice regarding legislative and
                              regulatory reforms, drafting and other advice necessary to give effect to Government policy and sector development (including specialist legal
                              advice for the Office of the Attorney General).

                              Component 2. ICT Regulatory Support US$1.2 million. This envisages a medium-term program of technical assistance and capacity-building
                              (including on the job and formal training) for the TAK in the following areas:
                              (a) New market entry: assist in the design and conduct of a selection process for new telecommunications service provider(s) that will permit a
                              second operator to offer mobile services, to be undertaken in coordination with the MCTTD;
                              (b) General regulatory support: technical assistance and capacity-building for the TAK to regulate a competitive market with multiple operators,
                              consistent with the new legal and regulatory framework
                              (c) Technical management and training: assistance for TAK regarding the development of a spectrum management and monitoring system
                              through procurement of specialized equipment and software, and capacity-building (formal training) for TAK staff at external training institutions,
                              under a comprehensive and prioritized training plan.

                              Component 3. Outer Islands Connectivity US$2.2 million. This will finance:
                              (a) Phase 1: Technical assistance to MCTTD and TAK for: (i) development of an appropriate Outer Islands connectivity policy and strategy (built
                              around an output-based aid approach), including preparation of the scheme and necessary enabling instruments. These include: (i) technical and
                              financial feasibility analysis, and stakeholder consultations; (ii) identification, analysis and evaluation of possible coverage and services extension
                              projects, least cost subsidy and financing/risk-sharing mechanism (such projects might include voice and/or data; broadband/backbone
                              infrastructure and/or access facilities); (iii) development of the necessary regulatory instruments, instructions and practical procedures to
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 4
                         implement Outer Islands coverage and services extensions; (iv) preparation of project documentation, selection process for identifying and
                         contracting with an operator for the supply of specified services; and ongoing monitoring and audit of the service being subsidized, possibly
                         including specialized equipment and software; and (v) community reach-out and training programs to encourage take-up.

                         (b) Phase 2: Outer Islands connectivity subsidy for new infrastructure and services delivery projects for the Outer Islands identified in Phase 1,
                         using an output-based aid approach. TAK will manage a competitive bidding process for the lowest subsidy for these Outer Islands projects. The
                         use and volume of subsidies to individual projects will depend on the extent of commercial rollout and connectivity gaps in the Outer Islands, and
                         the types of services (e.g., mobile voice, data) to be provided. The estimated costs for this sub-component assume a least cost, one-time subsidy

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
Public Disclosure Copy




                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  The proposed project will have very minor, if any, impacts on the environment, land and on people. The project mainly consists of policy and
                                 regulatory support and technical assistance to the Government of Kiribati to improve the reliability and affordability of telecommunications
                                 services. However, Component 3 may involve subsidies for provision of connectivity in outer islands, which would either finance maintenance of
                                 existing networks or minimal civil works. These works are expected to be small, such as installing communication towers or satellite dishes and
                                 will require very little construction and land. Therefore the safeguard issues are considered to be small. The Government of Kiribati has
                                 prepared an Environmental Code of Practice (ECOP) and a Compensation Framework (CF) to inform the process of any construction and land
                                 acquisition that is required under Component 3 of this project. These documents provide procedures to ensure that any environment or social
                                 impacts are properly avoided or mitigated.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  Improved connectivity throughout Kiribati is expected to help Kiribati citizens to have greater access to information and provide improved
                                 communications facilities to the Outer Islands. Improved connectivity may support economic activities e.g. tourism, and improved service
                                 delivery e.g. health and education. Social benefits are expected to be positive. There are no significant long term environmental impacts
                                 related to the telecommunications infrastructure.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  Not applicable.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The recipient has prepared an ECOP (Environmental Code of Practice) and Compensation Framework (CF) which were disclosed in country
                                 on February 17, 2012. These documents are specific to Component 3 of this project as it is the only component potentially involving civil works.
                                 Implementation of the ECOP and the CF will be the responsibility of the service provider granted the subsidy to install the backbone/broadband
                                 infrastructure and MCTTD (working with MELAD).

                                 The Government has limited institutional capacity for implementation of World Bank environmental and social safeguards policies. The local
                                 agency in-charge of environmental matters is the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Agricultural Development (MELAD). They have full time
                                 staff who regulate and monitors activities with potential environmental impacts. The Government of Kiribati has passed regulations which
                                 mandate environmental assessment for projects with potential impacts on the environment.

                                 The Government also has existing institutional capacity for addressing land acquisition, particularly if done at a small scale. They are able to
                                 identify affected people and pay compensation payments, and a grievance mechanism that allows people to file complaints at courts is in place
                                 throughout the country. This is particularly the case when land acquisition is led by MELAD. However, these systems can be overburdened and

                                 slow. Meanwhile MCTTD is working on land acquisition in two World Bank projects. It is important that they get implementation support from the
                                 World Bank, as well as service providers and MELAD, as needed, to ensure any land acquisition impacts are promptly mitigated.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                  The key stakeholders of the project are TAK, TSKL, other potential service providers, and all the people of Kiribati who would benefit from
                                 improved access to telecommunication services. Given the uncertainty of Component 3 activities at this stage, consultations on the ECOP and
                                 CF have been limited to relevant government ministries, service providers and Outer Islands representatives. The ECOP and CF were
                                 disclosed in Tarawa on February 17, 2012 and are available at <www.tak.gov.ki>
                                 <www.environment.gov.ki>. Once subprojects under Component 3 are clear, further consultations directly with the affected people will be
                                 conducted. These consultations will be the responsibility of the service provider, MCTTD and TAK.
