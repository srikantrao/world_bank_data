2. Project Objectives:

The development objective of the GPOBA project is to increase access to sanitation and water
services in selected low-income communities of Nairobi. The key indicators are: (1) Number of
sewerage and water connections, and (2) Number of people provided with access to sewerage
and water services in the project areas.

3. Project Description:

The objective of this project is to increase access to sewerage and water supply connections in
Nairobi’s low-income communities over a 4 year period.

The project builds upon a 2004 IDA Grant which successfully helped establish the Nairobi City
Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) as an autonomous and ring-fenced service provision
utility with clear roles, responsibilities and contractual arrangements. NCWSC will be the project
implementer and service provider for this OBA project.
The project also builds on the 2007 IDA Credit (Water and Sanitation Service Improvement
Project or WaSSIP) which has funded, inter alia, significant improvements to the water and
sewerage networks in Nairobi’s low-income areas. This expansion of local networks, particularly
sewer networks, within Nairobi’s low-income settlements has provided an opportunity for
improved access to water and sewerage services. However, the cost of connecting to these
networks is too high for low income families and so this project will provide targeted output-
based subsidies for eligible households to facilitate service access.

The primary focus of this OBA project is access to sanitation services. However, given the need
for clean water to be available for hygiene purposes (hand washing, etc.), as well as for drinking
and cooking, this project will also offer subsidies for piped water supply access where the
household is not already connected to the network.
Project outputs will be:
     Installation of a working water supply connection and 6 months of billed water
        consumption,
     Installation of a working sewer connection (including all associated internal low cost
        plumbing/toilet facilities) and 6 months of billed service usage.

The project aims to connect 16,000 poor households (80,000 people) to the water and sewerage
network of NCWSC. The OBA subsidy per household/connection will be:
    Sewerage connection: $175 (70% of total connection cost)
    Water supply connection: $80 (40% of total connection cost)

The balance of the connection costs will be funded by household deposits and a five-year loan
from NCWSC to the eligible household. NCWSC is planning to fund these loans by borrowing
from local financial institutions.

The project will involve the installation of:
(1) water connections (but only where safe piped drinking water is not already available), and
(2) sewer connections.

Under this OBA project eligible households will have the option of receiving a:
- Sewer connection only (if they already have a NCWSC water connection)
- Water and sewer connection

Households will not be offered water only connections under this scheme since its primary objective
to increase sustainable sanitation service access.

Sewer Connections
A sewer connection will include the works to convert pit latrines and other sanitation facilities to
pour flush toilets. This will involve: (1) filling the pit (consumer/facility owner’s contribution); (2)
screed blinding for slab; (3) installation of a squatting WC pan; (4) installation of grey water storage
pan (which will be used for flushing); (5) installation of a hand wash basin; and (6) installation of
uPVC pipe to link facility to nearest manhole.
The sewer ‘connection’ includes all the internal plumbing (including WC pan) to ensure sanitation
services are accessed and delivered. Hand washing facilities are an integral component of the
output/facility to maximize the hygiene benefits of the sanitation facility – this is important for
sustainability and maximizing the economic/health benefits of improved sanitation.

Water Connections
A water connection will involve: (1) installation of uPVC pipe to link the household to distribution
system; and (2) installation of meter.

Social Marketing and Hygiene Promotion
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) will be responsible for funding and implementing a
complementary social marketing and hygiene promotion program. WSP is currently implementing a
project: Innovation in Scaling-up Access to WSS for the Urban Poor (P132015). Under this WSP
project support will be given to Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company for: mapping low
income urban areas; leveraging water and sanitation infrastructure finance; further development of
the Social Connection Policy; use of appropriate technology; innovative metering and billing
approaches; and use of subsidized microfinance in Kenya’s low-income communities. This WSP
project will also provide the required TA support for the implementation of the Nairobi Sanitation
OBA Project.

Wastewater Treatment and Effluent Disposal
All the wastewater produced at the beneficiary households will be conveyed to the Kariobangi
Sewerage Treatment Plant which was rehabilitated under the WaSSIP. The main sewers feeding the
treatment plant were also rehabilitated under the WaSSIP.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The proposed informal/low-income settlements for this OBA project are located in Nairobi
Eastlands & Northlands low income areas. Informal settlements being considered for
investments include: Matopeni/Spring Valley, Kayole Soweto, Maili-Saba, Kahawa-Soweto,
Huruma, and Embakasi-River Bank.

Nairobi’s slums demonstrate the magnitude of the challenges and opportunities for poverty
reduction in these settlements. The National Bureau of Statistics conservatively estimates that,
within Nairobi‘s administrative boundary, at least 30 percent of the population lives in slums.
With the 2009 census reporting Nairobi‘s total population as 3.2 million, the city‘s slum
population now stands at almost one million people. Recent indepth research supported by the
World Bank reveals both encouraging and discouraging development indicators in Nairobi‘s
slums. The incidence of economic poverty is very high—an astounding 73 percent of slum
residents fall below the poverty line. Unemployment is also high (26 percent), and living
conditions are appalling—only 3 percent live in a house with permanent walls, water and
electricity.

Rapid growth of informal slum settlements in the city of Nairobi can be attributed to a number of
factors among them increasing income inequalities and urban poverty, increasing rates of rural
urban migration, inefficient land delivery systems, high costs of urban living and poor
investment in low income housing, among other factors. In these low income areas of Nairobi,
basic amenities such as water, sanitation facilities including toilets and designed drainage and
sewage systems as well as garbage dumping sites are lacking. Some of the low income areas
have recently seen developments to improve basic services.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The project activities trigger OP 4.01 and OP 4.12, although in both cases, the risks are
anticipated to be minimal and site-specific. NCWSC will work with AWSB (implementing
agency of WaSSIP) to employ existing procedures to satisfy the safeguards requirements.

Environmental Assessment
No potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected. The site-specific, local
environmental risks identified are related to construction impacts. As a mitigation plan, the
project will adopt the ESMF developed for WaSSIP project. The ESMF was publicly disclosed
in Kenya and in the World Bank InfoShop on December 14, 2013.

Restriction of access to resources, temporary disturbance:
Neither involuntary resettlement nor land acquisition is not expected to be associated with this
project. For public water points, all connections will be made in local public spaces in the form
of public water points, with the consent of communities after community consultation has taken
place. In the case of yard taps, connections will only be made if the connection is demanded by
the household who will be responsible for paying the bills for the water supplied. Therefore the
project is envisioned to be demand-driven.

However, there could potentially be temporary disruption to household activities, and in some
cases project activities may lead to property damage. Therefore, the project will adopt the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) developed for WaSSIP and publicly disclosed on
December 14, 2011. The NCWSC will work with AWSB to ensure that the potential
beneficiaries are well apprised of their rights, and are able to achieve maximum benefit from this
GPOBA-funded project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
 No negative indirect or long-term impacts are anticipated due to project activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
 N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:
 The OBA Grant will utilize the WaSSIP ESMF and RPF to guide development of subproject
specific EA/EMP, which will be developed and publicly disclosed prior to beginning of works
on the subproject. The NCWSC will work closely with AWSB to further develop capacity in
implementing environmental and social safeguards instruments, in addition, it is recommended
that NCWSC hires a consultant to ensure sufficient oversight of safeguards. NCWSC is also
encouraged to participate in WaSSIP capacity building program for safeguards.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
 The project beneficiaries will include about 16,000 low-income households in Nairobi’s low-
income communities (about 80,000 people). The project will use geographic targeting, focusing on
low income settlements of Kayole-Soweto, Matopeni-Spring valley & Embakasi-River Bank in
Nairobi City. Consultations with PAPs will be a continued effort following the public consultations
undertaken for WaSSIP project activities.
