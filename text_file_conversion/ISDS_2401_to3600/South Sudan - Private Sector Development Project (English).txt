2. Project Objectives
The project development objective (PDO) is to improve access to finance for private
sector development and increase employment opportunities in South Sudan.

3. Project Description
The project consists of the following four components: {Same as in EPP, 3) A.}

 Component 1: Establish Commercially-Viable Microfinance Institutions (US$ 2.6
million). There are two sub-components under this component. The first sub-component
will provide technical and financial support to MFIs, promoting the start up and
expansion of microfinance providers and services throughout South Sudan. The MFIs
will provide micro-lending to micro-borrowers for various commercial activities that are
concentrated on trade. The second sub-component will support the operating costs of the
South Sudan Microfinance Development Facility (SSMDF) for a period of 3 years in an
amount of US$0.7 million. The SSMDF is a microfinance Apex institution established in
2009, under the MDTF-SS funded PSD project and serves as a wholesale microfinance
body for South Sudan.
 Component 2: Promote Micro-Entrepreneurship (US$ 4.4 million). This component will
catalyze entrepreneurship through a Business Plan Competition (BPC) for existing
businesses and start-ups. A total of $4 million will be earmarked to support 200
entrepreneurs with sub-grants in the amount of US$20,000 to be used as block collateral
for loans provided by commercial banks. Another $0.4 million will be allocated for the
preparation, technical assistance and M&E for the BPC. Under this component, some of
the loans will be used to finance activities across different sectors such as light
manufacturing, services, poultry farms, and agriculture.

 Component 3: Mobile Payments and Trade Policy Support (US$ 0.3 million). This
component will support the development of a regulatory framework for mobile banking
and payments and provide long term advisory services on trade policy for South Sudan,
including consideration of South Sudan#s potential membership to the East African
Community (EAC).

 Component 4: Institutional Strengthening of the South Sudan Business Forum and
Project Management (US$ 1.7 million). This component will finance the activities and
operating costs of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which is responsible for
coordinating and monitoring activities implemented by the project. It will also support
technical assistance and training to build the institutional capacity of the MCII staff
responsible for the development of the Private Sector in South Sudan.
 This component will also cater for the operating costs of the South Sudan Business
Forum (SSBF), a Public-Private Sector Development Forum, established in 2009, under
the MDTF-SS PSD Project.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Geographically, the Business Plan Competition winners and the MFIs and their clients
will be scattered throughout the 10 states of Southern Sudan.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
(a)     This is a category B (Partial Assessment) project. The activities under this project
will primarily focus on job creation opportunities revolving around up-scaling the
establishment of a commercially viable microfinance sector and catalyzing
entrepreneurship through Business Plan Competition (BPC).

 (b) Under Component 2, Promote Micro-Entrepreneurship, some of the loans will be
used to finance activities across different sectors such as light manufacturing, services,
poultry farms, and agriculture. These activities are likely to generate negative social and
environmental impacts, but the potential impacts are likely to be small and localized in
effect and can be easily mitigated as per the recommendations in the sectoral ESSAF that
will be developed by the client with technical support from the Bank three months after
project effectiveness.

  (c)   A draft Environmental and Social Safeguard Assessment Framework (ESSAF)
has been prepared for this operation and included as an annex to the project paper.
Additional material on potential impacts and mitigation measures will be include, as
necessary, during project implementation and appropriate safeguards documents prepared
(e.g. Environmental and Social Management Plans). The ESSAF explains the OPs
triggered, safeguard screening and mitigation based on the possible types of sub-projects,
responsibilities for safeguards screening and mitigation, capacity-building and
monitoring of safeguards framework implementation, and consultation and disclosure.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Sources of negative environment impact may relate to the following activities:

 (i) Land clearing and physical construction: The project may finance some activities that
could indirectly result in farm expansions through conversion of other lands into crop
farming. The project might support the construction of small-scale irrigation facilities,
village-level agro-processing plants, and post-harvest storage facilities, which could also
lead to impacts on the biophysical environment and manifesting through loss of
vegetation cover, biodiversity, land degradation, and soil erosion. The project will not
support any sub-project that will require acquisition of land.

 (ii) Agro-processing: Potential negative impacts will be solid and liquid wastes from
processing that can cause soil and water contamination. Depending on the type of
processing adopted, it may result in the generation of gaseous fumes and smoke and
odors which could be detrimental to the health and safety of workers.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
None

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
(a)     In order to address the anticipated impacts, the project includes an ESSAF;
ESMPs will be prepared during project implementation to mitigate the impacts from use
of inputs (pesticides, fertilizers and etc) the project (BPC) will ensure every agricultural
activity applies a best practice standard and conducts environmental screening to
identify potential negative environmental impacts.

 (b) Currently, the PCU does not have the capacity to manage safeguard issues,
therefore to fill the gap under the capacity development component, the project will
recruit a safeguards specialist who will develop, implement and monitor the
environmental and safeguard tools and provide technical support to the PCU and other
respective line ministries to build capacity for safeguard compliance.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders include the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment as the
implementing agency, MFIs and their clients, BPC winners, Kenya Commercial Bank-
South Sudan, and Equity Bank which will provide the BPC loans, and the GOSS in
general.
