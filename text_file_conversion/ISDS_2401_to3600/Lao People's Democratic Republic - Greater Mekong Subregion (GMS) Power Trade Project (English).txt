2. Project Objectives
The objective of the Project is to enhance regional power trade within the Greater
Mekong Sub-Region with a view to also bringing reliable electricity to the Saravan
province in Lao PDR, and creating the conditions for eventual interconnections of Lao
PDR with other countries of the region.

3. Project Description
The Project consists of the following activities before and after the proposed
restructuring:

Component L-1: Cancelled.
Component L-1-b (new): Extension of the Saphaothong and Ban Na substations,
construction of a small building within the developed perimeter of existing substation,
changes of bus bars, addition of second bay to connect the second circuit of the already
built double circuit line (Ban Na – Saphathong), second 115/22kV power transformer to
provide secure supplies to the region and additional outgoing 22kV circuits.


Component L-2: Construction of a 115 kV transmission system from Xeset 1 substation
to Saravan now complete and operational since 2011.


Component L-3 (modified): Activities to facilitate implementation of Components L-1-
b and L-2, including: (i) consulting services for project management and design of L-1-b
and L-2; (ii) mitigation of social and environmental impacts of L-1-b and L-2; and (iii)
provisions of vehicle, computers and office equipment.


Component L-4 (modified): Consulting services only for the scoping and technical
specification design for Load Dispatch Center (LCD) and the Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.


Component L-5: Feasibility study of Houay Lamphan Gnai Hydropower Project –
(completed).

Component L-6: Cancelled.

Component L-7: Technical assistance to Electricité du Laos (EdL) to update the Tariff
Study – (completed).

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis

The component L 1: Construction of the high voltage transmission line from the Ban Hat
in southern Lao PDR to the Cambodia Border under the original project design has now
been cancelled due to unilateral withdrawal by the Cambodian side. Following the
request from the GOL in March 2013 to utilize eligible undisbursed grand, while
maintaining the PDOs, a new project has been identified at Saphaothong and Ban Na
substation     in    Attapeu      and      Champak        provinces,      respectively.


The new component L 1 includes the installation of one each, 115kV circuit breakers at
Saphaothong and Ban Na substations to connect the existing second circuit of the double
CCT line from the terminal tower to the substation busbars. This existing 115kV double
circuit line (currently one circuit is connected) was built under Indian funding some 7
years ago but the second circuit was not terminated due to shortage of funds.


It will also involve a) the extension of existing building to accommodate the expansion of
the substation, b) replacement of inadequately sized bus bars to align it with current
utility substation standards, c) installation of additional 115/22kV power transformer to
provide secures and reliable supplies to the region and d) associated additional outgoing
22kV circuits. Minor civil works will be undertaken for the installation of the electrical
equipment,       within     the      compound        of      the   existing    substation.
All new activities under the new component L 1 will be carried out within the existing
boundary of the sub-stations. No other new physical investment is required under
restructuring.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Safeguard performance of the on-going project, both the environmental and social sides,
is satisfactory.

The proposed expansion of transmission capacity of existing substations will be carried
out within the existing sub-stations that have been under operation. The expansion
activities will involve minor civil works (such as expansion of office building, cable
trenches, transformer foundations, and excavation works). There are likely to be some
concerns relating to inconveniences or nuisances (e.g., dust, noise, construction waste) to
surrounding areas during construction. However, these potential impacts on the
environment are deemed to be minor, site-specific, and reversible in nature, and for
which mitigation measures can be readily designed. Given the nature and small scale of
the proposed civil works under the expansion project, a formal environmental assessment
report is not considered necessary. For the purpose of enhancing environmentally-
friendly measures and mitigating any adverse impacts caused by the construction
activities, the existing EMP of Xeset-Saravan 115kV transmission line is updated
according to the nature of new investment including requirements on monitoring,
supervision and reporting. The revised EMP has been disclosed locally and in the Bank’s
Info Shop, both in English and in Lao languages and it will be included in bidding
documents.

No new social impact is expected to occur as a result of the restructuring. All civil works
will be carried out within the existing premises of the substations, and no impact beyond
the boundaries of the substations is expected to occur; no land acquisition, physical
relocation or asset loss is expected to occur.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

No major indirect and/or long term impacts are anticipated.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

No alternatives are required. All civil works will be carried out within the existing
premises of the substations, and no impact beyond the boundaries of the substations is
expected to occur.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

Environment Management Plans for the proposed expansion of capacity of existing sub-
stations have been revised and reviewed by the Bank. Implementation of these plans will
be monitored as covenants of the proposed Grant. EDL has a successful experience in
environmental and social impacts mitigation with the previous and ongoing projects
financed by IDA, and has an adequate and proven capacity to plan and implement
safeguard instruments under the project. The GMS project office, the corporate
Environmental Office at EDL headquarters, EDL branch offices, and provincial
environmental management committee comprising of provincial and district officials at
provincial level, would be responsible for the implementation of environmental and
social safeguards. Safeguard capacities of EdL, especially branch offices, is expected to
be further enhanced through the Safeguard Capacity Building program to be implemented
under the on-going REP II Project financed by IDA.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Local governments and local population in the project areas were consulted. The existing
EMP of Xeset-Saravan 115kV transmission line is updated according to the nature of
new investment including requirements on monitoring, supervision, reporting, and
budgeting. The revised EMP will be disclosed locally and in the Bank’s Info Shop, both
in English and in Lao languages and it will be included in bidding documents.
