2. Project Objectives
To improve access to sustainable basic infrastructure and services for the most
disadvantaged rural communities selected in some of the poorest municipalities of
Bolivia.

3. Project Description
Component 1: Community capacity building. This component would finance technical
assistance, training and capacity building for rural communities and community-based
organizations to enable and empower them for the identification and implementation of
community investments financed under

  Component 2: Community-Driven Development Investment. This component would
finance, on a matching-grant basis, the implementation of small-scale investment
subprojects presented by rural communities to respond to their self-identified priorities.
Given the demand-driven nature of the Project, communities would have an open menu
of social and economic investments, including rural infrastructure, basic services,
vulnerability-reduction and food security activities, nutrition, and management of natural
resources.

  Component 3: Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation. This component would
support the establishment and operation, within the Ministry of Rural Development and
Lands (MRDL/Empoderar), of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) comprising a lean
team responsible for the technical, administrative and fiduciary management of the
project at the central level, and two regional units at the decentralized level.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The preliminary intervention area comprises 51 municipalities within the departments of
La Paz, Oruro, Chuquisaca, and Cochabamba. The four departments are in the Bolivia
highlands (altiplano and valles) and are among the poorest regions of the country.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Based on experience with similar operations, potential negative ENVIRONMENTAL
impacts are likely to include: soil erosion, water and soil pollution, loss of vegetation,
increase in solid and liquid waste, pesticide poisoning, and pesticide residues in the food
chain.
  The Project is expected to contribute to build the productivity capacity of the famers by
financing subprojects and by providing training and technical assistance. It is expected
that these activities would also contribute to increase productivity and reduce agriculture
vulnerability. The Project design and implementation strategy includes elements to
ensure that women will participate in identification and selection of subproject and will
benefit of the Project technology transfers.
 The Indigenous Peoples Policy (OP/BP 4.10) is triggered to ensure that indigenous
peoples are properly informed and consulted. Since about 95% of the beneficiaries are
indigenous peoples the Project has been designed as an Indigenous Peoples Project taking
into consideration all the elements of the Policy.

  Negative impacts to indigenous communities and to women will be avoided. However,
it is expected that in extreme occasions potential adverse SOCIAL impacts could occur as
a result of some of the investments (subprojects). Some of these impacts could be loss of
livelihoods due to displacement caused by the rehabilitation of feeder roads or
community infrastructure, exclusion of vulnerable sectors, household conflict generated
by positive discrimination towards women. To prevent these impacts the Involuntary
Resettlement Policy 4.12 is triggered and the Borrower has prepared an Involuntary
Resettlement Framework.

 Potential adverse HEALTH impacts could include: possible pesticide poisoning due to
the unsafe application and management of pesticides and herbicides by untrained
personnel; possible exposure to dust and noise for population near construction sites.


 The following safeguards are triggered:

 OP/BP 4.01 - Environmental Assessment. This policy is triggered because the physical
interventions financed under Component 2 could have negative impacts on the
environment, even though small in scale and localized. Such investments might include:
rehabilitation of existing rural feeder roads; small-scale irrigation systems; water systems;
rural electricity supply; and other small-scale infrastructure. Because these subprojects
involve mostly small-scale activities, the incremental environmental impacts are expected
to be low. Since the type, scale and localization of specific subprojects was unknown at
appraisal, the Borrower prepared an Environmental Management Framework, detailing
the environmental screening process and a negative list that would exclude any sensitive
environmental sites from being financed by the Project. The Project will not finance any
subproject hat would be considered as a Category A under the World Bank definition.

  OP/BP 4.04 - Natural Habitats. Most project activities would be implemented in areas
already under agricultural production. However, the potential impacts on critical natural
habitats would be explored as part of the subproject screening process. Subprojects could
be located in areas close to critical natural habitats or protected areas but subprojects
which imply significant degradation or conversion of natural habitats would not be
financed. Subprojects within protected areas (national and provincial) would not be
eligible for funding. Subproject in areas with other conservation statuses (Ramsar sites,
Birdlife IBAS, etc.) would be considered ineligible unless otherwise compatible with the
ESMF.

 OP 4.09 - Pest Management. The policy is triggered because investments in agriculture
(small irrigation schemes, improvement of food-security production, etc.) might lead to
increased use of pesticides. Integrated pest management would be a part of subproject
activities under Component 2. Any procurement of pesticides would comply with the
requirements of OP 4.09 which lists pesticides ineligible for Bank financing. A positive
list has been prepared to identify pesticides that can be used and is included in the ESMF.
In addition, the ESMF requires the preparation of Pest Management Plans and includes
guidelines for Integrated Pest Management.

 OP/BP 4.10 - Indigenous Peoples. The policy is triggered because it is expected that
about 95 percent of the potential beneficiaries would be indigenous peoples (IP). For this
reason the whole operation is considered as an Indigenous Peoples Project and no
separate Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework is being prepared, apart from the
Social Assessment. The PAD and ESMF specify measures and mechanisms to ensure that
cultural patterns and socio-economic characteristics of the indigenous peoples are taken
into account during the design and implementation stages. More specifically, the
subproject cycle, the information, consultation and participation strategy, as well as the
capacity-building strategy include the linguistic, cultural, generational and gender
approaches to ensure that the Project is suitable to the main beneficiaries cultural
patterns. Gender aspects are being systematically
 considered and addressed, but are not the focus of this summary on safeguard issues.

 OP/BP 4.11 - Physical Cultural Resources. While the project would not finance any
subproject with known potential negative impacts on physical cultural resources, sacred
and/or religious sites, it is possible that excavations could unearth cultural artifacts. The
ESMF includes measures to ensure that these sites are timely determined and respected
before proceeding with the approval of subproject financing. The ESMF also details how
to deal with chance finds or such physical cultural resources.

 OP/BP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement. As the Project involves small-scale community
investments, no significant involuntary resettlement or land acquisition is anticipated.
However, works related, in particular, to the construction or rehabilitation of irrigation or
water systems, the rehabilitation of rural feeder roads, and/or rural electrification
connections might lead to involuntary displacement, loss of assets, and/or land. Land
needed for rehabilitation/construction could only be obtained through voluntary
donations, compensation paid by the community and/or by the government. For
government land, documentation would be needed to ensure that the land is free of
encroachments, squatters or any other encumbrances and has been transferred to the
beneficiaries by authorized government authorities. The Borrower will prepare a
Resettlement Policy Framework, as part of the ESMF.

 OP 4.36 - Forests. The project screening mechanism would identify subprojects with
potential impacts on forests. Subprojects impacting forests or involving establishment of
plantations would require a deeper environmental analysis.

 OP 4.37 - Safety of Dams. While the Project would not finance building of any large
dam, it is possible that irrigation or water supply subprojects financed under Component
2 might depend on the storage and operation of an existing dam for their supply of water
and may not function if the dam failed. The ESMF stipulates that financing of any such
subproject requires a preliminary specialized dam safety assessment, including a review
and evaluation of the operation and maintenance procedures of the existing dam and the
presentation of a written report including finding and recommendations for any remedial
work or safety related measures, which, if needed, have to be undertaken before the start
of operations on the relevant subproject.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Even though all efforts would be made to avoid this possibility, the Project could lead to
cases of resettlement, loss of assets and/or loss of land in connection with rehabilitation
or construction of rural infrastructure. However, the option of limiting the intervention to
rehabilitation and to small-scale infrastructures should considerably reduce the number
and the extent of these cases, and as result the positive impact of the Project in the socio-
economic development of the communities. For this reason, the Borrower will prepare an
Involuntary Resettlement Policy Framework to ensure that the relevant safeguard policy
is complied with and that the development objective of the Project is not compromised.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The following options have been selected in order to avoid or minimize potential
impacts:
 1) subprojects limited to community-scale investments
 2) intervention on rural feeder roads limited to rehabilitation (construction of new rural
roads is not eligible)
 3) positive exclusion of sensible areas such as Natural Habitats and Permanent Forests.
 4) limitation of activities that could cause resettlement or relocation.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower capacity to address social and environmental issues and relevant safeguard
policies appears to be adequate, as assessed based on recent successful experiences
managing other Bank-financed projects in rural Bolivia (Rural Alliances Project and
Rural Participatory Development Project). Compliance with the environmental
safeguards policies would be ensured through the recruitment of environmental and
social specialists with knowledge on indigenous cultures in the project regional
coordination teams. Monitoring with specific indicators, disaggregated by gender and age
groups, will be in place to measure project benefits and impacts for indigenous peoples as
well as compliance with the ESMF.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The vast majority (95 percent) of the beneficiary would be indigenous people, living in
rural communities within municipalities selected based on their degree of vulnerability.
 Beneficiaries and local stakeholder have been consulted during project preparation, in
particular through meetings, focus groups, and workshops held in the affected rural areas.
 Disclosure of safeguard documents will be done in all municipalities targeted by the
Project.
