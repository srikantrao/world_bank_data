                              value arising from natural gas development (financial, social, and environmental) in Tanzania.
                              Component B aims at strengthening the capacity of the major institutions that deal with the oil and gas sector as well as the power generation
                              sector to allow them to execute their mandates in a way that is conducive to investments and ensures that all safeguards and safety standards are
                              met to international standards. Component C focuses on enhancing technical skills in the sector through support to the Vocational Education
                              Training Authority (VETA). Component D will increase the capacity of the GoT and its institutions to attract and develop power generation projects
                              with private sector sponsors/financing. Finally, Component E will support Project coordination among the various implementing agencies.

                              Component A: Petroleum Policy and Legal Framework. The proposed component supports the GoT in ensuring that (A.1) the Petroleum Policy
                              and Strategy are updated to maximize value arising from natural gas development (financial, social, and environmental); and (A.2) the Legal and
                              Regulatory Framework for the Gas sector reflects the Governments policies and strategies for the sector and attracts foreign and local
                              investments to the sector.

                              Component B: Strengthening Institutional Sector Management, Coordination and Governance. The aim of this component is to strengthen the
                              organizational capacity and coordination among key sector institutions (MEM, EWURA, TPDC, NEMC, OSHA and EITI) involved in the countrys
                              gas sector development. The proposed support is grouped into four sub-components: (B.1) Strengthen Sector Coordination and Governance; (B.2)
                              Enhancing Organizational Capacity; (B.3) Environmental and Social Management; and (B.4) Health and Safety Management

                              Component C: Education and Skills Development. The capacity building activities envisaged for VETA under this component are expected to
                              increase the availability of vocational training capacity for the gas sector of Tanzania in alignment with the projection of employment growth in the
                              public and private parts of the sector. Activities being financed include (1) support to VETA to develop and implement an Educational Development
                              Plan; (2) the purchase of equipment, tools and consumables necessary for executing the Educational Development Plan; and (3) administrative
                              and logistics support for the Training Center including coordination and supervision missions from a Training Advisor until end of project, as well as
                              additional training of new instructors.

                              Component D: Power Generation and Natural Gas PPP Projects Capacity Assistance. This component will increase capacity of GoT and its
                              institutions (MEM and TANESCO) to attract and develop power generation projects with private sector sponsors/financing (excluding deals based
                              SPP framework) The proposed support under this component of the project is grouped into two sub-components: (1) MEM PPP Node Support; (2)
                              TANESCO PPP Node Support.

                              Component E: Project Coordination This component supports the Project Steering Committee as well as the Project Management Teams (PMT) of
                              the four Implementing Agencies (IAs), namely MEM, TANESCO, TPDC and EWURA. It will enhance the IAs capacity for procurement and
                              financial management, through the provision of technical advisory services, training, operating costs and acquisition of goods.

                                                                                                                                                                        Page 1 of 3
                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               This technical assistance project is expected to have positive social impacts. The focus on sound governance and improved management of the
                               gas sub-sector will benefit the population of Tanzania and the education and skills development activities will allow a greater number of
                               Tanzanians to be equipped for work in the sector. The component supporting vocational training (Component C) will show government
                               commitment to training and development of skills in the country that are expected to generate employment for Tanzanians in the public and private
                               gas sector.

                               The upgrading of NEMC's ability to respond to oil and gas- related incidents is another element of the project designed to attenuate social impacts
                               of the oil and gas sector. A package of capacity building activities has been agreed with NEMC that is expected to help NEMC provide effective
                               and efficient oversight of the oil and gas sector in accordance with sector-related environmental regulation and in line with international best
                               practice, to provide guidance on systematically integrating environmental and socio-economic concerns in project development, operations and
                               maintenance of oil and gas sector activities, to prepare NEMC staff to execute its responsibilities under the Environmental Laws and regulations in
                               the gas sector effectively and efficiently and to prepare communities to participate in the early warning/response system.

                               Finally, a package of capacity building activities will strengthen OSHAs capabilities to provide effective and efficient oversight of the oil and gas
                               sector in accordance with sector-related health and safety regulation and in line with international best practice.

                               The project will fund installation of laboratory equipment, work that will be guided by applicable local and national laws and regulations. The project
                               will also finance acquisition of data storage and training equipment, consulting services, training courses and technical assistance. The project will
                               not fund construction of new infrastructure and it will not lead to land acquisition nor will it deprive people of access to their usual means of
                               livelihood. Thus, no significant adverse environmental or social impacts are anticipated.

                               Moreover, project support to NEMC (Component A.2 and B.3) and OSHA (A.2 and B.4) is designed to enhance the NEMCs ability to improve
                               management of potential environmental impacts generated from future activities in the oil and gas sector and OSHAs ability to provide effective
                               and efficient oversight of the oil and gas sector in accordance with sector-related safety regulations and in line with international best practice.

                               The project is also expected to finance feasibility studies for gas and electricity infrastructure projects. As such, the project is classified as a
                               Category B project, therefore OP4.01 is triggered and a Strategic Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (SESIA), supported through
                               Component B.3 will provide guidance to NEMC and MEM on systematically integrating environmental and socio-economic concerns in
                               development, operations and maintenance of oil and gas sector activities. A Consulting firm will be hired to prepare the SESIA in accordance with
                               the SESIA ToR that has been agreed between the World Bank and NEMC. NEMC will hold a public consultation meeting on the ToR with a wide
                               range of public stakeholders, including the local oil and gas industry, civil society, and relevant government agencies to allow for any comments on
                               those ToR.

                               and implement the measures described.
                               The GOT prepared the Terms of Reference for the SESIA and will conduct this SESIA during project implementation. The TOR, jointly
                              prepared with the safeguards colleagues and cleared by ASPEN, have been disclosed [in country] and in the InfoShop for stakeholder review.
                              Consultations on the draft TORs will be conducted with a broad range of stakeholders. A senior environmental safeguards specialist and a
                              social development specialist are included in the World Bank team to review the SESIA and the environmental, social and safety guidelines.
                              The draft guidelines will be referred to the Bank for review prior to formal adoption in the national regulatory system.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                               Key stakeholders are: government agencies involved with economic development; environment, health and safety, and regulation of oil and
