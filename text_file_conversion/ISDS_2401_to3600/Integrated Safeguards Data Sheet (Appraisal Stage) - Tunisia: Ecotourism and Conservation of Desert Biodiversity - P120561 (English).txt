                              Component 1: Promoting enabling conditions for protected area (PA) management and ecotourism development. Support through this component
                              will be organized as follows:
                              (i)             Reinforcing the institutional, legal and strategic framework through the (a) preparation or updating of National Park (NP)
                              Management Plans in the three targeted NPs using a participatory approach, and the identification of priority investments; (b) revision of the
                              national legislative, regulatory, and institutional PA management and ecotourism development framework, as currently mandated by the national
                              Forestry Code and the national classification of accommodations; and (c) the development of an international, national, and local ecotourism
                              marketing strategy to promote the three targeted NPs, including communications packages;
                              (ii)       Building and mainstreaming national and local capacities through the (a) reinforcement of the material capacity for NP management in
                              the targeted NPs; (b) reinforcement of the human capacity in the targeted NPs; (c) delivery of adaptive training packages to key stakeholders in PA
                              management, ecotourism development, and environmental education, including NP staff, local communities, the private sector, and others; and (d)
                              delivery of initial training to key staff of the autonomous PA management agency once established; and
                              (iii)      Establishing the project M&E system through the: (a) acquisition and operation of the project M&E system; and (b) capacity building and

                              Component 2: Supporting the implementation of NP Management Plans. Support through this component will be organized as follows:
                              (i)        Implementing identified priority investments in NP Management Plans;
                              (ii)       Mobilizing partnerships with local communities and the private sector around targeted NPs through the implementation of a small grants
                              program for (a) not-for-profit activities targeting local associations linked to the management and development of the NPs and the improvement of
                              the local environment; and (b) for-profit activities targeting the development of micro-enterprises linked to ecotourism (individuals or groups, with a
                              focus on women and young entrepreneurs);
                              (iii)      Implementing environmental awareness investments, namely the rehabilitation of the ecomuseum within each targeted NP, and the
                              establishment of one eco-shop per targeted NP; and
                              (iv)       Promoting a public-private-partnership (PPP) initiative through the introduction of incentive frameworks, financial mechanisms and
                              ecotourism concessions for the private sector with a view to encouraging investment in ecotourism development.

                              Component 3: Project management. This component will support the establishment and operationalization of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
                              within the General Direction for Ecotourism and Quality of Life (DGEQV) of the Ministry of Environment (MoE), through the provision of goods,
                              consultant services (training, study tours), and incremental operating costs associated with project management and implementation, including
                              procurement and financial management.

                               Governorate) NPs will be targeted. In the center-west, Bouhedma NP (Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa Governorates ) will be targeted. The choice of the
                               NPs for project purposes was based on a short-list using specific eligibility criteria agreed between the Bank team and the National Steering
                               Committee (e.g., the existence of significant biodiversity after IUCN classification, level of threat to biodiversity, location within existing tourist
                               circuits, ecotourism potential, appropriateness for replication, location within an arid zone, etc.).

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The potential negative impacts are: (i) impacts from small-scale construction in targeted NPs (road improvements, visitor centers,
                                  ecomuseums, sanitary facilities); and (ii) waste and sewage management from ecotourism infrastructure. For construction works of any size
                                  (path improvements, new structures such as visitor centers and ecomuseums), clear environmental guidelines will be established and will be
                                  enforced by contractors using a basic, pragmatic Environmental Management Plan (EMP) format that will be included as part of the
                                  environmental guidelines.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   Indirect impacts such as the destruction of vegetation, degradation of water resources, health risks, disturbance of wildlife, species extinction,
                                  etc., are considered to be low to moderate and localized given the small size of subprojects. Cumulative impacts and long term impacts are
                                  difficult to estimate at this stage as specific subprojects have not been identified prior to appraisal. However, the risks they may pose to the
                                  environment can be easily controlled with appropriate mitigation measures concerning the application of environmental conditions relating to
                                  construction activities, water and waste management, compliance with authorization procedures for water wells, as well as maintenance and
                                  operations.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                   The NP Management Plans for each of the three parks will provide alternatives to minimize possible conflicts arising from changes in the
                                  management of NPs and minimize potential conflicts between activities implemented on the basis of community decision and PPP
                                  arrangements.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan

                            The DGEQV is one of the operational general directions of the MoE. It has a 40 technical staff divided into three departments: Ecology/
                           Biodiversity, Industrial Development, and Urban Development. Five of the technical staff are acting as technical experts for reviewing
                           environmental impact assessments (EIA) for the National Agency for Environmental Protection (ANPE), which is the regulatory environment
                           agency for EIA of the MoE. They have received substantial training on EIA, and two of these staff have received training on the Bank’s
                           safeguard policies and are managing/have managed two GEF funded projects, namely the Second Natural Resources Management Project
                           (PGRN2) and the Gulf de Gabès Marine and Coastal Resources Protection Project. Furthermore, the ANPE has adequate staff and expertise
                           on environmental assessment and could provide technical expertise, in addition to EIA national consultants, who will be financed through this

                           project. The Bank has prepared four safeguard diagnostic reviews (SDR) for the use of country systems in waste management, natural
                           resources, as well as for the Second Water Sector Management Project (PISEAU II) and Fourth Northwest Mountainous and Forested Areas
                           Development Project (PNO4). The SDR assessed the capacity of the ANPE and found it acceptable.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            The project is based on a participatory approach that establishes cooperative relations between the PCU, the partner institutions (i.e, Regional
                           Commissariats for Agricultural Development, General Direction for Forests of the Ministry of Agriculture, National Tunisian Tourism Office of the
                           Ministry of Tourism) and key stakeholders at the local level, including project beneficiaries. Project beneficiaries are local communities and
                           community groups/organizations, including farmers' associations/cooperatives, women's organizations, youth organizations, community
                           development groups, and environmental NGOs in the areas where targeted NPs are located. A social analysis has been undertaken under this
                           Project and has identified the socioeconomic conditions of the communities and the project affected people (PAPs). The PAPs are the
                           communities which are living at the periphery of the targeted NPs.
