                              To harmonize medicines registration systems and to improve efficiency and enhance transparency in medicines registration among the East
                              African Community Partner States.

                              3. Project Description

                              Lack of standardization, cumbersome and non-transparent processes for medicine registration create uncertainty and high costs for the

                              manufacturers registering new drugs. They are often confronted with numerous and different regulatory requirements, delays in registration, and
                              lack of transparency in the process. As a result, the availability of some much-needed medicines and vaccines for the neglected tropical diseases
                              and high burden diseases is delayed. Manufacturers may also decide that it is not worth registering additional brands of well-known generic
                              medicines, reducing effective competition and contributing to high medicine prices adversely affecting the poor.

                              The success of this harmonization initiative is expected to result in a continuum of change, starting with the use of harmonized protocols by the
                              countries and gradually moving towards a system of mutual recognition by countries within the regional economic block. Finally, it could result in a
                              broader harmonized regulatory environment that extends beyond the EAC to other regional economic communities in the African region.

                              To achieve the development objectives, the project proposes to have two components:
                              a)         Regional Coordination and Capacity Building for Medicines Regulatory Harmonization (USD2.40 million): This activity will be led by the
                              EAC and includes the establishment of the regional steering Committee, project coordination team, regional technical working groups, regional
                              capacity building at EAC level and support to country focal points for developing harmonized protocols for medicines registration and GMP
                              inspections. The intermediate outcomes will include harmonized guidelines, standard operating procedures and manuals by 2012, and the
                              establishment of the EAC Commission on Medicines and Food Safety by 2015. The activities supported will include operating costs at EAC level
                              but most of the funds are expected to be used for the direct benefit of the NMRAs in EAC countries.
                              The EAC will contract an ICT consulting agency to undertake a comprehensive systems requirement study for medicines registration at the
                              national and regional levels, and to develop a national and regional web- based data management information system for effective sharing of
                              information on medicines registration by 2013. Countries are expected to start using the information management system for medicines
                              registration from 2014.
                              b)         Institutional Development and Strengthening of National Medicines Regulatory Authorities (USD3.13 Million): The support to NMRAs will
                              be based on the institutional assessments undertaken by NEPAD and WHO. The project will support additional staff for newly established NMRAs
                              and training of staff in areas of project management (25); quality assessment and safety of medicines (24); GMP inspections (24); and
                              assessments and exchange visits for regulatory staff within and outside the region. The project will also support twinning of newly established
                              NMRAs with existing NMRAs in the region including implementation of quality management systems as well as internal and external audits to
                              enable a number of the NMRAs to achieve ISO certification in quality management system by 2015.
                              The activities supported include personnel, training, consultant support, supply of ICT equipment and software, ISO certification, country level
                              workshops and meetings. The project will support appropriate ICT hardware and software procurement, consultant support including licensing,
                              maintenance and training at NMRA and EAC levels and any required capacity building activities. It is expected the NMRAs will be using a common
                              information management system for medicines regulation from 2014 onwards.
                              Among participating NMRAs, the project will support the development of regional centres for regulatory excellence s covering areas such as
                              Quality Management Systems, ICT, Registration, Pharmacovigilance and GMP. It is expected that from 2013, these centres of excellence will

                               serve as training facilities for in-service training of the regulatory staff and help the countries to move toward effective implementation of the mutual
                               recognition policy frameworks and guidelines.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The project will be implemented in all five EAC countries, namely Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.
