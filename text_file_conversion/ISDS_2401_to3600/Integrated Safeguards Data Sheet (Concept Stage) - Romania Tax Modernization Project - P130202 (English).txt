                              The development objective is to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the revenue administration to collect tax and social contribution
                              revenues and to reduce the cost of taxpayer compliance.

                              The long-term vision is a revenue administration with streamlined business processes based on self-assessment and supported by risk-based
                              compliance management, strong reliance on electronic communication with taxpayers, and skilled and professional staff, all contributing to an

                              efficient but taxpayer-friendly, client-oriented environment characterized by fairness, honesty, and transparency. The modernized revenue
                              administration will improve business environment and increase country's competitiveness to attract foreign direct investment.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project would seek to improve the institutional arrangements and management systems to take full advantage of a highly
                              automated, low-discretion, risk-based system. The project will entail an investment over a period of five years needed to achieve the stated
                              government objectives, including the related organizational restructuring and development, management, and infrastructurechanges necessary for
                              optimal deployment of an integrated automation system. The project would include financial and technical support for revenue collection
                              methodologies and procedures; information technology and other technological infrastructure; training, and technical assistance to underpin
                              NAFA’s management decisions on organization structure and management, and operational systems refinements necessary to ensure that the
                              economy reaps the full benefits of the investment. Measurement of intermediate outcomes will be integrated into the project in order to provide
                              relevant and timely feedback as to the progress of the project.
                              Project components would include:

                              Component 1: Institutional Development. The component would develop a modern organization and management structure, instill a strategic focus
                              and a strong focus on integrity, rationalize the regional structure to increase NAFA’s effectiveness, and strengthen human resource management
                              through targeted professional training and technical assistance. This component would also improve the analytical capacity required to support
                              strategic management of NAFA and would support an improved appeals process.

                              Component 2: Business processes and IT infrastructure (EUR 65 million). This component would streamline business processes and work-flows,
                              and invest in the modernization of core IT systems to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by automation in NAFA’s back office
                              operations, as well as in the interaction with taxpayers and contributors. The component would also strengthen the effectiveness of audit and
                              enforcement functions, including the collection of arrears. This will be achieved by: (i) modernizing tax audit functions, intelligence and preventive
                              functions; (ii) upgrading IT management function within NAFA to manage all NAFA IT resources, including staff, countrywide following office
                              consolidation; (iii) reengineering business processes; (iv) implementing electronic document management and archiving; (v) developing and
                              implementing integrated revenue management system (IRMS); (vi) upgrading NAFA’s information and communications technology (ICT)
                              infrastructure, including centralized developing centralized data processing center, data warehouse and a business continuity center capable of
                              sustaining all NAFA operations with no data loss in case of a disaster.

                              Component 3: Taxpayer Services and Corporate Communication. This component will finance activities aimed at modernizing taxpayer services;
                              creating mechanisms for transparency and accountability, such as oversight panels and community surveys, to ensure fair community input;
                               modernizing call centers to provide advanced services to taxpayers; promoting community understanding of revenue laws, procedures and rights
                               and obligations of taxpayers; promoting taxpayer efficiency through simplification and provision of electronic services and participation in improving
                               the appeals procedures; and strengthening external and internal communication.

                               Component 4: Project Coordination and Management. The Project will have a Project Management Unit (PMU) and a Change Management Unit
                               (CMU), which will provide the direction and lead the development of NAFA and will be responsible for managing the changes necessary to eff ect
                               the implementation of each component and related activities of NAFA.

                               Preliminary estimates indicate that the total amount o fthe project could be approximately $100 million. These estimates are based on the 2010
                               IMF TA Report, a previously designed Bank Revenue Administration Reform investment project and the December 2010 World Bank identification
                               mission. A more precise cost estimate will be worked on during project preparation. The bulk of the cost will be on IT and operations modernization
                               which will be underpinned by the reforms in organizational management and tax processes and operations. The Government contribution will be
                               discussed with the Ministry of Public Finance.
