                              The objectives of the Project are an improved condition and quality of sections of the M-03 road and increased safety on roads in Ukraine. The
                              proposed project is a follow-on (or repeater) project to the ongoing Roads and Safety Improvement Project (RSIP, Loan No. 7677-UA) which was
                              approved by the Board in 2009 in the amount of $400 million. The ongoing RSIP is being implemented with satisfactory ratings and US$ 172
                              million (43 percent) disbursed as of early April 2012. This proposed repeater project (RSIP2, hereafter) has the same development objective as the
                              ongoing RSIP. The proposed project will rehabilitate and upgrade additional sections of the same M-03 road and will improve road safety

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project will have three components:

                              Component One: Road Rehabilitation and Upgrading between Lubny and Poltava ($397.0 million). The RSIP2 will rehabilitate and upgrade the
                              section of the M-03 road between Lubny and Poltava. This is the direct continuation of the M-03 road section that is being rehabilitated under the
                              ongoing RSIP project. It links central Ukraine and Kiev with the eastern industrial region of Ukraine and the border with Russia. The project road
                              sections mostly run through rural areas with very little population, on a flat to slightly rolling terrain, with many long straight sections and only a few
                              slight curves. The road presently carries about 16,000 vehicles per day with a high share of heavy vehicles (around 40 percent). The existing
                              Lubny-Poltava road has a length of 165 km, of which 55 km have four lanes and the remainder has only two lanes. The project will upgrade the
                              existing two-lane road sections to a four-lane road (category I.b) with median. It will also rehabilitate the existing four-lane road sections. The
                              existing road presently receives routine maintenance, but has not received periodic maintenance for more than twenty years; therefore is highly
                              deteriorated with an average roughness more than 6 IRI, m/km. The project will also include two bypasses designed to improve the alignment of
                              the road and go around two small villages, and another bypass designed to avoid long-distance traffic having to go through the city of Poltava
                              (connection between M-03 and M-22 roads). Although the proposed short Poltava bypass may eventually become part of a larger Poltava bypass
                              road, at this time it is considered a stand-alone investment that is justified on its own as a connection between the M-03 and the M-22 roads.

                              Component Two: Road Safety ($50.0 million). This component will finance road infrastructure safety improvements on 2 to 4 high risk road
                              sections and road corridors that will be identified by UKRAVTODOR, based on the safety inspection of about 1500 km of national roads with high
                              accident rates. The Road Safety Inspection will be carried out using the International Road Assessment Program (iRAP) risk mapping and star
                              rating protocols. The corridors to be improved under the RSIP2 will be selected and prioritized primarily on the basis of cost-benefit analysis. This
                              component will also improve the two existing village road sections in the villages where bypasses are to be built under Component 1.

                              Component Three: Institutional Support and Strengthening ($3.0 million). In order to enhance the local capacity to plan and execute road safety
                              interventions in Ukraine, the project will finance TA in the form of training, and through an iRAP accreditation program for staff of UKRAVTODOR
                              and other agencies. This will be in the form of a 3-step capacity building program: Step 1: An accredited foreign road survey company will be
                              hired to carry out safety inspections of the 22,000 km of national roads in collaboration with staff from UKRAVTODOR and other Ukrainian
                              institutions. This should lead to an accreditation by iRAP (International Road Assessment Program) for undertaking road safety inspections and
                              data coding. Step 2: Training for the State Scientific and Research Road Institute staff on the iRAP tools and protocols in order to develop risk
                              maps, star rating and safer roads investment plans for the entire UKRAVTODOR network (22,000 km) following the inspections. Step 3: Support
                              to UKRGIPRODOR staff towards including the iRAP results in the detailed design of roads in general, and in the design of specific road safety

                         interventions. The component may also include other types of technical support to strengthen the capacity of road sector institutions.

                         The total cost of the proposed RSIP2 is US$ 450 million net of taxes; this amount is to be funded through an IBRD SIL. The State budget will fund
                         the value-added taxes (VAT) expected to amount to US$ 112 million equivalent.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  Environmental: Risks are limited to the typical risks associated with road construction and rehabilitation projects. The severity of potential
                                 impacts is moderate and mostly limited to the construction period: (i) air pollution and noise from trucks and other construction machinery, and
                                 asphalt plants, (ii) soil disturbance, and (iii) tree-cutting. An Environmental Assessment has been prepared for all road sections to be repaired
                                 or upgraded, and for the new bypasses included in the project. The bypasses will go mainly through farmland and partially through forested
                                 areas. Protected areas will not be affected by the project.

                                 The area's primary ecological functions have long been significantly modified by human activities during the last centuries. Large-scale farming
                                 has dominated land use for several decades. The landscape was also significantly modified by the development of infrastructure associated
                                 with large-scale farming, populated villages and towns along the road (private housing, shops, public buildings and various local infrastructure
                                 facilities). In addition, the existing main road between Kyiv and Kharkiv was constructed more than 50 years ago and has changed the
                                 landscape and local ecosystems in the broader road corridor. Given that the ecosystems’ biological communities have been historically
                                 affected by the above economic and social activities, and taking into account that the road upgrading works will not result in significant
                                 conversion or degradation of natural habitats, OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats) will not be triggered.

                                 Forested areas touched by the project do not represent natural forests or related natural habitats. The predominant land use in the project area
                                 is agricultural and not dependent on forest cover. The project will affect only small segments of forested areas as a result of construction of
                                 bypasses. All forested areas affected by the project are planted with low-value tree species. Based on the above, OP 4.36 (Forests) is not
                                 triggered.

                                 Social: Social safeguard issues are associated with land acquisition necessary for construction of bypasses and interchanges, and for road
                                 widening. It is expected that land acquisition will affect mostly agricultural land. In two cases, single-family houses will be affected due to road
                                 widening (village of Belotserkivka, and village of Konoplianka). Owners of the houses have been contacted and informed of the potential road
                                 construction. At this stage, the two owners have expressed their desire to be offered alternative housing - one, within the same village, and the
                                 other in a neighboring village. No businesses or other income-generating activities have so far been identified as potentially affected by the
                                 project.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The project will not have indirect negative impacts, but will rather result in environmental, social and operational benefits due to improved
                                 access to markets and services, better vehicle operational conditions and better road safety. The project will also contribute to increased safety

                                 for pedestrians and for inhabitants of the villages along the road, especially in cases where bypasses will be constructed.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                   The proposed design of the road was chosen based on careful review of potential alternatives. The proposed specific location of the road
                                 includes sections (i) for road rehabilitation of the existing four lanes and (ii) for widening from two to four lanes, within the existing right of way
                                 and (iii) for the construction of new bypasses where road upgrading within the boundaries of villages/towns was not possible due to potential
                                 large-scale resettlement. Bypasses are also justified because they increase road safety for village residents.

                                 In selected cases, e.g. road straightening at Kovtuny village, road alignment plans were altered to avoid resettlement of single-family homes.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   For the purposes of the ongoing RSIP1 a corridor-specific Environmental Impact Assessment/OVOS (EIA/OVOS 2007) was prepared in 2007,
                                 documenting baseline conditions and environmental risks for the whole road Kyiv-Poltava. Based on this, a generic (or "framework")
                                 Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared (2007) and its disclosure and public consultations organized under RSIP1. Given that
                                 most of the road sections (except bypasses) proposed for financing under RSIP2 were already covered by this earlier EIA/OVOS 2007, the
                                 client now carried out the EIA/OVOS for the new sections/bypasses of the road not already covered under the earlier EIA/OVOS 2007. Based
                                 on the new EIA/OVOS report an Addendum to the earlier EMP Framework document was prepared. This Addendum represents the framework
                                 for the preparation of site-specific EMPs at the time of the preparation of final designs.

                                 UKRDORINVEST has experience of working on environmental safeguards under the ongoing RSIP1 and under other projects funded by
                                 EBRD/EIB. A designated full-time staff at UKRDORINVEST has been assigned to work on environmental issues in close collaboration with the
                                 road design institute (UKRGIPRODOR), local authorities and the Road Service of Poltava oblast. UKRDORINVEST has prior experience in
                                 organizing public consultations and organized such consultations on TOR for EIA/OVOS, draft EIA/OVOS reports, and on the Addendum to the
                                 Framework EMP in project locations. A recent site visit showed that the existing environmental safeguards management arrangements are
                                 functioning appropriately, demonstrated by the case when the number of trees that needed to be removed under the RSIP1 project had to be
                                 revised. The collaborative effort between the contractor, the supervision consultant and UKRDORINVEST led to an orderly review of the needs
                                 for tree cutting and a downward revision of the BOQ for the contractor.

                                 Under RSIP1, UKRDORINVEST (PIU) prepared a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (2007). In preparation for RSIP2, the PIU
                                 assigned a staff to prepare an updated and more detailed Resettlement Policy Framework (completed in February 2012 and updated in March
                                 2012) and also specific Resettlement Action Plans. The RAP for Component 1 of the RSIP2 has been completed in March 2012, covering the
                                 road sections where land acquisition and/or resettlement is expected. UKRAVTODOR has designated a staff member to monitor land
                                                                                                                                                                              Page 3 of 5
                           acquisition / resettlement to be carries out under the RSIP2 and report to the PIU and the World Bank any potential irregularities and
                           shortcomings during the implementation of the Resettlement Action Plan - both with respect to identified impacts, or related to additional
                           unexpected negative impacts occurring in the course of the project.

                           The PIU will also rely on close cooperation with regional authorities and the Poltava road service for monitoring resettlement and
                           compensations of PAPs in sub-projects. For land acquisition and resettlement, each six months the Poltava region road service will select a
                           random sample of cases, visit each, and report on the progress of land acquisition and resettlement. The results will be summarized in a report

                           to the project managers and the Bank which uses key performance indicators selected by the project and agreed in the RAP as reporting
                           topics.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            There are 83 communities in the area affected by the project, the majority of which are situated outside the immediate vicinity of the road as
                           such. The affected population of villages and towns in the area affected by the road constitutes about 230.000 people, or 793 inhabitants per
                           kilometer of road. Key stakeholder groups are: (a) the residents of areas affected by the road, (b) individuals and legal entities which will work
                           on the construction of the road, and (c ) individuals and legal entities in the project area which benefit from using the M03 road✎

                           Following the requirements for Category A projects, public consultations on the TOR for EA/OVOS were organized in five project locations
                           (Lubny, Khorol, Bilkotserkivka, Poltava, Reshetylivka) in October 2011. Public consultations on the draft EIA/OVOS reports were organized on
                           November 14, 2011 with participation of representatives of all rayons of the area of prospective construction. Key data and findings of these
                           EIA/OVOS reports were used for preparation of the Framework Addendum to EMP. Public consultations on the Framework Addendum to EMP
                           and Resettlement Policy Framework were organized by the client on December 23, 2011.
                           Preliminary consultations with owners of the two houses to be resettled have been held in December 2011 during which owners have stated
                           their desire to be provided with house and land of equivalent value to their property in the village of Belotserkivka. In early March 2012 the
                           Bank team, jointly with officials of UKRAVTODOR and Poltava Road Service visited the PAP's to be resettled; they confirmed their willingness
                           to be resettled to houses nearby.
