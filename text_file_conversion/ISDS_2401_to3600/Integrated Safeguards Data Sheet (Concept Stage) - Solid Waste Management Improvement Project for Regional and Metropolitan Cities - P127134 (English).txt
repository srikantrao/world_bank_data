                              C. Project Description

                              19.           The PDO will be achieved through the implementation of these four components, namely,

                              Component A: Improvements in Solid Waste Management Systems ($122.5m), these funds would be on-granted to the participating municipalities
                              and would finance the re-engineering and/or rehabilitation and/or closure of existing landfill/disposal sites, construction of new state of the art
                              sanitary landfills ( equipped with leachate treatment plants, heavy equipment such as compactors and bulldozers, facilities for staff/operator),
                              waste treatment systems (such as sorting and composting plants, landfill gas to energy/flaring plants, and or other treatment systems as
                              appropriate) and transfer stations. The 3 R approach ( reduce, re-cycle, re-use) will be incorporated in the design and infrastructure works to
                              minimize waste generation rates at the household level and local markets, and subsequently lowering collection, transfer and disposal costs, and
                              extending the life of the landfills. The selection criteria for participating provinces and municipalities which will include financial and technical
                              considerations, will be agreed upon as part of project preparation and will also be aligned with Indonesia's Master Plan 2011-2025. The draft
                              selection criteria are attached as Annex 2 of the PCN document. This component will be rolled out in two phases. Phase 1 investments will be
                              ready for implementation soon after project effectiveness and Phase 2 investments will be prepared, appraised and implemented in subsequent
                              years during project implementation. The potential Phase 1 and 2 groups of municipalities under consideration are the Cities of Semarang,
                              Yogyakarta, Medan, Bekasi and Tangerang. The tentative list of proposed investments are included in Annex 3 of the PCN document. The
                              proposed investments are presently subject to a feasibility study to ascertain their commercial, economic and technical viability. Both phases will
                              be completed within the five year life cycle of the project as the proposed lending instrument will be a specific investment loan (SIL). The proceeds
                              of the loan would be on-granted to the participating municipalities depending on the institutional and implementation arrangements agreed upon,
                              the relevant national regulations and other considerations.

                              Component B: Technical Assistance to support sustainable management system ($10m). This component is expected to be co-financed or parallel
                              financed as a donor grant. The source of financing will be confirmed during project preparation and will finance the technical assistance required to
                              support the institutional framework needed to sustainably operate and maintain the effective management of these systems. The government and
                              potential participating municipalities, given the past experiences in the sector, have suggested a partnership approach between the national and
                              participating municipal governments as the institutional framework to manage each provincial waste management system. The BLU approach
                              (Badan Layanan Usaha, as it is known under Indonesia regulations) involves establishing service units (in the Dinas Kebersihan, which is the
                              cleansing services department of the participating municipalities). The established BLU's would be set up with a clear and pre- defined
                              benchmarks. These benchmarks could include the completion of O&M contacts after a number of years to demonstrate how the improved systems
                              are to be managed, as well as the cost recovery measures and the allocation of operation budgets by the local parliament (DPRD). This
                              component will also provide support to establish a country wide CDM like Program of Activities (POA) for the solid waste management sector as a
                           whole to coordinate market based carbon revenue generation opportunities. This component will also include funding for setting up publically
                           accessible information based National Solid Waste Benchmarking System (NSWBS). Details of this system will be agreed upon during project
                           preparation but will include an incentive based mechanism to improve management of these operations.

                           Component C: Social Development Component ($5m). The funding source for this component will be confirmed during project preparation. This
                           component will address the social needs of waste pickers and affected host community members, particularly owners of livestock. Challenges
                           related to resettlement/land acquisition and the potential loss of livelihood for waste pickers and livestock owners will be comprehensively

                           addressed to help improve their social development outcomes. This component will not finance any physical investments or works associated with
                           landfill workers or livestock, as these need to be integrated into the landfill operations as a whole and are thus included in Component A. This
                           component will finance training, continuous consultations with affected households, participation activities and potentially a fund to address major
                           social concerns during preparation.

                           Component D: Advisory Services ($5m) will finance high level strategic and analytical studies to underpin advice to GoI and municipalities on
                           potential sector policy reform options going forward.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be implemented in larger-sized cities in Indonesia. The investments that will be supported will be in urban and peri-urban areas. As
                           mentioned in section C, the cities of Semarang, Medan, Yogyakarta, Tanggerang, and Bekasi are currently under consideration. Among these
                           only Yogyakarta will require physical resettlement of an estimated 15 households and the five hectares of land in question belongs to the
                           Sultanate. In the four remaining potential project sites some land acquisition is also likely to be required. Finally, waste pickers (numbers to be
                           determined) are active at the existing landfills, and members of host communities graze animals (cattle and goats) there.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Within the Ministry of Public Works, the Directorate of Bina Program will oversee project preparation activities, assisted by the Directorate of
                           Environmental Sanitation. Together they have adequate capacity to ensure that safeguards are properly addressed during project preparation.
                           The environmental and social impact management capacities of the Dinas Kebersihan (Sanitation Departments) in the cities are weak, and they
                           will need to be strengthened so that each city can have the necessary safeguards instruments prepared – a requirement that must be fulfilled prior
                           to consideration for funding under the project. A project implementation unit (PIU) will be established in each Dinas Kebersihan and will have
                           either qualified staff or consultants to handle safeguards during preparation and implementation. In order to address capacity issues, technical
                           assistance will be provided as part of component B.This will include capacity building and on the job training of staff at the municipal level.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and their timing1
                                  should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                    The project will be implemented in two phases. Safeguards documents for Phase 1 cities ( EIA's, ESMPs and RAPs) will be part of the
                                    package presented for Board approval. The studies for them will commence parallel with final feasibility studies, in April 2012 and are
                                    expected to be completed in October 2012. An ESMF will also be prepared and disclosed prior to appraisal; it will explain the procedures and
                                    institutional responsibilities for preparation, review and implementation of safeguards documents for Phase 2 cities. The corresponding studies
                                    for Phase 2 cities will begin during project preparation, in early 2014. Wherever possible, Indonesian and World Bank safeguards documents
                                    work will be coordinated so that a single report, either ANDAL or UKL/UPL, will meet the requirements of both.
