                              B. Project Objectives

                              The project development objective is to improve climate resilience of the West Coast Road and strengthen institutional capacity to climate-proof
                              the overall road network of Samoa.

                              Component 1. (US$17 million) Improving the Climate Change Resilience of the WCR. Under SIAM2, technical assistance was provided for a

                              detailed feasibility study for upgrading the drainage of the WCR to increase its resilience to extreme weather events. This project will implement
                              the finding and extend the works to include a general rehabilitation of the road profile and surface in the affected areas. The proposed construction
                              works on the WCR will address these recommendations through improvements to the road pavement,including raising and strengthening where
                              necessary, sealing the road shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross-drainage. These investments serve to:

                              (a) reduce road closures during extreme weather events and high sea levels;
                              (b) avoid surface flooding and impounding of water which contributes to road deterioration and impacts adversely on roadside communities;
                              (c) reduce road deterioration due to runoff and increasingly high water tables, and generally improve pavement quality to reduce future
                              maintenance requirements; and
                              (d) increase road safety and provide a roadside pathway for pedestrians.

                              All road reconstruction works are planned to take place within the existing road reserve, but the need to access roadside properties to complete
                              the associated drainage works wasidentified in the SIAM2 study. Technical assistance will also be provided for detailed design and supervision of
                              the WCR works. This component will also include a single consultant who will be responsible for design and supervision.

                              Component 2. (US$0.5 million) Vulnerability Assessment of the Samoa Road Network. This component involves technical assistance to assess the
                              climate change vulnerability of the main road network of Samoa as a whole, and prepare a climate resilience strategy for the road network. This
                              will involve using best available climate change information to identify key hazard types and risk levels (sea level rise, cyclones, extreme rainfall
                              and temperature events, etc), and then assessing the likely severity and timing of risk impacts for all links of the road network. Based on this
                              analysis, the study will then prepare a road network adaptation strategy that will identify specific locations that will require investments to improve
                              the resilience of the road network, and measures to upgrade design and planning standards taking into account expected climate change.

                              Component 3. (TBD) Project Management; Monitoring and Evaluation; Operating Costs.Recognizing the limited capacity in Samoa and following
                              the satisfactory arrangements of SIAM2, technical assistance for project management may be provided. The PMU team would assist with the
                              project’s financial management, the preparation of procurement documentation, and monitoring and evaluation of results and indicators.
                              Incremental operating costs would also be financed under this component. However, in recent years LTA has been successful in managing a
                              budget of approximately US$10 million annually, so it may have the capacity to manage this project in-house. This component will be finalized by
                              appraisal.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The Project will be implemented along the West Coast Road from Falealolo International Airport to Apia. The technical assistance components will
                           be carried out throughout Samoa.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The LTA will be working closely with the MNRE on ensuring that the safeguards instruments and consultations are done properly. The LTA and
                           MNRE are familiar with the WB safeguards policies. These agencies have experience in safeguards requirement of the WB in previous projects
                           such as SIAM and Post Tsunami Reconstruction Project (PTRP). Environmental regulations exist in-country such as Codes of Environmental
                           Practice (COEP) which sufficiently covers road construction related impacts. There is also a regulatory requirement for screening of projects to
