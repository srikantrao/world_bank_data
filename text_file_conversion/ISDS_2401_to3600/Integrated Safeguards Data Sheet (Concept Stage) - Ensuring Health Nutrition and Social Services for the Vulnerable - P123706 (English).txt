                              The objectives of the proposed Project are to: (i) increase the use, access and quality of basic services; and (ii) strengthen Government’s capacity
                              to manage and monitor service delivery. The Project seeks to scale up two key Government programs to increase the use of and gradually
                              improve the quality of basic services, with a focus on maternal and child health and nutrition. The Project would also reinforce the stewardship role
                              of the Government and build capacity to manage and monitor service delivery. Although the Project would have a national scope, special
                              emphasis will be placed on ensuring access to services in under-served rural areas and in communities where the vulnerable are being relocated,

                              C. Project Description

                              To address key sector challenges and support the achievement of the PDO, the proposed Project would finance three Components: (i) Improving
                              Access to Health and Nutrition Services; (ii) Improving Basic Living Conditions of Poor and Vulnerable Families; and (iii) Institutional Capacity
                              Building.

                              Component 1. Increasing Use of Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Services (US$23 million). The objective of this Component is to increase
                              the use and quality of maternal and child health and nutrition services through the scaling up and enhancement of Manman ak Timoun an Santé,
                              including the expansion of the Program to include non-public providers and integration of other performance-based contracting models to ensure a
                              harmonized approach to the delivery of a national package of maternal and child health interventions. The Project seeks to ensure the provision of
                              a clearly defined package of evidence based, high-impact and cost-effective interventions* to a well defined population, namely pregnant women
                              and children under five. The MSPP, with the technical assistance of WHO/PAHO and in partnership with the Canadian Government, has identified
                              and costed a package of services proven to have a significant impact on under-five and maternal mortality rates. The Government intends to
                              deliver these services free-of-charge at the national scale, which should increase utilization, bringing the country closer to achieving the health-
                              related MDGs. Box 1 outlines the current package of health and nutrition services. This package will be reviewed during project preparation and
                              updated based on new costing studies. Both the package of services and the defined beneficiary population may be expanded in the future based
                              on available funding. The size and locations of the beneficiary population will be determined during project preparation.

                         To this end, this Component would finance two subcomponents: (i) Delivery of the Health and Nutrition Package; and (ii) Strengthening the Quality
                         and Supply of Services.

                         Sub-component 1.1: Delivery of the Health and Nutrition Package (US$13 million). This sub-component would finance payments to participating
                         health institutions for the delivery of a costed package of health and nutrition services based on agreed upon targets. Service providers are
                         reimbursed for each individual service provided. The payment system is output-based, that is, fees are set in advance and services are bundled to
                         some degree. Fees have been calculated on the basis of a costing study analyzing the recurrent costs associated with the delivery of the service in
                         question to the targeted population. Thus the Program’s financing scheme provides a subsidy for the delivery of an essential package of services.
                         Quality of services is assessed through two separate tools. One, a checklist is used to verify availability of critical inputs, such as the key medical
                         staff, supplies and medicines and the functionality of the infrastructure (including water and electricity). The checklist verification occurs in each
                         participating health facility on a quarterly basis. Second, a patient satisfaction survey is undertaken on a sample basis by an external party with the
                         objective of ensuring that the beneficiary did in fact receive services free-of-charge in line with the accepted protocols. The quality assurance
                         system and implementation modalities, including enrollment of the beneficiary population, will be strengthened. Matching funds from the
                         Norwegian Results-Based Financing Trust Fund would be sought for up to 80 percent of this sub-component in additional financing.

                         Sub-component 1.2: Strengthening the Quality and Supply of Services (US$10 million). This sub-component would seek to improve the quality and
                         supply of services within selected health facilities through financing of small-scale rehabilitation, equipment, medical supplies, and drugs and
                         training of health personnel. Prior to enrollment in the Program, an evaluation of whether the health provider has the requisite capacity to deliver
                         the package of services is undertaken by the Contract and Program Management Unit, followed by a field visit to verify and confirm the information
                         presented in the application. In certain priority geographic zones, such as slum areas, specific recommendations may be made to immediately
                         address capacity weaknesses, such as the provision of additional equipment and medical supplies to the institution by the Program given that the
                         goal is to retain as many health facilities in the Program as possible. Moreover, training is provided for all health personnel involved in the delivery
                         of the package of services as necessary. The training program, which focuses on the correct application of service delivery protocols, is provided
                         in three phases: (i) a two day general training on the basics of integrated management of childhood illnesses and obstetrical care; (ii) an on-site
                         training on application of the protocols over a three to six-month period; and (iii) monthly on-site coaching throughout the life of the Program.
                         Additional training would be provided on administrative and financial management of health institutions and support to medical waste management
                         would be provided. This sub-component will therefore finance the investment of costs related to small-scale rehabilitation of existing

                         infrastructures, the acquisition of equipment, medical supplies, and drugs as well as training of health personnel.

                         Additionally, this sub-Component would support the strengthening of the verification of results, a critical element of results-based financing, as well
                         as monitoring and supervision of delivery of services. Manman ak Timoun an Santé employs a combination of approaches for monitoring and
                         verification of results, through (i) routine verification to ensure reliable reporting and confirm that patients who were reported to have received
                         services actually received them; and (ii) an independent verification process to ensure the accuracy and consistency of reporting on the volume
                         and/or quality of services provided. Random patient satisfaction surveys are undertaken on a quarterly basis to verify if services have actually been
                         provided: the contracted firm reviews health facility registers, randomly selects a sample of patients and surveys them at their households to collect
                         information regarding services rendered, quality of care provided, and overall patient satisfaction. Moreover, given that results-based financing
                         represents a fundamental shift in behavior, moving the risk from the purchaser to the provider, training and capacity building will need to be
                         undertaken at all levels on purchaser responsibilities, triggers for payment, roles of decentralized health authorities and local government, fund
                         flow mechanisms, accountability mechanisms, verification and supervision.

                         Component 2. Improving Basic Living Conditions of Poor and Vulnerable Families (US$20 million). The objective of this Component is to reduce
                         the vulnerability of poor families through the preparation of a Family Development Plan based on the family’s vulnerability and living conditions and
                         the fulfillment of the family’s Life Objectives outlined in the Plan, with the support of the Kore Fanmi agents and municipal teams. Through the
                         proposed Project, and in support of the flagship Aba Grangou, the Kore Fanmi initiative will be scaled up in terms of both coverage and types of
                         interventions provided in order to cover a larger array of social services progressively and enhanced. Kore Fanmi agents are locally recruited and
                         assigned a manageable number of families (100 families per agent on average). Agents are responsible for (a) distribution of a package of
                         essential goods and services; (b) promotion of positive behavioral change; and (c) referral to appropriate social services when required. To do so,
                         they first assess family needs through a beneficiary survey to establish a detailed socio-economic profile based on family demographic, health,
                         nutrition, food insecurity, housing conditions, education and economic data. A vulnerability analysis is then undertaken to create a detailed profile
                         of each family’s conditions and produce an objective measure of its vulnerability, which in turn determines the intensity of the support provided by
                         the Kore Fanmi agent. Finally, a Family Development Plan is created to match each family’s specific conditions with Life Objectives that include
                         health, nutrition, civil rights, nutrition and food security, education, economic opportunities, living conditions and violence prevention. The municipal
                         team supervises, trains and guides Kore Fanmi agents in their tasks and is responsible for improving cooperation between partners and service
                         providers and for keeping local authorities informed on social services at the municipal level (map of opportunity for services and programs
                         available to families) The municipal team is composed of a full time coordinator, one social worker for every 15 Kore Fanmi agents and a data
                         management specialist. For families detected to be in extreme vulnerability, Kore Fanmi will provide support through an emergency fund.

                         This Component will finance the Kore Fanmi agents and the municipal teams, essential commodities and goods, and operational costs. To support
                         the scaling up of the Kore Fanmi model, this Component will finance: (a) payments, based on performance, of the Kore Fanmi agents and
                         municipal teams; (b) essential commodities and goods to support basic service delivery at the household level; (c) operational costs of the agents
                         and teams; and (d) emergency funds for extremely destitute families.

                         Component 3. Institutional Strengthening (US$7 million). The Government, while still requiring external assistance for financing the social sect ors
                         in the foreseeable future, must strengthen its capacity to effectively regulate and manage the delivery of services at the local levels. This
                         Component will finance two subcomponents: (i) Strengthening MSPP’s Stewardship and Management Capacity; and (ii) Support to Management
                         of Aba Grangou and Kore Fanmi.

                         Subcomponent 3.1: Strengthening MSPP’s Stewardship and Management Capacity (US$4 million). The objective of this sub-component is to
                         support the development of adequate capacity of MSPP to effectively put in place, manage and supervise the relevant contracting and monitoring
                         arrangements. In order to do this, a Contract and Program Management Unit (CPMU) is being created within the Ministry for this purpose and
                         staffed by Ministry personnel as well as competitively recruited local consultants. The objectives of the CPMU are to: (i) help expand the delivery of
                         a standardized essential package of health and nutrition services; (ii) strengthen the MSPP’s stewardship role in the health sector so it can ensure
                         sector priorities and policies are realized; (iii) integrate donor, multilateral, and NGO efforts into the national health system; and (iv) develop the
                         capacity of the MSPP to work effectively with stakeholders in establishing an effective and efficient public private mix. This Unit will be firmly
                         embedded within the MSPP to manage funds and coordinate and oversee the activities and sector programs of various donors, particularly related
                         to the country wide provision of an essential package of health and nutrition services through standard procurement procedures, financial and
                         technical management of health service delivery contracts, in coordination with corresponding MSPP departments and relevant stakeholders.

                         Strengthening the capacity of the technical departments of the Ministry and the departmental health authorities is essential, given their important
                         role in the supervision of the respective technical aspects. Although donor-financed programs and contracts would be overseen by the CPMU, the
                         technical departments of the Ministry and the departmental health authorities play an important role in the supervision of the respective technical
                         aspects. The CPMU staff would liaise regularly with the relevant technical departments and staff of the CPMU will be twinned with staff in the
                         technical departments to ensure longer-term capacity building and transfer of experience and skills. In an effort to facilitate inter-departmental
                         exchanges of experience and lessons learned, the MSPP could put in place different mechanisms, such as creating coaching teams to support the
                         departments in public finance reforms, utilizing the “learning by doing? methodology in conducting internal audits at the departmental levels, and
                         holding staff meetings in well-performing departments so that the best performers can serve as examples and role models. It would be critical to
                         provide support to build capacity at all level of the delivery chain, including planning, budgeting and tracking public expenditures, defining policies,
                         clarifying role and responsibilities of the decentralized levels in planning and coordinating effective provision of services to the population. Finally,
                         this sub-component would support strengthening of capacity of MSPP for medical waste management and worker health and safety capacity. This
                         sub-component will therefore finance technical assistance in a number of areas, training and small goods and equipment at central and
                         decentralized levels of service provision.

                         Subcomponent 3.2: Support to Management of Aba Grangou and Kore Fanmi (US$3 million). This sub-component will provide support to the
                         coordination office of the National Commission on Fighting Hunger and Malnutrition (Aba Grangou) and to the Kore Fanmi team in the Fonds
                         d’Assistance Economique et Sociale (FAES). The Aba Grangou coordination office will be responsible for developing standards and policies on
                         social protection, tracking families’ vulnerabilities and social initiatives, providing technical support, and monitoring and evaluation to social
                         initiatives in Haiti. Support will be provided under this sub-component to the set-up and functioning of the municipal offices implementing the new
                         model of family support in the country. Moreover, the identification of citizens is a fundamental responsibility of the state, a basic prerequisite for
                         effective service delivery and an essential tool to promote inclusion and accountability. Therefore, this sub-component would provide technical
                         assistance for: (i) the development of the regulatory framework for an national identification system, including facilitating the issuance of numbers
                         and the gathering, updating, and usage of data; (ii) the design and deployment of technologies and facilities for the system; (iii) the enhancement

                         of the national identification database and strengthening of coordination among actors providing IDs and services using IDs as an accountability
                         mechanism, and (iv) the adoption of e-ID verification services and the linkage of national identification, Birth registration and National Population
                         Register databases. Finally, this sub-component would finance monitoring and evaluation, procurement, financial management, internal auditing
                         and oversight costs of Component 2, including annual financial audits, through FAES.

                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         Although the Project would have a national scope, special emphasis will be placed on ensuring access to services in under-served rural areas and
                         in communities where the vulnerable are being relocated, including in poor areas of Port au Prince.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                         The proposed Project will be implemented by MSPP – Component 1 and part of Component 3 – and FAES – Component 2 and part of Component
                         3. MSPP has little experience working with World Bank safeguards. As part of the project’s focus on institutional capacity building at the municipal
                         and community levels, especially under Component 3, MSPP’s ability to manage the environmental impacts of healthcare – particularly in terms of
                         building the capacity to manage health care waste management at source sites in healthcare facilities – will need to be strengthened.

                         FAES has successfully prepared and implemented safeguards activities in other World Bank projects, including in the Cholera Emergency
                         Response project and the Household Development Agent Initiative and has participated in safeguards management provided by the World Bank in
                         September 2010. FAES also provided training in the environmental impacts of health care waste management in May 2011. FAES and MSPP
                         have jointly participated in supervision missions that have monitored, among other things, the quality of both human waste and medical waste
                         management. Moreover, PAHO has developed protocols for healthcare waste management and worker health and safety that have been used as
                         the basis on which to prepare mitigation measures under OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) for health projects in Haiti. These protocols will
                         again be included and built upon in the Project’s medical waste management plan and implementation manual. The National Medical Waste
                         Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary. WHO/PAHO and CDC have been providing technical assistance to the Ministry on
                         this issue. An inventory of incinerators is currently being conducted by the Ministry and development partners and an action plan to address
                         weakness in functionality of incinerators as well as management of medicate waste more generally is being developed and will be supported under
                         the Bank-financed Cholera project, Training will be provided to all participating service providers during project preparation. Thus, the Project will
                         ensure support to both MSPP and FAES to further strengthen their capacity to prepare, implement and supervise safeguards actions.

                         The Project will ensure mechanisms to monitor quality and timeliness of service delivery, including third party monitoring and establishment of a
                         grievance redress mechanism to rapidly and reliably address beneficiary complaints and concerns.
