2. Project Objectives
The original Project Development Objective (PDO) is "to improve the quality and
coverage of preventive and curative health services, particularly for women and children,
in order to accelerate progress toward the health millennium development goals
(MDGs)". However, the initial design has proven too complex for the implementation
capacity, and thus the PDO will be changed to: "support Government of Timor-Leste to
get more resources to where they are needed most, to improve the delivery of health
services in districts and sub-districts." The restructured Project will target the system and
resource management issues that underpin improved essential health service delivery at
the district level, which is where live the majority of the Timorese population.

 The proposed modifications in the PDO and its components do not change the overall
environmental category of the Project (rated Category C), nor do they trigger new
safeguard policies. The ISDS is being updated to reflect the changes in the PDO and
components.
3. Project Description
The restructured Project with additional financing will focus on the system and resource
management issues that will ultimately improve primary health care services in districts
and sub-districts. Central to the restructured Project is a 'roadmap' to improve public
financial management (PFM) for increased service delivery captured in the NHSSP.

 The following components will replace the existing components:

 Component 1. Improving PFM and Fund Flows for Service Delivery: (i) strengthening
the MoH's planning and budgeting; (ii) advocating for an increased overall health budget
allocation; and (iii) increasing flexible and innovative funding for district service
delivery;

 Component 2. Strengthening Pharmaceutical and Medical Supplies Management: (i)
strengthening the clinical and logistics management capacity of the health sector; (ii)
strengthening regulatory capacity of the health sector; and (iii) improving quality control;
and

  Component 3. Improving Evidence-Informed Decision Making and Health Sector
Coordination: (i) developing and using an agreed sector M&E framework to assess
performance across the health sector; (ii) institutionalizing health sector coordination; and
(iii) strengthening research capacity.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
As the restructured Project with additional financing will focus primarily on resource
management by strengthening the system and building capacity among staff to better
manage it, the restructured Project will not finance any drugs or any civil works, except
for very minor rehabilitation (i.e., shelf and window screen for drug storage).
Accordingly no land acquisition or involuntary resettlement is needed. Thus, no adverse
social or environmental impacts are anticipated. Various capacity building activities will
target all PFM related staff in the health sector (e.g., central MOH, all 13 district health
teams, hospitals, and central medical stores) without any preference given to specific
ethnic and/or gender groups.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The proposed modifications do not change the overall environmental category of the
Project (rated Category C), nor do they trigger any new safeguard policies. OP/BP 4.01.
Environmental Assessment remains triggered as the original Project financed the
rehabilitation of facilities and procurement of drugs and medical equipment. A short
Environmental and Health Care Waste Management Assessment was disclosed in 2007.
The rehabilitation of the targeted health facilities is completed, even though distribution
of medical equipment is pending. The restructured Project will not finance any
procurement of drugs or civil works/infrastructure, except for very minor rehabilitation
(i.e., shelf and window screen for drug storage), as other funding sources are available for
this purpose, most notably the GoTL's own Infrastructure Fund. Accordingly, no land
acquisition or involuntary resettlement is needed under the restructured Project. Also, as
the restructured Project will focus primarily on resource management by strengthening
the system and building capacity among staff, no adverse social or environmental impacts
are anticipated. Various capacity building activities will target all PFM related staff in
the health sector (e.g., central MOH, all 13 district health teams, hospitals, and central
medical stores) without any preference given to specific ethnic and/or gender groups.
