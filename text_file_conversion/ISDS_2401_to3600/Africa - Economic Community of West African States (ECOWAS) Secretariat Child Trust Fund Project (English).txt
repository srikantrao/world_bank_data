2. Project Objectives:
In line with the development objective (PDO) of the CAADP MDTF, the proposed PDO for the
ECOWAS CTF is an improved enabling environment for African agricultural programs and
policies. An improved enabling environment is defined as systems, structures and institutions
that are inclusive; evidence based; scaled up and more effective in leveraging technical, financial
and political support; and more robust in identifying and delivering on regional integration
priorities.

3. Project Description:
      A. Pr oject Components

  ased on the adoption ofthe ECOWAP/CAADP and in line with the objectives ofthe RAIP, the
 COWAS SOP has identified 6 key functions (briefly outlined under Component 1 below) to be
carried out by DARD. DARD's fulfillment of these functions will benefit greatly from
operational and capacity-building-support provided by this CTF. The CTF is for a period of three
 ears and will be implemented through the following two components: (1) support for DARD
 ey program activities and (2) institutional capacity building support to DARD.

C omponent 1: Support for DARD Program A ctivities (US$ 3.0 million). The six key
~mctions identified in the ECOWAS SOP as critical to the improvement of the ECOWAS'
~griculture and Rural Development sector are as follows:
• Key Function 1: Coordination of ECOWAS CAADP processes. DARD's activities in
    coordination of ECOWAP/CAADP will focus on the refinement and implementation of the
    RAIP, coordination with other ECOWAS Departments, with regional and CAADP
    institutions signatories to the CAADP Compact and with other regional and national
    stakeholders.
• Key Function 2: Support to Delivery of Technical Assistance Services. DARD will support
    analytical work and will also respond toMS' technical assistance needs or requests, through
    the mobilization of relevant expertise.
• Key Function 3: Facilitating Monitoring and Evaluation of Regional Strategic Objectives
    and Targets. Tbe Commission will support the establishment of national and regional M&E
    systems as well as activities which will build upon the capacities and roles of various other
    stakeholders, in particular, Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System (SAKSS)
    nodes, regional SAKSS nodes (ReSAKSS) and the Regional Agricultural Information
    System (ECOAGRIS).
• Key Function 4: Knowledge Management, Information and Communication. The
    Commission will manage and expand its knowledge management, information and
    communication activities within the agriculture and rural development sector.
    Key Function 5: Coordination and management of existing regional projects and programs.
    The Commission currently plays a role in regional project implementation. Prut of this is
    direct implementation of regional projects, which is to be progressively transferred to the
      RAAF.
•     Key Function 6: Governance and Management of ECOWAPICAADP. The Commission plays
      an overall supervisory role in ECOW AP/CAADP implementation (including the supervision
      of newly created govemance bodies, once they are operationalized) and exercises a
      management function for specific ECOWAP/CAADP policy instruments.

 ECOWAS' own resources cover the current annual budget of DARD up to roughly US$1.5
/21illion. The Commission considers key functions number 1, 5 and 6 as "core sovereign
;tUnctions" which should not require external funding to be fulfilled. However, the Commission
lwelcomes external support for program activities to fulfill other key functions. To that end, while
  ot limiting support to the above areas - the CTF will focus on supporting DARD program
activities within key functions 2, 3 and 4.

    upporl to key function 2: Delivery of Technical Assistance Services (US$0.5 million). the CTF
will provide funding for a pool of consultants to mobilize relevant expertise and respond to MS
request for technical assistance, as well as regional priorities. For example, DARD will suppo
analysis at regional and/or national level on public expenditure reviews (PER) and emergin
issues such as climate change, support to agricultural inputs and to the adoption of improve
technologies.

Support to key function 3: Facilitating Monitoring and Evaluation of Regional Strategi
Objectives and Targets (US$1.5 million). Key activities supported by the CTF will include: (i
setting up the ECOWAP/CAADP regiona~ M&E Unit; (ii) providing support to count
institutions and systems responsible for M&E in the agriculture sector, including equipment an
training to build M&E capacity an1ong country teams; (iii) organizing joint regional consultativ
meetings to develop regional sector performance indicators; and (v) the production of analysi
for documentation and dissemination of results.

Support to key function 4: Knowledge Management, Information and Communication (US$1 .0)
DARD will use CTF resources for (i) the production and dissemination of publications, brief:
media progran1s and annual reports on agriculture and food secmity in the region; (ii) th ·
development of ECOAGRlS; and (iii) the improvement of the DARD website, which wil
include the addition of a regularly updated web portal dedicated to ECOWAP/CAADP (t
provide public access to information and data about the advancement of the CAADP process i
the region, operational implementation of the RAIP and the NAIPs, etc) and the creation o
discussion fora.

Component 2: Institutional Capacity B uilding Support to the ECOWAS Commission (US ·
1.9 millionj. Effective ECOWAP/CAADP implementation at regional level and in supp01t t
member States (MS), as well as the proper management of this CTF to foster quick disburseme
and respect adequate fiduciary procedures will require capacity enhancement at DARD. Th
CTF will support additional human resources at the Commission, supplement operational cost
for professional staff at DARD and fund training activities.

Human Resources (US$1.3 million). With a view to ensuring sustainability and develo
institutional capacity, and taking into account the experience of CTFs executed thro~gh othe
RECs, the proposal to place additional staff at ECOWAS Commission has been thorough!
considered, taking into account (i) existing logistical capacity for accommodating new staff
DARD; (ii) the outcome of fiduciary capacity assessments of the ECOWAS Department fo
Administration & Finance; (iii) current and planned staff additions based on the SOP and th
Secretariat-approved envisaged organogt·am for DARD; and (iv) current and planned donor      l
supported additions to DARD and RAAF staff. As a result, human resources support will b
limited to eight new staff only:

•   CTF management. Four of these positions are directly related to CTF management an
    capacity transfer. This includes two officers at the Department for Administration an
    Finance (a senior financial management specialist and a senior procurement specialist) an
    two temporary staff at DARD (a CTF Project Manager at and an Assistant) 1•

1
 ECOW AS follows the UN staff category system: the Financial Management specialist and Procurement specialist
are both at P4 level); the CTF Project Manager is at P5 and the Assistant at P3 .
•     DARD technical strengthenin2. Four technical positions2 for capacity-building at DARD will
      be supported by the CTF. This includes an M&E!database management expert and three
      Program Officers (one for the General Agriculture sub-sector, one for the
      Fisheries/Aquaculture sub-sector, and one for Value Chains developmene). Such technical
      staff is critical for DARD to fulfill its key functions. Longer-term recruitment will be
      considered during the life of the CTF according to availability of DARD budget allocations
      in the future, as well as possible other additional donor support.

 raining Plan (US$0.6 million). CTF resources will support a large training plan, to encompass
oth technical and operational areas. Subject areas such as policy analysis and strategic planning,
esults-based management, human resource management, technical training and updates, as well
straining in fiduciary issues (financial management and procurement) will be part of this plan,
s needed.

    . Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

    he CTF will fund non-physical activities as described in section 3 above, in ECOWAS
    eadquarters (HQ) in Abuja, Nigeria and in Member States

I. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
~-   Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
l. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potentia/large scale, significallt amllor irreversible impacts:

     e activities funded by the CTF will be limited to the mandate and functional responsibilities of
    e recipient, ECOW AS, in supporting CAADP processes. Within the CAADP framework,
    ECs generally facilitate:


 The M&Eidatabase management expert is at P5 level and the three Program Officers are at P4
 A Livestock Program Officer is currently available at DARD through another donor
       •   Stocktaking, analysis, and design of a regional program and policies for the
           agriculture sector
       •   Coordination and implementation of the CAADP agenda in Member States, ensuring
           that structures for management ofl·egional and CAADP processes are in place at the
           country level;
       •   Technical backstopping of stocktaking and analytical work related to national
           agricultural activities, and policies so as to inform national investment options;
       •   Capacity building of in-cOLmtry teams to manage and implement the regional and
           CAADP agendas;
       •   Assisting countries to identify DPs and mobilize resources for effective
           implementation of their agricultural programs and projects;
       •   Communication, experience sharing, and peer review of CAADP implementation;
       •   Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of regional agricultural initiatives and CAADP
           implementation.

Therefore, this CTF cannot and will not fund any civil work whatsoever either at ECOWAS HQ
or in Member States. There will therefore be no adverse environmental impacts associated with
the CTF.

Notwithstanding, as part of the support ECOWAS wishes to provide in line with its mandate, th
CTF may support consultant services to evaluate the environmental and social project
management systems of member countries as part of the broader set of services being provided
which are detailed in the operational plan. Evaluating these systems will help Member States
identify actions to be taken by them to strengthen their respective systems.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:

       NIA

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

       NIA

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The recipient has almost no experience in using and applying Bank safeguard policies. However
this is not a concern as the CTF will not directly or indirectly finance any civil works, their
engineering design (either detailed or schematic) or their feasibility study. However the task
team will continue to work with the recipient throughout implementation to ensure that the
processes the GTF supports include evaluating Member States environmental and social
management systems,
