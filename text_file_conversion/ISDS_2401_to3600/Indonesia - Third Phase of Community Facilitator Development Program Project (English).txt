2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the Community Facilitator Development Project is to support community-
driven poverty reduction by advancing the role of community facilitators (including PNPM staff)
as agents of change through a certification process and improved training design. The project
will provide multiple benefits for a number of stakeholders:
      Existing PNPM facilitators will not only be ad hoc project staff but be recognized as
       certified professional facilitators. This will allow their associations to promote the use of
       facilitators in development projects. Certification will also enhance the public image of
       facilitators and their leadership role in society.
      The workload of the various secretariats of PNPM Mandiri projects as regards facilitator
       training will be reduced. Executing agencies will no longer need to carry out separate
        basic competency training for the facilitators and the various projects will be able to hire
        staff who already have certain basic competencies
       The central government will be better able to maintain standard minimum competencies
        that all recognized facilitators must hold. This license program will ensure that recruited
        staff are competent, thus improving the quality of program delivery. This will support the
        tasks of the central government and PNPM line ministries in maintaining the quality of
        program delivery, as the role of the central government in the future might shift towards
        standardization, quality control and oversight, rather than program delivery.
       The program will allow for the mainstreaming and replication of community facilitation
        and PNPM principles into regular local government affairs by providing a roster of
        certified facilitators that in line with national procurement guidelines can be hired as
        government consultants.
       Universities and training institutes will develop specialized curriculum for community
        development and facilitators, which will enhance the “third role? of universities in social
        and economic development of their surrounding communities.
       Other development partners and NGOs will also be able adopt the program and use the
        LSP certification as a main criterion for recruiting community facilitators as project staff.


3. Project Description:
Grant financed activities under Recipient-executed funds, totaling $1.139.000, will be used to
deliver the following outputs:

   1. Establishment and support for the operations of the non-profit Community Facilitators
        Certification Institute (LSP), under auspices of the Indonesian National Board for
        Professional Certification. Through local branches, the LSP will assess agreed-upon
        competency standards and provide professional certification, acknowledged by the
        Government of Indonesia. The target for Phase 3 is that 3,000 facilitators will be assessed
   2.   Design a system for refresher training of community facilitators
   3.   Identify and develop standards for certification of advanced competencies
   4.   Develop a work plan for accreditation of facilitator’s training institutes and material.
   5.   Develop a roster of master trainers who can carry out training needs assessments and
        design interactive training.

An Indonesian NGO has been identified as grantee Yayasan Nusantara Sejati- Institute for Good
Governance and Regional Development (YNS-IGGRD) was established in 2004 and has been
providing support to previous phases of the CFDP program

Support for Point 2-5 will be directly executed under the auspices of YNS-IGGRD. Support for
activities under Point 1 will be done through technical assistance: the Community Facilitators
Certification Institute (LSP) is an independent organization and funds will not be directly
channeled to the LSP. Rather, YNS-IGGRD will provide administrative and management
support for the operations of the Certification Institute. Support under this point includes:
     Establishment of the LSP Management Team and LSP office
     Establishment of Regional Competency Test Centers in ten locations and training of 70
         assessors
      Design and launch of the certification process – including grievance redress mechanisms
      Communications and MIS - an effective media communication and information
       management strategy that is accessible by accredited facilitators and PNPM/donor
       programs.
      Facilitators’ database and roster of qualified master trainers and training institute
      Business plan – for how the LSP can become a self-sustaining entity after the end of the
       present support.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Since this project consists of training activities and there is no physical intervention, hence there
are no safeguard issues and impacts associated directly with the proposed project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

There are no significant long term potential safeguard impacts triggered by this project.
Nevertheless the CFDP project has strong linkage to PNPM in ensuring their facilitators trained
from this project will have proper understanding on safeguards policies, specifically the ones
triggered in the umbrella of PNPM Rural. The OP/BP 4.01 - Environment Assessment and
OP/BP 4.10 - Indigenous Peoples as well as explained in Implementation Guideline for Social
and Environmental Safeguards (IGSES) shall be implemented in the training modules within
CFDP curriculum. The Safeguards Team will review the Action Plan and Detail of Curriculum
prior to the implementation stage in order to ensure the integration of safeguard issues in CFDP
training programs.


3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

As a certification and capacity-building project, the CFPD does basically not directly impact on
safeguard issues. However, the grant recipient IGGRD has developed an Safeguard Action Plan,
which aims to ensure that the safeguards policies are taken into considerations during the
planning and implementation of the project, and specifically, that safeguard issues become part
of the regular competency standards for community facilitators. Based on the approved action
plan, IGGRD will work with the LSP to develop Detail of Curriculum and the system to ensure
awareness of stakeholders on the safeguard issues, as has been stated in the community
facilitators basic competency documents (SKKNI) which has been approved prior to the project
implementation. The recipient has been involved in the CFDP project since phase I, therefore
they are aware of the safeguard requirement of Bank-financed projects. Based on those
considerations, the recipient is rated to have the capacities to implement the action plan.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The key main stakeholders of the project are community facilitators in various Government of
Indonesia and donor CDD -projects. There are around 25,000 facilitators who are now working
under several PNPM scheme projects. The project is aim to standardize the quality of the
facilitators through certification and capacity building activities. The newly established
Community Facilitators Certification Institute has been driven by a range of stakeholders, from
government, NGOs, universities, and community facilitator’s association. During the
implementation of the project, disclosure is mandatory to all stakeholders. The action plan will
be uploaded to the project website, as well as the materials which consider the safeguards issues.
