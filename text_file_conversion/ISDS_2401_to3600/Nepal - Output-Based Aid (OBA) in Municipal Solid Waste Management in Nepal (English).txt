3. Project Description
The p roject a ims t o i mprove the q uality a nd financial sustainability o f SWM se rvices in
participating municipalities, t hrough a n output-based subsidy s cheme. G iven the generally poor
financial situation of the SWM sector, the project is designed to provide incentives to enable the
gradual development of a beneficiary charging mechanism for SWM services in order to enhance
financial sustainability, improve service quality, and enable expansion of SWM service coverage
over a f our y ear p eriod. The pr oject ha s t hree c omponents: ( i) a s ervice d elivery su bsidy t o
support gradual improvements in cost recovery in tandem with service quality improvements over
a four-year period; (ii) implementation support to municipalities during project implementation;
and (iii) project management, monitoring and verification activities.
Component 1 - Service delivery subsidy ($3m): T his component will f inance s ervice delivery
subsidies for each P articipating Mu nicipality, o ver a f our ( 4) y ear p eriod, t o co ver t he g ap

will f inance c ritical t echnical a ssistance t o p articipating m unicipalities to a ssist th em in
successfully implementing the project, including preparation of service i mprovement plans;
preparation of m anuals and training in la ndfill ope rations a nd m anagement; improvement of
billing and revenue collection systems for solid waste m anagement services; monitoring and
evaluation and performance management systems for solid waste management services; design
and implementation of integrated solid waste management activities based on 3R (reduce, reuse
and recycle) principles; design and implementation of information, education and communication
campaigns; an d d esign o f appropriate c ontractual arrangements i n ca ses w here a municipality
chooses to contract with the private sector, non-governmental organizations or community-based
organizations.
Component 3 - Project management, monitoring, evaluation and communications ($0.695m):
This component will finance project management costs; c onsulting services for monitoring and
verification of outputs and performance, baseline and beneficiary assessments, studies and other
M&E activities, and communication and dissemination activities.
The main central government counterparts for project are (i) the Town Development Fund (TDF)
– a government-owned, autonomous municipal finance institution which will act as the Fiduciary
Agent for t he p roject; a nd ( ii) t he S olid W aste M anagement T echnical Support C entre
(SWMTSC) within the Ministry of Urban Development. S WMTSC is the lead technical agency
for Nepal’s SWM sector and will assist in the technical aspects of the project.
Basic eligibility criteria for participating in the project include:

The pr oject w ill be financed by a g rant f rom t he Global P artnership o n O utput-Based A id
(GPOBA) – a multi-donor trust fund administered by the World Bank. The project complements
an ong oing W orld B ank-supported U rban G overnance a nd D evelopment P rogram/Emerging
Towns Project (UGDP/ETP).


4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
The project is designed as a ‘framework project’ whereby all the key design principles (including
eligibility criteria, i nstitutional, financial, technical, fiduciary and safeguards) are agreed during
project pr eparation, c aptured in t he project ope rations manual, and a re s ubsequently applied
during project implementation. This means that the terms and conditions for participation in the
project are identified a priori, together with an initial pipeline of municipalities, but this pipeline
is flexible and can be amended if circumstances change (for instance, if one of the municipalities
in the initial pipeline drops out, another eligible municipality can join to replace it).
SWMTSC has facilitated a self-selection process based on the eligibility criteria outlined above.
Five municipalities ha ve c ome f orward t o f orm t he i nitial pi peline. T he pi peline i s r easonably
diverse, co nsisting o f (i) two small hill to wns (Tansen a nd D hankuta) serving as market an d
administrative cen ters f or the s urrounding a reas; ( ii) two s ub-metropolitan c ities ( Pokhara a nd
Lalitpur), and one medium-size town (Lekhnath) located less than 10km from Pokhara. All five
municipalities have provided w ritten confirmation of i nterest t o pa rticipate a nd commitment t o
the p roject’s p rinciples. Three of the m unicipalities (Tansen, D hankuta a nd L ekhnath) a re also
participants in the ongoing Bank-financed UGDP/ETP project.
It is estimated that a total of about 800,000 people will benefit from the project.

• Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.1) is triggered because the activities /interventions
  proposed in e ach m unicipality’s S WM-SIP may h ave m oderate impacts o n n atural
  environment, human health and safety.
• Forest NH OP/BP 4.04 is triggered because it is possible, though uncertain, that some SWM-
  SIP activities in Lekhnath and Pokhara Municipality may be implemented in close proximity
  to lakes.
• OP/BP 4.36 is triggered because there are small patches of forests in and around some of the
  participating municipalities which may or may not be affected under the project.
• PCR O P/BP 4 .11 i s triggered b ecause there are cu ltural s ites in ea ch o f the p articipating
  municipalities. Depending on t he nature and precise location of SWM activities/interventions,
  these resources may or may not be affected (positively or negatively).

  vulnerable groups in some of the participating municipalities
• IR O P/BP 4.12 is n ot triggered be cause p roject interventions do not involve c onstruction o f
  landfills or other waste management facilities that require acquisition of land or resettlements

For all triggered policies, environmental and social screening and assessment will investigate on
these aspects, and an environmental and social management plan will be prepared as p art of the
SWM-SIP, an d w ill i nclude m easures t o p revent, mitigate an d m anage ad verse impacts and

II. Key safeguards policy issues and their management
A. Summary of key safeguard issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The pr oject t riggers five safeguard p olicies a s i ndicated ab ove: E nvironmental A ssessment,
Natural Habitat, Forest, Physical Cultural Resources, and Indigenous Peoples.
Environmental impacts: T he project is aimed at improving th e o verall s olid waste management
situation in participating municipalities and will contribute positively to each town's cleanliness,
sanitation and drainage, and will as such have positive environmental and social impacts.
Improvements envisaged will typically include increased frequency of w aste collection,
expanding t he se rvice ar ea t o co ver y et un-served ar eas, i ntroduction of w aste seg regation and
waste r eduction i nitiatives, a nd i mproving l andfill management a s w ell a s i mprovement i n
collection and transportation practices.
However, there are existing environmental concerns, which may continue or may even increase
as a result of the project, including:
    •   increased w aste going t o t he l andfill, with a r isk o f increased en vironmental and so cial
        impacts from landfill operation;
    •   pest problems;
    •   odors, n oise, d usts and n uisance t o public due to s weeping, w aste s torage p rior to
        collection and movement of waste collection vehicles and spillage from collection trucks/
        vehicles;
    •   health and safety of workers and public who might come in contact with the wastes;
    •   water and land pollution potential from the leachate;
    •   vermin problems and bad odor due to incorrect compositing process;
    •   incorrect handling, separation and storing of waste at household level;
    •   visual/ aesthetic impacts; and
    •   existing i ssues r elated t o l inked-activity o r f acility including r isks r elated to f loods and
        landslides ( such as in the cas e o f ac cess r oads and l andfill s ites), an d f ire (due to
        generation of methane gas).

The ab ove en vironmental co ncerns ar e r elated t o t he operational in terventions that w ill b e
implemented unde r C omponent 1 of t he pr oject. P articipating m unicipalities ar e r equired t o
develop SWM-SIPs identifying those investments to be covered under the project, and which are
directly lin ked t o a chieving th e m inimum performance requirements agreed i n t he t echnical
scorecard.
The types of activities to be s upported i nclude ( i) p urchase o f a dditional e quipment, i ncluding
waste co llection v ehicles such as t ractors, trailers and compactors; waste co llection bi ns, and
home c ompositing bins etc; (ii) improvement o f i nformation and recording sy stems f or so lid
waste operations; (iii) i mprovement of billing, r evenue collection systems; ( iv) improvement of
waste collection a nd la ndfill management pr actices; (v) c apacity bui lding of m unicipality s taff
involved solid waste management; (vi) improvement of existing transfer stations and compositing
facilities; and (vii) procurement of private operators/NGOs for primary waste collection (where a
municipality ch ooses so ) in s elected w ards under a clear c ontractual framework i n w hich the
performance incentives of the project are transferred to the private operator.
The pr oject interventions do not i nvolve c onstruction of l andfills or o ther w aste facilities t hat
require acquisition of private land or resettlements.
Consistent w ith the O BA p rinciple, the project a llows m unicipalities the flexibility to m ake
choices r egarding t he service de livery m odel a nd the c ombination o f interventions r equired to
achieve p re-agreed r esults in t erms of i mproved quality of s ervices and f inancial s ustainability.
Thus, t he e xact s cope of i nterventions t o be s upported in each municipality i s unknown a t t his
stage. F or t his r eason, G oN (through t he i mplementing pa rtners – TDF a nd SW MTSC) has
prepared a d raft E nvironmental and S ocial Management F ramework ( ESMF) that i s co nsistent
with the Government a nd World Bank requirements, a nd t hat will be applied during project
implementation to e nsure compliance with the tr iggered environmental sa feguards. The
assessment m ade dur ing preparation of t he ESMF indicates th at m ost o f th e anticipated
interventions have limited negative environmental i mpacts. In fact, all the i nterventions are
expected to contribute to an improved urban environment in each municipality.
Impacts on indigenous people: The s ocial as sessment carried du ring t he pr eparation o f the
UGDP/ETP project indicated the presence of janjatis (tribal people), dalits and other vulnerable
groups i n s ome of t he participating municipalities. Nepal i s a s ignatory t o I LO 169, w hich
requires special attention to the welfare of the indigenous people. Nepal has several legislations to
protect t he i nterests of the I Ps a nd v ulnerable g roups i ncluding t he "National F oundation f or
Upliftment o f I ndigenous N ationalities", "L ocal S elf-Governance A ct, 19 99". I n or der t o
minimize and mitigate any adverse impacts on and enhance benefits for the janjaties and dalits,
the Indigenous People-Vulnerable Communities Development (IP-VCD) framework developed as
part of the UGDP/ETP will be utilized in the OBA project. The framework provides guidelines to
prepare and implement IP-VCD plans (where necessary) for interventions that may require one.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area

The p roject i s ex pected t o enhance the overall urban e nvironment in t he pa rticipating
municipalities b y i mproving t he management o f so lid waste, expanding waste c ollection a reas,
enhancing w aste reduction an d m inimization i nitiatives an d i mproving r esidual w aste d isposal
practices. Impacts of specific project supported activities could be positive or negative depending
on t ype and location of a n a ctivity. F or example, improving/expanding waste collection m eans
that more waste is deposited at existing landfills, thus reducing the existing landfill capacity. This
could be mitigated by investing in waste reduction and minimization activities, or other form of
waste p rocessing ( such a s co mpost) t o reduce t he f raction o f w aste g oing t o t he l andfill. The
performance/technical sco recard f or the p roject includes i ndicators f or waste minimization and
reduction. In the addition, the ESMF has provisions for screening, preparing Environmental and
Social Man agement P lans ( ESMP), a nd m onitoring i mplementation of specific m itigations for
each OBA project intervention outlined in the SWM-SIP. Actual indirect and long term impacts
will b e assessed a s p art o f s ocial an d environmental s creening during t he pl anning of
interventions, as provided for in the ESMF.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

The project design includes a number features designed to minimize adverse environmental and
social impacts. F irst, the basic eligibility criteria for participating in the project requires that (i)
municipalities m ust already h ave access t o a l andfill that i s operational, a nd i s co nsidered
environmentally accep table w ithin GoN’s e nvironmental g uidelines an d st andards; ( ii)
municipalities m ust al ready h ave a b asic f unctioning SWM sy stem i n p lace (collection an d
disposal) and an existing system f or co llecting so lid waste charges f rom b eneficiaries; and (iii)
municipalities must agree to develop SWM-SIPs, which shall include ESMPs of activities in the
SWM-SIP (activities requiring EIAs are excluded from the SWM-SIP).
Secondly, the project’s primary monitoring tool is a technical/performance scored which includes
among others indicators to track environmental performance of solid waste operations, as well as
citizen satisfaction. Payment of the service delivery subsidy i s l inked to achieving a minimum
passing sco re o n t he t echnical s corecard. F inally, t he p roject includes a t echnical
assistance/capacity bu ilding c omponent t o pr ovide t echnical support a nd t raining t o
municipalities i n areas su ch as landfill o perations a nd management; preparation o f E SMPs a nd
monitoring systems for SWM activities and operations; implementation of integrated solid waste
management activities based on 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) principles; design and
implementation of information, education and communication campaigns.


4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

(a)       Borrower's measures to address the safeguards issues

An E SMF has be en de veloped to a ddress e nvironment and so cial safeguard i ssues f or t he
activities/interventions to be funded under the project. The ESMF builds on t he EMF and SMF
frameworks prepared under the UGPD/ETP, and will be treated as an Addendum to the existing
frameworks for t hose municipalities that ar e also participants i n t he UGDP/ETP p roject. Given
that participation in the OBA project is also open to non-UGDP/ETP municipalities, the ESMF
has be en p repared i n such a w ay t hat i t is a standalone doc ument t hat c an b e applied by non -
UGDP/ETP municipalities. The ESMF defines t he approach for i dentifying t he e nvironmental
and so cial issues associated w ith t he a ctivities, identifies the r equirements of c onducting
environmental and social screening and environment and social assessment studies, and provides
guidance to i ntegrate environment and so cial safeguard m easures d uring t he preparation an d
implementation o f S WM-SIPs. The E SMF proposes robust e nvironmental s upervision a nd
monitoring; i ncluding t rimester m onitoring by TDF ( supported by S WMTSC) and a nnual
external monitoring.
      (b) Assessment of the borrower's capacity to plan and implement the measures

An asses sment of en vironmental an d so cial sa feguard m anagement cap acities i n a sam ple o f
municipalities has revealed that the municipalities have limited organizational capacity in terms
of staffing levels and qualifications and in terms of physical recording and reporting systems for
SWM. The d ay t o d ay d elivery o f S WM s ervices rests w ith t he E nvironment & S anitation
Section which consists of sweepers, drivers and a supervisor (“In-charge?). Other sections / staff
relevant to S WM i nclude Rural U rban P artnership and S ocial Welfare S ections r esponsible f or
providing oversight/ capacity building of TLOs/ CBOs. Managerial / a dministrative oversight to
the above sections and the municipality as a whole is provided by the Executive Officer. In the
absence of elected representatives (Municipal Council, Mayor, Deputy Mayor), it is understood
that sev eral su bject sp ecific co mmittees w ith r epresentation f rom p olitical p arties an d o ther
stakeholders have been formed.
At t he cen tral l evel, TDF sh all b e responsible f or t he ov erall m onitoring o f safeguards
management. TDF will be supported by SWMTSC in its capacity as t he lead technical agency
on solid waste management in Nepal. SWMTSC will also provide training and technical support
to t he municipalities. SWMTSC w ill au gment its ex pertise by r ecruiting a dditional
environmental, solid waste and social experts as consultants or technical support providers under
the project.
Overall, environmental management cap acities o f al l d irectly i nvolved i nstitutions n eed
strengthening f or effective i mplementation o f t he ESMF pr ovisions. The E SMF contains
capacity s trengthening m easures, including t raining; pr ovision of a dditional h uman r esources;
creation o f S WM su bject co mmittee at t he municipality, cr eation of a d edicated S WM u nit et c
(see E SMF for details). The t echnical s upport c omponent of the p roject ( component 2) w ill
support c apacity bui lding m easures f or e nhancing i mplementation c apacity f or e nvironmental
safeguards c ompliance. I n a ddition, U GDP/ETP m unicipalities w ill be nefit from saf eguards
training and implementation support provided under the project.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The key stakeholders in the OBA project include waste producers (households, hotels/restaurants,
shops/retail, i ndustry, hospitals, e tc); M unicipality; Tole L ane O rganizations (TLOs), NGOs;
government agencies (SWMTSC; TDF); waste pickers and private sector companies involved in
waste co llection. Stakeholder as sessments w ere carried out du ring pr oject pr eparation, a nd a n
overall strategy for stakeholder engagement has been outlined in the project operations manual at
the operations stage of the project. Between March –September 2012, a series of consultations
were h eld with the m unicipalities and o ther s takeholders, i ncluding TLOs, municipal o fficials,
NGOs, an d political representatives a s a p art o f p reparatory st udies. In a ddition, extensive
consultations w ere he ld in S eptember 2012 in selected municipalities an d a t t he cen tral l evel
during preparation of the draft ESMF. A r eport o n all the c onsultations c arried out to d ate is
included as an Annex in the ESMF. These consultations confirmed the basic design of the OBA
project, but also resulted in a number of improvements to the project design, including:
    •   inclusion o f environmentally saf e an d a cceptable waste d isposal as a performance
        indicator under the project
    •   inclusion of a TA component to finance implementation support/technical assistance and
        training to municipalities in the following areas: ( i) pr eparation of S WM-SIPs: ( ii)
        establishing an operational m anual f or landfill and upgrading l andfill ope rations a nd
        management ex pertise; (iii) design and i mplementation of a wareness c ampaigns; ( iv)
        design a nd implementation of 3R activities; ( v) establishing t he M&E and performance
        management systems for SWM services. This TA component complements (but does not
        duplicate) what is already provided for under the UGDP/ETP.
