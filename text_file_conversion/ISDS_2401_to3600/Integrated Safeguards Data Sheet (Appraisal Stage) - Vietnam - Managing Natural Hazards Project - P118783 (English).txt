                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The project consists of five components:

                              •         Component 1: Strengthening DRM Institutions, Information Systems and Planning (US$ 5.12 million). This component will support the
                              implementation of DRM policies and the shift towards integrated river basin management. It will strengthen DRM planning, information systems
                              and coordination mechanisms at different levels by supporting: (a) technical assistance and training for DRM staff; (b) the integration of DRM into
                              the provincial river basin plans; (c) establishment of provincial disaster management centers (PDMC) for eight central provinces (except Quang
                              Ngai province and city of Danang); (d) improvements in DRM databases and other information systems; and (e) the preparation of disaster risk
                              maps and other planning tools to integrate DRM into river basin planning.

                              •         Component 2: Strengthening Weather Forecasting and Early Warning Systems (US$ 30.00 million). This component will strengthen
                              weather forecasting and early warning systems for disaster preparedness at all levels and improve the delivery of timely, relevant and accurate
                              hydromet information to the population. The component will support: (a) improved integration and management of the national hydromet system,
                              (b) enhanced technical capacity at the national and regional level for better use of hydrological and meteorological forecasting models, and (c) the
                              modernization of weather forecasting technology, hydro-meteorological monitoring and communication systems in three regions (north-central,
                              mid-central and southern region).

                              •         Component 3: Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (US$ 19.38 million). This component will (a) strengthen DRM awareness
                              and planning capacity at commune level; (b) mainstream DRM into commune socio-economic development plans; (c) develop and update the
                              Commune Annual Flood and Storm Control Plan and practice evacuation drills; (d) invest in DRM structural and non-structural measures; and (e)
                              strengthen management information systems and M&E capacity related to the CBDRM program at national and sub-national levels. This
                              component will support some 100 communes, selected through a geographical clustering of investments in Component 4 to ensure maximum
                              synergy from investments of different scales. A participatory approach will be applied to promote accountability and transparency.

                              •           Component 4: Priority Disaster Risk Mitigation Investments ($117.5 million). This component will support structural measures to reduce
                              natural disaster risks in selected river basins. The structural measures will include river and sea dykes and embankments, safe harbors (at river
                              mouths), rescue roads and bridges, and repair works to reservoirs to improve its safety. Investments will take place in two phases: Phase 1
                              Investments ($40.0 million) will include six high priority subprojects in five provinces mainly for urgent repair works for one existing reservoirs and
                              five river dykes. Phase 2 Investments (US$64.7 million) will include other high priority investments in the 10 provinces in the Central Region which
                              will respond to agreed prioritization criteria.

                              •         Component 5: Project Management (US$ 8.0 million). This component will finance incremental operating costs and technical assistance
                              to ensure smooth implementation of the overall project. The component will also support the compliance monitoring on safeguards, fiduciary

                                                                                                                                                                         Page 1 of 6
                               management (including external audit), and establishment of an effective M&E system for the project and applicable to the broader DRM sector
                               including tracking the implementation of the National DRM Strategy.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The project area will cover ten Central provinces of Vietnam including Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Da Nang, Quang
                               Nam, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, and Ninh Thuan. The majority of project investment activities will be implemented in four major river basins (Ma, Ca,
                               Vu Gia-Thu Bon, and Tra Khuc-Tra Bong) that span the provinces of Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Da Nang, Quang Nam, and Quang Ngai. The

                               rest of the investments will be in smaller river basins (Giang, Nhat Le, Thach Han, Kone, Dinh) in the other four provinces.

                               The river basins of the project area are considered to be Vietnam’s most disaster-prone areas. They are located entirely within Vietnam, except the
                               upper part of the Ca River which is located in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Ma River which originates in Vietnam but
                               runs through Lao PDR before coming back to Vietnam territory. Most of the rivers are short and steep causing fast water flows and accumulation of
                               sediment at the river mouths.

                               The project area experiences most of the different types of natural disasters in Vietnam, of which the most frequent are floods, typhoons, heat
                               waves, and droughts. Floods and inundations in the region usually occur on a large scale, simultaneously in several provinces, and sometimes
                               cover the entire region. Floods have been hitting the region more frequently and more fiercely, causing human casualties, property damage, and
                               soil and water pollution. Storms and more intense tropical low pressure systems are being recorded more regularly.

                               Most of the proposed subprojects would be located in the current flood prone areas with existing flood control and mitigation physical structures
                               such as dykes, embankments, dams, reservoirs, and fishing boat harbors. The Phase 1 subprojects include: (1) Maintenance and upgrading of the
                               key parts of the left dyke of Cau Chay river, Yen Dinh district, Thanh Hoa province; (2) Construction of a small bridge combining with overflow
                               connecting rescue roads, in Nghi Loc, Nghe An province; (3) Upgrading of dyke site of Luong Yen Khai, Nghe An province; (4) Upgrading of dyke
                               site of Phuc Long Nhuong, Cam Xuyen district, Ha Tinh province; (5) Repairing and strengthening of Thạch Ban reservoir, Duy Xuyen district,
                               Quang Nam province; and (6) Upgrading of an anti-erosion embankment of Kone river, An Nhon and Tuy Phuoc districts, Binh Dinh province.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   Environment

                                  OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment. The policy is triggered due to expected negative impacts, which will occur during the construction and
                                  operational phases of the project. Potential impacts could be caused by typical civil works to be carried out at the subproject level such as:
                                  rehabilitation/ upgrading of existing dykes, embankments; rehabilitation of overflow bridges, upgrading/ construction of rescue roads;
                                  rehabilitation/upgrading of existing dams/reservoir; and dredging and/or construction of river mouth infrastructure (i.e. rehabilitation of fishing
                                  boat harbors and/or river mouth erosion protection).

                                  The overall project impact will be positive since it will increase the safety of physical structures and the resilience of people, and reduce the
                                  potential loss of life and assets to natural hazards including raising community awareness and natural disaster risk management capacity at
                                  different levels and result in an improvement in the quality of the environment.

                                  The potential negative impacts during construction will be mainly due to civil works of the subproject to be implemented under Component 4
                                  and the impacts will be limited to increasing air, noise and water pollution, vibration, construction and solid wastes, traffic volume, community
                                  and occupational health and safety, etc. As the subprojects mainly involve upgrading and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, impacts are
                                  assessed to be moderate, localized, and temporary, and can be mitigated through the application of good construction and management
                                  practices and the strict implementation of the environmental code of practice (ECOP) which will be included in the bidding documents and the
                                  program of work of the contractor under a close supervision of contractor performance by field engineers and in close consultation with local
                                  communities. There is also safety risk related to UXO which is considered moderate since most of the subprojects will involve existing
                                                                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 6
                           infrastructure with very limited number of new construction (some small rescue roads).

                           The potential negative impacts during operation of Component 4 subprojects would be limited to the potential risks related to: (a) damages
                           caused to rehabilitation of dam dyke, and/or rescue roads and potential land/water use conflicts during operation of hydraulic infrastructures
                           (dams, and irrigation gates), and local floods and (b) possible impacts on coastal erosion in nearby area due to construction of new structures
                           that could change flow pattern of near shore current and/or sediment transport.

                           OP 4.04 Natural Habitats. The EA identified natural habitats at the river basin level and assessed the potential impacts of the first phase
                           subprojects on them. The assessment has shown that the proposed subprojects are not located within or nearby any critical natural habitat
                           such as protected areas, nature reserves or protection forests, and would not cause any significant loss or degradation of any area of natural
                           habitats. Therefore, OP 4.04 is not triggered. An exclusion list has been developed to exclude any subproject that could have significant
                           adverse impacts on natural habitats.

                           OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources. The screening of the subprojects to be financed by the Project indicates the Project will not affect any
                           areas of archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious or cultural significance within the project area. Nevertheless, chance
                           find procedures are included in the Environment and Social Management Framework that detail the steps and process that will be undertaken
                           in case of chance finds. The policy is triggered by relocation of graves in some subproject areas. Three of the six first year subprojects will
                           involve relocation of 22 graves.

                           OP 4.36 Forests. The project investment activities will be implemented at existing physical structures and will not involve forests or their
                           management, protection or utilization. As a result, this policy is not triggered.

                           OP 4.37. Safety of Dams. The project will involve rehabilitation, repairs and strengthening of 19 existing dams including large dams to improve
                           their safety and robustness to natural hazards. Some of the dams such as Thach Ban, Khe Tan, and Hoa Trung re higher than 15 m. Therefore,
                           this policy is triggered.

                           OP 7.50 Projects on International Waterways. Some of the project investments will include civil works to enhance safety of the dams and river
                           dykes of the Ma and Ca Rivers. Ca River originates in Lao PDR. Ma River begins in Vietnam, runs through the Lao PDR before rejoining the
                           Vietnam territory again. Therefore, the two rivers are considered to be international waterways, and thus the policy is triggered. The Lao PDR
                           has been notified on the proposed investment that would affect waterway/s shared by both Vietnam and Lao PDR.

                           Loss of land, assets, and businesses associated to land: The Project will require land acquisition (permanently and temporarily) to allow the
                           construction of the intended infrastructure. These activities may affect houses, assets, crops, perennial trees, graves, business and livelihood
                           of the households living with the expanded part of the infrastructure, as well as within the existing works. An estimated 3,000 households will be
                           affected as a result of the Project, of which 1,284 households would be affected by the six first-year subprojects. Permanent acquisition of 26
                           ha of land and temporary acquisition of 55 ha of land (68% of which are government managed land) will be required. Despite the apparently
                           high number of affected households (1,284 in aggregate at six first-year subprojects), impacts are minor at the household level. For instance, of
                           the total of 1,248 households affected (at six first-year subprojects), only 41 households (3.2%) are to be severely affected (only three
                           households would need to relocate their houses).

                           Linkages. During project preparation, screening (for linkages) of the six first-year subprojects (including the one in Thanh Hoa) indicates that
                           none of the subprojects are considered “linked? to other investments as defined in the OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement). When the project is
                           implemented, screening for potential linkages will be done for newly identified subprojects. If new subprojects are considered linked to other
                           projects, due diligence will be conducted to ensure activities linked to Bank financed subprojects are in compliance with domestic laws and
                           regulations, and with OP 4.12.

                           Impact on ethnic minority peoples: Approximately 210,000 ethnic minority households are currently living within the ten project provinces,
                           including Muong (in Thanh Hoa), Thai (in Thanh Hoa and Nghe An), Cham (in Ninh Thuan), H’re (in Quang Ngai) and Co Tu (in Quang Nam
                           and Da Nang). Most of these ethnic minorities live in the remote mountainous area (to the west of the country) which is to the upstream of the
                           river basins whereas most of the proposed subprojects are located in the current flood prone areas and to the downstream of the rivers. The
                           social impact assessment (done at selected two river basins) and ethnic minority screening (at provincial, river basin and subproject levels)
                           indicates that no ethnic minority households are affected as result of subprojects. The key reason is that most of the subprojects are located to
                           the downstream of the river basins (where ethnic minority peoples are virtually absent). Screening for ethnic minorities at the six first-year
                           subprojects indicates that no ethnic minority households are present in subproject areas.

                           Under this project, a river basin approach is adopted for the project’s investments/interventions. As such, although no adverse impacts are
                           anticipated on the livelihood of ethnic minorities, ethnic minority peoples were consulted during the project preparation and will be further
                           consulted during project implementation to ensure a) project’s adverse impact (if any, as a result of land acquisition) is minimized/mitigated; and
                           b) ethnic minority peoples can benefit from the project activities, particularly under Component 3 (Community-Based Disaster Risk
                           Management) which aims to enhance preparedness for natural disasters and capacity building for local people, including ethnic minorities
                           present in the river basins.

                           Consultations with ethnic minority peoples were conducted in a free, prior and informed manner, in the river basins indicate that ethnic minority
                           communities supports project activities since rehabilitating/upgrading public infrastructure mainly contributes to improving the preparedness as
                           well as capacities of the local communities in the basin, which will enhance the local capacity for natural disasters prevention, mitigation, and
                           reduce the risks associated with disaster events such as typhoons and storms. It is noted that there is no any foreseeable potential large scale,
                           significant and/or irreversible impacts as indicated by the social assessment and the overall environmental assessment study.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:



                                                                                                                                                                      Page 3 of 6
                             The potential risks related to operation of the subproject infrastructure are described above. No other negative potential indirect and/or long
                           term environment and social impacts due to future activities is anticipated in the project areas. The long term positive impacts of the project
                           include enhanced safety of physical structures, resilience of people, reduction of the potential loss of life and assets to natural hazards, and
                           enhanced community awareness and natural disaster risk management capacity.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            Most structural rehabilitation activities are to be carried out on existing infrastructure. However, efforts have been made to minimize the

                           adverse impacts, particularly impacts resulting from the acquisition of land to allow structural expansion for dykes, embankments, dams, rescue
                           roads, etc. Comparison of “No action? and “Project implementation? plans by the EA study indicates that the “Project implementation? plan is
                           preferred. The implementation of subprojects is necessary to protect human, livelihoods and property of the people.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            To address the project negative environmental impacts the following safeguard studies and documents have been prepared by the Client and
                           reviewed by the Bank environment and social specialists and found to be satisfactory:

                           Environment

                           •        Environmental Assessment (EA): The EA assessed the potential impacts of the project and identified the mitigation measures to be
                           undertaken at the project and subproject levels.

                           •           Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF): Given that there are still future subprojects to be identified and
                           implemented in the next phases, an ESMF has been prepared for (1) safeguard screening; (2) impact assessment and development of
                           mitigation measures; (3) safeguard documentation preparation and clearance, (4) safeguard implementation, supervision, monitoring, and
                           reporting, (5) institutional strengthening and capacity building programs; and (6) institutional arrangement and budget. The ESMF provides
                           guidelines for the preparation of an EMP for a subproject as well as requires the subproject to comply with the Government’s regulations on
                           EIA. The ESMF also includes a standard ECOP to be applied to Component 4 subprojects and a simple ECOP to be applied to other project
                           activities involving civil works. The ECOPs will be incorporated into the bidding and contract documents and be closely monitored by
                           supervision engineers.

                           •         Environmental Management Plans (EMPs): The EMPs for the six phase 1 subprojects have been prepared following the ESMF
                           guidelines. The same procedures will apply to the future subprojects during implementation. EMPs for the Phase 2 subprojects would be
                           prepared during the first year of project implementation.

                           •         Subproject EIAs/EPCs: The Government’s regulations on EIA require the preparation of an EIA or an Environmental Protection
                           Commitment (EPC) for an investment project. Accordingly, the EIAs/EPCs for the six phase 1 subprojects have been prepared and submitted
                           for Government approval. The phase 2 subprojects and other project activities will comply with the Government’s regulations on EIA and will be
                           prepared as specified in the ESMF.

                           •          Dam Safety Framework (DSF): A DSF has been prepared for the subproject involving dam safety describing specific measures
                           including scope for the preparation of a Dam Safety Report (DSR) for a large dam and a Dam Safety Inspection Report (DSIR) for small dam.
                           In addition to the EMP of the Thach Ban Reservoir rehabilitation subproject (phase 1), a DSR has been prepared including a plan for

                           construction supervision and quality assurance. In addition, operation and maintenance plans, emergency preparedness plans, and
                           instrumentation plans will be prepared during the project implementation. An independent Panel of Expert (POE) comprising of dam safety
                           experts will be formed to review dam safety works financed by the project. The phase 2 reservoir/dam rehabilitation subprojects will follow the
                           same procedures requires under the DSF.

                           Social

                           •          Social Assessment (SA): An SA was carried out following a river basin approach. The SA’s purpose is two-fold: one was to explore
                           potential positive and adverse impacts of the project and the other was to inform the project design, particularly for Component 3 (Community-
                           Based Disaster Risk Management). The overall social impact of the project is positive, given the project aims to strengthening national,
                           provincial, and local capacities for natural disaster prevention, preparedness, and mitigation through better planning and mitigating against
                           hazard risks, improving weather forecasting and early warning systems, and putting in place effective structural measures to reduce typhoon
                           and storm risks in high priority areas identified by vulnerable communities.

                           •          Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF): A RPF has been prepared to guide how a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) should be
                           formulated for a subproject. The RPF specifies steps to be taken for preparation, review, and clearance of RAPs for subsequent sub-projects
                           for which the impacts only become known during project implementation. The RPF under the project features the following:

                           �          Land, structure, crops, businesses: Compensation to land and physical structures will be made at the replacement cost while
                           compensation to crops will be made at the market prices. Businesses affected will be compensated for the loss of structures (at replacement
                           costs) and income loss irrespective of land status. Vulnerable groups such as women-headed households, the elderly or disabled, households
                           living below the poverty, the landless, ethnic minorities, etc. are entitled to additional support under the income restoration program when 10%
                           or more of their total productive land are affected. These entitlements are provided in addition to compensation made to the assets being
                           affected. The level of support for affected households will be determined on the basis of the project’ RPF combined with consultation to be
                           made during the socioeconomic survey that will be carried out during Detailed Measurement Surveys (DMS).

                           �          Grave relocation: During the preparation of the six subprojects, twenty two graves were identified as being affected. Relocation of
                           graves would be carried out by households whose graves are affected (as is the normal practice in Vietnam). Rituals for relocation of graves
                           may be different among Kinh, and ethnic minority peoples. Affected households will receive compensation payment to conduct the relocation on
                           their own. Payment to the grave relocation includes costs of excavation, relocation, reburial, purchasing land for reburial (if any), and all other
                           reasonable costs associated with necessary rituals by the local practice. Local ritual means relocation of graves will be carried out in
                           accordance with local cultural practices, taking into account cultural preferences which are typical for each ethnic group. When graves of ethnic
                           minorities are affected, grave relocation rituals adopted will be documented in respective Ethic Minority Development Plan (EMDPs) based on
                                                                                                                                                                   Page 4 of 6
                           the consultation with affected ethnic minority peoples during project implementation. Where graveyard - owned collectively by ethnic groups,
                           are affected, appropriate consultation with affected groups will be conducted during social assessment under respective subproject to work out
                           solutions acceptable to affected ethnic minorities. Relocation of graves will be done satisfactorily to the affected households prior to the
                           commencement of construction.

                           �           Ethnic Minority Policy Framework (EMPF) and Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP): An EMPF has been prepared on the basis
                           of free, prior, and informed consultation with ethnic minority communities to ensure there is a broad support form affected ethnic minority

                           communities for project implementation, and to ensure ethnic minorities have opportunity to receive socioeconomic benefits from the project in
                           a way that is culturally appropriate to them. The EMPF provides guidelines for the preparation of an Ethnic Minority Development Plan (EMDP)
                           for individual subprojects to be confirmed during project implementation.

                           �           Subproject Specific Safeguard Plans (RAPs): In consistency with the above-mentioned frameworks, RAPs were already prepared for
                           the six first-year subprojects to ensure affected households are compensated/ supported in accordance with Bank’s OP 4.12.

                           �          Social safeguards implementation arrangement. The implementation of the RAPs and EMDPs will be the responsibilities of the
                           respective provincial PMUs. The costs for land acquisition will be financed by the Government whereas the budget for EMDP implementation
                           will be from the Bank’s fund. However, they will obtain the support from the Central Project Management Office (CPMO), which is responsible
                           for providing guidance and technical support to the PPMUs over the course of the project to ensure the RAPs for six first-year subprojects are
                           updated appropriately before implementation, and the RAPs for new subprojects are prepared and implemented in accordance with the
                           project’s RPF. The Government will finance the costs for land acquisition. Other mitigation measures associated with the implementation of the
                           RAPs and EMDPs to ensure that income generation activities of affected households are restored to the pre-project living standard, and that
                           ethnic minorities in the project areas receive social and economic benefits that are culturally appropriate to them. A social staff will be appointed
                           and will be on board at every PPMU and CPMU to ensure social safeguards implementation and monitoring are in accordance with RPF. An
                           independent monitoring agency will also be hired by the project to carry out periodic and ad-hoc monitoring to ensure social safeguards
                           implementation under the project is in full compliance with the project’s RPF. Both RPF and EMPF specify a grievance redress mechanism.

                           Others

                           •           Projects on International Waterways: Under Components 3 and 4, some of the investments will be carried out within the basin of the
                           Ca River, which originates in the territory of Lao PDR and of the Ma river basin which originates in Vietnam, but runs a small part in Lao PDR
                           too. In line with the WB’s safeguard policy on Projects on International Waterways (OP 7.50), the Bank has requested the Government to notify
                           Lao PDR of the proposed investments under the project. The Lao PDR has been notified on the proposed investment that would affect
                           waterway/s shared by both Vietnam and Lao PDR.

                           Safeguard training

                           The CPMO and each Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Project
                           Management Unit (PMU) of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) who is responsible for Component 2, will appoint one
                           staff to be responsible for environmental and social safeguarding of the project and subprojects in the case of PPMUs. CPMO will be
                           responsible for supervision and monitoring the implementation of the ESMF and other safeguards policies such as RAF, EMDF, DSF while the
                           subproject PPMUs will be responsible for preparing and ensuring the effective implementation of safeguard measures such as RAPs, EMDPs,
                           EIAs/EPCs, EMPs/ECOP, DSR/DSIR and regular liaison with the local authorities and communities. Reporting of safeguard implementation
Public Disclosure Copy




                           must be done regularly.

                           Given that there are on-going WB projects related to dam safety and CBDRM in the project area it is considered that some CPMO/PPMUs staff
                           has knowledge and experience with WB safeguard policies and its requirements. However, it is anticipated that different and/or new staff would
                           be assigned to the project/subprojects therefore safeguard training would be necessary and will be provided to staff of CPMO/PPMUs as well
                           as contractors, local community representatives to increase familiarity with the safeguard instruments to be applied to the project. At least 4
                           safeguard training courses would be provided during the first 3 years of the project implementation. The training would first focus on the

                            In addition to the CPMO and PPMUs of MARD and PMU of MONRE who are responsible for the implementation of the project other key
                           stakeholders are people’s committees, local authorities, local communities, mass organization, and general public. Consultation and disclosure
                           were made as follows:

                           •          Consultation: Two public consultations were carried out in the process of preparing the EA, ESMF, and subproject EIAs/EMPs one in
                           June-July 2011 and the other in September 2011. Participants included farmer and fisherman households directly or indirectly affected by the
                           Project, local authorities, central and local state agencies, and mass organizations. The opinions and concerns expressed during the
                           consultation were mainly focused on mitigation measures to reduce environmental impacts during construction and compensation related to
                           land acquisition. As far as social issues are concerned, several consultations have been hold with different groups of people present in the river
                           basins covered by the project. People consulted include Kinh and ethnic minorities, affected as well as non-affected peoples, to identify and
                           examine potential impact of the project and explore how these adverse impacts could be effectively managed through appropriate consultation
                           with affected population. All these opinions and concerns were taken into account in the preparation of the final documents.

                           •         Disclosure: All safeguard documents (EA, ESMF, DSF, EMPs, RPF, EMPF, RAPs,) have been disclosed in Vietnamese at the
