                           B. Project Objectives
                           To improve public financial management by strengthening: (a) the mobilization of revenues (as
                           measured by increases in tax and non-tax revenues as a percentage of GDP); and (b) the management
                           of public resources focusing on the implementation of the FinancialManagement Information System
                           (FMIS) (as measured by more credible budget, improved financial accountability, and reduced
                         fiduciary risk, and functional FMIS). Progress against the principal objective will be measured by the
                         PFMRP’s Key Performance Indicators and Targets set forth under the Stage Two of the PFMRP.
                         C. Project Description

                         Under the Mobilization of Revenue (component 1) technical assistance will be provide to support
                         the ongoing implementation of the RGC’s Revenue Mobilization Strategy and the Medium –term
                         Revenue Policy to increase the amount of tax collected to a level comparable with neighboring
                         countries. Support to strengthen the legal and regulatory framework to improve public resource
                         collection, transparency and accountability (including EITI for effective oil and gas revenue
                         management) will also be provided. Envisioned activities include preparing sequenced and
                         sequenced and prioritized action plans for implementation each of the revenue measures outlined in
                         the strategy and ensuring both the Revenue Mobilization Strategy and the Revenue policy supports
                         the RGC’s overall strategy, policy, and planning goals such as the NSDP and long-term vision of
                         Cambodia.

                         The introduction and the implementation of the FMIS will be the core activity under Component 2 –
                         Improving the management of public resources. The delay in procuring the FMIS, the largest
                         component of the PFMAP, requires that the majority of the RETF is used to finance the FMIS
                         contract and ongoing preparatory work and activities supporting the system’s implementation and
                         management. Since January 2012 the RGC has developed a new strategy for the implementation of
                         a scaled down version of the Financial Management Information System (FMIS), a treasury centric
                         model, which will result in a more realistic definition of its scope, functionality, and coverage to
                         address the Government’s key financial management requirements.

                         The project also will finance critical FMIS-related activities through a sustained series of sequenced
                         ongoing TA support and training. These activities am to support the successful implementation of the
                         FMIS including: (i) the streamlining of business processes within the MEF and related restructuring
                         of the current organizational structure; (ii) putting in place a treasury support component which
                         includes the support to the implementation of International Public Sector Accounting Standard

                         (IPSAS), the introduction of a Uniform Account Code Structure (UACS) enabling IPSAS reporting,
                         and (iii) the development of public financial management capacity for sub-national and local
                         administrations.

                         Despite the delay of the FMIS procurement, the MEF has worked hard to finalize the COA to fully
                         meet IPSAS cash basis requirements. This represents a significant achievement under the PFMRP
                         as it lays the foundation for much greater transparency in budgeting, accounting, and reporting.
                         Sources of funds, program, and geographic classification coding under the UACS should encourage
                         the use of government PFM systems by donors and facilitate budget integration. This UACS along
                         with the piloting of the budget entity for the 2014 budget paves the way for greater deconcentration
                         of financial management and control from and the Ministry of Economy and Finance and other
                         central ministries to service delivery units (budget entities) and sub-national administrations.
