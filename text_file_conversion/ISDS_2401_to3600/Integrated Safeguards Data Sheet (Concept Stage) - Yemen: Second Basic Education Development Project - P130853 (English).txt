                           B. Project Objectives
                           The higher level objective is to assist the GOY in providing equitable learning opportunities in basic
                           education for increased student learning achievements. While BEDP II is intended the be a key
                           instrument in achieving these higher level objectives, the Project Development Objectives, specific
                           areas of intervention and key project results will be refined during project preparation, taking into
                           account available funding and in agreement with the GOY.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project would have the following components:
                         Component 1: Providing equitable learning opportunities in basic education to all Yemeni children
                         (US$190 million). This component will support both supply-side and demand-side interventions

                         aimed at improving enrollment of relevant age-group children, especially girls and disadvantaged
                         groups, in basic education. More specifically, this component will support: (i) the provision of school
                         infrastructure (new school buildings, extensions and rehabilitations) and learning resources,
                         including teachers; (ii) interventions to promote equity and inclusiveness targeting girls, rural and
                         poor communities, and out-of-school children ; and (iii) empowerment of schools and communities
                         through strengthening school-based management capacity and supporting parents councils.

                         Component 2: Improving the quality of basic education to increase student learning achievement (US
                         $90 million). This component will support: (i) a comprehensive sets of activities, covering the
                         development of curriculum, teaching and learning materials and teacher training, and aimed at
                         improving the acquisition of key competencies such as reading skills and math by basic education
                         students; (ii) the development of teacher policies aimed at developing standards for teacher
                         certification and qualification, and establishing a system for teachers professional development and
                         supporting school headmasters; and (iii) the development and implementation of a national student
                         assessment system to evaluate the acquisition of key competencies by basic education students,
                         particularly at grades 3 (reading) and 6 (math) (the frequency of such assessments will be discussed
                         during preparation).

                         Component 3: Improving education management capacity and practice for effective education
                         service delivery (US$10 million). This component will support: (i) capacity building of the MOE at
                         both the central and decentralized levels and support to the implementation of the MOE
                         restructuring, designed with funding from BEDP; (ii) strengthening the capacity of the MOE in
                         evidence-based policy design, implementation and evaluation; (iii) deployment of the Education
                         Management Information System designed under BEDP; and (iv) project management.

                         Component 4: Improving ECE services and increasing community participation (US$10 million).

                         This component will support the design and implementation of suitable ECE model (low-cost, high
                         effectiveness) involving community and private sector participation and aimed at substantially
                         increasing enrollment (currently less than 5 percent). Whether the ECE is treated as a stand-alone
                         component or an activity to be under another component will be determined during the preparation
                         mission.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         PWP (who will be in charge of the civil works activities) has a track record of preparing and
                         implementing the EMP for the Secondary Education Development and Girls' Access Project. PWP
                         will be responsible for preparing the updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP) taking into
                         account lessons learned from the previous experiences (i.e. toilets issue needs to be taken into
                         account). The Environmental Specialist in the Bank team will provide necessary support during the
                         preparation of such EMP. Consultants will be hired to monitor adherence to the EMP.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
                                  The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                      The EMP and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be launched in July 2012 (after project
                                      preparation mission) and will be completed prior to the September 4, 2012 Decision Meeting. A
                                      Social Assessment is not a safeguards requirement but it is a tool that will improve targeting,
                                      particularly of girls and young women and vulnerable segments of the society, and will also assist
                                      in the identification of potential risks to the project given the current situation in Yemen. It is
                                      expected that if possible this assessment would take place before the end of July 2012.
