III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
   would be prepared: N/A

B. For projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS:
   03/15/2012
C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
   Since the specific physical works and their location incl. status of land requirements will not
   be fully known at appraisal, an Environment and Social Management Framework will be
   developed by the client as to screen for social and environment issues and provide guidance
   on mitigatory procedures and actions to be taken. The ESMF will also include guidelines for
   the preparation of sub-project specific ESMPs during implementation. In case physical works
   require land acquisition or replacement of more than 200 people, this will have to be
   determined before appraisal and a SIA and RAP would have to be prepared and approved in
   advance.
