                              B. Project Objectives

                              The Project Development Objective is to support improvement of the quality and duration of water supply services in selected areas of the Armenia
                              Water and Sewerage Company's (AWSC) Service Area.

                              C. Project Description

                              The design of this repeater Project is to a large extent similar to the original Municipal Water and Wastewater Development Project (MWWP),
Public Disclosure Copy




                              which is scheduled to close in December 30, 2011, with satisfactory PDO and implementation rating. The proposed Municipal Water Project
                              (MWP) will replicate the MWWP activities in three other cities, install modern water meters throughout the AWSC Service Area, and scale up the
                              institutional development and sustainability measures. Similar to the successful design and implementation modality of the MWWP, the proposed
                              MWP will have the same three components:

                              Component 1:         Investments in Water Supply Systems (WB: $8.6m; Borrower: $1.72m): This component will finance: design, implementation
                              and supervision of the rehabilitation of water systems in the cities of Masis, Echmiadzin, and Ashtarak, including their neighboring settlements. The
                              rehabilitating works will include rehabilitation of networks linked to operation efficiency and reduction of non-revenue water. The main goal of the
                              investments under this Component is to finance physical infrastructure that is technically sound, cost effective, reliable and reduce technical
                              losses.

                              Component 2:        AWSC Investments (WB: $1.8m; Borrower: $0.36): This component will finance: (i) water meters replacement and installation
                              of meter chambers in several cities and villages throughout the AWSC Service Area to reduce commercial losses; (ii) automation of pumping
                              stations and reservoirs; and (iii) procurement of equipment and machinery for improved Operation & Maintenance system of AWSC.

                              Component 3:         AWSC Management Strengthening (WB: $4.6m; Borrower: $0.92): This component will finance: (i) a two years fee of the
                              enhanced management contract to improve AWSC administration, operations, maintenance, and to ensure optimal implementation of program's
                              investment funds; (ii) technical studies, project management and monitoring, including independent technical audits and financial audits.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will be implemented in the towns of Masis, Echmiadzin, Ashtarak, and the neighboring regional settlements.


                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              The AWSC will be responsible for respecting the national environmental legislation and the World Bank safeguard policies in the course of the
                              project implementation. AWSC has been implementing projects financed by several multilateral organizations and its track record in applying
                              environmental standards satisfactory to the donor institutions has been good. The AWSC capacity for implementing safeguards relies on the
                              services of an individual consultant financed from another donor-supported operation. This capacity needs reinforcement in light of the additional
                              requirements of the proposed new project. An assistant to the environmental officer will be hired under the MWP for the duration of this project.
