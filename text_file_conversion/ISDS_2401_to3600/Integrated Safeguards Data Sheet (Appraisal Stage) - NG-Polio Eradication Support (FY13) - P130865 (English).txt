                              2. Project Objectives

                              The development objective of the proposed Project is to assist, as part of a global polio eradication effort, the Government of Nigeria to achieve
                              and sustain at least 80% coverage with OPV immunization in every state in the country

                              3. Project Description

                              The project will provide funding for the procurement and supply of Oral Polio Vaccine for the Nigeria polio eradication efforts. This is a repeater

                              project of the Partnership for Polio Eradication Project (P080295), which is scheduled to close on April 30, 2012. The original project development
                              objective was to to assist the Government of Nigeria to achieve its goal of interrupting the transmission of the wild polio virus, and to sustain these
                              efforts throughout the implementation of the Project through effective oral polio vaccine coverage of the target population. The original credit, in
                              the amount of SDR 20.9 million (US$ 28.70 million equivalent) was approved on April 29, 2003, and was supplemented with three additional
                              credits of (i) SDR 33.4 million (US$ 51.7 million) approved on May 10, 2005; (ii) SDR 31.8 million (US$50 million) approved on September 8, 2008;
                              and (iii) SDR 39 million (US$ 60 million equivalent) approved 0n March 17, 2011. The previous credits have been fully disbursed, the target of
                              80% for OPV coverage has been reached, the overall implementation progress is rated as satisfactory, legal covenants have been complied with,
                              and there is no outstanding audit, fiduciary, environmental or social issue.

                              Compared to the original project, which included additional donor- and counterpart-financed polio eradication activities, this project is limited to the
                              IDA financed part of the Polio Eradication Program. In line with this, the project development objective has been modified to address only the OPV
                              coverage. The project complies with the requirements for a repeater project i.e. (i) it is consistent with current CAS objectives; (ii) the previous
                              project has demonstrated tangible results and was rated as satisfactory for the past 12 months; (iii) there are no unresolved fiduciary,
                              environmental or safeguard issues; and (iv) there is demonstrated client support for Bank participation in this final effort to eradicate polio.

                              While the epidemiology of polio is not easily understood and it therefore is not possible to predict how long it will take to eradicate polio from
                              Nigeria, it is now evident that full eradication has taken longer than originally anticipated. The developments in Nigeria over the last five years, the
                              recent intensified efforts by the country and its partners, as well as the recent success of eradication efforts in India indicate that there is an
                              opportunity that the last case may be recorded within the next one or two years. A repeater project is therefore justified to ensure that there is
                              secured financing of OPV for this – possibly – final effort to eradicate polio from Nigeria.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The Project is not envisaged to cause environmental risks and the environmental category for the additional financing is C as for the original
                                 Project. There is no construction financed under the project. Since oral vaccine becomes biologically inactive when exposed to outside
                                 temperatures, only the vaccine glass vials present a potential environmental risk. These are collected for vaccine monitoring purposes and
                                 brought to the state level where they are incinerated according to WHO guidelines and national and local laws and regulations for waste
                                 management in polio eradication programs.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   There is no potential indirect or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
