2. Project Objectives
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of RAP II is: Residents of beneficiary
Dzongkhags (Districts) utilize improved rural transport infrastructure and services. The
last implementation review has rated the progress towards the achievement of PDO and
the implementation progress as being satisfactory. The project was reviewed by the
Quality Assurance Group in May 2010 and a satisfactory rating was awarded.

3. Project Description
i) The Road Access Component - Otta-sealed (around US$ 0.6 million, excluding
contingencies) will include the following:
  a)Construction of two roads, with a total length of 18km, will be Otta-sealed.

 ii) Proposed additional changes, as part of restructuring of the original project, include
the following:
 a) Change in length of roads for new construction: During the project preparation it was
estimated that a total length of construction of new roads will be 65km. The estimation
made use of topographical sheets (scale 1:50,000). However, during the detailed survey
the length was found to be 75km. The project description in the Financing Agreement
needs to be changed due to this change in length.
  b) Change in road for Otta-Seal pilot. The road access component of the original project
had envisaged that the pilot of Otta-seal would be undertaken on two roads: Riju-
Bartsham road and Tangmachu-Takila road. However, MOWHS proposed and agreed
with IDA to pilot Otta-seal on Drametse road in order to avoid certain precedence of
Otta-sealing feeder roads. However, the Otta-sealing contract on the Drametse road was
subsequently cancelled after the completion of approximately 7km out of planned 18km
length. This was done as the contractor had failed to bring specified quality materials.
The Otta-seal piloting was undertaken on Bajo-Shengana road (6.2km) with IDAâ€™s
concurrence. The piloting on the latter road had considered the lessons learned from the
earlier road.
  c) Performance Based Maintenance Scheme. The Capacity Development and
Implementation Support Component included the provision of technical assistance to the
Pilot Performance Based Maintenance Mechanism. However, DOR has been piloting a
Performance Based Maintenance Scheme using National Work Force on its own
initiatives. Furthermore, DOR also engaged a consultant, with support from ADB, to
review the outcome of this pilot and to help DOR on trying out new maintenance
contracts. Although the IDA team provided initial input to DOR, it was decided and
agreed to drop this activity from the project.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project is located in Wangdue Dzongkhag. The roads will only be upgraded with a
low-cost Otta sealing technology. No widening is expected. The roads are not close to the
national parks, any protected area, their buffere zones or wildlife movement corridor or
any other known natural habitats.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Based on the screening carried out by the borrower, the proposed project activity is not
expected to cause any adverse social impacts and no involuntary resettlement and
rehabilitation activities are anticipated. However, as part of preparation of RAP II, a
Social Assessment Framework (SAF) based on the Royal Government of Bhutan
(RGOB) relevant legislation and guidelines, and the World Bank Operational Policy 4.12
on Involuntary Resettlement has been prepared by the borrower which will be applicable
for this project activity as well. The SAF defines the modalities for profiling socio-
economic conditions, identifying stakeholder groups, assessing social impacts, voluntary
land donations, the institutional structure to support social impact management, including
capacity building requirements and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, as well as
measures to protect and ensure the ongoing inclusion of economically vulnerable groups
in project implementation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared
and is detailed in the SAF, in the event that minor land acquisition is unavoidable, or if
project activities result in loss of privately owned assets/structures or the displacement of
people. The RPF defines the legal, institutional and implementation framework to guide
the compensation for lost assets, livelihoods, community property and resettlement and
rehabilitation of people in accordance to World Bank#s OP 4.12 and RBOG polices.

 Since the social assessments also indicated that there were no social groups present in
these areas with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that
would make them vulnerable in the development process, OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous
Peoples has not been triggered. However as part of the project design, vulnerable groups
will be involved in decision-making throughout the planning and implementation phase
of the project.

  Low-cost otta sealing on existing unpaved road is proposed. No major environmental
impact is expected from such activity in the given location. Burrower has carried out
rapid assessment of the potential impacts of the proposed activities and prepared a simple
Environmental Management Plan as required by the Bhutan country system. Bhutan
country system for environmental safeguard has been piloted in the parent project (RAP
II), results of which have been generally satisfactory. The proposed additional Financing
will also use the Bhutan country system. According to which, there will be compliance
checks and monitoring by the District Environmental Officers, MoWHS/PPD and
IDD/DoR besides project management team regular supervision.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No indirect and/or long term impacts are envisaged under the project.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
This is not relevant for the project as under this activity only Otta sealing of the existing
road will be carried out and therefore, no project alternatives was considered.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
DOR has developed capacity to address social issues, as social issues are now
mainstreamed in its regular business processes. In RAP - II, one engineer at the local
DOR division was designated as focal social development person responsible for internal
monitoring along with the other Dzongkhak officials responsible for land acquisition. All
staff members of DOR responsible for addressing social issues were given training by
Bank staff on Bank operational policies as well as on relevant local laws and legislations.
The external monitoring was carried out by an external agency. Same arrangement will
be followed for this project. The mechanism used in the parent project RAP II for
environmental management will be used in the proposed additional financing also. This
includes preparation of environmental management plans, ensuring internalization of
mitigations, site-orientations to the field personnel, monitoring by DEO and MoWHSD
and IDD, and work completion check by DEO.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A strong participatory approach in the selection, implementation and monitoring of
project interventions through direct participation of beneficiary communities was adopted
in RAP - II. The SAF (developed on the basis of consultations with key stakeholders and
affected communities) provides guidance on the overall consultation strategy and
mechanisms to ensure community awareness and involvement in the project, as well as
participatory monitoring and evaluation modalities. A stakeholder analysis and extensive
consultations with key stakeholders and beneficiary communities were carried during the
Social Assessments. The Executive Summaries of the environment and social safeguard
documents has been translated to national language the "Dzongkha" and distributed to
twenty Dzongkhaks and DOR Field Divisions.
