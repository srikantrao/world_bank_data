                              The project development objective is to introduce and use new teaching and learning practices in the classroom targeting the most disadvantaged
                              groups of primary students.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project seeks to bring about a substantive reform in the teaching and learning process of the classroom. The following elements for

                              learning success—or SCALE— form the core of the proposed intervention: (i) Student-centered learning, (ii) Cooperative learning, (iii) Active and
                              reflective learning, (iv) Linkages in knowledge building, and (v) Empowerment of the community. Provided in a combined and dedicated package,
                              this SCALE forms an ambitious program of pedagogical and administrative reform that has the potential to truly enhance the education system in
                              Vietnam, and provide an example for other countries to follow.

                              The proposed Vietnam Escuela Nueva (VNEN) project is an adaptation of the well known and extensively researched Escuela Nueva (EN)
                              program in Colombia. In 2009, Vietnam piloted the EN pedagogy of child-centered, group-learning and contextualized methodology under the
                              Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children project in 48 classrooms across six provinces in Vietnam The ensuing Vietnam Escuela Nueva
                              (VNEN) model, implemented by trained teachers, has been implemented in full since the beginning of the academic year in September 2011.

                              The project seeks to scale up VNEN while prioritizing resources towards disadvantaged communities. The project is composed of four components
                              that together will help bring about systemic change while prioritizing disadvantaged communities.

                                   The Bank’s safeguard policy on Indigenous People (OP 4.10) is triggered. However, the project is expected to have no adverse impact on
                                 ethnic minority groups. With a strong focus on poor, ethnic minority, remote and low performance regions, the project will increase the
                                 accessibility to high quality education services of students and teachers in the project locations. As the main direct beneficiaries are ethnic
                                 minority people, the entire project would be considered as an Ethnic Minority Development Plan. Therefore, no free standing Ethnic Minority
                                 Development Plan or Planning Framework is required. MOET conducted a social assessment of the communities applying the VNEN model,
                                 the findings of which have informed the project design, enabling a culturally appropriate intervention.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  In the long run, the quality of education received by ethnic minorities will improve, and the gap in educational attainment between ethnic
                                 minorities and the Kinh population will be reduced.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The Government of Vietnam has included several measures in the GPE-VNEN project to support ethnic minority children, in particular to
                                 develop their Vietnamese language skills so they can take full benefit of the VNEN model. These include (i) intensive training inVietnamese
                                 language in Grade 1 based on material developed under the PEDC project; (ii) ethnic minority teaching assistants who are fluent in Vietnamese
                                                                                                                                                                       Page 2 of 3
                              and the ethnic language for mother tongue facilitation; (iii) clustered (or group) seating between students of different abilities to allow students
                              to help each other under the VNEN model; (iv) parental and community involvement in the daily life of the school; (v) a training module for
                              teachers and school managers regarding ethnic minority children to be administered together with the subject specific training; and (vi) on-site
                              support to further help teachers with specific issues in their particular schools with a particular ethnic community, including opportunities for
                              innovative solutions to be shared across schools that may or may not be located close together.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
