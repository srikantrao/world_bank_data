                              planning agency and selected sector secretariats. These are likely to be in education, science & technology, economic development and
                              infrastructure. The Project will provide cross-cutting technical assistance in public investment and human resource planning, procurement

                              making. It will also support, through eligible expenditure programs, investments in education (technological modernization and buildings repair),
                              transport (highway rehabilitation and maintenance) and private sector development (cluster programs, industrial extension services and technology

                              3. Project Description

                              The Rio Grande do Sul SWAp has two components: a cross-cutting public sector management component comprising technical assistance of
                              approximately US$50 million (the ‘head’) and an eligible expenditure program (EEP) component of approximately US$430 million (the ‘body’). The
                              purpose of the technical assistance is to strengthen the capacity of the Government to plan and execute the eligible expenditure programs. The
                              exact allocation of activities between technical assistance and eligible expenditure programs will be determined at appraisal

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 The Project is not expected to create any major environmental impact. An Environmental Management Framework has nevertheless been
                                 prepared due to: (i) the range of activities and the variability in their level of readiness which will require the preparation and review of multiple
                                 safeguards instruments; (ii) the multi-sector nature of the Project which will require engagement on safeguards management with multiple
                                 actors and counterparts with varying levels of capacity; and (iii) the counterparts familiarity with the Banks safeguards requirements is limited.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 The Environmental Management sub-component will strengthen its management systems and improve environmental education. This
                                 component will strengthen the States environmental licensing and zoning systems and support the development of an integrated disaster risk
                                 management policy and early warning and response system. In addition the ecological-economic zoning system will broaden the criteria
                                 employed in land use decision-making to include socio-economic as well as environmental and physical factors.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 Rio Grande do Sul has advanced environmental laws, reflecting a political culture of strong environmental protection, but needs to strengthen
                                 its management systems and improve environmental education. The State has prepared an Environmental Management Framework for the
                                 Project which will provide overall guidance as to how to proceed during implementation.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 The immediate beneficiaries of this Project will be technical staff and other employees in the following state agencies: Secretariat of Planning,
                                 Management and Citizen Participation (SEPLAG), Secretariat of Administration and (SARH), Secretariat of Environment (SEMA), Secretariat of
                                                                                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                           Education (SEDUC), Department of Highways (DAER), State Development and Investment Promotion Agency (AGDI) and Secretariat of
                           Science, Innovation and Technology (SCIT). Rio Grande do Sul has a strong tradition of citizen participation in public sector management.
                           However, the current system suffers from a number of problems, among them inadequate participatory designs and an absence of articulation
                           between the budgetary process and other forms of citizen participation. The Project will strengthen the participatory system through assistance
                           for the development of an ICT strategy, a secure multi-channel voting system, participatory budgeting platform and participation portal.
