                           The development objective of the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project for Low Income States
                           (RWSSP-LIS) is to improve piped water supply and sanitation services for selected rural
                           communities in the target states through decentralized delivery systems.



                                                                     Page 1 of 11

                         (iv)    Improvements in O&M cost recovery.
                         3. Project Description
                         The proposed project will support the preparation and implementation of a dedicated RWSS program
                         for improving piped water and sanitation coverage in the Low Income States, through a USD 1
                         billion (USD 500 million IDA, and USD 500 million GoI counterpart funding) first phase for Assam,
                         Bihar, Jharkhand and UP. The project will be implemented through a special window of assistance
                         under the on-going GoI Program, National Rural Drinking Water Programme (NRDWP). The
                         project interventions will be at all four levels: National, State, Districts, and Villages (including
                         Blocks, as appropriate). Project proposes to build the capacity of the Ministry of Drinking Water
                         Supply at the center, which will enable it to address the National and the State requirements. The
                         project will be implemented over a six year period.

                         Key Elements of the RWSS Project for Lagging States. The RWSS Project for Low Income States
                         will promote decentralized service delivery arrangements with increased Panchayati Raj Institution
                         (PRI) and community participation, improved financial sustainability and enhanced accountability at
                         all levels. A major shift from the business-as-usual will be the decentralization of RWSS service
                         delivery responsibility to the DWSM and the Zila Panchayat (ZP - district PRI) for Multi Village
                         Schemes (MVS) and the GPs for Single Village Schemes (SVS) and the intra-village MVSs. The
                         other major focus is on strengthening policy and planning activities at the state and district levels,
                         with clear accountability to the GPs and the beneficiary communities. The existing SWSMs and the
                         participating DWSMs, ZPs, and GPs will be strengthened and their capacity built to allow them to
                         undertake their respective policy, planning and review functions. An integrated approach to water
                         supply, sanitation and environmental sanitation, along with source sustainability programs, will be
                         supported by the project. The following are the key elements of the RWSS Program:

                         •       Placing GPs and communities in the central role – supported by higher levels of PRI, by
                         State governments, and by local NGOs and the private sector – for facilitating, planning,
                         implementing, monitoring and providing a range of O&M back-up services.
                         •       Using sustainable, community or local government managed models for intra-GP RWSS
                         schemes and using State-PRI partnership models for MVSs.
                         •       Putting water resources security as a core theme of the new model, including increased
                         community management of scarce resources.
                         •       Moving the RWSS sector to achieve the recovery of at least 50 percent of O&M and
                         replacement costs, and initiating contributions to capital costs.
                         •       Integrating water supply and sanitation, with effective sanitation promotion programs for
                         achieving ‘clean villages’.

                         Project Components:

                         The Project comprises the following three main components: (A) Capacity and Sector Development;
                         (B) Infrastructure Development; and (C) Project Implementation Support.

                         Component A: Capacity and Sector Development (15%): This component will support the building
                         of institutional capacity for implementing, managing and sustaining the project activities, along with


                                                                      Page 2 of 11
                         sector development studies to inform policy decisions. The main sub-components include: (a)
                         Capacity Building activities for MoDWS; (b) Capacity Building and Training activities for State,
                         district, and village level institutions, PRIs, and sector stakeholders; (c) Information, Education and

                         Communications (IEC) Program; (d) Innovative Pilot Programs and Sector Development Studies;
                         and (e) Monitoring and Evaluation Program at the State and Sector level (across participating Low
                         Income States), along with on-line system for financial management and reporting. Governance and
                         Accountability Action Plan will also be implemented by the MoDWS and the States.

                         Component B: Infrastructure Development (80%): This component will support investments for
                         improving water supply and sanitation coverage, including construction of new infrastructure or
                         rehabilitation and augmentation of existing schemes, along with engineering support costs. The water
                         supply investments will include water source strengthening and catchment area protection activities.
                         Most habitations are expected to be served by SVSs using local groundwater sources. The MVSs,
                         mainly relying on surface water sources, will be taken up for habitations where the local source is
                         either not sustainable or not of acceptable quality. The sanitation component will complement the
                         NBA activities and will support the construction of household latrines, soak-pits, drain and lane
                         improvements, community awareness programs for improving sanitation and hygiene practices,
                         along with incentives for achieving ‘open defecation free’ status. In addition, pilot programs will
                         include 24/7 water supply provision in select areas, and the introduction of new technologies,
                         including the use of solar energy . The project will support the universal provision of household
                         connections, meters for bulk water supply in all schemes, and the promotion of household meters,
                         where appropriate.

                         Component C: Project Management Support (5%): This component includes project management
                         support to the various entities at the national, state, district, and village levels for implementing the
                         project, including staffing, consultancy and equipment costs, and internal and external Financial
                         Audits.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard

                         analysis (if known)
                         Project interventions are being planned in four ‘low income states’ of the country -- Assam, Uttar
                         Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. The interventions promise a huge potential for positive health and
                         environmental as well as social benefits through supply of 'safe' drinking water and creation of
                         sanitary conditions in the village. However, given the extensive diverse conditions –physical as well
                         as socio-economic and cultural – it will be a challenge to translate the potential into reality. Of the
                         four states, two states (Jharkand and Assam) are predominantly ‘tribal’ and have substantial
                         geographical area under ‘forests’. In Jharkhand, mining is done extensively. In Uttar Pradesh, the
                         project is expected to confine itself to the eastern region which is characterized by high water table
                         and poor drainage resulting in high incidence of water transmitted diseases. In Bihar too several
                         districts have water table vulnerable to contamination. Largely fluoride, iron, nitrate and arsenic are
                         major chemical contaminants in the four states. Lastly, potable water may not be available locally in
                         a good number of habitations. As a result, water may have to be drawn from long distances via large
                         and complex multi village schemes which may necessitate special arrangements for securing ‘lands’
                         for these interventions.

                         In summary, the project interventions are likely to interface with forests, mines and natural habitats
                         as well as high water table areas and lands. These issues constitute the salient features of the projects
                         that are relevant for safeguards analysis. These issues are however not new to the Bank’s RWSS
                         team. In several projects, over the last two decades, these issues have been addressed successfully.


                                                                        Page 3 of 11
                           Several social and environmental mitigation measures will be included in the project design to ensure
                           a net positive effect on the environment and social development. The project itself is not expected to
                           cause any adverse impacts. However, the following key concerns will underpin safeguards

                         proposed project activities and to design appropriate management measures for enhancing the
                         positive impacts and mitigating potential negative impacts. These assessments included collection

                         and collation of secondary data, primary surveys and field studies in a sample of villages
                         representing various agro-climatic zones, analysis of policy and legal framework, and wide
                         stakeholder consultations. The program is not expected to have significant adverse environmental
                         and social impacts. However, the program does have the potential to offer significant opportunities
                         to further environmental and social development objectives. Safeguards Management Planning has
                         been prepared following Social and Environmental Assessments by independent consultants.

                         Social Assessment comprised: (i) Beneficiary Assessment (BA), (ii) Stakeholder Analysis (SA),
                         (iii) Institutional Analysis; (iv) Impacts Assessments; and (v) Risk Analysis. BA enabled building
                         socio-economic profiles at the national, district, sub-district and village level; the project
                         beneficiaries’ assessment on the current status of research/extension/marketing; and their linkages
                         with governance/management mechanisms. SA resulted in identifying stakeholders at different
                         levels and mapping the key expectations, issues and concerns as related to each stakeholder and
                         the sub-groups thereof. Institutional analysis led to documenting and analyzing the existing
                         institutional arrangements, and formulating inputs into designing of the decentralized extension
                         delivery system in consultation/collaboration with the stakeholders. This was followed by impact
                         assessments and risk analysis. The results helped in designing the delivery system and addressing
                         safeguards, thus ensuring positive and sustainable impacts.

                         Environmental Assessment (EA) study, which comprised an assessment of the current status of
                         rural water supply and sanitation in the state, status of the water resources availability for sourcing
                         of drinking water in terms of quantity and quality, identification of baseline environmental issues
                         pertaining to rural water supply and sanitation, institutional, legal and policy assessment, expected
                         environmental impacts of the proposed project interventions and proposed mitigation measures,
                         development of an Environmental Management Framework (EMF), and institutional arrangements
                         for implementation of the EMF. The findings of the EA study indicate that while the proposed

                         project interventions are expected to result in overall environmental and public health
                         improvements in the state, potential adverse impacts could occur if the schemes are not properly
                         designed, sited, implemented, and maintained.

                         Social Development Issues:

                         Given the extensive diverse conditions –physical as well as socio-economic and cultural – it will
                         be a challenge to translate the potential into reality. Success of the project depends upon the
                         project’s efforts at mobilizing local communities to participate in the development of water
                         supply and sanitation facilities and enable them shoulder responsibility for the operation and
                         maintenance and derive benefits on a sustained basis. The communities, however, are quite diverse
                         in many ways – social (scheduled castes, others), economic (landless, small, marginal, and large
                         farmers), ethnic (scheduled tribe, others), gender (female headed households) and geographical
                         setting (hills, plains, forests, flood prone). A good number of regions are also suffering from poor
                         water quality due to high content of fluoride, arsenic iron and other minerals which compels
                         searching for water from long distances. Gram Panchayats, local self-governments, are still in their
                         infancy. Added to these are other dimensions such as those areas characteristically Conflict
                         Affected, infested by Naxalites and other Extremist Groups, rendering accessibility highly
                         difficult. Additionally, WATSAN sector mainly rests with the Government Departments who have
                         been traditionally following top-down and hierarchical decision making with hardly any

                                                                    Page 5 of 11

                         5.       Given this setting, the project identifies the following as significant social issues: (i)
                         participation; (ii) ensuring inclusion and enhancing equity, (ii) decentralizing service delivery

                         underpinned by the principle of subsidiarity; (iii) customer base and demand generation –
                         marketing the program and deriving home the health and hygiene benefits (iv) human and
                         institutional development. The other important issues are enabling participation, especially of
                         women; GP Strengthening; change management initiatives for changing the role of Government
                         from ‘provider’ to a ‘facilitator’ to ensure; improving accountability and transparency; and
                         information, education and communication (IEC) campaign along with capacity building
                         programs.
                         From a social safeguard perspective, no lands are to be/ will be acquired involuntarily and hence
                         OP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement is not triggered. However, rules for securing lands have been
                         developed and agreed. Barring Jharkhand, there are no Tribals in any other project state. In
                         Jharkand, of the six districts to be covered under the project, four of them are in the Fifth Schedule
                         Areas. Hence, OP 4.10, on Indigenous Peoples policy is triggered.

                         Social Safeguards Management

                         Lands: Land requirement arises for four purposes: FOR (i) water source; (ii) water treatment
                         plants; (iii) construction of ground level or overhead tanks (G/OHT) or cisterns; and (iv)Water
                         transmission and distribution pipelines as well as sullage/ storm water drains. Water sources could
                         be either ground water or based on surface sources, chiefly, rivers and canals. The ground water
                         sources do require ‘land’ and so is the case with WTPs. In the case of tanks, if they are constructed
                         in a place other than that of the ‘source, separate land will be essential. Transmission and
                         distribution lines are laid mostly in public land or along public streets and no land needs are to be
                         secured. In a few cases, pipelines may have to pass through private agriculture fields. Since the
                         pipeline are laid at least 90 cms below ground elevation, no land acquisition is needed, but
                         permission from the land owner is taken. If such permission is not forthcoming, then alternative
                         pipe routing is used, even if it is more expensive to do so. This means, lands are required for Sl

                         No (i), (ii) and (iii).

                         When plots of lands are to be acquired for project installations, their ownership could be either
                         public or private. While it is easier to access public land, arrangements will have to be made for
                         securing privately owned land. The prevailing normal practice in the state is obtain such land plots
                         either through voluntary donation or by outright purchase. The discussions with
                         the communities and experts as well as the past experiences reveal that : (i) most villages do have
                         sufficient public/Panchayat lands; and (ii) in case, it becomes inevitable, the local community will
                         secure lands either through voluntary donations or outright purchase.

                         Rules of taking possession of land. Rules governing taking possession of land through donations
                         and/ or purchases are developed based on the experience of the Bank assisted projects: Kerala/
                         Karnataka/Maharashtra/ Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project; and UP Sodic Lands
                         Reclamation, UP Diversified Agriculture as well as Karnataka Watershed Projects. These rules
                         will be binding on the part of all states, with the following major elements:


                         o       All donations and purchases will be voluntary. Mechanisms will be developed not only to
                         ensure the voluntariness but also that it will not involve any significant adverse impact upon
                         incomes or physical displacement.

                                                                    Page 6 of 11
                         o        All voluntary land transactions will meet the following criteria: (i) the land in question
                         will be free of squatters, encroachers or other claims of encumbrances; (ii) land will be chosen by
                         the community after ensuring that water will be available in that particular piece of land; (iii)

                         verification of the voluntary nature of land donations in each case; (iii) due transparent measures
                         will be in place; (iv) land transfers will be complete, land title will be vested in the community/ GP
                         through a registered sale deed or MOU; and (v) provision will be made for redressal of grievances
                         (ROG) if any.
                         o        All voluntary transactions will be documented and signed by both the parties. Agreements
                         on above will be reached during appraisal and legal documents will include the necessary clauses.
                         o        DPMU will arrange for an examination of all land transactions by an independent agency
                         before according the approval. Further, lands will not be accepted from such land owners whose
                         holding will be less than the minimum economical viable stipulated size (2.5 acres).

                         Tribal Development (Indigenous Peoples Policy- OP/BP 4.10): All the four states have sizeable
                         Schedule Tribe population. However, barring Jharkhand, there are no ‘tribals’ (akin to Indigenous
                         Peoples in Bank parlance) in any other state in the project districts. In Jharkhand, the state policies
                         ensure safeguarding the tribals’ interests whereby in accordance with the Indian Constitutional
                         provision (Article 244), a significant geographical area is recognized as a distinct tribal territory,
                         normally called ‘Scheduled Area’ where the constitutional provision of the Fifth Schedule applies.
                         Jharkand’s scheduled area is spread across as many as 14 districts (out of a total of 24 districts). Of
                         the six districts chosen for project coverage, four of them have Scheduled Areas. The proposed
                         project interventions are not likely to have any adverse impact on the tribal groups. However, a
                         majority of the tribals are socially and economically weak, prone to vulnerability, and often
                         excluded from development initiatives. Hence, to ensure that they have access to project benefits
                         on par with others, and ensure ‘inclusion’ and ‘equity’, specific targeting is essential. Accordingly
                         in line with the Bank’s OP 4.10, a Tribal Development Plan has been prepared aimed at ensuring
                         that the project reaches the Tribals.

                         Tribal Development Plan has the following objective : ‘Promotion of inclusive, equitable and

                         sustainable water supply and sanitation delivery through fostering and empowering grassroots
                         tribal institutions in the tribal areas’. TDP shall have the geographical jurisdiction comprising all
                         the scheduled areas of the six project districts. Scale of operations will be proportionate to the
                         extent of tribal population and subject to the overall state program. Thus, in all, TDP will cover, at
                         the minimum, 253 water supply schemes and 1592 environmental sanitation schemes. Besides
                         this, about 40,000 households will be equipped with household latrines. This component is
                         expected to benefit about 380,000 tribal populations.

                         Environmental Issues and Management

                         (i) Water Availability: Increasing levels of water contamination due to anthropogenic activities is
                         slowly becoming an area of concern. Open defecation, lack of means to dispose animal waste, and
                         garbage are major contaminating factors in all the states. As per baseline data, the state of Assam
                         has an annual replenish able groundwater resources of 27.23 BCM out of which 22% is being
                         utilized annually. There are no zones classified as over exploited, critical or semi-critical in
                         Assam. The Mighty Brahmaputra River has an average water discharge at the mouth with a flow
                         of 19,830 cum/sec., a maximum discharge of 72794 cum/sec. at Guwahati and a minimum
                         discharge of 1757 cum/sec. There are 861 number of ox-bow lakes/cut-off meanders are present
                         throughout the state of Assam, covering an area of 15460.60 ha., a total of 1125 number of
                         waterlogged areas are observed which are distributed unevenly covering an area of 23431.50 ha.

                                                                    Page 7 of 11
                         and as many as 712 number of swampy/marshy areas have been identified from satellite data
                         which cover an area of 43433.50 ha. Though surface water is available, risk from floods to intakes
                         and other water supply infrastructure is an issue of sustainability. Floods may create water quality

                         issues, like flood waters entering toilets resulting in contamination of surface and groundwater
                         aquifers. Decreasing groundwater levels are observed in some districts.

                         The annual replenishable groundwater resources in Bihar are estimated to be 29.19 BCM out of
                         which about 39% is being utilized. There are no zones classified as over exploited, critical or
                         semi-critical in the state. The surface water resource in Bihar includes 69000 ha of ponds and
                         tanks, 9000 ha of oxbow lakes, 7200 ha of reservoirs, 3200 km of rivers and 1 lakh ha of riverine
                         and other flood plains. Due to the general lowering of groundwater table, during summer months
                         hand pumps run dry. Floods in Bihar create water quality issues and spread of water related
                         diseases after floods are recorded. The ground water table in some of the north Bihar district is
                         high; this may create water quality problems due to rampant open defecation and solid waste
                         disposal.

                         The annual replenishable ground water resources in Jharkhand are estimated to be 5.58 BCM out
                         of which about 20% is being utilized. Major rivers/ streams of Jharkhand include Brahmanni,
                         Subarnarekha, Damodar, Amanat, Anuranga, Barakar Ajoy and Mayurakshi. Wetlands constitute
                         an area of 170,000 ha. in the state. Jharkhand is famous for its rich mineral resources like
                         Uranium, Mica, Bauxite, Granite, Gold, Silver, Graphite, Magnetite, Dolomite, Fireclay, Quartz,
                         Fieldspar, Coal (32% of India), Iron, Copper (25%of India) etc. Forests and woodlands occupy
                         more than 29% of the state which is amongst the highest in India. The mining of these resources
                         affects the groundwater availability and quality in addition to affecting streams and water bodies
                         due to ore-waste, coal washeries and detritus.

                         The groundwater levels in Uttar Pradesh show a wide variation from less than 2 mbgl to more than
                         30 mbgl. The annual replenishable groundwater resources in UP are 76.35 BCM, out of which
                         about 70% is being utilized. Of the rivers and canals in the country, Uttar Pradesh occupies the
Public Disclosure Copy




                         first place with the total length of rivers and canals as 31.2 thousand km. that is about 17 percent
                         of the total length of rivers and canals in the country. The state of UP falls in Ganga Basin with the
                         sub basins of Yamuna, Ramganga, Gomati and Ghaghra Rivers. The state is estimated to have
                         161.70 BCM (131.0 m.a.f.) of surface water. Frequent drying of groundwater sources and their
                         contamination is an issue. The Shallow groundwater in eastern districts of the state is naturally
                         found to be in high state of Arsenic, Fluoride, and Iron, leading to the concentrations that are often
                         exceeding the drinking water standards. In order to ensure sustainability, groundwater is sourced
                         from deep aquifers after scientific hydrogeological investigations. To avoid flood related risks the
                         HFL of the source and nearby rivers need to be taken into consideration during the design.

                         (ii) Water Quality: The aquifers in many districts of Assam are affected with excess of Fluoride,
                         Iron and Arsenic. The discharges of untreated domestic wastewater, industrial wastewater, run of
                         from the agricultural fields and the urban sewage water is polluting the surface water in the state of
                         Assam. Ground water in Bihar is affected in many districts with excess Fluoride, Iron, Nitrate and
                         Arsenic. Bacterial contamination is found in surface water in Bihar. Water quality of shallow hand
                         pumps is considered poor by the villagers. Groundwater in Jharkhand is affected in many districts
                         with excess Fluoride, Nitrate and Arsenic. Bacterial contamination is found in surface water in
                         many places in Jharkhand in addition to increase in turbidity levels due to mining activities.

                         (iii) Environmental Sanitation: In Assam, about 62% of the households have household latrines

                                                                    Page 8 of 11
                           and out of these only around 66% use them. In Bihar, the present level of sanitation coverage in
                           the rural areas is less than 25 % with usage percentage much lower. The status of sanitation in
                           Jharkhand is very dismal, with only about 8% households having access to sanitation in the rural

                           areas and the balance defecating in the open. There are no sanitation facilities in most of rural
                           households in eastern Uttar Pradesh. Most villagers practice open defecation which is a source of
                           contamination of shallow groundwater and spread of water related and contagious diseases. Poor
                           or unfinished installations, lack of super structure and reluctance to change behaviour is leading to
                           non-use of toilets.

                           (iv) Solid and Liquid Management: There is no drainage or sewerage system in villages of Bihar
                           with most of the liquid waste is going to either agricultural land or to open ponds and open fields
                           affecting the surface water quality. There is no drainage or sewerage system in villages of
                           Jharkhand. In many of the Eastern UP districts solid and liquid waste management facilities are
                           nearly non-existent. Major issues that arise of this situation in all states are that wastewater
                           logging takes place near residences, thereby posing health problems and polluting groundwater
                           sources. The solid waste strewn around the village is posing a major public health problem in the
                           villages in all states, apart from contaminating water sources.

                           (v) Proposed Schemes in Forest Areas: Assam and Jharkhand are states with significant land under
                           forests, the OP 4.36 willbe triggered wherever, water sources or any infrastructure related to
                           scheme is located in the forests. Government of India (GOI) as well as state governments has well
                           laid out rules and procedures for making use of forest lands for non-forest purposes. Key principle
                           underpinning the land transactions are:

                           (i) Before awarding any work, an application will be made to the concerned Divisional Forest
                           Officer (DFO) requesting lands specifying location and area required as well as purpose
                           for which it will be used.

                           (ii) DFO will examine and recommends to the state government which has powers to

                           accord approval for lands up to five hectare and area beyond needs approval by GOI.

                           (iii) Due care be taken for not siting any scheme within or near to any National Park / Wild Life
                           Sanctuary. The Government of India and State Government rules and legislations related to such
                           areas will be followed.

                           Past experience of rural water supply projects and as other projects implemented by other sector
                           institutions indicate that a majority of schemes may not require more than 0.5 Ha (single village
                           schemes) and 1-2 Ha (multi-village schemes). This means, most approvals will be sought within
                           the state. Forest land transfer will require fees to be paid towards lease amount; annual lease rent,
                           and net present value (NPV), amounts will be determined by DFO. Therefore, before any project
                           be taken up in the forest areas due procedure to seek forest clearance be undertaken before work
                           on a water supply scheme be started.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                            No indirect and/ or long term impacts are expected as a result of the project intervention. Most of
                           the project components will have complementary positive impacts on the environment e.g. a
                           combination of ground water recharge measures, greater ownership by communities and
                           willingness to improve sustainability of local water sources. The selection of safe drinking water

                           sources coupled with water quality monitoring programs and environmental sanitation and health
                           hygiene education will contribute in sustainable water supply systems and in improving
                           environmental conditions in villages.

                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                            Environment: Due to the participatory nature of the schemes and framework approach adopted
                           for environmental management, the alternative options for villages would be considered during the
                           design and planning phase of each scheme.

                           Social: It is well recognized that the RWSS reforms are being attempted for the first time in these
                           states, and that it will be a difficult and challenging task for the government, PRIs and
                           communities. Hence, towards ensuring that potential positive benefits do translate into reality, a
                           variety of alternative interventions will be explored for extending community development support
                           as well as human and institutional development efforts. This will be complemented with an ample
                           provision for ‘change management’ initiatives.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                            Roles and responsibilities for ensuring implementation of the environment and social safeguards
                           have been detailed out at state, district, Block and village/scheme levels. At the state level, the
                           Program Management Unit (PMU) is being set-up within the RWSSD, with a mandate to manage
                           the proposed project. The PSU staff will include Environment and Social Development Specialists
                           charged with the overall responsibility of ensuring the implementation of the environmental and
                           social aspects. Similarly at the district level, each of the District PMU will include an
                           Environmental/ Social Development Specialist in their staff, who will be responsible for ensuring
                           social and environmental capacity support to the project partners-PRIs and communities. At the
                           village level, the awareness and capacity for environmental management in the local VWSC and
                           SO would be enhanced through a targeted training and capacity building program.

                           The social and environmental management will form an integral part of the overall scheme cycle.
                           Each detailed scheme report shall contain environmental/ social checklist highlighting the issues
                           and mitigation measures. Scheme appraisals will take due note of this and shall guide in decision
                           making. Grassroots/village level checklist preparation will rest with the concerned Junior Engineer
                           and the Support Organization. Implementation monitoring will rest chiefly with the VWSC who
                           will be capacitated and supported for this by RWSSD. The post implementation supervision
                           (including water quality) would be integrated with the overall monitoring of performance
                           indicators. Training and information, education, communication (IEC) activities are planned to
                           build the capacity of community institutions as well as project staff for effective integration of
                           safeguards measures into the scheme-based activities.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             Key program stakeholders were identified and consultations held to seek their views and
                           incorporate the same into designing of the program. Grassroots level stakeholders include: (i)
                           benefiting households (including women, poor, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes); (ii)
                           Gram Panchayats (men and women elected representatives), (iii) Junior Engineers of RWSSD, and
                           (iv) other community based organizations. Block/ district level stakeholders are: the respective
                           Panchayat Raj Institutions; other concerned line departments such as health, rural department,
                           power, irrigation; district/ block administration; the RWSSD; and non-governmental
