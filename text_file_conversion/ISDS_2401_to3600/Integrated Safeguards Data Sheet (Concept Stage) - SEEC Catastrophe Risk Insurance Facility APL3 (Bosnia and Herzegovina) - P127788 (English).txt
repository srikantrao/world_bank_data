                              The Project Development Objective (PDO) is consistent with the development objective for the SEEC CRIF program: to help increase the access
                              of homeowners, farmers, the enterprise sector and government agencies to financial protection from losses causedby climate change and
                              geological hazards.

                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed project is the third phase of a horizontal Adaptable Program Loan and comprises a US$3 million IDA regional credit and US$2
                              million IDA credit to finance Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership contribution to the Facility. The proposed project will enable Europa Re to
                              provide reinsurance support and required market infrastructure for innovative insurance products that will cover the costs of replacing physical
                              assets (such as homes, business equipment and inventory, greenhouses) and livelihoods lost to natural disasters. The first phase (APL1),
                              approved by the World Bank Group Board on March 3, 2011, consists of IBRD loans to Serbia and FYR Macedonia. The second phase (APL2),
                              under preparation, comprises an IBRD loan to Montenegro. And the third phase (APL3), also under preparation, comprises an IDA credit to Bosnia
                              and Herzegovina.

                              The PDO will be achieved through SEEC CRIF, a catastrophe and weather risk reinsurance program, which will enable a rapid expansion of
                              penetration for weather and catastrophe risk insurance products among beneficiaries in participating countries. A non-profit, government-owned
                              organization, Europa Reinsurance Facility Ltd. (Europa Re), has been established as a specialized regional reinsurer to implement the program.
                              Europa Re was incorporated under Swiss Law in Zug, Switzerland in November 2009 and will provide reinsurance, pricing and underwriting
                              services to private insurers in member countries for standardized catastrophe and weather risk insurance products.

                              The main design features of SEEC CRIF closely follow the previous prototypes of national and regional catastrophe and weather risk programs
                              developed with direct technical and capital assistance from the Bank, however, the program contains several innovations. These include (i) the
                              development of both traditional indemnity type catastrophe insurance products and parametric index-based weather risk hedging contracts; (ii)
                              private management and governance of the Facility; (iii) a sunset clause for the duration of government participation in the program; and (iv) the
                              openness of the Facility to a wider range of clients, inclusive of households, farmers, government agencies and the enterprise sector exposed to
                              weather risk.

                              There are two components under the overall program. Component 1 (Countries' Participation in Europa Re) supports SEEC countries' efforts to
                              join Europa Re by financing their membership contributions to the Facility. The countries' membership contributions to Europa Re form the
                              company#s initial capitalization. Component 2 (Technical Assistance), financed by donor funds (SECO and GEF grants) and implemented by
                              Europa Re, includes: (i) risk mapping and modeling for participating countries (ii) design and pricing of appropriate catastrophe and weather risk
                              insurance products; (iii) development of a web-based underwriting platform; (iv) small weather monitoring stations to support parametric weather
                              insurance; and (v) technical assistance for regulatory and policy reforms, to create an enabling market environment. Most of the technical and
                              regulatory work funded by the Technical Cooperation component will be carried out in the member countries after the disbursement of their
                              membership contributions into the Facility.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)
                           The SEEC CRIF program covers countries in Southeast Europe and the Caucasus. The governments of participating countries (currently Albania,
                           FYR Macedonia, and Serbia) have expressed their full commitment to the program and their representatives will actively participate in program
                           governance through shareholders meetings and participation on policy advisory board while the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
                           currently at the advanced stage of project preparation.

                           The project was classified as environmental category C as no environmental impact is expected from the proposed operation.
