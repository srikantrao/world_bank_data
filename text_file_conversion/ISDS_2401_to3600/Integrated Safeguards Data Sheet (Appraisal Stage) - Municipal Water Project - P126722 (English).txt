                              This is a repeater operation. The original project is scheduled to close in February 28, 2012, with satisfactory PDO and implementation rating. This
                              Project will replicate the original project activities in three other cities and scale up the institutional development and sustainability measures.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed Municipal Water Project (MWP) builds upon the improvements attained in the prior Municipal Water and Wastewater Project
                              (MWWP) and continues with measures towards greater AWSC sustainability. Specifically, it is structured around three complementary components
                              to simultaneously address key factors contributing to Armenia high level of non-revenue water and attain measurable gains in AWSC sustainability:

                              Component 1:         Investments in Water Supply Systems (WB: $8.6m; Borrower: $1.72m): This component will finance: design, implementation
                              and supervision of the rehabilitation of water systems in the cities of Masis, Echmiadzin, and Ashtarak, including their neighboring rural
                              settlements. The works will include rehabilitation of water networks linked to operation efficiency and reduction of non-revenue water. The main
                              goal of the investments under this Component is to finance physical infrastructure that is technically sound, cost effective, and reliable and that
                              reduces technical losses.

                              Component 2:        AWSC Investments (WB: $1.8m; Borrower: $0.36): This component will finance: (i) water meter replacement and installation of
                              meter chambers in several cities and villages throughout the AWSC Service Area to reduce commercial losses; (ii) automation of pumping stations
                              and reservoirs; and (iii) procurement of equipment and machinery for improved O&M system of AWSC.

                              Component 3:        AWSC Management Strengthening (WB: $4.6m; Borrower: $0.92): This component will finance: (i) about a two years of fees
                              for an Enhanced Management Contract (EMC) to improve AWSC administration, operations, maintenance, and ensure optimal implementation of
                              the program investment funds; and (ii) technical studies, project management and monitoring, including independent technical audits, financial
                              audits and operating cost.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will be implemented in the towns of Masis, Echmiadzin, Ashtarak, and the neighboring regional settlements. Implementation
                              experience in the first project, indicates that the works were carried out under limited scope at existing sites and Safeguards treatment was
                              primarily concerned with environmental conditions, and social issues relevant to the project objectives are mostly in relation to social impacts of the
                              project (no physical resettlement/land acquisition was undertaken). This repeater project will not finance construction of a new infrastructure and all
                              civil works will be performed on the existing water supply schemes and no private land owners or other land users will be affected by the works.

                                 existing asbestos-containing pipes in the course of earth works. Generic measures for mitigating these risks are provided in the Environmental
                                 Management Framework (EMF). They will be adjusted to individual work sites as required through the preparation of site-specific
                                 Environmental Management Plans (EMPs).
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 Long term environmental and social impacts resulting from the project implementation will be positive, as the repaired water supply systems will
                                 allow to increase duration of daily water supply to users, cut water loss due to leakage, strengthen guarantees of supplied water quality, and in
                                 some pumped water schemes - will allow for power savings.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 PProvided that many water supply schemes throughout the country are in need of upgrading, a set of prioritizing criteria was used to select the
                                 schemes to be targeted by the project. Potential short term negative environmental impacts are very similar and modest for the rehabilitation of
                                 any existing provincial water supply scheme, so selection of target schemes was not dependent on the environmental risk assessment. Some
                                                                                                                                                                       Page 2 of 4
                           of the selected schemes include sections of old asbestos pipes. Technological alternatives of unearthing and replacing these sections as
                           opposed to leaving them untouched and laing new piping in along the same route were considered and the latter option was chosen as it allows
                           to avoid risks to health and safety of workers as well as those related to the generation and disposal of hazardous waste.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                           MWP is classified as environmental Category B according to OP/BP 4.01. It will finance rehabilitation of several priority water supply schemes
                           in five municipalities and their satellite rural settlements. Works to be undertaken in various locations will be pretty similar in terms of applied

                           technologies and scope. Their potential environmental risks and mitigation measures required for mitigation of these risks are also mostly
                           common for the target schemes and pretty well known upfront. Therefore, the EMF was prepared to provide guiding principles of environmental
                           management under the MWP. This document builds on the EMF developed back in 2004 for the MWWP and revised for the AF to MWWP in
                           2008. The EMF revised to serve the needs of MWP was re-disclosed in-country on MM DD, 2012 and posted in the InfoShop on MM DD, 2012.
                           Once the detailed designs for the MWP work program are available, the client will be required to develop site-specific EMPs for the individual
                           investments.

                           AWSC, through the Project Implementing Entity (PIE) within it, is responsible for day-to-day management of the MWP, including application of
                           World Bank safeguard policies and ensuring compliance with the national environmental legislation. Due environmental diligence of AWSC will
                           include assuring (i) presence of satisfactory site-specific EMPs for all individual investment sites; (ii) presence of the required permits for waste
                           disposal, quarrying and borrowing, operation of asphalt/concrete plants, etc. as applicable; (iii) proper application of mitigation measures
                           provided in the site-specific EMPs in the course of works and upon their completion; and (iv) observance of occupational safety rules as well as
                           safety of traffic and pedestrian movement in and around work sites. For meeting such standards AWSC will exercise quality control of EMPs,
                           guarantee their inclusion in the bidding documents and incorporation into the works contracts, and maintain efficient mechanism of field
                           environmental monitoring of works. While environmental supervision of works will be part of the assignment of a licensed technical supervision
                           entity to be contracted from outside, AWSC will be responsible for quality control of the work undertaken by supervisor, verification of
                           information provided in the monthly reports of supervisor, and quarterly reporting to the World Bank on the status of environmental compliance
                           to the World Bank. AWSC will be capable of performing these functions through strengthening its institutional capacity for environmental
                           management by hiring an additional environmental specialist on the proceeds of the MWP.

                           The State Committee on Water Systems (SCWS), through its Contract management and Monitoring Unit (CMMU), will provide general
                           oversight and support of the MWP implementation and that will include tracking performance of works contractors, including application of the
                           environmental mitigation measures included in EMPs. Various national line agencies authorized to carry out control of respective thematic
                           aspects pertaining MWP at its construction and operation phases include: the State Environmental Inspectorate of the RA Ministry of Nature
                           Protection, the State Hygiene and Anti-Epidemic Inspectorate of the RA Ministry of Health, State Agency for Protection of Historical and Cultural
                           Monuments (as necessary), RA Ministry of Transport and Communications; and the local self-governing bodies.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                           Water users of the supply schemes selected for rehabilitation are the main beneficiaries of the project. At the same time they are the people
                           prone to the potential temporary negative impacts expected at the construction stage. SCWS and AWSC are also among the main
                           stakeholders.

                           Safeguard policies applicable to the MWP are explained in the EMF which builds on the EMF developed back in 2004 for the MWWP and
                           revised for the AF to MWWP in 2008. Those earlier versions of the EMF were publicized and discussed among stakeholders. Current EMF

                           detailed designs for the MWP work program are available, the client will develop site-specific EMPs for the individual investments, which will be
                           disclosed and consulted upon with the affected communities prior to commencement of works at each individual project site.
