2. Project Objectives:
The objective of this Grant is to support the development and refinement of harmonized
operational assessment tools and guide by leading international organizations on human and
animal health. This would contribute to increase capacity of countries to address priority
diseases, including zoonoses and pandemic threat, and build synergies among human and animal
health systems.

3. Project Description:
The project would support the development or refinement by the WHO and OIE of necessary
evaluation tools and an operational guide to strengthen public health and animal health services
and to develop cross-sectoral strategies and activities. Such tools would be used by OIE and
WHO experts in countries. Additionally, pilot missions would be conducted to develop the
common operational guide in 2 to 3 countries of Europe and Central Asia and South Asia and/or
East Asia and Pacific Regions and concrete processes defined to base future collaboration and
action at both global and national levels using complementarities and synergies.
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project would be implemented by the OIE and WHO at their respective headquarters (Paris
and Geneva) ; workshops would be organized in their different regional offices and missions
would be carried out in various requesting countries.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Since this program mainly deals with institutional development, it is not expected to have any
adverse environmental or safeguard issues.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

It is expected that the project would ultimately help countries improve human and animal health
as tools developed by the project would help them conform to international standards following
good governance mechanisms; this would therefore help minimize the incidence and prevalence
of diseases in both humans and animals, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality. This would
contribute to improve the social and economic welfare of people, in particular the most
vulnerable.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

No adverse impact has been identified.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

Not relevant as no adverse impact has been identified.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Not relevant as no adverse impact has been identified.
