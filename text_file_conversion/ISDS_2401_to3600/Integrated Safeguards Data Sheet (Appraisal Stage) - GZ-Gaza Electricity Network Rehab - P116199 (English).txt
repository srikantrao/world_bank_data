                              1.           Description

                              Component 1: Network Rehabilitation and Expansion. The investment projects financed under this component include the following:

                              (a)       Subcomponent 1: Rehabilitation of Medium and Low Voltage Networks. This subcomponent includes the rehabilitation of medium and
                              low voltage networks.

                              (b)      Subcomponent 2: Network Supply Improvement. This subcomponent includes the construction of new network facilities to improve the
                              performance of the electricity supply in Gaza, i.e. new 22 kV underground feeders from the Gaza Power Plant, reconfiguration and expansion of
                              medium and low voltage networks, and new 22 kV underground feeders from the proposed 161 kV north substation.

                              (c)      Subcomponent 3: Collection Improvement. This subcomponent includes the purchase of mobile billing PCs and installation of prepaid
                              meters and supporting equipment.

                              Component 2: Utility Capacity Building. The aim of this component is to increase the capacity of GEDCO in system operation and management
                              and will include the following:

                              (d)      Subcomponent 1: Supply of Vehicles and IT Equipment to GEDCO: This will include the procurement of vehicle, IT systems including
                              hardware and software and tools, Geographic Information System (GIS) and load flow hardware and software

                              (e)         Subcomponent 2: Technical Assistance including the recruitment of a consulting firm to assist PEA in preparing a master plan for the
                              electricity sector, and an auditing firm for project costs.

                              2.           Environmental and Social Aspects

                              The project is classified as environmental category B and designed to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Environmental Assessment
                              (OP 4.01) safeguard policy. An environmental and social impact review was undertaken by the World Bank during project preparation and noted
                              that project activities could result in minor, temporary, site-specific and reversible adverse environmental impacts. The review also underscored the
                              largely positive social impacts that will be generated through the project. The PEA and GEDCO prepared an Environmental and Social Impact
                                                                                                                                                                           Page 1 of 3
                               Assessment (ESIA) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) for the project that included mitigation measures for potential
                               environmental and social impacts during construction and operation.

                               During preparation, it was assessed that OP 4.12 would not be triggered. The draft ESIA prepared by GEDCO indicates that the process of
                               building new networks do not require land acquisition. Installation of the poles and underground rooms will be through allocated land from the
                               municipalities concerned of the public services including the electricity networks. In addition, the team conducted site visits of around 10 percent of
                               the total project sites. Based on this assessment and the verbal confirmation of GEDCO and the PEA, the team determined that OP 4.12 will not

                               be triggered. To further confirm this, written documentation was requested from the PEA to confirm that all works, even if there are design
                               changes, will be done on public land and will not result in relocation or loss of shelter, loss of assets or access to assets, or loss of income sources
                               or means of livelihoods.

                               For component one, all works will be done on existing lines ( changing poles, adding transformers, etc.), which are routed on sidewalks in
                               agreement with the municipality and after obtaining approvals as required. Entrance to stores and other sources of livelihood will be accessible by
                               providing walkways and construction will be done at night when necessary. Component 2 will consist of work on the median of streets, which will
                               not require any resettlement or obstruct any livelihoods.

                               Thepolicy on Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) will also not be triggered by project activities due to the nature and location of the investment
                               projects. This was verified during project prepara tion and confirmed in the ESMP as w ell. No other environmental policies are triggered as a result
                               of project activities.

                               The PMU and GEDCO will monitor the implementation of the ESMP and report to the World Bank on its compliance during project implementation.
                               Since GEDCO will be responsible for implementation of the contracts/works financed under this project, it will therefore report to the PMU on
                               implementation of contracts (including compliance with ESMP). The PMU will in turn aggregate information and report to the Bank in the project
                               progress reports on the implementation of the ESMP. A separate an nex will be added to the progress reports on ESMP compliance, by sub-
                               component.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The investment projects financed by this operation are expected to rehabilitate and expand the electricity networks located in various locations in
                               Gaza including urban and surrounding areas connected to the distribution networks.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  Environmental impacts are expected to be minor in nature that can be mitigated by the contractor following standard good practice codes for
                                  civil works. Further the ESMP has identified mitigation measures for potential adverse impacts. Project will not result in large scale, significant
                                  or irreversible impacts.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  None.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  None.

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 3
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                              The PMU and GEDCO have prepared an ESIA/ESMP in a consultative manner with relevant stakeholders. Detailed consultations were held in
                              all project governorates during preparation of the report. GEDCO will be responsible for implementation of the contracts/works financed under
                              this project and will therefore report to the PMU on implementation of contracts (including compliance with ESMP). The PMU will in turn
                              aggregate information and report to the Bank in the project progress reports on the implementation of the ESMP. A separate annex will be
                              added to the progress reports on ESMP compliance, by sub-component. Relevant GEDCO staff was trained by the Bank on safeguard policies

                              and requirements. Capacity building of these staff as well as of GEDCOs Environment Safety Unit will be continuously strengthened during
                              implementation. This will help with reporting of ESMP implementation in the progress reports.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                              GEDCO invited key stakeholders including affected people, tribal leaders, women, youth and other relevant local NGOs, environmental
                              institutions, government agencies and other stakeholders to attend five public consultations in Gaza, North, Khanyounis, Middle and Rafah
                              governorates between October 16 and 24, 2011. The consultations were attended by about 158 people. During the consultations it was made
                              clear that the project will be implemented on public land and will not fall in the property of citizens. Citizen complaints, if any, should be
                              submitted in writing to GEDCOs management, who will work with the citizen to resolve any disputes. Overall, it is clear that the projects are
                              expected to attain significant important environmental and social benefits that over weigh any minor adverse environmental and social impacts,
                              which can be mitigated through the implementation of the Environmental and Social Management Plan.
