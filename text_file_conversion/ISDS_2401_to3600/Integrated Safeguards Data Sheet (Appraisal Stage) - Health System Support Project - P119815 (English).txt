                              22.       The total population to cover under the project is 2.5 million, which is close to 2/3 of CAR’s population. The project is expected to be
                              implemented in nine prefectures located in four out of seven Health Regions (HR) in CAR: HR 2 (Prefectures of Mambéré Kadéi and Sangha
                              Mbaéré: 542,542 inhabitants, excluding Nana Membéré where CORDAID is already implementing PBF for 3 years); HR 3 (Prefectures of Ouham
                              and Ouham-Pendé: 931,346 inhabitants); HR 4 (Prefectures of Ouaka, Kémo and Nana Grébizi: 597,367 inhabitants); and HR 6 (Prefectures of
                              Mbomou and Basse-Kotto: 481,157 inhabitants). These four health regions included in the intervention were targeted by the project due to their
                              poor health status and health service coverage indicators. In fact, for certain indicators, coverage has deteriorated in these regions between 2006
                              and 2011. Three regions were excluded from the project intervention zone: Health Region 5 was excluded due to its ongoing security concerns,
                              while Health Region 1 (the closest to Bangui and currently benefitting from the ongoing European Union PBF intervention) and Health Region 7
                              (Bangui and surrounding localities) were not targeted as their health status and service coverage indicators are relatively better off than the four
                              regions targeted by the project. The anticipated estimated level of funding for the project does allow covering a maximum of 2.5 million
                              populations, which is size of the population in the targeted prefectures.

                              23.        The proposed PDO key results indicators are: (i) increasing the proportion of people with access to a basic package of health services
                              (number of consultations/capita/year in targeted areas) (ii) increasing the proportion of children fully immunized (proportion of children under 1 year
                              who received all vaccines in the project areas); (iii) increasing the proportion of births attended by trained personnel in health facility in targeted
                              areas (%); (iv) increasing the number of new cases of tuberculosis treated in targeted areas; and (v) increasing the contraceptive prevalence rate
                              in the project areas (%).

                              24.        All core sectoral indicators, except two (the number of facilities constructed, renovated and/or equipped; and the number of long-lasted
                              insecticide-treated malaria nets purchased and/or distributed) are included in the project targeted indicators (detailed list of indicators targeted by
                              the project is attached in Annex 2, Para. 8). The project will not address the issue of inputs related to infrastructure and malaria nets.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project has two main components: results-based financing (component 1) and strengthening M&E capacity (component 2). The
                              CAR team proposes to apply for funding from the Health Results Innovations Trust Fund (HRITF) to further d evelop the intervention. HRITF
                              funding could be up to US $10 million, in addition to the 15 million from IDA-16.

                               Component 1: Improving use and quality of maternal and child services through results based financing at different levels. (US$13 million). This
                              component finances the purchasing of key MCH and RH services from rural public, FBO and NGO facilities by a Performance Purchasing Agency
                              (PPA). The PPA will contract with health posts, health centers and district and regional level hospitals to deliver an agreed package of MCH, RH
                              and curative services. Facility payments will be based on: (i) volume of pre-defined MCH and RH services delivered and (ii) technical quality of
                              these services. Payment rates will also be adjusted for factors such as remoteness of the health facility. Facility payments will be made quarterly
                                                                                                                                                                           Page 1 of 4
                               after service volumes have been verified and quality of care has been assessed independently of facility personnel. Project funds to make
                               payments to health facilities will be held by an independent fund holder called the Performance Purchasing Agency (PPA) and released to
                               contracted health facilities after the quantity and quality of services provided are certified. An External Evaluation Agency (EEA) will perform ex
                               post-facto verification of the quantity and quality of these services. Given the shortage of technical capacity and human resources within the MoH
                               the project proposes to identify international NGOs with demonstrated experience with RBF to act as the PPAs. Given the low management
                               capacity within the public sector, a second important aspect of the PPA#s role will be to build the management capacity for RBF at both the central
                               level and in the periphery by working with the central-level steering committee, regional health directorates and district health teams.

                                Component 2. Strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity to enable the health information system to generate up to date, reliable data to
                               measure performance for RBF (US 2.0 million). At present, the health sector routine reporting system is very fragmented and the data generated
                               are too unreliable and inaccurate to use as a basis for measuring health facility performance. Since RBF payments are to be made based on
                               service volumes and quality, having accurate data on these parameters is critical to effective implementation. The component will therefore
                               support health facility and population-based household surveys to be conducted by an independent third party, i.e., the External Evaluation Agency
                               (EEA). The EEA will be contracted by the MoH. The EEA#s role will include: (i) Ex post-fact verification of service volumes and quality delivered by
                               contracted health faci lities through a combination of facility record checks, technical quality assessments using a checklist, home visits to a sub-
                               sample of facility clients and community or focus groups to assess perceived quality, (ii) annual household and health facility surveys to measure
                               service coverage and quality and evaluate the p erformance of the project, and (iii) building in-country M&E capacity. The project will initiate
                               advance procurement of an EEA with demonstrated and relevant M&E capacity to ensure that timely baseline data are available.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The program will be implemented in all regions of CAR, provided that the team succeeds in securing the additional US $10 million from Health
                               Results InnovationsTrust Fund (HRITF). It is not anticipated that project activities aiming at paying for performance will have significant negative
                               environmental impacts, besides the increase level of use of medical products by the physicians. The Indigenous Peoples located in Region 1
                               (Lobaye and Ombella-Mpoko prefectures) and Region2 (Nana-Mambéré, Mambéré # Kadéî, and Sangha # Mbaéré prefectures) are at risk of not
                               benefiting equitably from the project given that traditionally they barely utilize modern medical services.

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The project will not support civil works. Nevertheless, the project will result in an increase in the use of medical material which will accordingly
                                  increase medical wastes. The main safeguard instrument under this policy will be the Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) prepared by
                                  the Government prepared in September. This plan is being implemented by the MoH and it was agreed that the same plan will be applied in
                                  the context of this project. In addition, health centers will report on hazardous medical material waste management since that action will be
                                  included as an indicator to be evaluated and purchased in PBF. In fact, the quantified quality checklist used by PBF to pay for performance on
                                  the quality measure, measures this element. The weighting for this aspect will be increased, and the adherence to the guidelines will be
                                  checked, and paid for, quarterly. Finally there is no issue because of the comparative advantage of PBF to solving such traditionally intangible
                                  problem.

                           To better address the need to ensure that indigenous pygmy communities share in project benefits, an Indigenous Peoples Planning
                           Framework (IPPF) has been prepared and will be disclosed prior to appraisal in 2012. The IPPF will set out: (a) the types of interventions
                           proposed for financing under the project; (b) the potential positive and adverse effects of such interventions on Indigenous Peoples. It will be
                           elaborated in a participatory manner through: (i) discussions with individuals or IP households; (ii) taking into account the point of view of
                           organization supporting the promotion of the IP population; (iii) meetings with administrative authorities and local elected officials; and (iv)
                           discussions with technical services and international and national NGOs. The IPP includes (i) a baseline, (ii) an evaluation of possible impacts
                           of the project, (iii) activities to be conducted to ensure similar benefits towards IP than towards other communities, (iv) monitoring and

                           evaluation arrangements including mechanisms and benchmarks appropriate to the project; (v) a budget; and (vi) disclosure arrangements.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                            The project activities will not generate any indirect or long-term environmental impacts. The increased volume of medical waste that will be
                           generated by the project will be mitigated by the MWMP which will be revised if need be to take into account this increase in volume of medical
                           waste.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                             N/A.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                             The Government of CAR has extensive experience with World Bank safeguard policies, notably, under the ongoing Multisectoral HIV/AIDS
                           project which closing date was extended for eighteen months to March 2012. The extension of the closing date was conditioned to the updating
                           and implementation of revised strategy of medical waste management. The Medical Waste Management Plan prepared for the Multisectoral
                           HIV/AIDS and updated in 2010 will be re-disclosed prior to appraisal. An Indigenous Peoples Plan will be prepared prior to appraisal to ensure
                           that Indigenous Peoples who are generally marginalized will also benefit from this project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             The World Bank safeguards team will also provide training session on WB s safeguards policies and the PIU staff will benefit from specific
                           training on medical waste management techniques. Moreover, the quantity and quantified quality checklist used by PBF, to pay for
                           performance, will precisely measure both the proportion of indigenous people served by health facilities and the management of medical waste.
                           The weighting for those two indicators will be increased, and the adherence to the Indigenous Peoples Plan and guidelines for waste
                           management will be checked, and paid for, quarterly. This is the comparative advantage of PBF in solving such traditionally intangible
                           problems.
