                              C. Project Description

                              The project is likely to consist of the following components:

                              Component A: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building and Financial Sustainability of DHM (preliminary estimate US$ 4 million)
                              The main objective of this component is to ensure the institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the DHM to deliver weather, water and
                              climate services that meet the needs of Nepal. This component will also support the development of detailed project design and project
                              implementation and monitoring.

                              In view of the proposed significant upgrading and modernization of the DHM infrastructure, it is anticipated that the skills and staffing profile of
                              DHM will change. The following areas were identified as priority needs:
                              #          Detailed design of the DHM systems and project management support;
                              #          Institutional development and system restructuring options recognizing the needs of users and limitations of financing operations costs;
                              #          Development of a legal and regulatory framework concerning specialized hydrometeorological services;
                              #          Developing and implementing a DHM capacity building and training program, possibly:
                                    Using the Voluntary Cooperation Program of the WMO or regional training opportunities such as the Bay of Bengal Severe Weather
                              Forecasting Demonstration Project;
                                    Implementing training activities (workshops, round tables, etc.) for major users (agriculture, water resources, energy, health, civil aviation),
                              including those dealing with the use of the hydrometeorological information to ensure timely response actions;
                              #          Enhancing and expanding the existing public private partnership scheme.
                              #          Project management, monitoring and evaluation of components A, B and C (managed by DHM)
                              #          Coordination with the #Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development Project# of the Nepal SPCR for dissemination
                              of SPCR lessons learnt and best practices (for all Components, A, B, C and D of this project).

                              Component B: Modernization of the Hydro-meteorological and Environmental Observation Networks (preliminary estimate US$ 13 million)
                              The objective of this component is to upgrade and expand the meteorological and hydrological observation networks to ensure the efficient and
                              timely collection, transmission, processing and dissemination of information that is essential for the management of disaster risks, agriculture,
                              water resources, hydropower, etc.

                              Collection of high-quality data is the foundation for producing reliable weather forecasts and providing timely warnings. This information will help
                              build climate resilience in key sectors and also fulfill Nepal#s international and bilateral obligations to provide information on hydro-meteorological
                              conditions within the country. Specific activities might include:
                         #          Installing up to 100 automated weather stations capable of measuring meteorological parameters to the standards recommended by
                         WMO. Up to 20% of these stations could be equipped for agro-meteorological purposes, including soil moisture. Fifteen of these sites are currently
                         designated as synoptic stations (those designed according to WMO standards for use in large scale and global weather forecasts) and could be
                         refurbished accordingly. Three stations could provide representative climate information for three major climatic regions of Nepal (high mountains,
                         hills and terai) and comply with the standards set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Some of the stations could also be equipped
                         for air quality sampling to measure PM10, black carbon, UV, and ozone. The feasibility of including at least three high altitude stations linked to the
                         hydrological network should also be considered.

                         #          Installing up to 100 automated hydrological stations with the capacity to monitor stages, rainfall, and discharge. A subset of the network,
                         up to 20%, could be designed to measure basic water quality parameters (conductivity, BOD, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) and sedimentation. An
                         additional ten stations could be located in the upper reaches of the watersheds where current coverage is low.
                         #          Building capabilities to measure snow depth and density needed to forecast seasonal flows.
                         #          Installing up to two upper air stations measuring profiles of temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction to provide representative
                         daily or twice daily samples of the atmosphere. These data would improve weather forecasts for Nepal and local capacity to forecast extreme
                         weather events.
                         #          Installing up to two weather radar with the option to include other nowcasting systems, such as a lightening network to improve the real-
                         time monitoring of dangerous weather events that result in flash floods and landslides, livestock losses due to hail, and hazards to aviation.
                         #          Installing calibration facilities for the routine calibration of meteorological and hydrological equipment. This may include a combination of
                         fixed and mobile facilities.
                         #          Refurbishing DHM facilities

                         Component C: Enhancement of the Service Delivery System of DHM (preliminary estimate US$ 3 million)
                         The objective of this component is to improve weather, water and climate services, i.e., for extreme weather warnings and decision support
                         systems.

                         Currently Nepal does not issue any formal warnings for weather or weather extremes. Improving the forms and methods of providing weather
                         forecasts for government authorities and the public, as well as specialized weather, water and climate forecasts for specific user groups, is one of
                         the most important opportunities of this project. Specific activities could include:
                         #          Introducing modern communication facilities and technologies for receiving and processing data, to enable higher quality forecast and
                         warnings and increase warning lead times;
                         #          Implementing multi-purpose meteorological communication facilities and a system of hydro-meteorological data processing, archiving,
                         modeling and visualization;
                         #          Transitioning experimental numerical weather prediction systems into operations;
                         #          Establishing a Public Weather Service in accordance with WMO guidelines for the communication of weather forecasts and warnings to
                         the public. This could include climate and hydrological services. It could also form the kernel of a Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS),
                         which could support weather and climate related disaster reduction strategies across many sectors;
                         #          Developing and implementing information systems for various stakeholders, especially water management, transport, energy, and
                         tourism.

                         Component D: Creation of an Agriculture Management Information System (preliminary estimate US$ 5 million)
                         The objective of this component is to meet the information needs of the agriculture sector to better manage and mitigate climate-related production
                         risks.

                         Providing a value-added agriculture management information system would require strong intra-governmental cooperation. Specific components of
                         the system might include:
                         #          One-stop-shopping for agricultural data (e.g., crop, livestock, etc.)
                         #          Agriculture, weather and climate outlook advisory systems (e.g., crop planting advisory, pesticide application advisory, fertilizer
                         application advisory, and soil moisture management etc.);
                         #          Provision of data required for developing an agriculture insurance scheme(s);
                         #          Capacity building, involving youth and university students, in raising climate resilient agriculture science and practices and applications
                         of agriculture management information system;
                         #          Research and development, in particular the development of drought and flood resistant crops.
                         #          Information technology infrastructure for Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, in order to stream data from DHM, archive data and
                         house agriculture management information system.
                         #          Capacity building, project management, and monitoring and evaluation (Component D managed by MoAC)
                         #          Dissemination of lessons learnt and best practices in coordination with the Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in
                         Development Project of the Nepal PPCR.

                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         The project will support the establishment of new or upgrading of existing meteorological, hydrological, climate, agro-meteorological and other
                         monitoring sites and associated networks. In addition, it will also support refurbishing or upgrading of DHM and MoAC facilities mostly in already
                         existing sites. At present, it is envisaged that the installation of new monitoring equipment may include minor construction works involving
                         refurbishment or construction of DHM offices, rehabilitation of computer rooms and other offices in already existing DHM sites. The areas involved
                         and the possible nature of the civil works are also expected to be rather minimal. As a result, the safeguard impacts are also expected to be small
                         and limited. Since this is a national project, the specific project locations are not known at this stage. Therefore, the Project is expected to be
                         Category B.

                         Safeguards policies that are likely to be triggered include: OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment, OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary Resettlement, OP/BP
                         7.50 International Waters, and OP/BP 4.10 Indigenous People. OP/BP 4.12 is triggered as a precautionary measure in connection with possible
                         need for additional land and resettlement during the establishment or upgrading of monitoring sites, radars, and other observation instrumentation,
                         as well as additional offices. . OP/BP 4.10 is triggered to ensure that any adverse effects of the project are avoided or minimized, and that IPs
                         receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits. Similarly, OP/BP 7.50 is triggered since the proposed work is going to take place on an
                         international waterway, but the physical work is expected to be minor and have little impact. The precise locations of the specific meteorological
                         and hydrological stations and associated networks are not known at this stage: it is possible that some may be located in forests or protected
                         areas. This will be further explored during preparation if OP/BP 4.04 Natural Habitat and OP/BP 4.36 Forests are triggered.
                           As part of project preparation, the DHM will assess key social and environmental risks, potential impacts, and accordingly develop an
                           Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to mitigate these risks and impacts. More specifically, the ESMF will seek to provide
                           guidance and procedures to identify, screen, and evaluate key social and environmental risks. Based on the nature of risks identified, an
                           Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and a monitoring plan will accordingly be developed for each site/facility.

Public Disclosure Copy




                           The main implementing agency for the project is the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) which is under the Ministry of Environment
                           (MOE). DHM does not have an environmental safeguard unit or staff, but MoE is Nepal#s main regulatory agency with regard to environmental
                           assessment and the leading authority in Nepal on environmental issues. MOE has adequate experience in the development, review and clearance
                           of Environmental Assessments (EA) as per Nepal#s environmental requirements, but less experience in terms of monitoring and enforcement of
                           Environmental Management Plans (EMPs). Standard government practice is to include concerns regarding land acquisition and resettlement
                           under EIAs. As a result, the MOE is also experienced with resettlement issues. However, they may not have much implementing experiences at
                           the operational level in addressing social safeguard impacts. Furthermore, MOE and DHM do not have prior experience working with World Bank
                           safeguard requirements. Measures will therefore be designed and included in the ESMF to strengthen MOE#s and DHM#s existing capacity to
                           plan and implement safeguard measures. These may include recruiting safeguard consultant experts from the market.
