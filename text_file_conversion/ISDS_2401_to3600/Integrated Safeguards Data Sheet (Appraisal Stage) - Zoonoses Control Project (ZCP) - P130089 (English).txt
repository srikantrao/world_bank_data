                              12.        The objective of the proposed project is to enhance the country capacity for the prevention and control of infectious diseases that
                              transmit between animals and humans (zoonoses) under a One Health approach. This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of
                              infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food
                              insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention. If
                              successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human

                              infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will specifically link up with the
                              GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to support the realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of Nepal .
                              The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is
                              prepared by the PPCR.

                              3. Project Description

                              Building on the avian influenza prevention and control mechanisms developed by the IDA-financed AICP, the proposed project would expand the
                              scope to key zoonotic diseases under a “One Health? approach. The project would enhance the country overall coordination, preparedness, and
                              prevention, while specifically strengthen capacities of the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) under the Ministry of Agriculture and
                              Cooperative (MOAC) and the Department of Health Services (DOHS) under the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP). Moreover, in
                              innovatively addressing animal and human interface with the eco-system, the project would also support the National Agriculture Research Council
                              (NARC) under MOAC in developing early warning mechanisms to mitigate livestock disease risks induced by climate change. Finally, the project
                              would promote awareness and educational campaigns. The project has four components: (a) animal health, (b) climate sensitive disease risk
                              mitigation, (c) human health, and (d) communication.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Project activities will be implemented throughout the country and influence the entire geographic region of Nepal. The project will identify priority
                              zoonotic diseases and high-risk districts, where key prevention and control activities, such as surveillance, diagnostics, quarantine, bio-security,
                              and communication, would be implemented. Activities to strengthen DLS and DOHS capacities in disease mitigation will also focus on these key
                              districts.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   No large scale, significant or irreversible negative impacts are likely from this project. In fact the primary goal of this project is to prevent and
                                 manage any large-scale or significant impacts on human and animal health from outbreaks of Avian Influenza and other infectious diseases
                                 including studies, development of legislation, benchmarking and development of early action plans/mechanisms to mitigate climate-induced

                                 risks. The activities are mostly to enhance government capacity to manage outbreaks including increased surveillance, monitoring, reporting
                                 and response.
                                 Environmental safeguards have been mainstreamed in the Bird Flu Investigation, Prevention and Control Guidelines/Standard Operating
                                 Procedures used by the Government (and formerly used for AICP) so that should any plans, studies or other project activities suggest or
                                 propose activities with environmental implications, there will be consideration for environmental implications in the study or plan itself. The
                                 updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared to manage the minor impacts from the model live bird/meat markets and small-
                                 scale refurbishing of buildings. Any civil works will be minor, enhancing already-existing structures. No land will be acquired and no
                                 resettlement is needed for these works.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The project will, among other activities, strengthen DLS and DOHS capacity to prevent and control priority zoonotic diseases in Nepal,
                                 including avian influenza through activities such as studies, the development of legislation, benchmarking and development of early action
                                 plans/mechanisms to mitigate climate-induced risks. Once the plans are implemented (with non project financing) such as in the case of an
                                 outbreak, potential indirect impacts could result from culling, generation of medical waste and improper handling of chemicals for disinfection. It
                                 is important to note that the project is not funding the response to outbreaks itself but rather strengthening agencies' capacities to do so. The
                                 updated Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was designed to manage these indirect impacts as well as very minor impacts from the model
                                 live bird/meat markets and minor refurbishing of buildings. Key sections of the EMP such as the proper disposal of carcasses and medical
                                 waste management arrangements are already in place. Additionally the project will follow the DLS-developed protocols on safe handling of
                                 chemicals and burial pit development and management that were also successfully used in AICP located in the Standard Operating
                                 Procedures. Project indirect impacts from waste samples or specimen would be minor and are all managed by appropriate laboratory waste
                                 management practices and use of personal protective equipment. DLS, backed up by the Project coordination unit, will supervise and ensure
                                 that safety procedures are followed during the collection of samples and specimens. In the case of transporting infected samples, closed
                                 containers that do not leak or release air will be used by trained and certified personnel using personal protective equipment (PPE). The
                                 Regional Directorate checks, monitors, and verifies the availability of containers and PPE. The District Health Office monitors the health status
                                 and records of the personnel involved every six months.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  The alternative to have no project was considered but this would leave the government less prepared to manage the potentially enormous
                                 impacts from the outbreak of a highly infectious disease like Avian Influenza. In contrast, the project as proposed poses very insignificant direct
                                 environmental impacts including impacts from minor refurbishing, upgrading and the establishment of model markets and slaughter houses.
                                 Even indirect impacts have been already controlled appropriately under the former AICP project. Since the same institutional, management and
                                 other arrangements will remain the same, adverse impacts will be adequately minimized.

                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                                The borrower has developed capacity to plan and implement safeguard policy issues for Avian Influenza and other infectious diseases on the
                              recent Avian Influenza Control Project (AICP) which closed in July 2011. The borrower has updated the EMP developed for AICP to
                              accommodate the more limited needs of this project. Since most project interventions are not physical, the borrower does not have much to do
                              except recognize if there may be physical implications of some of the project financed activities (i.e., studies, legislation, early warning
                              mechanisms) which could have indirect environmental implications and take appropriate actions or make the appropriate analysis/formulate

                              measures for prevention of harm or mitigation. The AICP Standard Operating Procedures (which mainstreamed environmental considerations
                              throughout the project) and the updated EMP will serve as important references for how to manage or for what to consider in case of physical
                              implications from project-financed studies, strategies, warning systems, etc. Key sections of the EMP such as for the disposal of carcasses are
                              already in place. DLS will include complaint handling mechanisms as appropriate. Farmers, traders and animal health workers will receive
                              training on bio-security and food safety.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                                The key stakeholders include DLS, DOHS, NARC, FAO, OIE, WHO, NGOs (such as National Zoonoses and Food Hygiene Research Center),
                              District DLS Offices, District DOHS Offices, farmers and traders in the high-risk districts of identified priority zoonotic diseases. A consultation
                              on the EMP as well as other aspects of the project was held February 29, 2012 with 130 stakeholders. Input on the EMP has been requested
                              from a local NGO. Additionally consultation on outcomes of the previous project was conducted in June 2011. The draft EMP was disclosed in-
                              country on February 27, 2012 on the Department of Livestock Services and the MOAC websites (www.dls.gov.np and www.moac.gov.np) in
                              English and on March 20, 2012 in Nepali. It was disclosed March 30, 2012 before Appraisal in InfoShop.
