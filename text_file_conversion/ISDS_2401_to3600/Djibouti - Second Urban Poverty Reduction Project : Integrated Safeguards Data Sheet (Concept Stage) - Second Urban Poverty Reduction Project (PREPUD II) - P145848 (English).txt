                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase the sustainable access to basic
                           urban services in Quartier 7 (Q7).
                           C. Project Description
                         The proposed project builds on 30 years of Bank engagement in the urban sector in Djibouti, and is a
                         follow-up to the DUPREP 1 (Urban Poverty Reduction Project); which focused on Q7 and initiated
                         the transformation process of the neighborhood. DUPREP 1, including its additional financing,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         focused on (i) improving access to infrastructure and basic community services (roads, drainage,
                         street lighting, health center, and a community development center among others), (ii) mobilizing the
                         community through targeted professional trainings and close collaboration with community
                         organizations (trainings and capacity assessments); and (iii) institutional support to the solid waste
                         management authority and putting in place a master plan for Djibouti-ville.

                         Lessons learned from DUPREP have been fully taken into account in the design of the proposed
                         DUPREP II and consist of: (i) simplifying project design to increase impact via orienting activities
                         around the project’s objective and prioritizing needs, and building on previous achievements and
                         successes; (ii) promoting labor intensive works to increase ownership and sustainability of
                         investments, taking into account high unemployment rates and the employability potential of project
                         activities; (iii) building strong institutions to sustain investments and promote citizen engagement
                         and ownership throughout project cycle; and (iv) increasing project readiness for implementation at
                         the start of the project to reduce potential future delays.

                         In addition to those lessons learned, DUPREP II will build on DUPREP’s efforts via (i) putting in
                         place mechanisms for implementing the Djibouti Master Plan, (ii) enabling associations provided
                         with capacity building trainings to design and implement community activities, and (iii) expand the
                         labor intensive road paving pilot. The project will adopt an integrated approach (see Figure 1) that
                         further complements project components: infrastructure, institutional, and social with an enhanced
                         focus on mainstreaming disaster risk management, gender dimension, institutions and citizen
                         engagement. Those three components together will contribute to attain the same objective of
                         sustainable access to urban services.

                         Those efforts will be sustained and scaled-up under the proposed operation coupled with a pilot

                         intervention in Djaga Boulgou (section of Q7), while further focusing on improving participation
                         around project design and implementation, as well as strengthening institutions to sustain urban
                         development efforts. An in-depth urban study will be conducted by the Ministry of Housing, Urban
                         Planning and Environment, during preparation to design an intervention based on technical and
                         socio-economic understanding of the neighborhood and a long-term vision for the area.

                         In order to sustain project interventions, DUPREP II will aim to enhance current urban management
                         practices via: (i) improving horizontal coordination between different line ministries intervening in
                         the urban space, and (ii) strengthening the vertical communication channel that promotes citizen
                         engagement and a rapid response to local needs. The proposed project will adopt good practice
                         citizen engagement approaches to promote voice, transparency and social accountability throughout
                         the project cycle and beyond. These approaches will build upon existing informal and formal
                         participatory processes, such as local associations and neighborhood committees to consult and
                         solicit feedback from citizens directly in Quartier 7 and indirectly affected by the project. As such, a
                         grievance redress mechanism will be put in place to ensure that citizens can express their opinions
                         and provide their suggestions freely.

                         Furthermore, DUPREP II will take into account the utilization of gender-differentiated tools (such as
                         group and community interviews and consultations) in the context of project preparation to help
                         inform the design of project interventions. In infrastructure and service delivery, the project will
                         ensure design specifically takes into account women and youth needs, leveraging the earlier
                         successes of social mobilization and strengthening their inclusion in future implementation and
                         operation opportunities. For example, gender informed design will be carried out through the

                         formation of decision-making bodies at the community level, such as Neighborhood Committees,
                         where the inclusion of women will be key to its success. In addition, technical trainings will be
                         provided to both men and women, with added investment in marketable trainings for women,
                         especially those allowing them to profit from job opportunities expected to be created in the project.

                         Based on its overall objective, the proposed US$ 5.6 million project will have three components: (i)
                         building resilient urban infrastructure in Q7; (ii) strengthening institutions for sustainable urban
                         management; and (iii) socio-economic development for poverty reduction.

                         Component 1. Building resilient urban infrastructure in Q7: (IDA US$ 4 million equivalent): This
                         proposed component will improve access to basic infrastructure of Q7 residents and reduce their
                         exposure to flood risks:

                         �        Subcomponent 1.1: this sub-component will include the construction and restoration of
                         physical infrastructure assets to improve supply of essential services and reduce exposure to flood
                         risks, including building/rehabilitating road networks, drainage systems, street lighting, among others
                         (in the entire neighborhood including Djaga Boulgou). The design of roads will focus on labor-
                         intensive methods, some of which tested in the DUPREP. Those techniques piloted in DUPREP are
                         15 times more labor intensive than the same asphalted road. Overall, women will be consulted
                         through interviews and consultations in order to better inform the design of interventions.
                         Due to its physical complexity (non-aligned roads, major encroachments on public space, below
                         road-level houses, among others) a detailed topographical study and an urban study are required prior
                         to any intervention in Djaga Boulgou. Those studies, which will be carried out during project
                         preparation, will allow the elaboration of a medium and long-term development strategy for the
                         Djaga Boulgou area, and an urban transformation action plan. The choice of investments to be
                         selected will take into account: (i) improving environmental conditions, especially with regards to

                         draining water outside of the neighborhood; and (ii) managing social safeguards related risks. This
                         sub-component will also explore potential collaboration with the French Development Agency on the
                         new project promoting solid waste micro-collection will be explored for application in Q7 and
                         specifically in Djaga Boulgou.

                         �        Subcomponent 1.2: this sub-component will finance community equipment including the
                         conversion and landscaping of the central “public? space of Q7 (place Gadelmalleh) in order to
                         restore/improve its social cohesion and economic roles for the neighborhood. The new urban plan of
                         this space, which will be designed in consultation with the population, could include sport, cultural
                         and commercial activities. Other small unoccupied/abandoned zones inside Q7 could also be
                         converted into attractive public spaces. The project will encourage the utilization of public open
                         spaces as natural retention ponds, as well as permeable paving, via piloting innovative and cost
                         effective approaches to improve natural drainage and reduce urban rainwater runoff, which is usually
                         a major cause of recurrent flooding.

                         It is expected that all the investments at the sub-project level are expected to be Category B, and no
                         category A investments at the sub-project level are expected.

                         Component 2: Strengthening Institutions for Sustainable Urban Management (IDA US$ 1 million
                         equivalent): this component aims to support, at multiple levels of government, the elaboration and
                         initial steps of implementation of a coordinated urban development strategy. The goals are to
                         improve the effectiveness of institutions for sustainable urban management of Djibouti City, focusing
                         on inclusive governance, integrated infrastructure development, municipal finance management, and

                         strengthened institutional capacity. This component will cover the following:

                         �        Technical and equipment assistance to the Direction of Housing and Urban Development
                         (DHU) to put in place the Djibouti Master Plan. This will be coupled with the sharing of
                         international experiences of implementing Master Plans in similar City-State contexts.

                         �       Technical support to the municipality of Djibouti-Ville and its communes, starting with the
                         commune of Boulaos for aspects piloted in Quartier 7, in two key areas: (i) to establish the long-term
                         organizational structure, including an action plan for the transfer of resources and competencies over
                         time and designing an operational manual; and (ii) to design a short to medium term revenue
                         enhancement strategy, taking into account sources of local revenues, and inter-government finance.

                         �         Support for the creation and empowerment of a Neighborhood Committee (CDQ) in Quartier
                         7. The CDQ will be instrumental to the success of the new urban project across all components, as it
                         will stand for the designated interface for community engagement and participation in Q7. To ensure
                         that all groups have voice in the community development process, particular attention will be paid to
                         establishing a gender-sensitive governance system where women, youth and marginalized groups are
                         included / represented. The project will provide support in (i) setting up the structure,
                         responsibilities, and operating procedures of the CDQ; (ii) working with the CDQ to facilitate the
                         community engagement for the elaboration of the Local Urban Development Plan for Quartier 7; (iii)
                         empower the CDQ by granting a role in the selection and prioritization of community development
                         activities (funded under Component 3).

                         The technical assistance for the operational planning and capacity building to the selected institutions
                         will pave the way towards improved urban governance at the local, municipal and national levels.
                         The outcome will be to put in place long-term coordinated strategies for urban development,

                         effective management and appropriate financing for continued investment and sustainable
                         neighborhood improvement. The DUPREP II will also provide the opportunity to test and build
                         experience and confidence in the initial stages of implementation of the agreed strategies for each
                         institution.

                         �        Project Management support through providing effective and efficient management support
                         for the implementation (including auditing and monitoring and evaluation) of the project. This will
                         include training opportunities for ADDS staff to improve their capacity to design and implement
                         project activities, including the capacity to comply by Bank’s safeguards and fiduciary aspects.

                         Component 3: Socio-economic Development for Poverty Reduction. (IDA US$ 0.6 million
                         equivalent): Activities to be conducted in this component build on earlier lessons of community
                         mobilization and job creation around project objectives. Proposed activities will be directly linked to
                         component 1 to improve project outcomes via linking professional trainings to potential job
                         opportunities created by the project and mobilizing community associations to better attain project
                         objectives. Additionally, efforts to strengthen governance structures and institutional capacity (under
                         component 2) will also positively contribute to the success of this component. Two major activities
                         are proposed:

                         �       Technical trainings and on-site job insertion: the primary beneficiaries will be school drop-
                         outs youth, young graduates, and women. The selected trainings will be linked to job opportunities
                         in the project, with potential market outside and beyond project duration. This will allow utilizing
                         the project as first-hand on-site training, while offering direct economic benefits to the population.

                         The job market development in the proposed areas of training will be thoroughly assessed to ensure
                         insertion and job opportunities in the long-term. Gender will be taken into account as to provide
                         trainings and job opportunities to women seeking in particular to innovate away from traditional
                         trainings such as cooking and sewing among others. Based on preliminary diagnostic on potential
                         needs in the project and in the city, employment opportunities would focus on (i) labor intensive road
                         construction technologies; (ii) solar panel insertion and maintenance; (iii) landscaping and
                         maintenance of green spaces. This component will be designed and implemented in collaboration
                         with existing vocational training institutions, the national labor insertion agency, and existing micro-
                         credit facilities available on the city/national scales. In addition to the positive outcomes in terms of
                         job creation, and based on previous experiences, the project is expected to allow major buy-in and
                         conflict mitigation as youth and local residents will be given the opportunity to work on nearby
                         infrastructure.

                         �       Community Led Activities: allocated resources to-be-managed by ADDS will be available to
                         finance community-led projects proposed by local associations who previously benefited from
                         capacity building trainings under DUPREP. A community committee with representation of men,
                         women and youth, will be put in place to review and validate proposals. This activity will mainly
                         benefit women who occupy most leading community association roles. An evaluation of community
                         development activities from the several projects (including the DUPRED) as well as other donor’s
                         projects has been initiated and will further guide the design of this component.

                         Key Risks and Issues

                         Major risks identified during identification are primarily related to (i) having the needed know-how
                         and the proper institutional arrangement to coordinate the multi-sectoral and some novel aspects of
                         the project; and (ii) the sustainability of investments due to weak operation and maintenance

                         practices. The capacity of the implementing agency to design and implement the project following
                         Bank rules and regulations – especially on social aspects – will be further assessed in the next phases
                         of the project preparation.

                         On the first aspect, due to the multi-sectoral nature of the project, including interlinked interventions
                         on the physical, community, and institutional fronts, strong coordination, communication, and buy-in
                         will be needed between relevant ministries (Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning, Secretariat of
                         State of National Solidarity, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Education, and others), departments and
                         agencies to ensure proper harmonization, rapid decision making (with a clear distribution of roles
                         and responsibilities and a decision-making matrix) and a conflict resolution mechanism. This will
                         especially be needed in the case of potential resettlement.

                         On the second, the project will strengthen institutions involved in urban management to increase
                         institutional ownership and capacity to sustain and scale-up investments. Further, the project will
                         further invest at engaging citizens around the project so as to strengthen project ownership and
                         sustainability at the local level.

                         On the potential third, precaution measures are being taken to support ADDS’s capacity to design
                         and manage the project in compliance with Bank policies and procedures, via (i) targeted
                         procurement, financial management, and safeguards trainings, (ii) ensure their proper staffing, and
                           (iii) providing needed hardware and software tools. Furthermore, systematic community engagement
                           mechanism will be considered to ensure the proper flow of information and concerns (complaints)
                           between project beneficiaries and relevant institutions.

                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be located in the Quartier 7 of Djibouti city, which is in the alluvial plain of the city
                           on the right bank of the Ambouli river. The area is characterized by lack of sanitation; lack of
                           effective solid waste management; and improper drainage that leads to flooding during the rainy
                           season particularly that many houses are below the level of the road. Part of this neighborhood,
                           namely the Djaga Boulgou pocket is a slum type area, highly populated and physically dense. Its
                           layout is particularly challenging with no proper urban planning, very narrow streets and plots
                           potentially on the right of way.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Bank’s assessment of the client’s ability to manage safeguards is the client has had limited
                           experience on social and environmental safeguards to date. The World Bank team has recommended
                           the hiring of a fully dedicated expert on social and environmental safeguards which in addition to
                           capacity building and close supervision would enable the counterparts to be able to manage the
                           Bank’s safeguards requirements adequately. As is the recent practice across the portfolio, the Bank’s
                           safeguards team will be carrying out training on both the environmental and social policies and will
                           support the client in navigating issues of risk. Under this project, the client will be responsible for
                           managing safeguards related compliance under OP 4.01 and OP 4.12.
