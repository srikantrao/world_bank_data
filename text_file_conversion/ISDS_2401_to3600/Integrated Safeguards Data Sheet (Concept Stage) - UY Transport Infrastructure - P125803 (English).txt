                              B. Project Objectives

                              16.         The project development objective (PDO) is to improve transport efficiency through rehabilitation and maintenance of the national road
                              infrastructure and enhanced public sector capacity to plan, regulate and monitor transport and logistics services. Road maintenance and
                              rehabilitation works are expected to improve road quality and to decrease road users' transport costs. The project would also include institutional
                              strengthening activities, aimed at supporting the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (Ministerio de Transporte y obras Publicas, MTOP) in its
                              planning and regulatory duties.

                              C. Project Description

                              2.        Program definition. The proposed US$ 66 million Bank financing would support part of the Government of Uruguay Road program, as
                              above-described; new highway construction and development would not be included in the Bank-financed Program. Most contracts included in the
                              GoU Road program actually deal with road rehabilitation and maintenance; given the density and age of the Uruguay primary road network, the
                              road problematic is more oriented towards maintenance rather than network expansion.

                              3.         The Bank-financed Program would focus Uruguay primary paved road network rehabilitation and maintenance, including inter alia: (i)
                              routine road maintenance; (ii) pavement and drainage rehabilitation / reconstruction, (iii) local road alignment improvement, including for
                              intersections, in particular to improve road safety; (iv) bridge widening and reinforcement, in order to upgrade some international road corridors to
                              MERCOSUR standards. Beyond works and related studies, the Program would also include institutional strengthening activities aiming at
                              improving MTOP capacity to plan, regulate and monitor transport and logistics services, as well as the Program's safeguards and fiduciary
                              systems.

                              4.         Within MTOP, the main beneficiary would be the Road department, as the program key implementing entity. Some other entities, inter
                              alia the Topographic surveying department and the Planning and logistics department, would also benefit from the financing.

                              5.         Program technical soundness. Based on preliminary assessments, Program objective and content are deemed broadly adequate to
                              address Uruguay's road infrastructure challenges. Improving the primary highway network, including international transport corridors and
                              transversal connections will foster efficient transport and logistics services; such Program will contribute to the 2030 Strategic Plan that envisions
                              placing Uruguay as regional logistics hub. Road rehabilitation projects usually have high economic impact, all the more so as they focus on most
                              circulated networks; activities included in the Program should be no exception.

                              6.          Program performance. Based on previous experience with MTOP on Bank-financed projects and preliminary assessment, DNV's
                              capacity and performance to implement the road program are satisfactory; while some weaknesses were identified, DNV can rely on an
                              experienced technical body and manages works contracts in a straightforward fashion. While the past 2005-2009 program financial performance
                              could not yet be fully assessed, it was assessed that (i) there is a sustained increase of credits (and ceilings) over past years; (ii) there still is a
                              significant gap between the spending ceilings and credits, which represent maintenance needs. Credit execution appears to be good, with almost
                              100% of allowed ceiling committed.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)
                           The localization of the works that is not yet determined. The Program includes road works that could be located in any part of the territory of
                           Uruguay.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Based on preliminary assessment, the Borrower#s institutional capacity for safeguards is broadly demeed adequate, though some weaknesses
                           were identified.

                           The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MTOP) Road Department (Direccion Nacional de Vialidad # DNV).
                           While DNV will be primarily responsible for the management of the works, other departments, such as the Topographic Surveying and the
                           Planning departments, will also participate in the implementation of the Program#s activities environmental and social procedures.

                           DNV has an Environmental Unit (UAV), including four engineers, who worked a quarter to half time in this unit, with experience in preparing
                           environmental documents for the roads subprojects and in handling environmental permits and monitoring. DNV implements an Environmental
                           Manual prepared in 1998 and updated in 2002. UAV also has developed Environmental Management Plan templates, environmental checklists
                           and created an environmental fee system to encourage environmental compliance during the construction period.

                           The Department of Topographic Surveying (Direcci de Topograf) is primarily responsible for right-of-way acquisition. The Department currently has
                           seven full-time senior engineers with experience in the assessment and valuation of losses caused by right of way acquisition. The Department
                           also has a Social Specialist who is in charge of the preparation of resettlement plans in cases where right-of-way acquisition causes relocation.
                           The Social Specialist is familiar with World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and has led the preparation and implementation of
                           resettlement plans.
