Public Disclosure Copy




                              The project will have two components: (i) energy efficiency investments in public facilities; and (ii) technical assistance.
                              (i) Energy efficiency investments in public facilities. This component will support energy efficiency investments in social institutions and other public
                              facilities, e.g. schools, kindergartens, hospitals, administrative buildings, and street lighting. The energy efficiency investments will reduce the
                              energy consumption and directly and indirectly (through savings in fossil fuel consumption) reduce the CO2 emissions by retrofitting activities.
                              Additionally, these investments will generate substantial social benefits, including increased quality of education and, improved health by better
                              indoor heating and lighting. The selection of public facilities to be financed under the project will be based on eligibility criteria, the energy saving
                              potential and financial viability criteria. The Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency (R2E2) Fund will assess the sub-projects, finance them
                              and develop suitable repayment mechanisms.
                              The physical interventions planned to be financed will include the insulation of walls, basements and attics, repair/replacement of external doors
                              and windows, window optimization, reflective surfacing of walls behind radiators, as well as improvements/ replacement of boilers and heating
                              systems, replacement of mercury vapor lamps with high-pressure sodium vapor lamps (or light emitting diodes and of incandescent bulbs with
                              compact fluorescent lamps.
                              (ii) Technical assistance. This component will help remove the existing barriers to realizing the energy efficiency potential and create an enabling
                              environment for energy efficiency in the public sector. The key areas that this component will finance include: (a) capacity building of the R2E2
                              Fund, including training and basic audit and monitoring equipment; (b) pipeline development and capacity building to participating public agencies,
                              to address knowledge gaps on energy efficiency, build the demand for program financing, and improve the prospects for the sustainability of
                              energy savings generated under the project; (c) policy development support, including efforts to support budgeting, procurement and financing of
                              energy efficiency projects in the public sector, as well as select policy measures and energy statistics; (d) market development and capacity
                              building of various market actors, including ESCOs, banks, construction firms; and (e) project management, including monitoring, reporting and
                              financial audits.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The physical project activities will take place in urban, peri-urban or rural communities on Armenian territory. All activities will concern existing
                              buildings and structures. No new construction or enlaement of the footprint of buildings or structures is envisaged. While the replacement of street
                              lamps may include their pylons this would entirely take place within existing road infrastructure and would not lead to land conversion.

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The environmental impacts from the project are expected to be largely positive, by reducing energy consumption and – as a substantial part of

                                 the energy mix is produced from fossil fuels - thereby carbon emissions. Minor and temporary negative impacts relate mainly to small scale
                                 construction works. Modest issues may arise from noise, dust generation, vehicle emissions, construction waste management and traffic /
                                 pedestrian safety. All impacts under this component are expected to be easily and readily manageable with the “Checklist Environmental
                                 Management Plan (EMP)? template, contained in the Operational Manual. This safeguards instrument will be triggered by all small-scale
                                 construction, renovation, retrofitting and installation works relating to the activities planned under this component. The checklist EMP is self-
                                 explanatory, but does contain an introductory section explaining its scope, use and application.
                                 The replacement of mercury vapor lamps by more efficient devices not containing toxic substances will pose a specific challenge regarding
                                 their safe disposal. Several disposal pathways, among them packing and shipping to recycling plants in Armenia or abroad, will be investigated.
                                 If expected quantities are amll (e.g. several 100-1000 pcs) the project will purchase mobile disposal systems, of which several are commercially
                                 available on the market. Instructions for their safe disposal will be issues within the construction contracts and both PIU and team will monitor
                                 compliance during implementation.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The long term project impacts are expected to be positive, due to energy savings and related reductions of carbon emissions (due to reduced
                                 fossil fuel use). No indirect or long term negative impacts are anticipated.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  not applicable
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The Recipient will assign project management to an experienced implementing entity, the R2E2 Fund, which has had ample exposure to the
                                 implementation of the World Bank’s safeguards policies. The team has worked with the R2E2 Fund in several similar projects and is satisfied
                                 that the R2E2 Fund both understands the practical implications of the Bank’s safeguards policies, and is willing and capable regarding their
                                 implementation.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                  The key stakeholders will be the public administrative units, authorities and entities whose built assets will be improved and upgraded by the
                                 project. They were consulted during project preparation and have confirmed their interest in participation. There are no foreseeable negative
                                 impacts on any of the stakeholders.

                                 The consultation process was carried out during the preparation of a parent project (P116748) to which the current project was originally

                              consultations on it and disclosed it in the country (The World Bank disclosed it in the Infoshop). At the request of the Government, the original
                              Energy Efficiency component is now being processed as a stand-alone project. All of the above stakeholders were consulted from early in the
                              preparation phase of the original parent project, and specific concerns and perspectives heard, recorded and factored into the preparation of
                              the safeguards documents. Advanced draft versions of ESIA and EMP (including checklist EMP template) were prepared and public hearings
