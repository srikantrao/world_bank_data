B. Project Objectives [from Grant Proposal]:
The project objective is to develop an online platform and to create a sustainable map driven
information database of civil society disaster risk reduction (DRR) actors to strengthen the
ability of the DRR community to engage in collaboration, networking, partnerships, shared
actions and knowledge exchange within the sector and more widely with all actors concerned
with building resilience to natural hazards.
The project will create an established online platform and sustainable tool that maps global civil
society engagement in DRR. This online tool will be developed, housed, and maintained by the
Global Network of Civil Society Organizations for Disaster Reduction (GNDR). The target
audience for the online platform is government officials, policy makers, donors, development
organizations, civil society practitioners, and other stakeholders engaged in DRR.
The key indicator of success will be the creation of an established online platform and
sustainable tool that maps global CSO engagement in DRR.

C. Project Description [from Grant Proposal]:
A RETF Grant will be provided to the Global Network of Civil Society Organizations for
Disaster Reduction (GNDR) to create an established online platform and sustainable tool that
maps global civil society engagement in DRR. The platform will be hosted by the network
within their current web portal and will integrate with existing infrastructure and database of the
organization.
The gee-mapping functionality of the site will be delivered using a gee-mapping software
service called Cartodb. The organization will be responsible for gathering and uploading the
data. The initial scope of the exercise will be limited to an agreed region(s) and focus countries.
A 'passive' information gathering phase will be based on requested via existing networks (for
example GNDR, Preventionweb, ADRRN, CPP, La Red etc) for DRR actors to submit
information. If properly presented many of these actors will value visibility and identity and will
therefore have an incentive to submit information online. An 'active' information gathering phase
will consult with regional and global contacts to 'fill the gaps' which are likely to include INGOs,
quasi-institutional actors etc. The organization will be responsible for the maintenance of the
platform and database with the aim that once the platform is established CSOs will value this
tool and update their organizations information online.
After project inception the level of resource required for data gathering and validation will be
monitored during the first month of data gathering and if it is considered realistic this scope will
be extended based on initial experience.
