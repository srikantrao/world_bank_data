                              million. The operation will comprise the following three components: i) a labor intensive public works program and life skills training in urban areas
                              targeted at youth to construct, rehabilitate and maintain critical urban infrastructure and create short-term employment; ii) a pilot cash transfer to
                              improve human capital in poor and food insecure rural areas; iii) institutional and capacity building and project management aimed at supporting
                              the operational units of the program in the development of key elements of a social protection strategy.

                              Component 1: Labor intensive public work program in urban areas with a focus on youth and life skills trainings- (US$ 16.5 million- Total costs
                              including contingency)
                              This component will have two sub-components: (i) temporary employment opportunities to increase household’s income while rehabilitating and
                              creating community infrastructure; and (ii) life skills development to reinforce basic life skills and workforce readiness behavior to complement the
                              experience acquired through participating in the LIPW.

                              Sub-component 1.1:              Temporary employment opportunities: This subcomponent aims to temporarily increase the revenues of
                              underemployed and unemployed in the country’s regional capitals. It will provide temporary employment opportunities through labor intensive
                              public works to about 24,000 unskilled/low skilled people above the age of 18 in the eight regional capitals. The small and micro-projects will be
                              drawn from local municipal development plans, and selected in consultation with local populations in the country’s regional capitals. They are
                              expected to include activities such as road rehabilitation and maintenance, paving streets, paintings, upgrading/rehabilitation/maintenance/
                              construction of public and economic infrastructures, gardening, sanitation, etc. In order to promote women participation, a quota of 30% of female
                              participants will be observed. Further, the list of eligible micro projects will be reviewed and updated to ensure that gender friendly activities are
                              included. An estimated 2.4 million person-days of labor (or 100 days of work per beneficiary) will be created through the project.

                              Sub-component 1.2: Life skills trainings for youth: This subcomponent aims to provide an estimated 5,000 youths with trainings in non cognitive
                              skills. The youth will be selected among the LIPW beneficiaries based on demand, a minimum educational level and regular attendance at the
                              LIPW schemes. Training content will focus on topics such as civic education, citizenship and democratic values, the rights and responsibilities of
                              workers, conflict resolution and national cohesion, hygiene and security in the workplace, HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, money
                              management, team work, etc. The training curriculum will be validated by a consultative commission with representation from the private sector,
                              civil society and training professionals. A total number of 100 training sessions will be offered during the 5 years of project implementation. Each
                              year, selected LIPW beneficiaries will be organized in group of 50 people to attend 5-10 days trainings after completion of the LIPW activities.
                              Beneficiaries will receive a daily stipend during the training. The amount of the stipend will be determined during the appraisal mission.

                              Component 2: Pilot cash transfer program to protect human capital- (US$ 5.5 million- Total costs including contingency). The pilot cash transfer will
                              have three subcomponents: (i) design; (ii) pilot CT for nutrition and (iii) pilot CT for girl’s education.

                               Subcomponent 2.1.: Design of the pilot project: This subcomponent aims to guarantee, to the extent possible, the quality of the pilot cash transfer
                               intervention. UNICEF, as the only agency with the national network of local institutional infrastructures and the technical capacity required to
                               rapidly facilitate one of the first cash transfer intervention sfor nutrition and education in the country will be contracted by the government for the
                               execution of this subcomponent. In addition, this sub-component will finance the elaboration of a technical annex on targeting, beneficiary
                               selection, registration and payment methods for the pilot cash transfer, as a first step towards the establishment of cash transfer systems.

                               Subcomponent 2.2: Cash transfer for nutrition : This subcomponent aims to reduce the malnutrition rate of targeted children. It will benefit at least

                               5,000 children aged 0-24 months that are affected by chronic malnutrition in the two regions with some of the highest chronic malnutrition rates in
                               the country (Kankan and Labe). The transfers will be given to the mothers of the malnourished children, and will be made on a bi-monthly basis.
                               Nutritional training has been included in the package to maximize the impact of the cash transfer on nutrition. Beneficiary and non beneficiary
                               households in targeted communities will be trained in 8 essential family practices (EFP) on health, nutrition, and sanitation.

                               Subcomponent 2.3: Cash transfer for girls’ education: This subcomponent aims to increase the primary school completion rate among
                               beneficiaries. The intervention will target at least 5,000 girls in 5th and 6th grade in three regions where the achievement rate of girls is among the
                               lowest, namely Boké, Kankan and Labé. These regions also have the lowest ratio of girls' enrollment rate of the poorest quintile over the same rate
                               of the richest quintile. Beneficiaries will be required to attend at least 80% of the sessions. Supporting measures will be added to maximize the
                               impact of the transfers on girls’ education. All households in the targeted villages will be sensitized to the importance of girls’ education.

                               Component 3: Project coordination and institutional capacity building (US$ 3 million from HPIC- Total costs including contingency). Component 3
                               will ensure that the unit coordinating project implementation, the Safety Nets Unit (Cellule Filets Sociaux-CFS) is operational, and that it
                               successfully and efficiently conducts supervision to ensure that the project is implemented in conformity with key project documents including the
                               Financing Agreement, the procurement plan, and the project implementation manual. In addition, this component will finance technical assistance
                               including feasibility studies, institutional capacity building and seminars and workshops in support of the work program of the newly formed
                               National Social Protection Group (NSPG).

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    The project is classified as Environmental Category B as the potential environmental and social impacts will not be adverse; as they are likely
                                  to be small-scale, site-specific and thus easily manageable. The LIPWs to be financed under this operation consist of primarily (a) road
                                  rehabilitation and maintenance of municipal roads; and potentially (b) sanitation and drainage maintenance and rehabilitation; and (c) potential
                                  other activities to be determined benefiting vulnerable communities, such as social and economic infrastructure (such as rehabilitation of
                                  existing markets) and construction and rehabilitation of public latrines. With regards to road rehabilitation and maintenance, the specific
                                  activities undertaken would consist of: clearing and pruning of bush/tree branches hanging onto roads, filling of potholes, cleaning of existing
                                  drainage pipes/canals and culverts; clearing sand of roadways and road shoulders, road cleaning; and creation and maintenance of public
                                  green spaces and gardens.

                                  Initial reviews indicate that the project can generate positive social, economic, and environmental impacts. In spite of these potential positive
                                  impacts, there is the also the recognition of potential negative impacts, which calls for appropriate mitigation measures and institutional
                                  arrangements for their implementation. The project triggers two safeguards policies: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment and OP/BP
                                  4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework
                                  (RPF) have been prepared, reviewed, approved and disclosed in-country and at the Infoshop. The ESMF and RPF were disclosed in-country
                                  on April 9, 2012. While the ESMF was disclosed at the infoshop on April 30, 2012 the RPF was disclosed May 2, 2012.

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 4
                           The general environmental management clauses for civil works rehabilitation will be inserted into the bidding documents and contracts.
                           Detailed environmental assessments or Environmental Management Plans and Resettlement Action Plans, if necessary, would be carried out
                           for all project activities that will trigger them and disclosed in-country and at the Bank#s Infoshop before specific or rehabilitation civil works
                           could start.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                             The potential environmental and social impacts are likely to be small-scale, site-specific and thus easily mitigated. There are no indirect or
                           long term adverse impacts expected during project implementation.

                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                             Not applicable
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                             Since the location, size and magnitude of the LIPW micro-projects were not known, the approach to safeguards was to develop an
                           Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to cover all activities to be financed
                           under the project. An environmental consultant will be engaged to manage and oversee the environmental and social management process,
                           while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services throughout the project period. This consultant would work closely with
                           the implementing agency and other implementing entities to apply and strengthen the ESMF and RPF procedures that will improve subproject
                           quality and sustainability through compliance with safeguards.

                           The implementing agency is expected to use Bank screening procedures to identify, assess, evaluate, mitigate and monitor the impact of the
                           LIPW micro-projects on the environment. These assessments will involve consultations with key stakeholders and will inform the design of
                           specific resettlement action plans and environment management plans if necessary. Once the plans have been drafted, public consultations will
                           be held and community systems to handle grievances will be established. All key stakeholders will be sensitized and trained on the mitigation
                           measures.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             Key stakeholders including government representatives, NGOs, civil society, community representative, the media, and potential partners in
                           micro-project implementation (the local association of entrepreneurs), will participate in the public consultations process. All the relevant bodies
                           have been adequately informed of the Project. Concerns of the communities and some details of consultations have been provided as Annexes
                           in the ESMF and RPF.

                           One of the key principles of this project from the outset was to foster participation of all relevant stakeholders. This approach will be sustained
                           throughout project implementation. The environmental and social assessment studies, namely the ESMF and RPF, were also carried out
                           according to the same principle, using broad-based public consultation approach, involving the above stakeholder groups. The objective was to
                           raise awareness of project activities and impacts and foster ownership on their part.
