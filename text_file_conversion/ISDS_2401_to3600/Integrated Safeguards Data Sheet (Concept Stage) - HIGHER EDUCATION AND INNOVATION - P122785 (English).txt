                              The Project would consist of three components:

                              Component 1. Higher education finance reforms and implementation of Quality Assurance norms. This component would finance technical
                              assistance, training for capacity building, and competitively awarded grants to higher education institutions through the following: (i) capacity
                              building for the Council of Higher Education; (ii) support for membership in the European Quality Assurance Register (EQAR) and the European
                              Network of Quality Assurance Agency (ENQA); (iii) support for implementation of reaccreditation procedures for all universities and institutes; (iv)
                              support for internal quality assurance capacity building; and (v) building of a National Qualifications Framework (NQF).

                              Component 2. Human capital development through Internationalization Initiatives. The following activities have been identified as key
                              intervention areas to improve and utilize internationalization activities for quality enhancement of Montenegrin teaching, learning, and research: (i)
                              creating a facilitating agency within the MoES, to provide administrative support mechanisms to for international students and scholars, while
                              building capacity within the Institute for International Science, Education, Cultural and Technical Cooperation; (ii) creating a small grants program
                              to promote international scholarship in areas deemed of significant national interest; (iii) conducting analytical studies on the Montenegrin Diaspora
                              and how best to capitalize on the Diaspora for international opportunities for Montenegrin scholars and students; (iv) conducting an analytical study
                              on the internationalization context of Montenegro; and (v) utilization of the internationalization study to direct funds toward those recommended
                              areas deemed key priorities in both the short- and long-term.

                              Component 3. Establishing a competitive research and innovation environment, anchored by competitive grant instruments and a pilot Center of
                              Excellence. This component would finance technical assistance, training, procurement of goods and services, and minor civil works and would
                              include: (i) completion of a feasibility study on Centers of Excellence (CoEs) in the Montenegrin; (ii) establishment of one Centre of Excellence; (iii)
                              expansion of the existing National Projectsresearch grants; and (iv) assessment of the labor markets for the research and innovation community.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The Project would be implemented nationally.


                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              The proposed Project is not expected to trigger any safeguard policy. At the same time, since the Project would finance minor civil works and
                              technological equipment for the Centers of Excellence in research, as preparation advances, the team will consult closely with the Bank's
                              safeguard team to confirm that such works and equipment is not expected to have any adverse impact on the environment and, if needed, to
                              prepare an environmental management plan (EMP).
