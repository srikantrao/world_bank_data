                              of a sector-wide BAT/BEP adoption.

                              3. Project Description

                              Component 1: BAT/BEP Investment in Participating Mills (Total Cost: US$73.64M; GEF Grant: US$11.18M)

                              This component will support adoption of BAT/BEP in the four selected non-wood pulp mills by replacing the current elemental chlorine-based
                              bleaching process by the elemental chlorine-free (ECF) process in order to minimize releases of dioxins and furans. In doing so, construction,
                              renovation and rehabilitations of production processes and facilities (and associated engineering and design works and civil works and acquisition
                              and installation of equipment) will be carried out in the participating mills to improve their overall environmental performance, including reducing
                              pollution load in effluents and increasing water conservation. Technical assistance to the participating mills will be provided to support review of
                              technical proposals and design of BAT/BEP and during trial operations after the completion of the technological upgrades. An assessment of the
                              results of the BAT/BEP investment will also be performed. The selected four mills are the Zhongye Meili Paper Mill (Ningxia); Leshan Jinfu Paper
                              Mill (Sichuan), Nanning Sugar Company Pumiao Paper Mill (Nanning) and Yueyang Paper Mill (Hunan), each typifying the most common non-
                              wood fiber, straw, bamboo, bagasse and reed, respectively. A performance based financing (PBF) scheme has been designed to incentivize the
                              mills to carry out the agreed BAT/BEP investments, complete needed trial operations to adjust the system to the specific production conditions,
                              operate the new facility for a one year period and achieve agreed performance targets (details see Annex 2)

                              Component 2: National Action Plan for Sector-Wide Replication (Total Cost: US$2.56M; GEF Grant: US$1.8M, SIDA Grant: US$0.5M)

                              The objective of this component is to establish an enabling environment for the replication of the BAT/BEP techniques and practices tested under
                              Component 1, including the development and implementation of a national action plan to promote BAT/BEP for both wood and non-wood pulp
                              based production in pulp and paper mills. Based on the experience learned in the four demonstration projects, the component will support (a)
                              development, dissemination and implementation of general sectoral technical guidelines on BAT/BEP and specific guidelines for the non-wood
                              pulp sector of China; (b) development and promotion of implementation of a National Action Plan setting out a detailed approach for the pulp and
                              paper sector in China to progressively eliminate elemental chlorine based bleaching production process, promote updated assessment standard of
                              cleaner technology and carry out a SIDA (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) supported research of integrated permit and
                              its case study; (c) adoptions of measures to encourage sector-wide BAT/BEP adoption, including awareness-raising activities and promotion of
                              good practices for wood-based mills, and training of governmental officials and representatives of industrial institutions on BAT/BEP adoption in
                              the pulp and paper sector; (d) provision of capacity-building support and training to local EPBs to conduct sampling and monitoring of dioxin
                              release from the operation of paper and pulp mills using rapid assessment methods; and (e) carrying out of public awareness and outreach
                              activities to raise awareness on good production practices for both the non-wood and wood-based pulp and paper sectors, as well as among the
                              general public.
                                                                                                                                                                       Page 1 of 7
                         Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation (Total Cost: US$1.2M; GEF Grant: US$0.87 M)

                         Due to the pilot nature of the project, particular monitoring and evaluation emphasis will be placed on evaluating the results of the investments
                         supported by the project. This component will carry out independent verification of baseline and sample results at the four mills to quantify
                         reduction of dioxins releases as well as water quality parameters and water savings achieved. In addition, dioxin monitoring activities will be
                         performed at selected wood mills that have adopted BAT/BEP to evaluate BAT/BEP options for the wood pulp sector. In the four project provinces,

                         the project will support the four provincial EPBs’ efforts to promote UPOP monitoring based on the 2008 standards in their provinces. Such
                         monitoring and subsequent enforcement will provide a fair regulatory environment so that additional mills will be incentivized to take actions to
                         adopt BAT/BEP for non-wood mills demonstrated under this project or commercially available BAT/BEP options for wood mills. Project monitoring
                         and evaluation activities will be carried out during the course of project implementation.

                                 The project will result in significant environmental benefits by supporting four selected non-wood pulp and paper mills to adopt ECF based
                                 technical upgrading which will help minimize UPOPs (dioxins and furans) releases, reduce water consumption and pollutant load in effluents,
                                 including COD, BOD and TSS, etc. The project will also strengthen UPOPs monitoring and enforcement in four participating provinces where
                                 the mills are located.

                                 Potential environmental, health and safety (EHS) issues include, inter alia, the environmental performance of the mills before and after the
                                 project, wastewater management, air emissions, residuals and waste, noises ,construction impacts including decommissioning of old facilities,
                                 health and safety, accidental breakdown of facilities and environmental risks. These potential adverse impacts have been appropriately
                                 assessed and can be adequately avoided, minimized and/or mitigated with measures developed either during project design or in the EMPs.

                                 Proposed investment activities include:

                                 •         The Sichuan Leshan Jinfu Paper Mill will build a 52,000 ton/a bamboo pulp ECF bleaching line and associated material preparation,
                                 cooking, bamboo joint removal, screening, oxygen delignification, and a 4 ton/day chlorine dioxide generation facility.

                                 •          The Nanning Sugar Company Pumiao Paper Mill has built a 98,000 ton/a bamboo pulp ECF bleaching line and an associated 8 ton/
                                 day chlorine dioxide generation facility, and an 11,000 m3/d anaerobic wastewater treatment system for bagasse material preparation. Currently
                                 these facilities are being commissioned. The project will support pilot operation of the completed facilities and construction and operation of a
                                 40,000t/d tertiary wastewater treatment facility.

                                 •         The Ningxia Zhongye Meili Paper Mill will build a 68,000 ton/a straw pulp ECF bleaching and associated 4 ton/day chlorine dioxide
                                 generation facility, and a 260 ton/day alkaline recovery facility. The existing wastewater treatment plant will also be upgraded.

                                 •        The Hunan Yueyang Paper Mill will build a180t/d (61,200t/a) reed pulp oxygen delignification and ECF bleaching system, and

                                 Key environmental issues and impacts at construction stage. Construction activities will take place within the boundary of the mills. There will no
                                 land take or households relocation. Construction impacts are limited and can be effectively mitigated through proper design, construction
                                 schedule, and implementation of generic construction specifications. In terms of decommission of old facilities, there are no asbestos or PCB
                                 contained capacitors in the mill based on available mill operational records. Old facilities and equipments will be collected by certified waste
                                 management companies for safe disposal or reuse. Chemicals and wastes will be handled in accordance with national regulations in an
                                 environment and health protective way. The mitigation measures for construction impacts have been incorporated into the EMPs.

                                 Key environmental issues and impacts at operational stage are described in below.

                                 •          Wastewater discharge before and after the project. The primary driver for the mill to implement the project is to ensure compliance
                                 with the more stringent national wastewater discharge standards for pulp and paper sector (Table 2, GB3544-2008) that come into effective on
                                 July 1st, 2011. Mill specific compliance analysis was conducted and compared with the standards, as is shown in Table 1.

                         The results show before the project, most of the pollutant parameters in all mills do not meet the new national standards, i.e. GB3544-2008,
                         Table 2. After the project, the water consumption and pollutants streams can be substantially reduced. In particular, through implementing ECF
                         based technical upgrading, the mills will be able to substantially avoid or reduce the generation of AOX and dioxins that otherwise can be

                         produced in the elemental chlorine based bleaching process. The effluent quality fully meets the Chin ese standards through implementing the
                         project.

                         The applicable World Bank Group EHS Effluent Guidelines were also thoroughly taken into account into the compliance analysis. The results
                         show that, for most of the parameters, the new national standards are more stringent than EHS, except that the Total Nitrogen (TN) slightly
                         surpasses the EHS Effluent Guidelines. Mill specific analysis (as is shown in Table 2) proves that the implementation of the project will cause
                         most of the wastewater pollutant parameters meet the EHS Effluent Guidelines, except in a few cases the TN will surpass slightly. Further
                         analysis take into account specific environmental carrying capacity, current and planned environmental quality justifies that this will not result in

                         •        Solid waste. The typical solid wastes produced in the mills include residuals from raw materials preparation process, white sludge
                         (lime mud) produced in the alkali recovery process, wastewater treatment sludge, and other residuals and wastes from production process.
                         These wastes are non-hazardous in accordance with national standards and the EHS Guidelines; and are either recycled in the mills or
                         disposed of safety in line with relevant regulations. Other potentially hazardous wastes, such as chemical residues or grease are very small in
                         terms amount. Classification, segregation and disposal of the hazardous wastes are carried out in line with relevant regulations.

                         •            Air emissions. Three mills will not include air emission related activities in the project, except the Meili Mill which will renovate part of
                         its alkali recovery boiler system that will reduce air emissions upon completion. Thus the project is unlikely to cause significant changes of air
                         emissions. Air emissions assessment mainly addresses a review of actual monitoring data of the malodorous gases, Particulate Matters (PM),
                         SO2 and NOx in the process gases (recovery boiler) and flue gases (steam/power generation boilers). Mill-specific compliance analysis shows
                         that treatment facilities have been properly operated to remove air emissions effectively. Applicable Chinese standards are met in general.
                         Further, a comparison study of the monitoring data and relevant EHS Emission Guidelines (including EHS General Guidelines, Pulp and Paper
                         Guidelines and Thermal Plant Guidelines) have been carried out and included in the EIA. The comparison study shows that air emissions from
                         steam/power generation boilers meet the applicable EHS Guidelines. However, for recovery boilers, not all of the monitored parameters meet
                         relevant EHS Emission Guidelines, notably the NOx. The reasons are probably because the EHS Emission Guidelines that is compared specific
                         refer to Kraft wood pulping process, whose raw materials and chemicals needed are different from the non-wood pulping process. Ambient air
                         quality monitoring and assessment shows that the air emissions from each mill have not cause significant impacts to the ambient air quality

                           There are no social safeguard issues for the proposed BAT/BEP investments. There is no need for land acquisition and involuntary resettlement
                           as proposed construction and facility upgrading activities will be implemented within the existing mills’ compounds. All four selected mills will
                           carry out project activities within their existing facilities and do not need any land acquisition for project investment. All four mills also do not
                           have ethnic minority issues. For workers working on existing chlorine based pulp production lines, it is confirmed that none of them will lose
                           their jobs. All mills will provide them training on new production facilities and production processes and livelihood maintenance throughout the
                           project implementation process. Monitoring of this or any unexpected social risks will be integrated with the project overall supervision during
                           project implementation.

                           During project preparation, the Nanning Sugar Company Paper Mill reported that it acquired a piece of barren and hilly land (about 80 mu,
                           equivalent to 5.3 hectares) in 2010 before the project identification. As the land is now being used for its BAT/BEP investment activities, the
                           World Bank’s OP 4.12 is triggered. A due diligence review for this piece of land was conducted and a due diligence review report was prepared.
                           The review found that 45 households and 150 villagers from Nolipo, a sub-village under Liangxin Village in Pumiao Township of Yongning
                           District of Nanning, were affected by the 2010 land acquisition. Field interviews with one third of the total affected people (with representative
                           samples of 27 women and 21 men) and reviews of government authorities’ approval documents on the land acquisition confirmed that there are
                           no legacy issues or adverse effects on the local villagers and the affected village/villagers are satisfied with the compensation arrangements
                           they had received. It was confirmed that the affected villagers could replace what they had lost due to the land requisition since they did not rely
                           much on this piece of land for income or production activities. T his piece of land is adjacent to the Paper Mill and had a very small number of
                           fruit trees, no production and living facilities, and no structures or residents living there. The compensation was up to the satisfaction of the
                           affected people. The interviewed villagers provided broad support to the mill’s BAT/BEP investment activities. Therefore, it is concluded that no
                           additional actions are needed.

                           Further, the project has positive social benefits as it improves environment protection through the reduction of UPOPs emissions (thus
                           minimizing potential health impacts associated with such pollutants), by maintaining the market demand for non-wood fiber material production
                           and supply from rural farmers, and by presenting possible new jobs and skills upgrading for mill workers. Potential social impacts would be
                           related to possible job changes for some of the workers in the mills associated with the upgrading of the production facility. To mitigate any such
                           impact, the mills have confirmed that there will be no job losses and will provide affected workers with training on new technologies, safety and
                           operational skills associated with the project investments, thereby supporting job changes, as required, in the mills.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                           Successful implementation of the proposed BAT/BEP investments will help the participating pulp and paper mills significantly reduce their water
                           consumption and waste discharges/emissions into the environment. These positive environmental impacts will benefit the project areas in the
                           long run. And it is expected that China will eventually replicate the demonstrated BAT/BEP investments at the four mills within its pulp and

                           paper sector. Such a sector wide adoption will bring the sector’s environmental performance to an internationally comparable level.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           wo BAT/BEP options - total chlorine free (TCF) and elemental chlorine free (ECF) processes - were considered during Feasiblity Study Report
                           and EA process. The ECF option has a better cost effectiveness than the TCF option. Technically, the Stockholm Convention BAT/BEP
                           guidelines define “primary measures? and “secondary measures? for best available techniques – chief amongst them the elimination of
                           elemental chlorine by replacing it with chlorine dioxide – the ECF process. The “totally chlorine-free? process (TCF) is presented as an
                           alternative. Moreover, the guidelines note that TCF “has gradually lost its attraction because of its weaknesses in fiber characteristics, lower
                           pulp yield and higher energy consumption. The elemental chlorine-free (ECF) process has taken over as the leading bleaching method. Some
                           TCF processes have started to lose their shares in the market and a number of TCF mills are converting to ECF pulp production. The operating
                           costs of TCF pulping are usually higher than those of ECF pulping due to the higher chemical costs required to reach the same level of pulp
                           brightness.? Finally, referring specifically to non-wood pulp, the guidelines further note that “(b) because of their poor bleachability, non-wood
                           pulps cannot be satisfactorily bleached without chlorine chemicals if the traditional alkaline non-wood process is used?. Following these
                           guidelines, this project supports China to demonstrate ECF based BAT/BEP in the selected four mills.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                           The main project impacts are expected to be positive. The project has implemented a four-fold approach to achieve the expected environmental
                           benefits and minimize environmental and social impacts associated with construction and operation.

                           •         BAT/BEP design. The ECF based bleaching technology and other BAT/BEP such as improved cooking, screening and thorough
                           washing processes have been built into the project design for each mill. These measures are fundamental for the mills to ensure compliance
                           with the more stringent national environmental standards and international practices.

                           •           Comprehensive environmental management plans. Site-specific environmental assessments have been conducted by accredited EIA
                           institutes for each participating mills. A stand-alone EMP has been developed for each mill based on the findings of the EIA report. The EMP
                           details the environmental management and supervision organizations and their responsibilities, mitigation measures, a capacity training plan, a
                           monitoring plan, risk management plan and budget estimates for EMP implementation for construction and operation stages as well.

                           •          Performance Based Framework (PBF). The project will support recruiting internationally acknowledged independent dioxin lab to do
                           dioxins sampling and analysis. Upon verification of compliant dioxins discharge performance, the disbursement can be made to the participating
                           mills. The environmental performance of other wastewater discharge parameters are also built into the performance based framework.


                                                                                                                                                                    Page 5 of 7
                           •         Capacity building. At mill level, environmental management capacity building are built into each mill’s environmental management
                           system, including staff training and online water and air emission monitoring. At regional level, the project will strengthen UPOPs monitoring and
                           enforcement in four participating provinces where the mills are located.

                           The MEP/FECO, through provincial EPBs, will be responsible for overall social and environmental management during the project’s
                           implementation. Each participating paper mill will be responsible for the implementation of its site-specific technical upgrading and EMP.
                           Environmental management responsibility will be built into the project management structure within MEP/FECO, provincial EPBs and

                           participating mill management, through their existing environmental management office and dedicated staff. Environmental mitigation measures
                           developed in the EMP will be fully incorporated into the bidding documents and contracts of contractors, and environmental management
                           systems of the participating mills.

                           The participating paper mills are fully aware of safeguard issues, relevant policies, regulations and laws. They also received some training on
                           involuntary resettlement and other related social concerns. They will continue to comply with the safeguards regulations and policies. The
                           project team will monitor social safeguards issues of the mills’ investment activities and provide proper guidance and advice to the mills
                           throughout the project implementation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                           During EA preparation, public consultation was conducted in accordance with Chinese regulations and Bank’s OP4.01, through a combination
                           of opinion surveys and public meetings in the project areas. Local communities, villagers, mill workers and other affected people were
                           consulted. Public concerns raised during the consultation have been incorporated into the design, the EIA and EMP.

                           The EA has been disclosed in accordance with the Bank’s policy and has been sent to the InfoShop. Information disclosure of EA preparation
                           has been carried out via bulletins in the area of influence and internet. The drafts EIA reports were made available locally at local government
                           public information windows and internet, and as such, are accessible to the general public.
