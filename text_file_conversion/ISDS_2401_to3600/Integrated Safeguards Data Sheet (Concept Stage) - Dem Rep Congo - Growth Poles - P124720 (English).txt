                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to promote the development of an agriculture
                           based growth corridor along the Matadi-Kinshasa-Kikwit corridor through increasing private
                           investments in commercial agriculture, processing agriculture products, and strengthening select
                           value chains (including cassava, maize, rice, bean, fruits, meat, fishery).
                           C. Project Description
                           Based on lessons of experience, the proposed growth pole approach would require a cross-cutting
                           strategy in order to exploit synergies across several projects, catalyze resources, build capacity of
                         individuals and institutions, and address coordination failures needed to support growth and job
                         creation through the private sector. Coordination failures and the lack of direct and comprehensive
                         support to targeted sectors are indeed two major issues, which have discouraged the private sector to

                         seize and develop business opportunities in the past. In line with the “Competitiveness and
                         Employment? pillar of the 2011-2016 World Bank Africa’s Strategy, a growth pole approach could
                         contribute to addressing these issues, with a focus on the agriculture sector . This is also in line with
                         the FPD Competitive Industries Global Practice’s main objective of job creation through better
                         public-private dialogue, cooperation and strategic investments in public goods to support industries.

                         As indicated in the Africa Strategy, growth poles projects have been or are being developed in
                         several countries (Madagascar, Cameroon, Gambia, Mozambique) to help them deploy “a critical
                         mass of reforms, infrastructure investments, and skills building for the industries and locations of
                         highest potential?. The proposed Growth Pole Project will be developed based on the same integrated
                         approach. In addition to the recommendations from the Africa Strategy, the project will also build on
                         lessons from the 2011 World Development Report on “Conflict, Security, and Development?. The
                         report highlights that in post conflict countries with weak institutions, such as DRC, quick tangible
                         results, early projects to create jobs through the private sector, a longer-term perspective, and
                         integrated and coordinated interventions, are critical. Lessons from the 2009 World Development
                         report, “Reshaping Economic Geography?, highlighting that spatial integration (along a corridor for
                         instance) could be facilitated with institutions that unite, infrastructure that connects, and
                         interventions that target, such as incentives for firms to locate in certain areas.

                         Eight growth poles/corridors have been identified with the Government based on several key criteria:
                         i) minimum infrastructure platform (roads, railway, river transport, electricity); ii) Significant
                         economic potential (potential can come from underexploited natural resources (agricultural, mining),
                         industrial advantage (clusters), SMEs base, human capital iii) Geographic Position (proximity to
                         markets or on trade routes or corridors, sources of demand), potential forward or backward linkages;
                         transport terminals; iii) Political advantage (human needs, regional integration, inclusion, post
                         conflict rebuilding, decline or stagnation zones; areas of high poverty, malnutrition; iv) Ownership

                         (engagement of key players in achieving development goals and implementing reforms); existence of
                         an economic plan and spatial strategy; strong civil society; v) existence of lead/anchor investors and
                         potential efficiency gains (existence of a vertically disintegrated industry with a anchor/lead investor;
                         existence of a missing link in a value chain that can be exploited); vi) existence of relevant projects
                         or programmes supported by Government or development partners.

                         The identified growth poles and corridors are:
                         i)     Matadi-Kinshasa-Kikwit corridor (industry, agriculture and markets) including an SEZ in
                         Maluku (industry, agroindustry, construction materials) ;
                         ii)    Kinshasa-Equateur/Mbandaka corridor (agriculture);
                         iii)   Lubumbashi-Likasi-Kolwezi corridor (mining and agriculture);
                         iv)    Lubumbashi-Kindu-Kisangani corridor (mining, fisheries, wood and agriculture);
                         v)     Kinshasa-Kisangani river corridor (transport, fisheries, wood and agriculture);
                         vi)    Kisangani-Bukavu-Goma-Beni corridor (agriculture including tourism in the Virunga
                         mountains);
                         vii)   Bukavu-Kalemi corridor (agriculture, fisheries including tourism along lake Tanganyika);
                         viii)  Kasais/Corridor Bukavu-Kasongo-Mbuji Mayi (mining,agriculture, fisheries).

                         Poles and corridors are ranked based on a simple scoring methodology as presented in Annex 3. The
                         scores are proposed based on existing knowledge and information available on the poles/corridors.
                         The main sources of information are the Country Economic Memorandum (World Bank, 2011); the
                         Prioritizing Infrastructure Investments–Spatial Approach study (World Bank, 2009); as well as the
                         mapping of agriculture potential (Map 1), mapping of electric power generation and transmission

                         system (map 2), and mapping of transportation network (Map 3).

                         The Matadi-Kinshasa-Kikwit corridor was selected as the corridor, which meets most of the criteria.
                         It will therefore be the focus of the project. It has the most favorable minimum conditions (transport,
                         power, population, growth sectors) on which the growth pole approach could be implemented.
                         Indeed, a very good paved road network links Matadi to Kinshasa (330 kms), and Kinshasa to Kikwit
                         (450 kms). It provides access to the international port of Matadi, the international airport, to the river
                         and the republic of Congo’s capital city, Brazzaville. Electricity is available from Inga dams although
                         access remains unreliable. It has potential in several sectors including agriculture (cassava, maize,
                         bean, rice, fruits & vegetables); forestry; fisheries; construction materials; livestock. It has a large
                         market (about 10 million in Kinshasa).

                         Lubumbashi is the second identified growth pole (as part of the Lubumbashi-Likasi-Kolwezi
                         corridor) with the minimum conditions. However, with a population of 1.3 million, its potential to
                         quickly create jobs is lower than in Kinshasa. The paved road network connecting the city to other
                         potential growth centers in the provinces is also not as developed as in Kinshasa. The third corridor is
                         the Kisangani-Bukavu-Goma-Beni corridor with Kisangani as the main nodal pole and the country’s
                         third largest city. The corridor is being supported by the road network, which has been recently
                         improved. However, stability and security still need to be consolidated for the corridor to provide a
                         better platform to support its integrated growth. The other poles and corridors identified do not
                         provide, at this stage, the minimum infrastructure platform (roads and electricity network) on which
                         productive sectors could grow and quickly create jobs.

                         The approach consists in focusing a critical mass of concrete and complementary hard and soft
                         interventions, which can be rapidly deployed in a coordinated manner, for the industries mainly in
                         the selected Matadi-Kinshasa-Kikwit corridor. It will help drive employment growth by effectively

                         removing bottlenecks in the value chains, increasing production to supply existing markets,
                         improving transport/logistics that will bring prices down, stimulate domestic demand and increase
                         investment. It will start with interventions which can be deployed rapidly within the growth poles to
                         unleash a positive dynamic of investments and reforms which will spread through demonstration and
                         learning effects. As mentioned in paragraph 14 and 15, other sectoral projects would bring co
                         mplementary and more comprehensive support, which will not be provided under the proposed
                         project.

                         DESCRIPTION

                         The project will be very selective in the interventions it supports. It will focus mainly on providing
                         basic physical infrastructure (including special economic zone, feeder roads, power, storage,
                         markets), strengthen the institutional framework required to support the development of the corridor,
                         build the capacity of the private sector, and support targeted investment climate reforms. These
                         interventions will be mainly deployed in key nodal poles that are in the corridor with the view of
                         scaling up gradually and to a larger scale.

                         The project will start by developing and better connecting markets (Kinshasa) with agricultural
                         growth poles (Kikwit, Kimpese) along the corridors (Kinshasa-Kikwit and Kinshasa-Matadi paved
                         roads). It will also support agriculture products transformation (Kinshasa/Maluku SEZ). Indeed,
                         focusing on and strengthening the four links of the value chain (production, transport, transformation
                         and markets) large parts of the Matadi-Kinshasa-Kikwit corridor, including feeder roads, can be
                         bonded to work together with support from the project. Although the agriculture sector is the main
Public Disclosure Copy




                         source of growth that will be targeted along the corridor to drive job creation, other sectors including
                         construction materials will also be supported. The project could also provide support to the
                         Lubumbashi-Likasi-Kolwezi corridor . This support will however be less comprehensive than in the
                         first selected corridor. It will not finance physical infrastructure and will mainly provide technical
                         assistance to promote investments in the agriculture sector (with the abandoned farms) and build
                         capacity of SMEs around anchor investors. More comprehensive support could come at a later stage
                         from additional financing or other projects.

                         The Project components and very preliminary cost estimates are presented below.

                         COMPONENT 1 – Support to Infrastructure Development in the MATADI-KINSHASA-KIKWIT
                         corridor (US$95 million)

                         The proposed interventions will strengthen both the physical infrastructure and the institutional
                         platform to directly support the targeted products and sectors (agriculture, agribusiness, construction
                         materials).

                         Sub Component 1.1 – Physical Infrastructure (US$80 million)

                         The project will finance basic physical infrastructure to improve the enabling environment and to
                         attract additional private investment in the target area. (As indicated in paragraph 12 and 13, physical
                         infrastructure that required more resources could be considered under other stand alone ongoing or
                         new infrastructure projects).

                         �       Establish the Special Economic zone (SEZ) in Maluku (US$25 million). Building on the
                         preparatory work and support provided by the ongoing IFC SEZ program in DRC (master plan,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         demand analysis, site assessment, institutional and regulatory framework, energy supply study), the
                         project will finance, possibly in conjunction with a private developer, basic infrastructure/public
                         goods to establish the SEZ (fencing, main access roads, water, power, ICT, river port , administration
                         and security within the SEZ). It will also rehabilitate and extend the road, water and power networks,
                         and improve port logistics/services (through PPP) around the Maluku SEZ to improve the overall
                         enabling environment in Maluku and create linkages between the SEZ and the local economy.

                         �        Establish new markets in the Kinshasa periphery (US$5 million). The project will create new
                         outlets in the periphery of Kinshasa area (at Kinkole, Plateau des Bateke for example) to ease
                         marketing of fruits and vegetables (maize, cassava, rice, bean) and fish products arriving from other
                         nearby provinces including Bas Congo, Bandundu and Equateur. The markets, possibly managed
                         through PPPs to ensure their sustainability , could also serve as a marketing platform for products
                         from the SEZ.

                         �       Improving collection/storage/conditioning/packaging points (common service centers), a
                         wholesale market, and power distribution in Kikwit (US$20 million). The project will establish
                         depots and required common service centers to strengthen the value chains of selected agriculture
                         products (maize, cassava, rice, fruits) around Kikwit including a central wholesale market probably
                         at Pont Kwilu market (to be confirmed by master plan), which is the major transit point for most of
                         the regional production. Kikwit (in the Bandundu province) is a major agricultural center which

                         any electricity for establishing an agricultural product processing industry and supporting the vibrant
                         SME sector. The project will build on the upcoming hydropower plant in Kakobola (75 kms from

                         around Kimpese and other major production centers (US$15 million) in Bas Congo. The project will
                         establish/strengthen depots and other common service centers needed to strengthen the value chains
                         of selected agriculture products (cassava, maize, bean, fruits) around major productions areas along
                         the main road Kinshasa-Matadi.

                         �        Improving selected feeder roads (US$15 million).The project will provide financing to
                         rehabilitate and ensure the maintenance of selected feeder roads that are linked to the production
                         centers (and planne d common service centers mentioned above) and which are critical to the supply
                         chains of the growth poles. The maintenance of feeder roads are normally financed by the Fonds
                         d’Entretien Routier (FER) (based on the program prepared by the Direction des Voies de Dessertes
                         Agricoles (DVDA) which identifies the priority feeder roads to be financed, and implement the
                         maintenance program with the Office des Routes (ODR)). However, resources are not yet sufficient
                         to effectively and timely rehabilitate and maintain these roads . For this reason, the project will
                         provide the minimum resources to ensure that at least Kikwit and Kimpese are adequately linked to
                         feeder roads to enable farmers to supply their production .

                         Sub-component 1.2 - Institutional Infrastructure (US$15 million)

                         The project will support the establishment/development of SME support centers (Maison de
                         l’entreprise/ business and training centers) in each pole of the Maluku, Kinshasa and Kikwit corridor
                         and in the Lubumbashi-Likasi-Kolwezi corridor. These support centers will contribute to developing/
                         strengthening the SMEs/NGOs base, strengthening farmers associations, and creating linkages
                         between the Maluku zone (and other anchor investors) and the local economy. They will also play a

                         lead role in the implementation of the program with a focus on the organization and development of
                         the targeted value chains and clusters.

                         The project will strengthen the institutional framework (and the capacity of relevant stakeholders) to
                         develop and/or manage infrastructure supported by the project including the SEZ, markets, port
                         services, feeder roads, depot points and other common service centers through PPP or other forms of
                         partnerships . More specifically, for the proposed zone in Maluku, the project will finance a
                         transaction advisor to provide technical assistance to validate the PPP options for (further)
                         development and management of the zone, road show the proposed SEZ, and select the private
                         developer/manager. It will also strengthen the existing Cellule d’Appui des Zones Economiques
                         Spéciales (CAZES). CAZES is expected to evolve to become the overarching authority not only for
                         the proposed SEZ at Maluku, but any other SEZ that will be established in the country as part of the
                         broader growth pole program.

                         manufacturing, and construction materials in the targeted areas. It would finance feasibility studies
                         for business opportunities, which could also be materialized through PPPs or other forms of
                         partnerships. A manual of procedures for the PDF will be prepared to guide the operations and
                         highlight the selection criteria of the funds. It could work in close partnership with the IFC Supported
                         risk capital fund, King Kuba, to build on its experience and leverage more resources.

                         Examples of business opportunities or productive organizations which could be supported/facilitated
                         by the PDF, including opportunities already identified by the Government , are:

                         -      establishment of fruits/vegetables/fish processing units and bottling and packaging
                         manufacturing in the Maluku SEZ;
                         -      organization of a construction materials cluster in Maluku;
                         -      rehabilitation and development of abandoned farms;
                         -      support the development of an agricultural transport cooperative in Kikwit;
                         -      reactivation of palm oil production in Kikwit area through PPP.

                         The project will also strengthen the capacity of the Investment Promotion agency, enable it to better
                         market investment opportunities (including through investor road shows/conferences) and provide
                         investor aftercare services in collaboration with other relevant structures (i nvestment promotion
                         fund, private sector associations, etc) which will also be rationalized and strengthened.

                         other support services, necessary to build the capacity of enterprises , and support the development of
                         the SME base. Agricultural Technical Centers (including the center supported by UNIDO in
                         Kimpese) could be supported by the grant to better provide agricultural services and capacity
                         building to outgrowers, and promote transformation activities. Matching grants will be provided to
                         individual or clusters of firms with a primary focus on those that operate in the targeted sectors in the
                         Matadi-Kinshasa-Kiwit corridor and in the Lubumbashi-Likasi-Kolwezi corridor. It will also
                         contribute to strengthening and reinforcing their linkages with the lead firms in their value chains.

                         The matching grant will facilitate access to training in technical and management skills as well as
                         such business development services (BDS) and mentoring services, preparation of bankable business
                         plans, application of standards, and product certification. It will sensitize the beneficiaries on how to
                         identify and address environmental and social issues. It will complement and work closely with IFC
                         supported Business edge and SME toolkit instruments which are aimed strengthening capacity for
                         SMEs.

                         Sub Component 2.3. Governance and Investment Climate Reforms (US$10 million)

                         The growth pole approach, which consists in supporting the minimum physical and institutional
                         platform, will generate demand for ad-hoc reforms for targeted sectors and corridors. To handle these
                         reforms, the project will finance dedicated public-private dialogue platforms that would primarily
                           work on investment climate related risk identification and mitigation. Key analytical work and
                           position papers will be financed to help prepare specific reform action plans. The project will finance
                           the development and implementation of the governance system and structure that would support the

                           em ergence of the poles. Examples are the design of transparent approaches to procurement, M&E,
                           accountability, etc. The Governance of the project will also be supported by steering committees
                           including all the relevant stakeholders .

                           Although this component will focus on relevant sector specific reforms, the project will also support
                           more generic reforms, which are aimed at improving the overall investment climate. Reform areas
                           will include agriculture sector specific reforms , land cadastre and land titling/rights including for
                           abandoned farms and industrial sites, trucking and river transportation, licensing/permit, and other
                           industry specific reforms that are relevant to the development of the value chains or clusters.

                           COMPONENT 3 – PROJECT COORDINATION AND M&E (US$10 million)

                           The project will provide resources to recruit key staff including the Project Coordinator, a Finance
                           Manager, an accountant, a procurement specialist; and a monitoring & evaluation (M&E) specialist
                           within the coordinating Ministry (Ministry of Finance, tbc). The project will also provide resources
                           for training in relevant areas for staff of relevant Ministries, as well as resources to recruit
                           consultants with specific expertise as needed to strengthen the capacity of the relevant stakeholders
                           in the public sector and improve coordination. It will also finance the surveys that will feed into for
                           the M&E system. Office space, additional support staff, equipment, vehicles, goods and other
                           expenses required for the PCU to be fully operational will also be financed. A dedicated
                           multisectoral growth pole/corridor steering committee/task force will be established and empowered
                           to guide, monitor and ensure the coordinated implementation of the proposed activities. It will
                           monitor the implementation of a comprehensive master plan (including construction of infrastructure,
                           maintenance of feeder roads, ect) that will be prepared for at least the first phase of the corridor
                           development program besides the SEZ.

                           While the Ministry of Environment's capacity for review and enforcement of EIAs remains weak, an
                           important advance was achieved in July, 2011, with the adoption of a new framework law on the
                           environment, requiring EIA of all investments. This law provides for the establishment of a national
                           agency with a mandate for EIA review and enforcement, replacing the current unit of the Ministry.
                           Support for the creation of this agency will be provided under the Bank-supported PROMINES
                           project.
