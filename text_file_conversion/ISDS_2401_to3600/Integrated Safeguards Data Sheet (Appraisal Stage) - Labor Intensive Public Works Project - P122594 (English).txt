                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed project is a follow on to the first two phases of PWPs and the ongoing Third PWP. It aims to scale-up the impact of previous PWPs
                              by increasing the number of people with access to improved basic services by increasing the number of sub-projects to be delivered. T
                              The design of the project will be kept flexible, responsive and conducive to the existing conditions on the ground and will finance the following
                              three components:

                              (i)       Component 1: Community Infrastructure (US$59.03 million equivalent): This component will finance works and goods for small Sub-
                              projects in the following sectors: health, education, water supply, sewage, water harvesting schemes, stone paving of roads and streets and
                              vocational training.

                              (ii)      Component 2: Technical Assistance (US$3.47 million equivalent): This component will finance consultancy services for: (i) preliminary
                              and detailed designs of Sub-projects including construction supervision; (ii) auditing services; (iii) environmental assessments, monitoring, and
                              technical advisory services; and (iv) training and workshops.

                              (iii)      Component 3: Project Management (US$2.50 million equivalent): This component will finance incremental operational costs of the PMU
                              and staff training.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The sub-projects will collectively have national coverage with emphasis on areas with poverty, high unemployment, and which are deprived of
                              basic infrastructure services. Sub-projects will be selected from proposals submitted by communities and local governments.
                              The Project is classified Environmental Category "B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," as the
                              list of eligible sub-projects are expected to generally have positive health and environmental impacts. Additionally, due to the small-scale nature of
                              the investments (costing on average about US$130,000), no significant or irreversible impacts are anticipated. However, based on the Borrower's
                              experience in the first three projects, and the preliminary review of eligible sub-projects in the pipeline, negative impacts, if any, would be minor
                              and could be mitigated effectively by implementing the mitigation measures as recommended in the EMP. The Manual of Procedures includes
                              provisions for screening sub-projects and rejecting any that would have a negative impact on the environment (or that would not result in a positive
                              impact to improve the environment).

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The Project is classified Environmental Category "B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," as
                                 the list of eligible sub-projects are expected to have generally positive health and environmental impacts. Additionally, due to the small-scale
                                 nature of the investments (costing on average about US$130,000), no significant or irreversible impacts are anticipated. However, based on the
                                 Borrower's experience in the first three projects, and the preliminary review of eligible sub-projects in the pipeline, negative impacts, if any,
                                 would be minor and could be mitigated effectively by implementing the mitigation measures as recommended in the EMP. The MOP includes
                                 provisions for screening sub-projects and rejecting any that would have a negative impact on the environment (or that would not result in a
                                 positive impact to improve the environment).

                                 The MOP includes a provision in the selection criteria to exclude any sub-project proposals that would result in involuntary resettlement of
                                 people in accordance with OP/BP 4.12. The MOP also includes a provision in the selection criteria for eligibility of sub-projects to exclude any
                                 sub-projects proposal that would involve trans-boundary aquifers or other international waterways in accordance with OP/BP 7.50.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  N/A
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                  N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                   The Borrower's Implementing Agency, the Public Works Project/ Project Management Unit (PWP/PMU), has fourteen years of experience in
                                 implementing basic infrastructure sub-projects throughout the country. The PMU is staffed with qualified environmental specialists who are
                                 responsible for reviewing sub-project proposals against the screening criteria in the MOP, and ensuring approved sub-projects are designed in
                                 compliance with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The PMU undertook an Environmental Impact Assessment for PWP-3, which
                                 was updated for the proposed Labor Intensive Public Works Project (LIPWP) and its staff has updated the EMP for the proposed project taking
                                 into account the experience gained in the first three projects. The PMU is also assisted by consultants who ensure approved sub-projects are
                                 designed in compliance with the EMP requirements, and monitor construction during supervision of works contracts to ensure contractors'
                                 compliance with the EMP.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                   There are two categories of key stakeholders: donor communities and sector ministries, and beneficiaries who include communities and their
                                 local representative groups such as sheikhs, local governments etc. Donors and sector ministries are largely interested in projects that enhance
                                 the capacity of the recipient to absorb and manage resources for the implementation of small scale infrastructure that delivers services, has an
                                 impact on the lives of the poor, and generates employment through the use of labor intensive works contracts. The notable increase in the
                                 contribution of donors over the years from about US$2.5 million under the First PWP to over US$300 million under the ongoing Third PWP is
                                 testimony to the support that the PWPs enjoy from this group of stakeholders. The second category of stakeholders is the beneficiaries, and
                                 they include members of parliament, NGOs, district councils, local government officials, Sheikhs, etc. This group of stakeholders has become
                                 acutely aware of PWPs over the last 14 years. They are well informed through the local media, as well as through word of mouth in
                                 professional associations of engineering firms, the contracting industry and through other communication tools such as brochures. Requests for

                              sub-projects continue to come from communities at a steady pace and currently there are about 17,000 requests with the PMU awaiting
                              implementation.
