Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component 1. Improving Teachers’ Skills and Knowledge and School Management in Primary Schools of Project-Designated Areas (US$64
                              million)

                              This component has the following objectives: (i) consolidate and extend the Zones of Pedagogical Influence model to all provinces of Angola; (ii)
                              prepare, implement and evaluate an in-service teacher training program aimed at improving teachers’ academic knowledge, pedagogical skills and
                              use of time in the classroom; and (iii) further improve school management and accountability to local communities with the introduction of grant-
                              financed pedagogical school projects focused on quality enhancing activities. Careful evaluation of the different subcomponents (which includes an
                              impact evaluation) will allow identifying the most cost effective approach and refining the models within the lifetime of the project until ready for
                              national scale up.

                              Sub-component 1.1. Consolidating the Zones of Pedagogical Influence (US$3 million)

                              This sub-component will strengthen the ZIP model in the nine provinces where ZIPs are currently established and establish it in the remaining nine
                              provinces. Zones of Pedagogical Influence (ZIPs) are school groupings consisting of a centre-school and several associated satellite-schools.
                              Schools within a ZIP are to share and collaborate under coordination of the centre school with each other in their day-to-day work to deliver high
                              quality education. Consolidating and setting up the ZIPs will be done through the following activities: (i) informing the schools of the ZIP structure to
                              which they have been assigned as well as of their role as centre or satellite schools; (ii) establishing a ZIP council and a school council in each of
                              the schools within the ZIP; (iii) training the ZIP and school councils in their roles and responsibilities; (iv) establishing a system to produce,
                              disseminate, and use school report cards for improved school management and accountability.

                              The sub-component will finance (i) reproduction of ZIP manual, (ii) consultants fees for the development and implementation of the provincial ZIP
                              facilitators’ training as well as for the ZIP facilitators work itself, and (iii) operating costs and per diem to develop and implement the training of the
                              ZIP facilitators, to conduct workshops and capacity building activities with the ZIPs, to produce and disseminate the school report cards.

                              Sub-component 1.2. In-service Training Program for Teachers (US$59 million)

                              This sub-component aims to improve primary teachers’ academic knowledge, pedagogical skills and use of time in the classroom through the
                              preparation and delivery of an in-service teacher training program. The content of the in-service teacher training program will include several
                              modules: one academic module (Portuguese and mathematics) and four pedagogical modules and will include pre and post assessment (tests or
                              classroom observations) of teachers’ knowledge and skills. Content, teaching and learning materials will be developed, reproduced and distributed
                              to trainees. All training curriculum and material will be specifically developed and/or adapted for Angola. Careful evaluation of this program

                                                                                                                                                                              Page 1 of 3
                               (including an impact evaluation) will allow refining the model within the lifetime of the project with the aim of national scale up.

                               This sub-component will finance: (i) international technical assistance for developing the teacher training program curricula and material, train
                               trainers, monitor training delivery, and provide continuous support to the teacher training colleges; (ii) training equipment and supplies for the
                               teacher training colleges and ZIP center schools, (iii) reproduction of teaching and learning material for trainees; (iv) bicycles for ZIP mentors; (v)
                               operating costs associated with the activities of trainees, trainers, ZIPs, supervisors, and municipality staff.

                               whereby information compiled in the ZIP schools’ report cards is used to identify key problems and outline solutions to enhance quality of the
                               education delivered; and (ii) management of a grant (US$500 per school on average with the specific amounts depending on school’s size) by the
                               ZIP and school councils to execute the approved EPs.

                               This sub-component will finance: (i) the school grants; (ii) consultant fees for preparing the EP criteria and manual; (iii) printing of the EP manual
                               and other materials; (iv) training of ZIP facilitators on the grant and EP process; and (v) consultant fees and operating costs to support and monitor
                               preparation and execution of EPs.

                               The project does not include civil works, thus no environmental issues are expected. School Education Projects will be limited to pedagogical
                              projects that do not involve infrastructure projects. Given the engagement of the schools, parents and communities in the project, the presence
                              of center schools strengthening the support system available for satellite schools as well as the development of resource centers in the center-
                              schools that can also be used by the community, the project is expected to have a very positive social impact. The capacity building approach
                              embedded in the project’s components is also expected to have positive impact given its contribution to better local management, use of
