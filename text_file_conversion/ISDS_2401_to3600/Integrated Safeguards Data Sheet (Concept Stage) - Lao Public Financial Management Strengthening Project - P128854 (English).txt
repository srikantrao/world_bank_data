                           B. Project Objectives
                           The core objective of the new PFM project is to bring improvements to the GOL’s top down policy,
                           budgeting, oversight, and budget execution processes and systems that would: (i) link budgeting and
                           planning policy and processes at the central level, (ii) modernize financial management systems to
                           deliver, manage, and report on public finances in a timely and accurate manner, and (iii) bring Lao
                           PDR at par with good international practices on fiscal disclosure and transparency. These objectives
                           would be met by supporting the GOL efforts at institutional redesign, human resource development,
                           and investment in systems.
                         The project aims to address two fundamental problems in the public finance management system of
                         Lao PDR:

                         �

                                  Budgeting is reactive to a needs based planning process, leading to non – strategic
                         ‘projecitisation’ of the budget with inadequate resources for operating and maintenance costs.
                         �        Financial management systems are fragmented and unable to provide financial resources to
                         service delivery units an efficient manner, and to report accurately and timely.
                         C. Project Description
                         Over the past 6 months the project team has conducted two missions and been in on – going
                         consultations with the GOL, development partners and Bank staff to (i) confirm the project’s
                         approach; (ii) verify that the current context and identified set of constraints has been appropriately
                         identified; and (iii) that the right project components and appropriate set of solutions have been
                         proposed. With these objectives in mind, project preparation was expanded to include conducting a
                         procurement diagnostic to take a fresh look at procurement and a comprehensive review of capacity
                         constraints in the Ministry of Finance and other key institutions has begun. Two pre – concept
                         meetings were held in November and December of 2011, respectively. Various task team members
                         have engaged and participated in subsequent discussions and activities that the team considers
                         critical to inform the design of the new project. These included (i) a project design workshop with
                         government; (ii) participating in the PRSO and PER discussions between the GOL and Development
                         Partners; (iii) participating on a separate GFMIS/TIMS review mission in early November; and (iv) a
                         brainstorming session with representatives from the MPI, MOHA and Budget Department of the
                         MOF to identify ways to integrate and strengthen the annual budget planning and development
                         process. Based on these consultations and confirmation, 4 project components and set of solutions
                         has been designed.

                         The focus on modernizing the GOL’s existing first generation Public Financial Management systems
                         affects the proposed project design in several important ways. The top down approach means we will
                         not be supporting the MTEF (bottom up planning) or working intensively with the line ministries or
Public Disclosure Copy




                         provinces. More sophisticated reforms like strategic performance based budgeting, performance
                         auditing, building complex internal controls and accrual accounting will only be considered after
                         basic reforms presented below have been effectively. Because the focus will be on government
                         institutions, the project initially will not support private sector accounting or centers of excellence.
                         Additionally, the project plans to take a fresh approach to procurement to see what traction can be
                         achieved. Building on lessons learned from previous and ongoing Bank engagements supporting
                         PFM, the new project will select only those core activities as outlined below that can be realistically
                         achieved over the 5 year period.

                         The Planning and Budget Policy and Preparation (component 1) aims to better link government
                         policy with planning and budgeting. By supporting the central Ministries involved in the budget and
                         planning process to move from the current, largely reactive approach to management of the budget to
                         a more strategic approach the GOL overtime will be able to better reflect policy priorities in the
                         budget. This can only be achieved through improved collaboration between the cabinet, MoF, MPI,
                         and MoHA. The strategic plan and the budget need to be mutually reinforcing – with central
                         planning and financing agencies coming together to guide 100% of the budget, not just the 15-20%
                         they are responsible for at present. Interventions will be made in 2 key areas: (i) the Development a
                         Medium-Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) which establishes the medium-term resource envelope
                         upon which both the development plan and the budget are based; and (ii) providing support to the
                         Budget Department, MPI and MoHA to advise Cabinet on medium-term sector budgetary ceilings
                         within the overall resource envelope. To further strengthen the link between budget and planning the
                         project will work with those departments and institutions tasked with budget planning and
                         preparation to better align budget schedules, roles and responsibilities. Support will be provided to

                         ensure that the budget classification is designed and utilized to meet budget reporting requirements.
                         To further promote a holistic budgeting and planning framework, the project will explore
                         opportunities for integrating donor financing to the extent possible.

                         There have been a number of previous unsuccessful attempts to introduce Medium – Term
                         Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) in Lao. These have failed to meet expectations for three reasons.
                         The incorrect sequencing of reforms resulted in the development of unconstrained sector plans and
                         the creation of baseline MTEFs in a few pilot ministries. These were put in place before common
                         agreement had been achieved on the medium – term resource availabilities. Too little attention was
                         given to the institutional coll aboration required for the development of an MTEF: although
                         legislation for medium-term budgeting is in place, authority for determining resource availabilities of
                         the budget is also not solely in the hands of the Ministry of Finance. Furthermore, the reforms were
                         too narrowly focused on technical skills with forecasting models developed without the full
                         acceptance or understanding by those within GOL responsible for such task of the relevance of these
                         models.

                         A resource envelope over the medium – term remains a vitally important tool for the GOL to ensure
                         budgets better reflect its priorities in a fiscally sustainable way in an era of rapid natural resources
                         driven economic growth. Based on previous experiences, some within government and donor
                         community have concluded that working on Medium term budgeting and planning is fruitless. The
                         importance of the work is such that efforts should not cease, rather what is required is a change of
                         approach that draws lessons from some of the mistakes of the past. First, under the new project work
                         will be sequenced correctly to establish ‘availabilities-based’ budgeting by establishing a medium-
                         term resource envelope before moving to the provision of sector ceilings. Second, the work will seek
                         to build institutional collaboration between MPI, MOHA and MOF. Third, the project will continue
                         to foster understanding on the need for the introduction of medium-term budgeting across

                         government (not just in the Ministry of Finance). Fourth the approach taken will be simple and
                         collaborative building on the improvement of existing forecasting techniques, rather than importing
                         complex models.

                         The budget Execution Component (Component 2) aims to improve budget execution and foster
                         transparency in financial reporting. The program will support the two – track strategy for the
                         implementation of an integrated government financial information system in Lao PDR by
                         maintaining the locally developed GFIS (Track 1) while providing for the development and
                         deployment of a commercial-off-the shelf solution (Track 2). Moving along the two – track will
                         help to put in place a coding structure for the budget and systems that (i) facilitates the generation of
                         timely aggregate budget execution reports which give policy makers improved information for
                         adapting to altered circumstances (e.g. underperforming revenues/project overruns etc.) during
                         budget execution, and (ii) enables central Ministries to identify whether funds allocated to sector
                         Ministries are reaching the hospitals, schools and agricultural extension centers where services are
                         delivered.

                         From a systems and technical point of view the decision for the GOL to migrate to a new COTS
                         package rather than to try and upgrade the existing GFIS is a sensible approach. Because of a lack of
                         documentation, it is not feasible at this stage of development to conduct a proper systems
                         documentation for the GFIS. From a financial perspective the GOL will have to spend large amounts
                         of money patching up the system. This is not cost effective in the long - run and in many ways
                         would be delaying the inevitable purchase of a COTS system. Furthermore, the current IT staff (who
                         run the system) does not have the technical or functional knowledge to make the necessary upgrades.

                         The existing GFIS is a remarkable achievement and has served the government well up to a point. It
                         is increasingly clear that the system is unable to meet the increasing financial management
                         information needs of the GOL. The GFIS is essentially a cash - based system and has limited
                         capacity for accounts receivable/payable processing, and no requisition, procurement and goods
                         receipt management - these pose significant budget execution and internal control risks and concerns.
                         No applications currently exist to allow the system to generate revenue reports which severely
                         hampers the government's ability to produce adequate or consolidated reports for management,
                         accounting, reconciliation, auditing or accountability purposes. The lack of functionality in these
                         areas is where the GFIS would hinder progress on PFM reforms. To further try to incorporate these
                         in the GFIS would take significant financial resources with unpredictable results.

                         Under the two – track strategy the current GFIS would be stabilized and financing provided to
                         support its continued operation along with the incorporation of a much needed bank reconciliation
                         module. Once the new system is in place the project would support the business process design and
                         migration of data from the GFIS to the new TIM S. To facilitate a smooth transition, the Minister of
                         Finance issued a revised decree in August 2011 that expanded the Treasury Modernization
                         Committee charged with preparing the new system to now include representatives of the ICT
                         Department in the TIMS Steering committee, and an Implementation Committee and Working Group
                         to work with the consultants. We understand the MOF is considering merging the ICT Department
                         (responsible for the GFIS) into the Treasury which would be a welcome move to promote the
                         implementation of the two – track strategy.

                         Preparation for the migration to TIMS is underway. Under the PFM MDTF the government has
                         contracted a firm to help them design the specifications of TIMS, prepare the bidding documents,
                         and select a contractor. The work plan for this activity envisages the conceptual design phase of the

                         assignment to be completed by November 2011 with the bid documents for the acquisition of
                         software ready for issuance by May 2012. A two stage bid evaluation process will be used for the
                         acquisition and would take (12-18 months) with likely completion by December 2013. The Pilot
                         phase of the system implementation is projected to take approximately 9 months taking the project to
                         the end of 2014. The rollout of the system to the Provincial Treasuries is planned to commence in
                         late 2014 and completed by the end of 2015. Were the acquisition of TIMS to be deferred, the
                         acquisition of a COTS solution would be delayed to at least 2018 and result in the postponement of
                         many core PFM reforms supported by the new project. (See Attachment 3)

                         The exiting work on developing and introducing a new Chart of Accounts will be continued under
                         the new project. Reforms to the Chart of Accounts aim to unify coding structures for budgeting and
                         accounting and to harmonize the existing fragmentation of different reporting structures at the central
                         and local level. More specifically, the new COA will allow reporting across government of budget
                         versus actual amounts by: (i) Economic classification (based on modified GFS 2001); (ii)
                         Organizational classification, unified for each level of government (central, provincial and district);
                         (iii) Project, numbered for each level of government; and (iv) Source of funds (government/donor,
                         loan/grant, number). Analysis of expenditure by functional classification (COFOG) will be
                         achievable. All these important features will enable the GOL to improve and expand the information
                         and data provided in financial reports thereby providing decision makers and program managers the
                         necessary tools to inform their actions.
                         To further improve budget management, financial accountability and transparency, and decision
                         making, the project will assist the GOL in developing and implementing a single accounting and

                         auditing framework. It is envisaged this support will lead to a uniform, internationally recognized set
                         of reporting standards and requirements with financial reports covering all government – related
                         expenditure and revenue. Towards this goal resources and technical assistance will be provided to the
                         Accounting Department and the Accounting Council.

                         The low levels of capacity in the accounting and auditing professions must be addressed. The
                         existing Professional Accountancy Organization, the Lao Institute of Certified Public Accountants
                         (LIPCA) will be strengthened to enable it to properly regulate the profession (including the provision
                         and monitoring of compliance with continuing education requirements). Support will also be
                         provided to several education institutions to implement an accounting syllabus that meets the
                         requirements of the International Education Standards set by IFAC.

                         To break the log jam in our previous engagement with the GOL on procurement, the project is
                         considering several approaches. The procurement diagnostic initially applied to the procurement
                         process preliminarily identified various bottlenecks to reform and three levels of possible entry
                         points for engagement – (1) strengthening central agencies oversight roles; (2) strengthening the
                         capacity of provincial governments to manage public investment projects on demand; and (3) where
                         supported by governors, providing support to community monitoring mechanisms. The Procurement
                         Monitoring Office (PrMO) has limited ability to ensure the implementation of procurement rules; it
                         lacks both the skills and the management clout/support to fulfill its oversight mandate. Similarly, the
                         SAO does not have the necessary skills to conduct procurement audits and reviews. While the project
                         plans to provide support to both institutions, further discussions with GOL are needed to determine
                         the feasibility of reorienting the PrMO’s responsibilities towards supporting line ministries and
                         provincial governments and to ensure meaningful procurement outcomes. In light of de facto
                         decentralization of procurement with limited central oversight, the project will take the opportunity
                         to adopt the new PREM strategy by engaging sectors (namely, health and education) to assess what

                         can be done at the provincial level to strengthen capacity for planning, procuring and supervising
                         public investments. Whereas some provinces have developed substantial capacity, other mainly
                         small provinces have significant capacity gaps for planning public investment projects, handling the
                         procurement process and for supervising contractors during project implementation. This lack of
                         capacity is seen to lead to poor contract performance, such as maintenance work that does not meet
                         specifications. Support to procurement under the project will be defined further by deepening the
                         procurement diagnostic analysis and reaching agreement with the GOL on activities for the
                         component.

                         The external oversight function (component 3) can play a crucial role in reinforcing improvements to
                         budget planning and execution by holding the Executive to account. The project will work with the
                         National Assembly (NA) to enable the institution to better ensure that the budget is planned and
                         managed to reflect national priorities. This will be complemented by assistance to the State Audit
                         Organization (SAO) to help it fulfill its mandate of reducing waste and inefficiencies in budget
                         execution. Both these organizations can help oversee progress in the agreed PFM reform program.

                         Assistance to the NA will be primarily targeted towards the Economic, Planning and Financing
                         Committee given that a key part of their mandate is to oversee the socio-economic plan and budget.
                         Policy support will be provided to enhance the awareness and capacity of NA Members in the areas
                         of (i) the relationship between the Committee and the SAO through peer learning and networking,
                         (ii) a series of awareness seminars for members on issues such as natural resource management,
                         financial sector oversight and other policy issues, and (iii) participation in the annual global
                         legislative audit program through the global and/or regional sharing of experience. Core technical

                         skills of staff will be built by providing training/support for economic, financial and budget analysis
                         in addition to other cross – capacity building opportunities provided under the new project.

                         The SAO component will continue supporting the capacity development component of the SAO’s
                         Action Plan Implementation Program. The Action plan was developed jointly with the EU and ADB
                         based on the recommendations of a peer review conducted by the New Zealand Audit Office. More
                         specifically, the project will continue assisting developing the capacity of the SAO: (i)
                         implementation of the SAO’s ICT strategy; (ii) putting in place the professional development
                         strategy that includes a modern risk based audit methodology, the update of auditing standards and
                         manuals and development of a quality assurance function; (iii) implementation of a the workforce
                         development plan to ensure the SAO has the right mix of skills and expertise; (iv) providing
                         resources and technical assistance to enable the SAO staff better understand key PFM reforms
                         including accounting and auditing and international accounting standard requirements.

                         All three project components will be augmented by an overarching institutional strengthening and
                         capacity building component (component 4). A comprehensive functional analysis of the MOF will
                         be carried out jointly with the Personnel Department with a view to enhancing understanding of all
                         functions, improving division of labor within and the organization structure. The analysis will
                         recommend dedicated organizational homes for important functions and tasks - if currently they are
                         split among too many organizational units, or are not carried out by any unit - and will remove
                         indentified functional overlaps. A revised organization structure will be proposed (if necessary), a
                         set of detailed conceptual frameworks will be developed for each function and TORs will be revised/
                         developed for each organizational unit. The success of this piece of work will rely upon the
                         identification of a consultant who both understands functional analyses, but critically is able to work
                         with departments to undertake this work, so that the end product has broad consensus and authorities
                         understand how such work is conducted.

                         Capacity building and skills training will also be comprehensive: looking at leadership, management
                         as well as sector specific technical skills and basic cross-cutting skills .To modernize thinking and
                         build acceptance for reforms it is vital that the MOF management act as ‘change agents’ in what is a
                         particularly hierarchical working culture in Lao. Leadership training for MOF management
                         (Minister/VM/DGs) and an emerging leadership course for the DDG's will be important for changing
                         the working culture and the perceived role of the Ministry of Finance over time. In addition, there
                         will be a management training and development program which will consist of short, skills-based
                         modules to be delivered on the job. A comprehensive Skills Needs Analysis for sector-specific skills
                         will be also carried out, followed by the design and delivery of a multi-year training program. Such
                         a study will also help to identify basic PFM skills gaps and training needs that cut across functions
                         and institutions (MOF, MOHA, MPI, NA, and SAO). Running in tandem will be a capacity building
                         operation for the Institute of Economics and Finance. In this program, much attention will be paid to
                         coordination and collaboration with the National University of Laos.
