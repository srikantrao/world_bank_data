                              The revised PDO is (i) to increase agricultural productivity of poor rural households in all districts of Malawi; (ii) to strengthen institutional capacity
                              for long-term irrigation development; and (iii) to facilitate early emergency response.

Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed additional financing forms part of an emergency response package to the Government of Malawi (GoM), which has embarked on
                              difficult economic reforms. The AF II for IRLADP responds to GoM’s request dated April 26, 2012, to: (i) upscale a number of its activities from 11
                              to 28 districts; (ii) consolidate project achievements and successes; (iii) prepare a future irrigation investment framework; and (iv) extend project
                              duration beyond its current closing date of June 30, 2012. The proposed IRLADP AF II is consistent with the parameters of OP/BP 8.0 and OP/BP
                              13.20 related to emergency AF operations. The overall project strategy is to support growth-oriented agricultural development by working with the
                              capable poor. In line with the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDSII), the principal target group for this project is the
                              economically active rural poor. The original project had 4 components: (i) Irrigation Rehabilitation and Development and Catchment Conservation;
                              (ii) Farmer Services and Livelihood Fund; (iii) Institutional Development and Community Mobilization; and (iv) Project Coordination, Monitoring and
                              Evaluation. Under AF II, the project will include a fifth component – (v) Contingent Financing. This component will allow for rapid response in
                              future emergencies.
                              The proposed IRLADP AF II (P131760) would help finance the costs associated with scaling up the community-driven development (CDD) element
                              of the project through enhanced demand-driven rural public works programs to create more community assets and build community resilience to
                              help cushion the rural poor while difficult economic reforms are undertaken. These activities are envisaged to be scaled-up from 11 original
                              districts to all 28 districts in Malawi. In addition, the AF II will provide support to: (i) consolidating the project’s gains, institutionalizing and improving
                              water management in rehabilitated and constructed irrigation schemes under the parent project, improving in-field water management, rice
                              agronomy and strengthening cooperatives, and input and output marketing arrangements in the value chain; and (ii) preparing an investment
                              framework for future investments including technical, environmental, social and financial feasibility studies and designs for potential future
                              investments.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project's scaled up activities will support smallholder farmers in all 28 districts in Malawi, this is a scale up from the original 11 districts. The
                              proposed changes will not affect the project’s outcome indicators, except for the targets, which are revised to reflect the upwards change due to
                              the scaling up. New activities do not trigger any additional safeguards policies, and the scope of activities is covered under the ESMF, PMP and
                              RPF developed for the Project.

                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                   The original IRLADP and the first Additional Financing were classified as a Category B with respect to the environmental and social
                                 considerations of the project investment and in line with World Bank policies. The expected adverse environmental and social impacts to be
                                 generated by the addition of this second additional financing is expected to be minimal, site specific and manageable to an acceptable level.
                                 The impacts are similar to those mentioned in the original project, as the project activities are within the same scope as those in the original
                                 project.
                                 Potential environmental impacts that may be generated by the AF investments include:
                                 (i)        Soil degradation due to intensification within and around irrigation schemes;
                                 (ii)       Siltation of water courses due to potential increase in soil erosion which is more likely to contribute towards flooding, if not well
                                 managed;
                                 (iii)      Drainage challenges resulting from poor water management leading to inundation; and
                                 (iv)       Water contamination due to exposure to agro- chemicals;

                                   Potential social impacts of the AF activities include:
                                 (i) Loss of grazing land for local people surrounding the irrigation schemes, since the schemes have been out of use for long, leading to
                                 changes in grazing patterns for livestock;
                                 (ii) Conflicts over land use and ownership in the schemes and for CDD activities; and,
                                 (iii) Disruption of footpaths, roads and other community facilities due to the rehabilitation and protection of the irrigation schemes and other
                                 assets.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  No potential indirect and long-term impacts are anticipated.
                                                                                                                                                                            Page 2 of 4
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                            N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                             The proposed AF, is not expected to generate significant adverse environmental and social impacts. For the original IRLAD project, the
                           Borrower prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), including a Pest Management Plan (PMP) and a

                           Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address the environmental and social concerns triggered by World Bank safeguard policies. These
                           safeguard frameworks detail: (i) systematization of environmental and social screening for all identified sub-project types; (ii) procedures for
                           conducting sub-project specific EIAs, limited or full and RAPs as applicable; (iii) a template for developing sub-project specific environmental
                           and social management plans;(iv) capacity strengthening and awareness raising campaigns targeted at relevant project stakeholder groups to
                           improve implementation and monitoring of the projects safeguard policy measures; (v) establishment and implementation of a consultation
                           framework for issues like land user rights and ownership, soil and water conservation, water management and environmental control and
                           monitoring; (vi) reinforcement of coordination meetings of harmonization and consultation among all stakeholders ; and, (vii) delineation of
                           attributes, roles and responsibilities of all relevant project stakeholders.

                           The Bank has determined that the Borrower has weak institutional capacity to effectively address both environmental and social safeguards
                           concerns especially at the district level. An assessment at MTR discussed the current legal, regulatory and institutional framework within which
                           the project is implemented along with short-comings and measures designed to strengthen implementation of and the proposed mitigation
                           measures for potential environmental and social project impacts. Institutional arrangements for implementing agreed social and environmental
                           mitigation measures have been clearly discussed with the Borrower to ensure that the projects safeguards policy concerns are thoroughly
                           addressed through screening, selection, planning, construction and operation processes of AF activities. Since then, the project has
                           implemented an action plan including capacity needs assessment and training to ensure that the environmental and social safeguards are
                           complied with. The project will also use short term consultants to boost capacity for safeguards measures implementation where necessary. All
                           ESMPs created under the project are disclosed in-country and in the InfoShop.

                           The project already anticipated and developed a mitigation plan for the potential social issues that might have arisen due to the implementation
                           of the project. Among others, these include: (i) possible conflicts among upstream and downstream users along irrigation schemes; (ii)
                           beneficiary participation in scheme design, operations and maintenance; (iii) the scope of the irrigation management transfers; and (iv) counter-
                           claims on land ownership within the schemes. Based on the assessment and subsequent action plan, Land and Water agreements on the
                           irrigation schemes between land owners and irrigators organized in WUAs, as well as for FBOs have been drawn up at district and community
                           level to formalize previously informal voluntary arrangements dealing with access to land and water for the irrigation schemes. To date, there
                           have not been instances of involuntary resettlement and therefore no formal resettlement action plans (RAPs) were developed as provided for
                           under the resettlement policy framework (RPF). A list of the Land and Water agreements developed under the project has been being disclosed
                           at the InfoShop as well as in-country. A framework has also been developed for the Government to offer land leases to WUAs and FBOs to
                           avoid future land conflicts and competing claims.

                           The capacity needs assessment was undertaken and trainings were conducted for national and district level staff, and where necessary more
                           training may be undertaken. Currently documentation and compliance with Environmental Safeguards is Satisfactory.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.

                             The key stakeholder groups include: Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Lands, Department of Environmental Affairs, other relevant
                           Government Agencies, the private sector, NGOs, the 28 districts and other local institutions and rural smallholder communities. These
                           stakeholders play different roles in the project ranging from project execution to active participation as beneficiaries. These were all consulted in
                           the first phase of the project and especially during the preparation of the project ESMF and RPF. Both documents have now been disclosed in
                           country.

                           In-country disclosure process involved: (i) sending the ESMF and RPF report summaries to various District Assemblies, District Agricultural
                           Development Offices, Irrigation Schemes and Traditional Authorities in the districts and particular areas affected by the project; and, (ii) Press
                           releases summarizing project goals and objectives, methodology utilized and findings of the assessment studies carried and modalities for
                           accessing the reports and summaries in-country. Copies of the safeguard reports could be obtained from the Department of Environmental
                           Affairs. Copies of summaries are available for access and collection by the public at no cost.

                           The recommendations of these safeguards frameworks were reflected in the original Project Implementation Manual (PIM) and the
                           environmental mitigation plan and costs and the institutional capacity strengthening with respect to safeguard aspects were reflected in the
                           original project Financing Agreement. The AF will adopt and apply the same safeguard tools (except for the revisions mentioned above). The
                           AF has the same project category B rating and triggers the same safeguard policies as the original IRLAD project.

                           Since the consultations for the parent project happened a long time ago, and the proposed AF will finance the same original activities but in
                           different areas it is necessary to consult stakeholders and potentially affected people early during project implementation. These consultations
                           and trainings of frontline staff in communication and implementation of safeguards policies are budgeted for under the Additional Financing.
