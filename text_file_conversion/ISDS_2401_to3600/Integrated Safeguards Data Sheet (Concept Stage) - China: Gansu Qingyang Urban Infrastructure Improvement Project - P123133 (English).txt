                              (1)      Component 1: Urban Infrastructure Improvement, and
                              (2)      Component 2: Institutional Capacity Building

                              The proposed physical investments under the component 1 include the following four sub-components:

                              a.          Urban Bypass Road Construction of (i) the southern section of the city#s west freight traffic by-pass (West Ring Road, 2.57 km with
                              width of 60 meters) with associated pipe works, and (ii) the northern section of the city#s east freight traffic by-pass (East Ring Road, 1.9 km with
                              width of 60 meters) with associated pipe works. Cost of this component is estimated at about 42% of the Project cost
                              b.          Integrated Road Corridor Improvement of three selected primary roads in Xifeng: West Ring Road, South and North Avenue, and
                              Anding Road. Civil works include pavement, traffic channelization, lighting and greening, along with drainage and sewage system improvements.
                              Cost of this component is estimated at about 5% of the Project cost.
                              c.          Drainage and Sewage Pipes, including (i) constructing drainage and sewer mains for the middle section of West Ring Road (3.6km), (ii)
                              constructing drainage and sewer mains for a section of Anding East Road (0.6km), , (iii) constructing drainage and sewer mains for a section of
                              Anding West Road (1.8km), constructing sewage collection system in Xifeng's western area, and (iv) rehabilitation of sewer collection pipes in
                              Xifeng#s build-up area, associated civil works of road pavement improvement, street lighting and landscaping for these roads. Cost of this
                              component is estimated at about 19% of the Project cost.
                              d.          Wastewater Treatment Plant construction of (i) a new Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Xifeng's eastern area (capacity of 20,000
                              m3/day), (ii) a wastewater pump station in Xifeng's northern area (capacity of 11,500 m3/day), and (iii) associated trunk wastewater collectors.
                              Cost of this component is estimated at about 19% of the Project cost.

                              Component 2 will include four sub-components of (i) a water resource management study (ii) O&M improvement of urban infrastructure services
                              for sector of urban wastewater management and urban road/transport system,(iii) capacity building and training for local governmental agencies,
                              and (iv) project management and supervision assistance consulting service to PMO. Cost of this component is estimated about 3% of the Project
                              cost.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will be located in Xifeng District, Qingyang Municipality, which is in the east of Gansu province bordering Shaanxi Province in the east
                              and north, and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the west. Xifeng District is the only urban district of the Qingyang Municipality which was
                              developed over last two decades as the center of local governmental agencies, commerce and industry, public services and residential housing.
                              The key industry inside the Xifeng District includes food processing and petrochemical processing. There are no national level significance
                              physical culture properties inside the district.
                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Gansu province has ongoing Bank supported projects. Qingyang Municipality, though new to the Bank projects, has established a Project Leading
                           Group at the municipal level to oversee and coordinate the preparation and implementation of the Project. This Leading Group is chaired by a Vice
                           Mayor with officials from a number of governmental agencies. In addition Qingyang has established a project management office (PMO) with 14
                           full-time staff, including four administrator and managerial persons, six engineers and technicians, and four secretarial and supporting staff. For
                           project preparation, Qingyang PMO has engaged a French consulting firm with extensive experience in preparing Bank projects to prepare the

                           consolidated feasibility study report. The safeguarded documents such as EA and RAP reports will be prepared by the professional institutions with
                           the required qualification and adequate experiences on Bank projects in China. Qingyang PMO will receive necessary trainings on project
                           management and Bank safeguard polices in the early stage of preparation. Although the capacity is not sufficient at this moment, Qingyang PMO
                           and involved local agencies are willing to strengthen their capacity through the special training programs organized regularly by the Ministry of
                           Finance and the Bank and on-the-job training by working with the external safeguards consultants. The timely interaction between the Bank#s
                           task team and Qingyang PMO will also ensure this capacity will be strengthened properly during project preparation.
