Public Disclosure Copy




                              A.         Concept
                              The project will fund the key mechanisms for the pre- start-up, start-up and very early growth stages of an enterprise. Currently, the biggest
                              funding gap lies in the initial stages preceding full commercialization. This is a period of high risk, wherea significant number of start-ups and new
                              ideas emerge but only a few survive. Lack of innovation is an obvious reason for the failure of new product developments and start-ups as well as
                              the lack of skills by innovators and dormant entrepreneurs to start a business. However, many of these ventures also fail due to lack of resources,
                              technical know-how and training support. These factors are critical in allowing companies to further improve and refine their products to the point
                              where they attract the necessary financing not only to survive, but to prosper. The high risk nature of these early stages, and the level of
                              investment needed for product development and enterprise growth, require government intervention and funding. This intervention will be needed
                              to establish the initial structures, and a critical mass of market agents, investors and successful SMEs. The private sector will then be able to step
                              in, leverage the established structures and sustain the financing and training/mentoring linkages through the long term.

                              The Government of Lebanon has requested support from the WB to develop a project to enhance the ecosystem infrastructure to promote
                              innovation, competitiveness and growth of private sector firms in Lebanon. The proposed project will consist of a Funding facility which will provide
                              two types of funding. The process will engage private sector investors, including national, regional and international Venture Capital funds, and
                              industry experts and entrepreneurs from among the diaspora. The activities are detailed below:

                              Development grant (in the amounts of approximately US$15,000 each): Potential entrepreneurs with a new business idea will be invited to apply
                              for a small grant to help them develop their innovative concept. The grant will fund the collection of evidence and the building of a case for external
                              investment in their business, along with an assessment of the key areas of risk. The outcome will be an improvement in the ability of the potential
                              entrepreneur to demonstrate the value of their proposed business idea, and the conversion of the idea into a business ready for investment. The
                              grants will be provided in two phases: a small grant of up to $5000 during the first phase which would allow the entrepreneur to begin working on a
                              proof of concept, and a larger second phase grant of up to $10,000 which would enable the entrepreneur to work closely with VCs to prepare the
                              enterprise for possible early stage VC financing. The outreach to potential entrepreneurs will be conducted via incubators, universities, national
                              and regional chambers of commerce, business and professional associations, municipalities and NGOs. These organizations will be invited to
                              participate by helping their clients in the application process. A program to leverage partnerships and fund targeted assistance to potential
                              entrepreneurs and students who have creative ideas but lack the skills and entrepreneurial knowledge to get them to a proposal stage will be
                              integrated to increase the base of potential concepts and start-ups entering the pipeline needed to achieve a critical mass.

                              Equity Investment (in the amounts of up to US$1,500,000): Potential entrepreneurs, both as part of the stages covered by the development grant
                              above and others seeking growth financing, will be encouraged to meet with venture funds to ensure the evidence they have assembled, or their
                              business plan, will address the investors' information needs, and truly demonstrate that the entrepreneur is investment ready. To qualify for the
                           equity investment financing, the entrepreneur must first have approached a potential investor with the completed business idea, and received from
                           them a commitment to invest in the new venture. Having acquired this commitment, the venture investor or the entrepreneur can then approach
                           the project Funding facility to seek a matching investment that will share the initial venture fund's risk, and add to the capital available to the new
                           business. The scheme relies on the efforts of partner VC funds both to identify and promote new business projects and to provide the active
                           mentoring and professional inputs that characterize truly effective VC participation in successful investments. VCs will therefore be screened to
                           ensure that they enjoy a reputation of active participation, and have a proven track record of mentoring and support.

                           An Investment Committee (IC) will be appointed to make the decisions for the awarding of the equity investments. The criteria for the IC role and
                           its members will be developed and described in the project operational manual and will ensure that: the IC can make full independent decisions
                           based on the commercial viability of the propos als; it is diverse; does not allow capture of political and sectarian interests; and addresses
                           potential conflict of interest. Members will be acting in their personal capacities and will be constituted of high status individuals (from Lebanon, the
                           MENA regi on, from the Diaspora around the world as well as international experts) who have direct and relevant business experience and whose
                           participation will reassure VC and investor partners of the serious intent behind these proposals and good governance of the funding facility.

                           The design and governance features of the proposed Fund will ensure that it complies with the Bank’s OP 8.30 guidelines as well as with the legal
                           requirements governing Kafalat and the government's mandates and operational structures in Lebanon.

                           Institutional set up and implementation:

                           The project government counterpart will be the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET) who is in the processing of setting up a Small and Medium
                           Enterprise (SME) Observatory unit to support and monitor all projects and initiatives to assist SMEs in their development and access to financing.
                           The implementation of the grant and equity funding activities will be done by Kafalat a quasi government agency that operates a national credit
                           guarantee scheme .

                           Project implementation and oversight/ monitoring mechanism:

                           A Project Steering Committee will be created to oversee the project and provide strategic guidance and monitoring in accordance to the project
                           operations manual and national development objectives. The MOET will Chair the Steering Committee which will include representatives from
                           other key ministries and agencies that have related work as well as some NGOs that support the broader ecosystem. The project SC will:
                           Represent the GOL
                           -Give strategic guidance to implementation in accordance to national objectives

                           The project will include mechanisms for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of development indicators. A preliminary M&E is outlined in Annex IV. of
                           the PCN. The framework will build on the results sought from each component and develop indicators to assess accomplishments against the
                           development objectives. The design of the M&E framework will be in proportion to the relatively modest loan size, and driven by the need for the
                           appropriate M&E capacity. Annex IV details some preliminary indicators being proposed as a starting point for discussions with the counterparts.
