2. Project Objectives:

       The project development objectives are to: (i) improve the climate resilience of the West
Coast Road; and (ii) enhance local capacity to develop a more climate resilience road network.

3. Project Description:

       The West Coast Road (WCR) is a key infrastructure component of the Samoa Economic
Corridor. It provides a vital land transport link between Apia, Faleolo International Airport and
Mulifanua inter-island ferry wharf. The road runs parallel, and occasionally adjacent to, the
coast. It is vulnerable to high rainfall events (leading to surface flooding and deterioration of the
road surface), and extreme high sea levels (leading to accelerated erosion of the road profile). In
addition, the road surface is compromised, particularly at its eastern end, by a high water table,
which contributes to deterioration of the road pavement.

        Under the Second Infrastructure Asset Management Project (SIAM-2), technical
assistance was provided to carry out a detailed feasibility study to upgrade the drainage of the
WCR to increase its resilience to extreme weather events. The Enhancing Climate Resilience of
the West Coast Road Project (CRWCR) will implement the study’s findings and extend the
works to include a general rehabilitation of the road profile and surface in the affected areas

       The proposed project comprises three components as described below:

Component 1: (US$15.70 million) Improving Climate Resilience of the WCR.

        Proposed works under this component will improve the West Coast Road (WCR)
pavement by raising and strengthening, where necessary, sealing shoulders, improving
longitudinal and cross drainage, and associated costs for drainage easements. These investments
will serve to: (a) reduce road closures during extreme weather events and high sea levels; (b)
avoid surface flooding and impounding of water, which contributes to road deterioration and
adversely impacts roadside communities; (c) reduce road deterioration due to runoff and
increasingly high water tables, and generally improve pavement quality to reduce future
maintenance requirements; and (d) contribute to increased road safety by providing a roadside
pathway for pedestrians and dedicated bus stops and facilities.

        The proposed construction works on the WCR will address these recommendations of the
drainage study by making improvements to the road pavement, including raising and
strengthening where necessary; sealing the road shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross-
drainage.

All road reconstruction works are planned to take place within the existing road reserve, but the
need to access roadside properties to complete the associated drainage works was identified in
the SIAM2 study.

Technical assistance will also be included in this component for the detailed design and
supervision of the WCR works. This will mitigate capacity and delivery quality risk to project
implementation.

Component 2: (US$0.80 million) Vulnerability Assessment of the Samoa Road Network.

         Although the WCR is the main focus of the CRWCR, many other links of the Samoa
road network share similar vulnerability issues, in particular: (i) coastal exposure to sea level
rise; (ii) storm surge; (iii) wave action during cyclones and tsunamis; (iv) inland flooding and
landslips during extreme rainfall events; (v) earthquake damage; and (vi) accelerated pavement
deterioration due to extreme weather and rising water tables in some locations.

        This component involves technical assistance designed to bring about transformative
change in the way that climate change is addressed in the Samoa roads sector. The assistance
will assess the climate change and disaster vulnerability of the main road network of Samoa as a
whole, and prepare a climate resilience/adaptation strategy for the road network. This will
involve using best available climate change and natural hazard risk information to identify key
hazard types and risk levels (sea level rise, tropical cyclones, extreme rainfall and temperature
events, tsunami, etc), and then assessing the likely severity and timing of risk impacts for all
links of the major road network. In particular, the analysis will use latest results from the Pacific
Climate Change Science Program and the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing
Initiative. Based on this analysis, the study will then prepare a road network adaptation strategy
that will (a) outline a general climate change adaptation policy framework and objectives for the
road network; (b) identify and prioritize specific locations that require investments to improve
the resilience of the road network; (c) identify and define specific measures to update design and
planning standards and maintenance procedures taking into account expected climate change;
and (d) review the institutional and legal framework and recommend specific reforms required to
facilitate climate change resilience in the roads sector from infrastructure and operational
perspectives.

Component 3: (US$0.74 million) Project Management.

         Recognizing the current work load of the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the size and
significance of the proposed project, and following the satisfactory arrangements of SIAM-2 and
the PTRP, technical assistance for project management will be provided under the project. A
PMU would assist with the preparation of procurement documentation, financial management
arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation of results and indicators. Incremental operating
costs associated with LTA’s costs to carry out adequate management and supervision of project
activities would also be financed under this component.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

       The CRWCR will be implemented along the West Coast Road from Faleolo International
Airport to Apia. The technical assistance components will be carried out throughout Samoa.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

        Rehabilitation of the West Coast Road will involve road carriageway improvements,
pavement rehabilitation, and improvements of drainage and road shoulders, among others. There
will be no new road openings. Rehabilitation work will be limited to within the existing road
right of way. The rehabilitation of the existing road may have some adverse impacts on the
physical environment, communities along the road and the public using the road. These impacts
are mostly construction related, such as increased dust, noise and traffic congestion. These are
typical impacts associated with construction activities, which are local, temporary and can be
mitigated through proper measures. Consultations with the communities in the area, have
identified issues of concern to the stakeholders, including the importance of preserving
community bathing pools along the road. The operation of quarry sites as a source of materials
will also have potential negative impacts on the environment, if not managed properly.

        Only minor impact on land acquisition is expected with the CRWCR. Aside from the
fact that most activities will happen within the legal road reserve, the settlement pattern is Samoa
is generally many meters away from the road. Concrete fences and other developments made of
permanent building materials are not common. The impact would be minor land take and
temporary disruption due to construction of drainage discharge runoff to the coast. During
consultations with various groups, attendees acknowledged and accepted that improved drainage
run off would benefit both the road users and owners of flood prone areas over the long-term.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
        The long-term impact of the proposed improvements to the road is mostly positive.
Having a climate resilient road will ensure that the country’s most important transport corridor
would be more resilient to climate events and remain open more of the time. Faster travel times
and a more reliable connection between the airport and the capital Apia will have economic and
personal benefits to the community. Improvement of the sidewalks and bus stops will also
improve safety along the road. Better road conditions will lead to increased travel speed of
vehicles which may have consequences on safety of motorists and pedestrians. Construction
related impacts from civil works will be short-term and temporary.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

       Not applicable.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

        An Environmental Code of Practice (ECOP) has been prepared for the project to mitigate
the impacts of construction-related activities during construction. This ECOP will be included in
works contracts and contractors will be obligated to comply with the guidance in the ECOP
during construction and implementation of the project. Impacts identified during the community
consultations and impacts related to quarry sites have also been included in the ECOP. The cost
of implementing the mitigating measures embodied in the ECOP will be part of the overall
project cost of the winning contractors. The Planning and Urban Management Agency (PUMA)
and the LTA will monitor compliance of the contractor/s with the ECOP. An Information
Education Campaign will also be carried out by the LTA after completion of the road to educate
the stakeholders regarding safety rules and proper road safety.

        A Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework (LARF) was prepared for the CRWCR.
This was discussed during several consultations with multiple stakeholders. The Bank reviewed
the LARF and found it to be compliant to OP 4.12. The LTA/PUMA has also demonstrated
adequate knowledge and skills in implementing resettlement action plans through an ongoing
Bank project (SIAM-2). The Government will provide funds for any compensation payments, as
well as other activities associated with resettlement.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key project stakeholders include the LTA, PUMA, Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment, and other government entities expected to have specific roles in the
implementation of the project. Stakeholders from the communities are residents and village
leaders, Matais (heads of families) and representatives of non government organizations. Samoa
has a very complex system of consultation and it is guided by written and oral guidelines
sensitive to their culture. The Samoa Codes of Environmental Practice, dated April 2007, strictly
prescribes acceptable procedures for carrying out consultations. For this project a series of
consultations were carried out, as summarized in the following table:
            Dates                           Venue                         Participants

        The results of the consultations showed strong support for the CRWCR, and suggestions
for better design and implementations were provided by participants, particularly in the area of
safety and land acquisition. Documentation of these consultations is annexed to the LARF and
has been disclosed on the websites of the LTA and MNRE, and at the InfoShop in Washington,
DC.

       The ECOP was disclosed locally on the websites of the Land Transport Authority and the
Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, and in the Bank’s InfoShop.
