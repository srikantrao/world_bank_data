                              10.        This Project aims at assisting the Government to lessen the potential impact of ongoing reforms on poor and vulnerable households by
                              providing temporary work in urban areas and protecting the human capital in rural areas. The project also aims at laying the foundations for a more
                              stable, effective and fiscally sustainable safety net system capable of protecting the most vulnerable of the society but also increasing people#s
                              resilience to shocks and promoting asset creation. Such a system should be able to expand and shrink depending on emerging needs with clear
                              exiting strategies to avoid long term dependence.

                              C. Project Description

                              The project will be implemented as a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) for a period of four years. The operation will comprise the following four
                              components: i) a labor intensive public works program in urban areas targeted at youth to build or rehabilitate critical urban infrastructure and
                              create short-term employment; (ii) a school feeding program in rural areas to stimulate human capital accumulation among children; iii) a pilot cash
                              transfer to mitigate against shocks such as energy and food price increase to targeted population- this pilot would be scaled-up based on lessons
                              learned during the testing phase-; iv) project management aimed at supporting the operational units of the program in the establishment of key
                              elements of a safety net system (e.g. targeting mechanisms, payment methods, management and information systems, design of impact
                              evaluations etc.).

                              Total IDA allocation for the proposed Guinea Social Safety Net Project is currently US$10 million. The Project team is also seeking the possibility
                              of accessing up to US$14 million from HIPC resources, while the Government of Guinea may also provide counterpart financing but it is yet to be
                              determined. The European Union has recently signed an agreement with the GoG under its 10th FED (Fonds Europeen de Developpement) to
                              support the public work component of the PDU program among other things. The financial envelope allocated to the component amounts to Euro
                              3.150 million. The Bank is seeking to further leverage resources from other partners. Efforts are under way with the United Nations' Peace building
                              Fund, African Development Bank, Islamic Development Bank, bilateral donors and the private sector in particular the mining industry, in order to
                              increase the pool of funds. Securing additional sources of financing will be critical for increasing the program scale and scope.

                              Component 1: Labor intensive public work program with a focus on youth in urban areas- Preparatory diagnostic work indicated that urban
                              households tend to have high vulnerability to food price fluctuations. The share of food items, mainly purchased, is very high across income groups
                              in urban areas (over 62% of total expenditure on average). Furthermore, the presence of large cohort of idle youth in major urban centers presents
                              a serious risk to the countries stability. Public work programs are good instruments to provide income and protect household purchasing power
                              from increased commodity prices and can also build assets at the community level in particular in low income areas. They are an important
                              counter-cyclical safety net instrument used in diverse country circumstances at different points in time in both middle income and low income
                              countries. They can also work as a bridge to labor-intensive short-term employment and asset creation instrument in the presence of covariate and
                              idiosyncratic shocks. This component will build on lessons learned from the emergency operation undertaken under the Bank's PDU (Projet de
                              Developpement Urbain) to mitigate the impact of the 2008 fuel and food price crisis, and has been rated moderately successful as of April 2011.
                              The PDU has had good results with the emergency operation achieving a labor cost ratio of over 60% and a very high ratio of youth employed.
                              This compone nt will finance small and micro-projects that will be determined in consultation with local populations in selected urban centers.
                              Public work interventions would also be useful instruments for rural areas and the project will look into the possibility of expanding its coverage. It
                              is expected that rural areas would continue to benefit from other programs such as the WFP food for work in Guinea Forestiere, the national
                              program for rural infrastructure (PNIR), the Village Communities Support Program (PCAV) to name a few, which have a comparative advantage in
                           dealing with the specific nature of vulnerability in rural areas. The pre-appraisal mission will investigate implementation modalities (allocation of
                           costs versus labor, modalities to select projects to be implemented, targeting mechanisms etc.).

                           Component 2: School feeding programs in rural areas-Preparatory diagnostic work indicated that about one third of rural households are food
                           insecure. Although agro-ecological conditions of Guinea are much better than many neighboring countries, the subsistence and low productivity
                           nature of agricultural practices makes rural population vulnerable to even mild shocks. Furthermore, survey data showed that the coping measures
                           of rural population can have long lasting and potentially irreversible damage in particular among children. Large proportion of households reduces

                           the amount and quality of food intake in the case of shocks. School feeding programs are among the instruments that can help protect and build
                           the human capital. They are part of Government's responses to chronic food insecurity and shocks and they can also work as a source of human
                           capital accumulation by promoting school attendance and enhance learning outcomes. This component will work with WFP to build up on their
                           programs drawing on most recent lessons on what works and what does not work both from the Guinea program and from other countries with
                           similar context. The WFP is the largest implementer of school feeding programs in the world. In 2008, globally, it reached an average of 22 million
                           children in school in around 70 countries. An independent review of the WFP The Guinea program indicated that the areas where the school
                           feeding program operated registered a higher Gross Enrollment Rate (71% in 2007) than the national average for rural areas (60%); an increased
                           number of pupils of 15 to 20% per year; an increased attendance from 88 to 93% for girls in 2008; and an increased girls/boys ratio from 42 to
                           46% in 2009. WFP's program in Guinea is finishing this year and the new safety net project will help bridge this gap. It is expected that this
                           component will be funded from HIPC resources.

                           Component 3: Pilot cash transfer program- Preparatory diagnostic work indicated Guinea largely relies on general price subsidies to help poor and
                           vulnerable populations. These are regressive, very expensive and difficult to remove once in place. Other targeted safety net interventions are
                           more effective. Public work and school feeding programs cited above have limitations as they will not reach certain groups who may be affected by
                           sudden shocks whether covariate or idiosyncratic. The project will explore the feasibility of innovative targeted cash transfer programs within the
                           context of Guinea where there is no prior experience on this type of intervention. A consultant will be recruited to conduct a feasibility study on
                           cash transfers. Recommendations from this study would inform the specific design of this component, relative to targeting approaches and
                           methodologies, payment systems, amount of cash to be disbursed, periodicity, implementation mechanisms and possible soft Conditionalities.

                           Component 4: Capacity building and project management - The Fund for Social Development and Solidarity (FSDS) under the Ministry of Social
                           Affairs, Women and Children Development will be the lead agency for the project. The newly created FSDS, which is administratively and
                           financially an autonomous institution, has no proven track record of project implementation. To address this limitation and to be able to respond to
                           the GoG's need for urgent intervention to support the reform agenda, the project proposes that FSDS signs agreements with existing institutions
                           that have proven record in the implementation i.e. the public work program would be implemented by the same PIU the PDU3 is using and the
                           school feeding program would be implemented through WFP. Because of lack of experience in cash transfer programs in Guinea, the project
                           proposes to use an international NGO to implement the pilot cash transfer. It is important however, to strengthen the government institutional
                           capacity in order to formulate appropriate social protection policies, to monitor implementation, and to empirically evaluate impact.

                           Affairs, Women and Children Development. The FSDS has no experience with safeguards policies. However, its capacity will be strengthened
                           throughout project preparation and implementation to ensure proper implementation of the ESMF and the RPF. Component 2 on the labor
                           intensive public works, which is the basis of the triggering of OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) will be implemented by the Project

                           safeguards policy. The safeguards instruments of PDU III (ESMF and RPF) will be revised and updated for the proposed project. Environmental
                           and Social Management Plans and/or Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared as and when necessary during implementation.
