2. Project Objectives
The primary objective of the overall Roads and Bridges Management and Maintenance
Program (RBMMP), is to stimulate growth and contribute to poverty reduction through
improved road infrastructure, better sector policies, and enhanced roads sector
management. More specifically by (i) improving the coverage and conditions of roads
and bridges in the territory of the Recipient; (ii) strengthening the Recipient's institutional
capacity to manage and administer the road sector; (iii) establishing financing
mechanisms for road maintenance; (iv) promoting the use of local resources in roads
construction and management; and (v) improving road transport safety. The project
development objective of this phase of the APL is to improve access of the population to
all-season roads through maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of the classified road
network. The indicators to assess the achievement of the PDO are (i) the percentage of
classified roads in good and fair condition, and (ii) the percentage of the rural population
within 2 km of an all-season road. Intermediate outcomes have been defined as follows:
(a) improved road sector management capacity; (b) enhanced execution of the road
maintenance program; and (c) timely and cost-effective implementation of the IDA
financed rehabilitation and upgrading of sections of the National Road N1.

3. Project Description
7.     The additional Project activities will include the following. Only category (i) is
relevant to safeguards issues.

  (i)   Emergency related works: Cyclones, tropical depressions and heavy rains hit
Mozambique in December 2011, January 2012 and March 2012 devastating part of the
country and affecting different types of infrastructure including road infrastructure in
seven provinces which have a population of about 17 million. The damage to bridges and
road infrastructure in these provinces, which are currently limiting movement of people
and goods, need urgent repair to restore the normal life of the affected population.
Specifically, one bridge, three drifts and twenty four sections of various roads are
targeted for emergency repairs;

 (ii) Road Safety and Axle Load Control: This component will contribute to enhance
safety measures. Under this component, a fixed weigh bridge will be installed in Macia,
Gaza province, along the N1 road while each province (total 10) will be provided with a
mobile weigh bridge. Such equipment is necessary to enforce stricter axle load control to
preserve road investments and improve road safety. Improved thermoplastic pavement
markings and new road signs are also planned on completed sections of N1 as added road
safety measures;

 (iii) Purchase of equipment: This component will contribute to improving the Road
Fund and ANE office operation as well as equip the ANE laboratory with adequate
testing equipment. Such equipment includes road testing equipment, computers, audio
visual equipment for meeting rooms, and generators; and

 (iv) Training of Road Fund and ANE staff: This component will continue to
contribute to the development of human resources and improvement of their competence
to better fulfill their professional obligations. The training focus will be on developing
and adding engineering, project management, and financial management skills, and
providing exposure to innovative contractual methodologies like Performance Based
Contracting and Public Private Partnerships arrangements. The project will also continue
to provide assistance to sponsored candidates of Road Fund and ANE pursuing post
graduate training programs.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The major restoration emergency works spread throughout seven provinces (Maputo,
Gaza, Tete, Zambezia, Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and Niassa) of Mozambique. This will
help restore connectivity to stranded communities affected by extreme weather activity
witnessed during the months of December 2011 to March 2012. The emergency
roadworks will take place only on existing roads, which are outside nature reserves and
natural forests. There wll be no resettlement or loss of assets, crops, or livelihoods that
will take place as a result of these emergency works.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The impacts of the proposed major restoration emergency works spread throughout seven
provinces (Maputo, Gaza, Tete, Zambezia, Nampula, Cabo Delgado, and Niassa) of
Mozambique are estimated as low negative impacts both in the construction phase and
over the life of the road (operation phase), but these impacts can be reduced by the
application of appropriate mitigation and support measures. These negative impacts are
far outweighed by the positive social impacts of restoring the roadworks,

 The environmental management measures proposed are generally straightforward. The
majority of the measures relate directly to sound operating practices both during the
construction phase and subsequently over the operational life of the road.

 The proposed restoration works do not require the resettlement of Project Affected
Persons, nor will it result in loss of crops, assets, or livelihoods. As such, no
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is required.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There are no negative impacts that will result as a consequence of the emergency
roadworks. Long term social impacts of the restoration works are positive.
Implementation of the project will result in the improvement of the living conditions of
population living along the road and the entire district in general thus contributing to
poverty reduction.

  Travel time to trading centres will be shortened and there will be improved access to
markets to sell their livestock products. The upgrading of the road will result in efficient
traffic flow with savings in both time and cost thus there will be improved
communication, which at present is a big concern.
  Restored roadworks will increase/ease access to schools and colleges. Restoration of the
roadworks will result in reduction in accidents along the road and avoid the use of unsafe
off-road routes. Women play an important role in agriculture throughout the country.
However, the lack of a functioning road network makes it hard for women to access
markets for their products. This is anticipated to change with the rehabilitation of the road
networks.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Without the restoration of this vital transport network, the social impact on the Project
Affected Persons will be immense, restricting their abilities to undertake commercial and
agricultural practices, as well as limiting access to schools, hospitals, commercial centers,
police stations, government offices, and other institutions. In addition, the impassability
of the roads is leading to increased mortality and morbidity due to increased road
accidents, and the necessity to utilize off-road routes.

 There is therefore no alternative to the project that would fulfill the immediate need to
provide access to transport networks to the local affected populations.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Environmental management for all roadworks will be undertaken through
implementation a consolidatedEMP, which will follow both World Bank Operational
Policies and guidelines, the ESMF prepared for RBMMP1 in 2006, and the
environmental management instructions delineated in the Environmental and Social
Guidelines for Road Works in Mozambique, prepared for the Administracao Nacional de
Estradas (ANE) in September 2006. This document contains the Environmental
Management Instructions for road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance projects in
Mozambique.The guidelines are also compliant with World Bank Operational Policy OP
4.01 – Environmental Assessment.
  The consolidated EMP covers all necessary steps to mitigate negative impacts. These
include but are not restricted measures during construction to: a) mitigate risks of erosion
and sedimentation around watercourses; b) restrict water and soil contamination on work
sites and around work camps (including littering and waste disposal); c) restrict
generation of dust during construction; d) reduce risk of fire, cutting of trees for
firewood, and trapping by construction workers; e) implement HIV/AIDS awareness
programs f) ensure sustainable water management at worksites and construction camps;
and g0minimize risk of accidents and ensure occupational safety of workers on
construction sites. The borrower, ANE, has succesfully completed environmental and
social safeguard implementation on both RBMMP 1 and 2, and has in-house staff that are
well versed in Bank OPs.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are the persons living along the road, and in close vicinity to the road.
They have been consulted about the roadworks and are vociferous in their wish that
works commence as soon as possible, in order to resume normal life and restore their
livelihoods. A grievance process is detailed in the consolidated EMP. The EMP will be
disclosed in country and in the InfoShop, prior to the start of civil works. The framework
document, the ESMF was disclosed, in 2006 and re-disclosed in 2010 at the time of the
AF for RBMMP2
