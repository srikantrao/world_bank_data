                              (i) to improve water use efficiency in the selected irrigation schemes; and (ii) to foster immediate rural employment.

                              3. Project Description

                              The Project consists of three components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                                Component 1. Rehabilitation of main and secondary canals (US$15.90 million). Identified stretches of main/secondary canals in the selected
                              irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated: a total of about 50 kilometers (km) sections, namely Arzni-Shamiram system (23.76 km), Shirak system
                              (4.6 km), Lower Hrazdan system (5.28 km), Artashat system (4.82 km), Talin system (4.32 km), including Myasnikyan Main aru (canal) (3.19 km),
                              and Nalband canal (4.25 km). The component includes: (i) civil works for the main and secondary canals rehabilitation (US$15.29 million); (ii)
                              consultancy services for supervision of rehabilitation works (US$0.61 million).
                                          Component 2. Rehabilitation of tertiary network (US$4.02 million). On-farm irrigation network (total 62.8 km) in 19 communities of Lori,
                              Shirak, Gegharkunik, and Armavir marzes will be rehabilitated to improve existing irrigation water services over 2,500 hectares (ha) and potentially
                              restore irrigation on 1,760 ha. These activities are 15 percent co-financed by farmers; the MCC has collected funds and deposited them in
                              accounts that will be made available to the PIU before tendering. Appropriate FM measures were discussed and agreed. The component includes:
                              (i) civil works for tertiary canal rehabilitation (US$3.86 million); (ii) consultancy services for supervision of rehabilitation works (US$0.16 million).
                              Component 3. Project Management and Institutional Activities (US$1.68 million). There are three sub-components, namely:
                              (a) Project management and WUAs support (US$0.92 million). The Project would finance all incremental PIU operating costs necessary to
                              implement the Project (US$0.61 million) and costs for Water Users Associations (WUAs) Support Group (US$0.31 million). Refresher training on
                              enhanced water management techniques and practices, including for O&M of pumping stations, and for improving alternative water-saving
                              irrigation structures and practices on tertiary canals and on-farm irrigation practices will be provided to the two WSA and the eight WUAs involved
                              in Project rehabilitation activities.
                              (b) Audits (US$0.40 million) for the PIU, Water Supply Agencies (WSAs), and WUAs.
                              (c) Technical Assistance (US$0.36 million) to verify environmental, economic, and technical feasibility of gravity scheme construction in the Meghri
                              region (US$360,000). In part, the Meghri scheme was studied under the MCC Program and Government has strongly proposed its inclusion in
                              potential future Bank-financed operations, or from Government budget

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The selected irrigation canals, except for Nalband canal, to be rehabilitated under the Project are parts of Artashat, Arzni-Shamiram, Lower
                              Hrazdan, Shirak, and Armavir irrigation schemes. These schemes are located in Shirak, Kotayk, Lori, Ararat, Gegharkunik, Aragatsotn, and
                              Armavir marzes (regions).

                                 The Proposed Additional Financing (AF) to the Irrigation Rehabilitation Emergency Project (IREP) will support rehabilitation of the existing
                                 irrigation schemes, which will involve relining of canals while retaining their design capacities. No new construction will be financed. Based on
                                 such nature and scope of the planned physical works, the AF is classified through environmental screening as Category B. Expected impact on
                                 the human health and natural environmental is minor. The Project does not carry any considerable risk of destroying important habitats,
                                 damaging forest stands, altering hydrology of the natural waterways, or affecting other ecosystems in any tangible and/or irreversible ways.

                                   Project activities will cause temporary and localized impacts typical for the repair of irrigation infrastructure. This will include accumulation of
                                 the generated construction waste, as well as silt and litter excavated from canals. Waste disposal will be allowed strictly in the sites designated
                                 by local authorities. Deployment of construction machinery will carry common risks of operational spillage of fuel and lubricants, and will
                                 generate some noise, dust, and vibration. Transportation of construction materials and removal of waste with heavy vehicles may cause
                                 inconvenience for local dwellers. Through most part of the construction sites are not within densely populated areas and the potential impact of
                                 moving and operating machinery can be easily mitigated through adherence to the good construction standards. All canals lie in the semi-arid
                                 zone with relatively scarce vegetation and little wildlife. Furthermore, these canals were constructed decades ago and have been operated ever
                                 since. Therefore, the planned rehabilitation works are not likely to disrupt environmental balance of the surroundings.

                                   One of the expected AF outcomes is bringing some area of agricultural land back to irrigation. Also, it is anticipated that because of improved
                                 water supply to the currently irrigated areas, agriculture may intensify and cropping patter may alter to some extent. Provided that this is an
                                 indirect and low-risk possible impact of the Project, development of a self standing Pest Management Plan (PMP) is not necessary, while
                                 Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) carry information on a public awareness campaign for optimal and safe use of pesticides to be
                                 carried out in the Project coverage area.

                                  There are no known historical/cultural sites located along the selected for rehabilitation canals. In case of chance finds in the course of earth
                                 works, contractors will be obligated to immediately stop activity and notify the State Agency for Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments.

                                   Project implementation does not require the acquisition of land, as the civil works will be carried out within the alienation zone along canals
                                 owned by the State. Neither physical dislocation of population and/or demolishment of any residential structures are anticipated. At some sites
                                 along the canals minor cases of encroachment into the alienation zone were registered as part of the EMPs prepared by Millennium Challenge
                                 Account Armenia (MCA) - a local entity established for implementation of a program funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC).
                                 However, according to the client, the existence of these encroachments should not pose an obstacle to the completion of works. It was agreed
                                 that these encroachments would be indicated in the Project designs and specific instructions provided to contractors on how to complete works
                                 in a manner that will not result in the removal of encroaching structures or assets. As a matter of due diligence OP 4.12 was triggered. A
                                 resettlement policy framework has been prepared by MCA for the activities planned under this Project.
                                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 4
                             Several canals to be rehabilitated under the AF abstract water from the tributaries of the trans-boundary Araks River shared by Armenia,
                           Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iran and one canal is fed by the tributary of the trans-boundary Debed River flowing from Armenia to Georgia; though
                           the AF will support rehabilitation of only existing primary, secondary and on-farm canals, focusing on the prevention of water loss and waste of
                           the existing water allocations. No new canals will be built, nor will the existing intake be enlarged. The AF will not result in any tangible alteration
                           of neither quantity nor quality of water downstream the project area as compared to the present status. Therefore, the AF triggers OP/BP 7.50
                           Projects on the International Waterways, but a special notification to the riparian states on the upcoming project activities is not deemed

                           necessary.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                           In combination with repair of hydraulic structures of the selected schemes financed by MCC, operation of canals after their rehabilitation under
                           this AF will allow to better meet the demand for irrigation water of its current users and to increase coverage of agricultural areas irrigated at
                           present. This effect is expected from significant cuts of water loss within the schemes, without an increase of water uptake. In a long term this
                           will result in higher agricultural productivity and yields within the coverage area and will have positive social and economic impacts.

                             An indirect impact of intensified agricultural production resulting from improved operation of irrigation schemes may be the increased use of
                           agricultural inputs, including fertilizers and pesticides. Provided current pattern of low input-low output agriculture, certain increase in the use of
                           fertilizers and pesticides is not likely to cause tangible negative environmental impacts. Consistent enforcement of good agricultural practice
                           and monitoring of soil and water quality in the production areas would be necessary in future.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           Considering the AF alternatives was not relevant, as the proposed activities do not include new development. The Project will improve only the
                           existing irrigation canals, thus generating local employment and supporting rural livelihoods.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                           Rehabilitation of the selected irrigation schemes was initially planned under the Infrastructure Activity of the Irrigated Agriculture Project
                           prepared with the funding from MCC. The Borrower carried out Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of this Project at its concept stage.
                           The Ministry of Nature Protection of the Republic of Armenia carried out an expert review of the Project concept and produced a positive
                           conclusion on it. The EIA was found consistent with the requirements of the Bank OP/BP 4.01. MCC also financed development of site-specific
                           Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for individual irrigation schemes, including primary, secondary and on-farm infrastructure selected
                           for rehabilitation under the AF. These EMPs are overall up to the Bank standards, though the Task Team is currently carrying out their detailed
                           review and will point out any updates which the Borrower may need to make towards their finalization. The EMPs will then be re-disclosed and
                           opened for the second round of comments from the potentially affected local communities (first community consultations held back in 2008) at
                           least 30 days prior to the commencement of works at each individual project site.

                           In anticipation of possible resettlement resulting from investments, MCA (which adheres to the World Bank Policy on Involuntary Resettlement)
                           prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework, for their entire Program to facilitate Poverty Reduction through Economic Growth. This RPF was
                           discussed with government and civil society stakeholders during consultation meetings held in July and August 2008, and disclosed on the
                           MCA website. This RPF covered the rehabilitation works to be carried out on the identified canals planned under this Project.

                           Water Sector Development and Institutional Improvement PIU is managing the Bank supported projects over many years and is well familiar
                           with the Bank requirements pertaining safeguard compliance. This PIU is an implementing body for the ongoing IREP and will serve for the
Public Disclosure Copy




                           purposes of the AF as well. IREP implementation to date has proven that as long as environmental monitoring is made an integral part of close
                           technical supervision of works by PIU, contractors generally follow EMPs or effectively react to outstanding issues flagged to them by
                           supervisors. Site-specific EMPs for the sections of canals to be rehabilitated under the AF will be finalized prior to commencement of civil
                           works and PIU will be required to maintain arrangements for environmental supervision and reporting satisfactory to the Bank throughout
                           implementation of the AF.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                           The key stakeholders of the AF are public Water Supply Agencies, Water User Associations receiving irrigation water from the selected canals,
                           and rural communities cultivating land within the areas irrigated from these canals.

                           The EIA Report acceptable to the Bank was disclosed in-country through the MCA web page and the public consultations were held. It was re-
                           disclosed in-country and posted in the Bank InfoShop for the purposes of the IREP. Site-Specific EMPs for the schemes to be rehabilitated
                           under the AF IREP were also disclosed by MCA and local community feedback obtained back in 2008. Upon update of these EMPs they will be
                           re-disclosed in-country, re-opened for comments, and the finalized documents disclosed through the InfoShop.

                           The Resettlement Policy Framework prepared for MCA program, which included the plans for this Project, was discussed in multi-stakeholder
                           workshop held in July and August 2008. It is also the case that the environmental management plans which were disclosed and discussed
                           locally in August 2008 provided details on possible resettlement implications of implementing this project. If it is the case that during Project
                           implementation resettlement is required, the resettlement policy framework mandates a process of disclosure and consultation with potentially
                           affected persons of a resettlement action plan to be prepared by the borrower.

                            If the project triggers the Pest Management and/or Physical Cultural Resources policies, the respective issues are to be addressed and
                            disclosed as part of the Environmental Assessment/Audit/or EMP.
                            If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please explain why:
                            One of the expected AF outcomes is bringing some area of agricultural land back to irrigation. Also, it is anticipated that because of improved
                            water supply to the currently irrigated areas, agriculture may intensify and cropping patter may alter to some extent. All of the above may entail
                            increased usage of pesticides. OP 4.09 Pest Management is triggered, through provided an indirect and low-risk possible impact of the AF,
                            development of a self standing Pest Management Plan (PMP) is not deemed necessary. The AF will finance public awareness campaign for
                            optimal and safe use of pesticides in the coverage area, which would carry on a few well targeted and successful activities initiated under the
                            original IREP.
