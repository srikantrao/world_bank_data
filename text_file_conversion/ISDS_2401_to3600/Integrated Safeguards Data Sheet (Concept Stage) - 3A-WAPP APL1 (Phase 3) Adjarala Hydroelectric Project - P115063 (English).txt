                           WAPP APL : The goal of West Africa Power Pool (WAPP) is to establish a well-functioning,
                           cooperative, power pooling mechanism for West Africa, as a means to increase access of the citizens
                           of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to stable and reliable electricity at
                           affordable costs. [APL1 refers to the countries involved in this horizontal and vertical APL structure,
                         and covers WAPP projects undertaken in the WAPP Zone A. Phase 3 indicates that this is the third
                         project in this APL series.]

                         The development objective of the WAPP Adjarala Hydropower Project (APL 1, Phase 3) is to
                         increase power supply and reduce the cost of supply.
                         C. Project Description
                         The proposed revised design now includes 3 x 49 MW for an estimated 366 GWh energy production
                         per annum. Project design will contribute to the mitigation of the floods downstream and allow for
                         the future development of a large irrigation perimeter. A 2012 independent review confirmed the
                         economic and financial viability of the project with the revised design. The team will validate these
                         results during project preparation. The review took into account the latest economic and social costs.
                         The duration of the construction is estimated at 3 years. The annual average energy, estimated at 366
                         GWh, includes 314 GWh of firm energy (at 5% deficiency). The indicative line route for the
                         proposed transmission line (about 50km long) will be parallel to the existing power line. This routing
                         has been chosen to minimize environmental and social impacts.
                         The WAPP Adjarala Hydropower Project (APL 1, Phase 3) will finance the following components:
                         Component 1: Adjarala dam, hydropower plant, transmission line, and associated infrastructure.
                         This component involves the construction of the hydropower scheme and its interconnection with the
                         Momé Hagou substation. Expected results from this component are an increase in hydropower
                         generation capacity constructed under the project, transmission lines constructed under the project,
                         and improvement in quality of service thanks to less average interruption frequency per year in the
                         project area. The component includes the following elements:
                         •        A 48m high and 3,700 m long dam creating a 680 hm3 and 95 km2 reservoir;
                         •        A hydropower station equipped with 3 x 49 MW units (315 m3/s, 54 m head);
                         •        Construction of about 50 km of 161 kV transmission line between the power plant and the
                         substation of Momé Hagou where the transmission line joins the WAPP Coastal Transmission
                         Backbone;
                         •        Construction of access roads, a new 150 m bridge across the Mono river at Tetetou (road

                         Tohoun-Notse), repositioning of part of the Nangbéto /Momé Hagou transmission line located in the
                         land submerged by the reservoir and other minor infrastructures;
                         •        A transmission interconnection line
                         •        Consulting services for Project and Construction Management.
                         Component 2: Environmental and social measures. This component will finance activities related to
                         the implementation of all measures outlined in the Environmental and Social Management Plan
                         (ESMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), related to activities financed in Component 1. In
                         addition, the component may support the design and implementation of a limited Local Development
                         Program that will address immediate social and development needs of affected local communities
                         beyond those prescribed in the ESMP and RAP.
                         Component 3: Technical assistance and project management. This component will finance technical
                         assistance activities related to preparation and implementation of the project such as:
                         •        Study to minimize the occurrence and extent of floods downstream of Adjarala by setting up
                         a flood routing management system coordinated with Nangbéto,
                         •        Analytic studies related to the potential development of the 40,000 hectare irrigation
                         perimeter downstream of Adjarala,
                         •        Development of coordinated operation system between Nangbéto and Adjarala power station
                         with a view to optimize the sharing of data and ultimately the benefits of the schemes.

                         It will also support comprehensive communication program to help achieve the project development
                           objectives. The project will support overall project management, including consultants, equipment,
                           trainings, and monitoring and evaluation for the project.

                           The Adjarala Dam site is located on the Mono River downstream of the Nangbéto Hydropower
                           Project on the same river. The Mono River at the Adjarala dam site forms the border between Togo
                           and Benin. The largest part of the Adjarala reservoir is located on Togolese territory, where also most
