                              The development objective of the project is to enhance the private sector development through further improving the business environment,
                              encouraging the development of high-potential industries, and enhancing access to financial services while strengthening the financial sector.

                              C. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The tasks contemplated under the project would leverage the work conducted over the last 3-4 years by the World Bank Group as well as other
                              donors in the PSD and FSD areas in Tajikistan.

                              The Project consists of the following three components:

                              Component 1: Improving the business environment;
                              Component 2: Encouraging the development of high-potential industries, and
                              Component 3: Enhancing access to financial services while strengthening the financial sector.

                              Below is the preliminary outline of the components and estimated distribution of the total project envelope of US$12 million, of which US$10 million
                              are IDA lending and US$2 million are potential counterpart funds (since the latter are not confirmed, project outputs and outcomes will be based on
                              IDA funding alone).

                              Component 1: Improving the business environment.

                              This component of the project aims to:

                              o       Continue the support in selected areas, where the technical assistance needs to be extended in depth and breadth.
                              o       Support the implementation of reforms by complementing the technical assistance with a dedicated investment and capacity building
                              component.

                              The assistance envisioned under this component aims to cover four specific problem areas:

                              1.        Starting a Business: Despite the reforms, the process of starting a business in Tajikistan could be further improved: entrepreneurs still
                              need to visit the three agencies (the Tax Committee, the Statistics Committee and the Pension Agency) to obtain three separate registration
                              numbers. Also, there are a number of procedures that could be simplified and costs that could be reduced.

                              2.          Registering Property: Despite the legislative amendment that calls for the unification of land and building registries, this reform has not
                              yet been implemented. As a result of an unreliable system of property registration, it is very difficult to carry out adequate urban planning,
                              transportation and infrastructure design and planning, and agricultural or tourism development. In addition, the uncertainty associated with real
                              estate titling makes the use of real estate as collateral a challenge for creditors, thereby, affecting the ability of farmers and business to gain
                         access to credit at favorable terms. The burdensome process of registration has also developed a prevalent system of informal transfer of
                         property (especially in the rural areas) in Tajikistan. The implementation of unified registry would simplify the process, reduce costs and likely
                         decrease the number of informal property transfers.

                         3.         Construction Permits: While the legislative reforms carried out are a positive step forward, they need to be broadened and implemented
                         for them to have an impact. For example, while the legislative amendments call for the implementation of a one-stop-shop for utilities no such
                         mechanism currently exists. In addition, the regulatory framework lacks key components, such as a modern licensing framework for building

                         practitioners, best practice codes and risk-based approaches for construction permitting. Due to the lack of implementation and an under-
                         developed regulatory framework, in Tajikistan, it is still very expensive and burdensome to comply with building rules.

                         4.        Getting Credit (Secured Transactions): Although the current collateral registry in the Ministry of Justice has a modern computerized core,
                         the system is outdated, with a poor and old IT base that makes the registry unreliable.

                         Component 2: Encouraging the development of high-potential industries.

                         This component is the one with relevance with regards to the Bank’s safeguards policies and is thus described in more detail. It would aim at
                         supporting the development of some selected sectors with a high competitiveness potential in Tajikistan, in particular mining, leveraging the new
                         Competitiveness Partnerships Initiative (CPI) developed under the FPD network . The mining component would be developed in collaboration with
                         SEGOM .(Sustainable Energy – Gas, Oil and Mining) Both would leverage preliminary work implemented by these two groups in recent years.

                         In the mining industry, the component would aim at (i) increasing the attractiveness of Tajikistan as a destination country for large mining
                         developments and (ii) building the capacity to manage and regulate the sector, building upon a number of previous Bank ad-hoc interventions in
                         the mining sector (a mining strategy review, a review of mining legislation, and preliminary work on the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative
                         (EITI)). The project would be complemented by efforts being undertaken by the working group led by the Ministry of Finance preparing Tajikistan
                         for candidate country status for EITI, at which time it would be eligible for funding from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund to enable it to strive towards
                         compliant country status. (The goal of the working group is to become an EITI candidate country by spring 2012.)

                         Component 2 of the project would build upon the preliminary steps taken by the Government of Tajikistan on mining sector reform—including the
                         organization of a Mining Technical Working Group—with a combination of technical assistance, capacity building, and investment that would make
                         the mining sector more attractive for investment in exploration and exploitation as well as enhance the benefits received by the country from the
                         development of mining operations.

                         Sub-component 2a: Mining Sector Laws and Regulations Technical Assistance - $ 0.9 million
                         a)         Support to the GoT on implementing regulations in the mining sector for the new Law on Subsoil (expected to be passed in the first 6
                         months of 2012) to bring them in line with international best practices, including provisions governing the social and environmental duties,
                         responsibilities and accountability of prospectors and operators, including appropriate monitoring and enforcement measures; the project would
                         review, and – if required - produce proposed updates for the legislation on environmental impact assessment, environmental management,
                         remediation, emissions, waste management and the protection of water, nature, landscape and biodiversity in Tajikistan.
                         b)         Assessment and recommendations on developing a law specific to mining sector activities (the Law on Subsoil pertains to oil, gas, and
                         mining, contrary to the situation in most countries where mining has its own sector specific law or code);
                         c)         Support to the GoT on revisions to the mining fiscal regime including an assessment of the total fiscal burden on mining operations;
                         d)         Support to the GoT on the organizational structure for the mining, cadastre and geological survey functions carried out by various
Public Disclosure Copy




                         agencies of the GoT, including an assessment and recommendations on institutional design and responsibilities, current and future staffing needs,
                         and a training strategy for staff in key regulatory roles.
                         e)         Support to the GoT on policies and regulations for tendering of known mineral deposits (given the large amount of unexploited resources
                         that were identified in the Soviet period); this would include the environmental and social provisions and regulations that prospective mine
                         operators would be contractually and legally bound to adhere to.
                         f)         Support to the GoT on programs and policies to enhance the domestic impacts of mining operations in the areas of mine site
                         employment, procurement of local goods and services by mining companies and associated employment (e.g. surveying, food supply, mine
                         clothing, servicing heavy machinery, small machine shop works), and infrastructure (through shared infrastructure or private-public partnerships
                         where feasible); and
                         g)         Provision and delivery of training programs to develop improved staff skills in relevant GoT agencies, including issues in the areas of the
                         monitoring and evaluation of environmental and social impacts and benefit streams management.

                         Sub-component 2b: Development of a Modern Mining Cadastre and Associated Capacity Building - $0.8 million
                         a)        Conducting a diagnostic for setting up a mineral rights cadastre;
                         b)        Support for the establishment of a modern, automated, transparent mineral rights cadastre system, including the creation of a digital
                         inventory of all existing licenses;
                         c)        Provision of hardware that is capable of handling an automated cadast re, taking into account the possibility of future extension of the
                         cadastre to various provinces;
                         d)        Support for the development of cadastral regulations (in line with the Law on Subsoil) to underpin the administration of the cadastral
                         system; and
                         e)        Training to relevant ministry employees to be able to administer the new system.

                         Sub-component 2c: Modernization of the Geological Survey Functions Investment, Technical Assistance and Capacity Building - $ 0.9 million
                         a)        Support for the development of a platform for the modernization of the geological information of Tajikistan, including requisite hardware
                         and software;
                         b)        Support for the modernization of the geological information policy framework and regulations and specifications for provision of
                         information into a geodata bank;
                         c)        Support for the conversion of existing maps to digital formats at international standards; and
                         d)        Training to relevant ministry employees to be able to use the new system.

                         Sub-component 2d: Stakeholder Outreach Technical Assistance - $0.5 million
                         a)      Support for a series of workshops with (potentially) impacted stakeholder groups concerning issues surrounding the development of
                           medium- and large-scale industrial mining, good international practice, and the potential benefits and risks of mining operations;
                           b)        Diagnostic of the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sub-sector with respect to its social and environmental impacts (by means of a
                           dedicated sectoral environmental and social assessment), as well as the potential for value added activities in the gem sector;
                           c)        Support for a series of workshops with (potentially) impacted stakeholder groups concerning issues surrounding the artisanal and small-
                           scale mining sector, including good international practice on social, environmental, and benefit enhancement issues; and
                           d)        Support for consultations with the mining industry, including the artisanal and small-scale mining sector, in a participatory discussion on

                           Component 3: Enhancing access to financial services while strengthening the financial sector.

                           The objective of this component is to improve access to financial services by enterprises and individuals and enhancing financial sector stability.
                           The main activities would be structural and systemic reforms in the financial services sector, as well as improvements in the regulatory framework
                           and in the streamlining and simplifying of the administrative processes required to access financial services.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be carried out in Tajikistan and all project activities will relate to the territory of Tajikistan. As the project is purely TA no physical
                           investments are planned, and thus no specific locations or physical characteristics can be identified.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Borrower’s capacity for safeguards is low, especially the monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations is a serious challenge for
                           Tajik environmental authorities. The key problems are the lack f training, the lack of political and financial supportby the Government, and the
                           absence of a general culture of accountability and of environmental consciousness and care in Tajikistan. It is one of the declared objectives of the
                           project to provide capacity building to the Borrower’s licensing and enforcing agencies in the mining sector, which will include specific modules and
                           activities for environmental authorities. Synergistic effects are expected with ongoing large scale studies in the energy sector, where environmental
                           authorities have been challenged to actively engage and get exposure to assessment and evaluation procedures in line with good environmental
                           practice.

                               B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. The specific studies and their timing1
                                  should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
                                    As the project activities consist only of TA the conventional safeguards instruments, such as ESIA and EMP do not apply. The team has
                                    produced Terms of References (ToRs) for a Sectoral Environmental and Social Assessment to be conducted for all relevant TA activities. The
                                    TOR would describe in detail the scope of all the proposed activities assisting the Government of Tajikistan in development of regulations to
                                    facilitate the mining sector development. the project will also help to develop appropriate policy and regulatory instruments and processes to
                                    ensure compliance with international good practice in environmental regulatory oversight. The draft version of the TOR has been disclosed on
                                    February 24, 2012 and public hearings will be held during the week of March 5th prior to Project Appraisal, after which the final version of the
                                    ToRs will be disclosed in the World Bank’s InfoShop as well as in the country (websites of Ministry of Finance and involved line Ministries).
                                    The disclosure and consultation of the TOR is a condition for Appraisal.
