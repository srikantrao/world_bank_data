                              C. Project Description

                              The project is likely to consist of the following components:

                              Component A: Enhanced Operational Effectiveness and Sustainability of the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environment Conservation (US$0.8 million
                              GEF). This component will provide technical support and capacity building to strengthen the ongoing effort to improve the effectiveness of BTFEC.
                              In particular, this component will help implement a revised Strategy and Action Plan for the BTFEC and operational guidelines to enable BTFEC to
                              assume leadership in prioritizing conservation threats and opportunities, work with partners to conceive the programs that can best address these
                              priorities, encourage the creation of indigenous capacity to design and manage programs and provide funding for program implementation. This
                              Component, in particular, will help implement a new Strategic Plan for BTFEC to enable it to provide leadership and strategic direction for
                              environmental conservation in Bhutan. It will help identify the interrelated areas of program implementation and define the strategies for meeting
                              the goal of this whole initiative. It will support the development of a detailed action plan that will specify a transparent and competitive system for
                              prioritization of annual conservation grant making; define the allocation of monetary resources to the different program areas, detail requirements
                              for project implementation, create systems for monitoring and evaluation and lay out the course for improving the performance and operations of
                              the Trust Fund itself. It would help to improve publicity and visibility of its operations. The intent of this component is to help BTFEC demonstrate
                              its determination, competence and success in achieving the goals of this Strategic Plan through rigorous implementation of the Action Plan and
                              measurable proof of habitat and biodiversity conservation, as well as improved quality of life for rural citizens. BTFEC should become an effective
                              instrument for biodiversity and sustainable forest conservation and management action in the country and one of the main sources of sustained
                              funding for conservation in Bhutan.

                              Component B: Improved conservation management of high altitude northern areas landscape in Bhutan (including protected areas and associated
                              alpine meadows, forests and agricultural ecosystems) with community participation to conserve temperate broad-leaf forests and other
                              ecosystems (US$2.84 million GEF; US$0.3million local communities and US$1.2 million from government agencies)): In order to improve its grant
                              making system and demonstrate its impact on conservation outcomes, under this component, BTFEC will support activities aimed at improving the
                              conservation management of high altitude northern area ecosystems in the country. Firstly, this component will support the testing and
                              implementation of appropriate management strategies and proactive plans to anticipate and address threats to the protected area and biodiversity
                              corridor complexes in HANAS. This would enable the conservation of broad-leaf forests and other ecosystems within HANAS and help maintain
                              their ecological integrity and the economic and ecological services they support. These would include the following activities: Review and update of
                              existing management plans for protected areas and zoning and enforcement of land-use regulations; monitoring of species of special concern,
                              especially tigers and other charismatic species; research on critical species; engagement of local communities in habitat management and
                              community stewardship and improved livelihoods and incomes; and improved staff training and capacity for conservation. Secondly, this
                           component will support a range of community activities to strengthen the adoption of sustainable land use and grazing practices; co-management
                           of forests and alpine meadows; and community-based ecotourism and value addition products.

                           Component C: Mainstreamed conservation and sustainable forest and natural resource management approaches in national policies, strategies
                           and plans, and the replication of such approaches elsewhere in Bhutan (US$0.44 million GEF; US$0.3 million from government agencies): The
                           lessons from protected area management, as well as management of alpine pastures, agricultural lands and catchment forests derived from
                           Component B will inform policies pertaining to key natural resources sectors, including watershed management, upland agriculture and livestock,

                           forestry, wildlife conservation and also infrastructure development. It would also attempt to mainstream such approaches in the national five-year
                           planning process. The learning and experience of Component B will also contribute to development and improvement of existing natural resource
                           management guidelines and provide good examples of best practice in key natural resource management sectors and support new models of
                           integrating protected area, sustainable grazing and agricultural management approaches into sector and geog (sub-district) level planning to
                           prevent the loss and fragmentation of forests and critical habitats. It will facilitate the replication of this learning more broadly throughout the
                           country.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be located within the Bhutan Trust Fund for Environment Conservation (BTFEC) with its office in Thimpu, Bhutan. The
                           conservation grants supported through the BTFEC will support activities in the northern alpine areas of the country and cover around 1.5 million
                           hectares. This will include three national parks, farmer's agricultural lands and alpine pastures, as well as forests outside the protected areas.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Bhutan Trust Fund is a permanent institution that provides financial support for environmental conservation activities in the country. It has
                           limited safeguard capacity. The project will provide technical assistance, capacity development and new guidelines and procedures to improve
                           safeguard management and monitoring within the conservation grants program of BTFEC.
