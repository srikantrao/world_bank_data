2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective is to ascertain the viability of market-based sovereign
catastrophe risk transfer instruments to reduce the financial vulnerability to natural disasters
(earthquakes and tropical cyclones) of Republic of Marshall Islands, Independent State of
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kingdom of Tonga, and Republic of Vanuatu. This will be achieved
by providing financing to allow participating countries to join the Pacific catastrophe risk
insurance pilot program and purchase catastrophe risk coverage against catastrophic earthquake
and/or tropical cyclone events for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 pilot period.


﻿3. Project Description:
The Pacific catastrophe risk insurance project aims to test the viability of catastrophe risk
transfer instruments for the Pacific islands as a source of limited but immediate funding post-
disaster. The program would be implemented in November 2012 for two years to offer rapid
post-disaster liquidity to participating PICs in the event of major natural disasters. The project
would offer country-specific parametric catastrophe risk coverage (against earthquake and
tropical cyclones) and would transfer the aggregate risk to the international reinsurance markets.
The pilot program prioritizes the PICs that are already active in disaster risk management and
willing to further enhance their budget planning against natural disasters. Five countries have
confirmed their participation for 2012: Republic of Marshall Islands, Independent State of
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Kingdom of Tonga, and Republic of Vanuatu.
The project will test the viability of sovereign catastrophe risk transfer from the demand side and
the supply side. On the supply side, the pilot aims to test the credibility of the catastrophe risk
models developed under Pacific Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) for market-
based financial transactions, and the risk appetite of the international reinsurers to underwrite
Pacific catastrophe risks using parametric triggers. On the demand side, the pilot aims to test the
payment in case of a covered event and demonstrate that such immediate payments can help the
affected countries improve their recovery post-disaster.
The portfolio of catastrophe risk transfer policies of the five participating PICs, for the first pilot
season 2012-2013, has an aggregate limit (i.e., maximum possible loss) of about US$45 million
and an annual expected loss (AEL) of US$1 million. Based on the catastrophe risk models
developed by the risk modelling firm AIR Worldwide under this initiative, there is a 54.5 percent
chance that a payout is made to at least one participating PIC in any given year. The aggregate
loss on the portfolio is estimated to exceed US$10 million approximately once every 100 years
(1 percent annual frequency).
The country-specific catastrophe risk policies will be placed, through IDA, on the international
reinsurance market as a single, well diversified portfolio. Financial simulations shows that
pooling country-specific catastrophe risks into a single portfolio enables to reduce the
catastrophe load, which is an important component of the premium, by almost 75 percent.
Experience from the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility indicates that such a
reduction in the catastrophe load could reduce premiums by almost half, compared with the cost
of coverage a country would pay if it had to approach the reinsurance market independently.
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project will finance catastrophic risk coverage premiums for the above-mentioned five
countries and will not involve any physical interventions. No safeguard policies will be
triggered.
