                              advantage of market opportunities.

                              3. Project Description

                              The project would be financed by an IDA Specific Investment Credit equivalent to US$ 8 million and a US$ 5 million grant from the Food Price
                              Crisis Response Core Multidonor Trust Fund managed by the World Bank.

                              The project would be implemented over a period of five years, on both Upolu and Savaii islands, with targeted farming and livestock enterprises
                              promoted in those areas of the islands where they are considered by MAF and producer associations to have some comparative advantage.
                              Household participation in the project would be demand-driven, with focus not only those households wanting to adopt a more commercial
                              approach to farming and livestock production, but also those households who want to produce more, but at the same time prefer to remain
                              operating at a subsistence level.

                              The project would promote the adoption of improved technologies and agricultural practices; and finance investments both on-farm and in strategic
                              marketing infrastructure. Project activities would be grouped into three components: (a) Livestock Production and Marketing; (b) Fruit and
                              Vegetable Production and Marketing; and (c) Institutional Strengthening.

                              Component 1: Livestock Production and Marketing. The objective of this component would be to encourage interested livestock producers to
                              upgrade livestock, improve husbandry practices and stock management, make productivity enhancing on-farm investments, and improve the
                              quality of meat sold in the local market. The component would comprise a number of activities, including:
                              (a) improving farmer access to superior breeding stock for cattle, pigs, sheep and poultry;
                              (b) financing eligible farm enterprise investments to improve stock handling and livestock housing and provide start-up working capital, through a
                              combination of demand-driven matching grants and bank loans;
                              (c) providing technical advice on breed selection and breeding management, nutrition, animal health and improved husbandry practices;
                              (d) improving livestock nutrition by fostering locally grown feedstuffs and upgrading pastures for cattle and sheep; and
                              (e) improving meat quality and hygiene initially through initiation of a new field slaughter service on Upolu and Savaii, and later by construction of
                              an abattoir on Upolu, all with associated cold chains.

                              Component 2: Fruit and Vegetable Production and Marketing. The objective of this component would be to enable interested fruit and vegetable
                              growers to have access to new, higher yielding varieties, adopt improved technology and production techniques, make productivity enhancing on-
                              farm investments, and organize themselves to strengthen their presence in the market and meet the demands of local retailers and foodservice
                              operators for year-round supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables. The component would be comprised of a number of interrelated activities,
                              including:
                                                                                                                                                                          Page 1 of 4
                         (a)         enhancing farmer access to planting material of a broad range of improved fruit and vegetable varieties, shown in local trials to be
                         suitable for Samoan conditions;
                         (b)         financing eligible farm enterprise investments to facilitate land preparation, address problems with seasonal rainfall excesses and
                         shortfalls, increase mechanization and provide start-up working capital through a combination of demand-driven matching grants and bank loans;
                         (c)         providing technical advice on variety selection, crop nutrition, improved husbandry practices, post harvest handling and organization of
                         producer groups; and
                         (d)         promoting the growth of organic products and fruit and vegetable exports through assistance in market development and arrangements

                         for certification.

                         2.          Component 3: Institutional Strengthening. The objective of this component would be to improve the effectiveness of agricultural
                         institutions (Government and non-government) providing extension and adaptive research services to Samoan farmers; and the ability of these
                         same institutions working individually or in collaboration with each other to implement and monitor the project effectively. This would be done by:
                         (a)         enhancing institutional, technical and management capacity to improve extension effectiveness and address identified skill-gaps in staff
                         and the operational procedures of implementing agencies;
                         (b)         providing incremental staff to manage the project effectively;
                         (c)         improving work facilities and providing adequate vehicles, equipment and operating expenditure to maximize operational effectiveness;
                         and
                         (d)         designing and implementing a monitoring and evaluation system which is integrated into the existing Management Information System
                         (MIS) of MAF.

                         4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                         The project would be implemented in the two main islands of Upolu and Savai'i. The project activities would only be implemented on land already
                         used for agricultural production activities.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 The project will support activities that will improve fruit and vegetable productivity, livestock productivity and animal breeding, as well as meat
                                 quality and hygiene. The activities, with the exception of the construction and operation of the abattoir in Upolo, will be implemented at the
                                 individual farmer level in which case environmental and social impacts are expected to be benign and short term. As part of project preparation,
                                 the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework that includes an analysis on the
                                 potential environment and social impacts of the project and sub-projects. The analysis indicated that the negative impacts are minor, localized
                                 and temporary primarily because the sub-projects are small in scale and limited in scope and at done at the household level. Among the sub-
                                 projects, the construction of the proposed abattoir and waste generated during operation of the abattoir would have some environmental
                                 impacts if the wastes are not managed properly. Effective waste management facilities such as wastewater treatment would be constructed as
                                 part of the abattoir. Other minor impacts include soil erosion from agricultural activities and noise, odors and wastes from animals.
                                 The project may also lead to an increase in usage of pesticides for fruit and vegetable production. However, since organic farming and
                                 Integrated Pest Management will be promoted and supported by the project, potential increase in pesticide is assessed to be minor.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:

                                 Long term environmental impacts are assessed to be positive with the promotion and support of IPM and soil conservation measures in the
                                 production activities and waste management in the abattoir operation.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 Alternative sites were considered for the location of the abattoir in Upolu to avoid involuntary resettlement. The final location for the abattoir site
                                 is on Government-owned land that does not have any settlers that will be affected.
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries prepared an Environmental and Social management Framework (ESMF) and Code of Environmental
                                 Practice (COEP) for the abattoir, which also serves as the EMP, during project preparation which were disclosed locally in English and the local
                                 language (Samoan) and in the Bank's Infoshop prior to appraisal. The ESMF included, among others, the legal frameworks, the assessment of
                                 environmental and social impacts of the sub-projects, mitigating measures, institutional arrangements for carrying out the screening and the
                                 implementation of the EMP, training and capacity building, monitoring and reporting and the screening checklist for each type of subproject to
                                 be supported by the project. Sub-projects may include upgrading of the veterinary laboratory, livestock production facilities, abattoir, agriculture
                                 activities, etc. The ESMF also included a separate chapter on Pest Management that focuses on Integrated Pest Management for the fruit and
                                 vegetable production component.

                                 The Government of Samoa has a well established Environmental Impact Assessment Law. It has also developed Codes of Environmental
                                 Practice that are being followed and adhered to in civil works activities. These codes were developed with the assistance of the Bank under the
                                 SIAM Project. The Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Meteorology (MNREM) is a well-organized agency with good experience in
                                 environmental impact assessment and environmental management plans, and is familiar with Bank environmental safeguards. Government has
                                 been successful in addressing environmental and social safeguards aspects in other Bank-financed programs. Nevertheless, the project will
                                 support the capacity building of the MAF with regard to the use of the ESMF and the preparation and implementation of the Integrated Pest
                                 Management Plan.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 The key stakeholders include fruit and vegetables and livestock producers that wish to make the transition from subsistence to semi-commercial
                                 and/or commercial agriculture. During preparation several consultations were held by MAF with broad participation from stakeholders including
                                 representatives of farmer and producer organizations and NGOs. During these workshops, information on the project, both written and verbal,
                                 was provided in English and Samoan.
