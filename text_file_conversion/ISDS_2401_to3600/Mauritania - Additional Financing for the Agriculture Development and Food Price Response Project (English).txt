2. Project Objectives
The PDO of this Additional Financing to PDIAIM II is to improve availability of critical
agricultural inputs and food staples for targeted beneficiaries.

 The Project will intervene in ten administrative regions affected by the drought
emergency situation (see note). An estimated number of 279,000 rural beneficiaries are
expected to benefit from this operation of which approximately 40 percent will be female.

 Note: Compared to PDIAIM II, the areas targeted will be increased from 4 to 10
administrative regions affected by the emergency situation: Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol,
Guidimaka, Hodh Chargui, Hodh Gharbi, Assaba, Tagant, Adrar, Inchiri. PDIAIM II is
currently operating in the first four regions only.
3. Project Description
From the on-going Bank portfolio in Mauritania, the PDIAIM II offers a very convenient
opportunity to fast-track the Bank's emergency response in drought affected areas
because the PDIAIM II is already active in several regions of southern Mauritania and
has adequate institutional and fiduciary capacities. Besides, this Additional Financing
will also be used to initiate the preparation of an agricultural investment operation
(including irrigation development) taking into account the newly approved national
strategies for food security and rural development.

  The PDIAIM II has three main components: (i) rural incentives and capacity building;
(ii) infrastructure for irrigated agriculture; and (iii) support to agricultural supply chains.

 For the purpose of this Additional Financing a new Component E "Emergency and Food
Price Response" will be added to the on-going PDIAIM II, while the existing Component
D of PDIAIM II will serve for project management and coordination. The summary of
the activities under each of these components are as follows:

 Component E - Emergency and Food Price Response (US$9 million, of which IDA
support is equivalent to US$4 million and GFRP support is US$5 million) is (i) to
support Agricultural and Livestock Productivity Enhancement through the supply of
agricultural inputs and livestock sanitation, and (ii) to support the existing Food Safety
Net by providing critical management assistance as well as access to cereal for vulnerable
rural beneficiaries.

 The project's activities will consist of: (i) supply and distribution of urea in the rice
cultivation areas (Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol and Guidimaka areas), (ii) supply of veterinary
products including treatments (vitamin and mineral nutritional complements, and/or
antibiotics, and/or anti-parasites) and livestock vaccinations against drought induced
diseases (Small Ruminants' Plague, Botulism and Pasteurellosis), and (iii) the provision
of initial cereal stocks (or the replenishment of depleted existing cereal stocks) to targeted
village food security banks (Stocks Alimentaires Villageois de Sécurité).

 Component D - Project Management and Coordination (IDA support equivalent to
US$1 million) will build on institutional arrangements and trained management capacity
already in place through the existing Project Coordination Unit of PDIAIM II; it will also
allow for studies aimed at improving preparedness in dealing with food security issues.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project's activities will be undertaken in ten administrative regions of Mauritania
(Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol, Guidimaka, Hodh Chargui, Hodh Gharbi, Assaba, Tagant,
Adrar, Inchiri) affected by the current drought situation. Some of the project sites are
located in the Mauritania side of the Senegal River basin but the size and scale of the
activities are not suspicious to generate a disturbance in water flow or any other dynamics
in natural environment. The remaining sites stretch over typical Sahelian rangelands that
are adapted to activities to be supported under the project. Thus, no salient physical
characteristic is found critical to safeguard analysis.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The parent project (PDIAIM II) is a category A due to the Foum Gleita Dam component
which activities have been either completed or dropped out. Through the distribution of
agricultural inputs (fertilizers and veterinary drugs) the Additional Financing (current
project) activities may induce indirect but manageable impacts due to inadequate
handling and use of the products or their residues. As a result, the project is category B
with two policies triggered: OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.09 Pest
Management. Thus the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and
Pest and Pesticide Management Plan (PMP) that were prepared for PDIAIM II will be
updated for the purpose of the AF. There will be no substantial responsibility change for
the implementation of the revised safeguards instruments.

  Furthermore, the envisaged nature of the activities to be supported under this Additional
Financing entails no land acquisition or restrictions of access to natural resources and
livelihoods; therefore the OP4.12 is not triggered.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
N/A

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The two safeguard documents (ESMF and PMP) for PDIAIM II will be updated for the
purpose of the Additional Financing, consulted upon and disclosed publicly both in-
country and at the InfoShop (this update of Safeguard documents will be included as a
disbursement condition). The assessment of borrower's capacity reveals a substantial
need of support since the implementation of the ESMF during the PDIAIM showed some
difficulties. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will appoint one safeguard specialist to
ensure proper implementation, documentation, follow up and reporting of the mitigation
measures (screening, execution of specific ESMP, etc.) recommended in the updated
instruments (ESMF, PMP). This will be a condition for Project effectiveness. A provision
is earmarked in the project budget for the effectiveness of the above-mentioned measures.
Finally, this new operation will build on the many years of experience and the lessons
learned from implementation of PDIAIM II. This provides the project Teams and
relevant actors a good framework for smooth implementation of safeguards measures.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The stakeholders that will be consulted in the preparation of the safeguard documents
will include the direct beneficiaries and potentially affected people (producer
organizations and agribusiness associations) and the various agricultural, environmental,
social, and health agencies.
