                              The Development Objectives of Electricity Network Reinforcement and Expansion Project (ENREP) are to improve reliability and increase access
                              to electricity services in Ethiopia.

                              C. Project Description

                              1.         The proposed project consists of four components: (i) Reinforcement of Electricity Network (Upgrade and Expansion), (ii) Access Scale-

                              Up, (iii) Market Development for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Products, and (iv) EEPCo Modernization Support to provide the required
                              capital and capacity building support to meet GoEs electrification goals over the next 5 years through a least-cost electricity sector investment plan.

                              2.        Component 1: Reinforcement of Electricity Network (estimated US$100 million): Reinforcement of the electricity network component
                              includes two sub-components: (i) grid upgrade: and (ii) grid extension in order to improve the overall service delivery of the Ethiopian electricity
                              network.

                              3. The reinforcement of electricity network component will be based on a least-cost electricity sector investment plan (investment and operations).
                              In the past few years, Ethiopia has seen tremendous expansion in new generation and new connections (nearly 2 million customers) in the EEPCo
                              networks. This has created several bottlenecks in the grid which has resulted in significant depreciation of service delivery levels as well as
                              technical losses in transmission.

                              4.          The concept behind reinforcement of electricity network is to invest in specific sub-projects (including HV, MV, LV transmission lines and
                              66/11 & 33/11 KV sub-station investments and other line replacement and/or extensions) to be implemented by EEPCo during FY2012-2017.
                              Prior to this, a study will be carried out by the EEPCo to identify critical priority segments that would benefit from these investments. At the
                              moment, the exact segments required for the investments are not known; consequently, the ENREP is proposing a programmatic approach to
                              these investments.

                              5.          Under the project, ENREP will finance the replacement of technical equipment to upgrade the capacity of identified segments and to
                              expand certain critical segments of the grid. These segments will be identified following the EEPCo analysis and in close coordination with the
                              project team. The project will lay out specific criteria for selection of the segments. As the project is focused on enhancing the distribution of
                              electricity from the main power lines, which receive power from a variety of sources, it is not associated with any existing or future hydropower
                              production facilities.

                              6.        Component 2: Access Scale-Up (estimated US$50 million): Access scale-up plan includes intensification of connections to the
                              households and villages in the areas already connected by the grid. As the grid reinforcement component (below) addresses the technical
                              bottlenecks in the transmission systems, the access scale-up would address the low connection intensity in the areas already connected.

                              7.         The concept is to enhance the development and implementation of local connections for the households and villages in the grid area by
                              providing financing of the last-mile technologies based on least cost estimates for given load densities.

                              8.           This component of the project will include three sub-components: (i) connection intensification in the segments of the grid with low
                           connection rates and existing capacity and (ii) connection intensification in the segments of the grid which will undergo upgrade (per component 2
                           below) and hence would have increased capacity of connections; and (iii) connection expansion in the segments of the grid which will undergo
                           expansion (per component 1).

                           9.        Component 3: Market Development for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Products (estimated US$40 million): Development of off-
                           grid renewable energy programs such as, stand-alone solar systems, solar lanterns, improved cook-stoves, CFLs, micro-hydro stations, etc. will
                           provide additional coverage for household electrification; especially in the areas that are not yet connected to the grid. However, the target

                           population for this component will not only be the households and villages that are not included in the grid areas, but also those that are in the grid
                           area and are unable to afford a connection. This component will complement the grid reinforcement (component 1) by assisting in access scale-up
                           (component 2) for energy inclusion targets.

                           10.        The renewable energy component will create a credit facility in partnership with REF which will operate under the following two
                           categories, (i) giving access to credit to project developers (private sector, communities, NGOs, etc.) for commercial financing of capital investment
                           in the area o f renewable energy; (ii) giving access to distributors and end-users to working capital (for SHSs, Lighting Africa certified products,
                           biogas plants, energy efficient cooking stoves, etc.).

                           11.        Component 4: Capacity Building and Technical Assistance (estimated US$10 million): Finally, ENREP will include comprehensive
                           technical assistance, capacity strengthening, and implementation support, mainly focused on three areas of support: (i) EEPCo institutional
                           strengthening and program implementation; (ii) development of sector wide capacity building in the energy sector; (iii) technical assistance for
                           institutional and regulatory framework development; especially for energy efficiency and renewable energy development. The technical assistance
                           component will be designed to assist GoE/EEPCo in their entire energy portfolio as the country embarks on massive growth program in the energy
                           sector. Specific programs will be designed to up-skill institutions in areas such as fiduciary management, environmental and social safeguards
                           management, procurement and contract management, HR, project management, and overall portfolio execution.

                           13. The Project component 1, 2, and 4 will be implemented by EEPCo. The Environmental Monitoring Unit at EEPCo conducts environment and
                           social assessments at different stages of all energy projects; often undertaking the assignment (including preparation of RAPs) themselves with no
                           external technical support. Given that EEPCo is working on numerous energy supply and distribution, this practice, which is considered acceptable
                           to EEPCo, is neither sustainable nor advisable as it creates a conflict of interest. EMU recognizes the heavy load and admit their lack of capacity to
                           monitor activities to ensure implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures. The technical assistance component will thus be
                           designed to assist GoE/EEPCo in their entire energy portfolio as the country embarks on massive growth program in the energy sector. Specific
                           programs will be designed to enhance the technical skills of institutions, such as EMU, to adequately manage the environmental and social
                           safeguards issues.

                           14. Component 3 on Off grid Lighting and Energy Efficiency Product Market Development will be implemented by REF of the Ministry. This part of
                           the project is not expected to have any adverse safeguards impact. However, the ESMF of the project prepared by EEPCO will also include
                           information on this component though implemented by REF.
