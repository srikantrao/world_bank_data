                              2. Project Objectives

                              The proposed project would support the Government’s implementation of reforms to improve the equity and efficiency of its social assistance
                              programs.

                              3. Project Description

                              The proposed project would consist of two inter-related components. The first component would support the actual results arising from
Public Disclosure Copy




                              implementation of improvements in the main social assistance programs (NE and disability assistance benefits). Such support would be provided
                              by co-financing the eligible expenditure program (on a reimbursement basis), and disbursing against measured improvements in implementation
                              (actions and outputs) leading to improved performance (outcomes), according to a results-based financing (RBF) approach. The second
                              component would finance select technical investments to strengthen the Government’s capacity for implementing such improvements and thereby
                              achieving the results. This component will follow standard World Bank procedures for technical investments.

                              The two components are inherently linked through definition of the results framework. Specifically, technical assistance for systems
                              improvements in the Government’s capacity supported by Component 2 would contribute to improved implementation of social assistance
                              programs, and the achievement of results that would trigger disbursements under Component 1. With this approach, the partnership and
                              engagement between the World Bank and the Government of Albania on social assistance reforms would span technical assistance for
                              administration of social assistance programs, implementation support, and co-financing of a major social assistance program based on the results
                              achieved through this partnership.


                              Component 1: Strengthening the Implementation and Performance of Social Assistance Programs

                              The objective of this component is to support the results of implementation of improvements in the main social assistance programs. Specifically,
                              the component would support improved implementation of both the NE program and disability assistance benefits in the main areas identified in
                              the broad “Roadmap for Reforms?: (a) program parameters (eligibility criteria and intake processes); (b) benefits administration (business
                              processes, management of information, and payments mechanisms, and reporting and monitoring); and (c) oversight and controls.

                              The proposed project would support reforms promoting equity and efficiency of social assistance benefits. The “results chains? for each objective
                              demonstrate how the intended objectives and outcomes (PDIs) would be achieved following a logical framework. Along these results chains, some
                              of the critical actions and outputs have been selected as Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) to mark progress towards achievement of the
                              PDIs. Disbursements would be triggered by achievement of these DLIs corresponding to the reform objectives: equity and efficiency.


                              Component 2: Technical Assistance to Strengthen Implementation Capacity for Social Assistance Programs

                              The objectives of this component are to strengthen capacity for implementing improvements in the delivery of social assistance benefits. By
                              contributing to improvements in the Government’s capacity to implement the social assistance programs, this component will contribute to the
                              achievement of the DLIs under Component 1.

                                                                                                                                                                     Page 1 of 3
                               This component will finance select technical assistance and investment activities. Implementing the Roadmap for reforms to improve equity and
                               efficiency will require many types of inputs. The Government has opted to finance many of those inputs with its own State Budget (e.g., for the
                               MIS, core training activities, human resources, etc.). To complement those inputs, the proposed project would finance select technical assistance
                               and advisory activities that would leverage the World Bank’s comparative advantage and international experience. These activities would support
                               improved capacity or core tools that are needed upfront (e.g. in the first year) to implement and monitor reforms that would lead to the achievement
                               of results (DLIs and ultimately the PDIs). Technical assistance activities to support the implementation of reforms at the later stages would be
Public Disclosure Copy




                               financed by other sources (e.g. the state budget and/or the European Commission). Specific activities would be organized into four sub-
                               components, supporting the two results areas (equity and efficiency) plus the cross-cutting principle of transparency.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               The proposed Project supports the Government social assistance programs (Ndihma Ekonomike and Disability assistance) that are executed
                               nation-wide in Albania. Given the already broad nature of the project, no civil works, even minor civil works and goods will be included under
                               Component 1 or Component 2.

                                   There are no known environmental issues relating to this project and none of the environmental safeguards have been triggered.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                    The activities supported by the proposed Project are not likely to have significant effects on Albania's environment or natural resources. The
                                  measures contemplated under the
                                  loan relate to improving the social assistance programs and are not expected to have any significant links to the environment, nor trigger any of
                                  the World Bank's environmental safeguards.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
