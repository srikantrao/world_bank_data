                              The project development objective is to ensure the quality of and maintain the access to general education while supporting the efficiency reforms
                              being implemented in the education sector.

                              C. Project Description

                              (i) strengthening the quality of education; (ii) maintaining access of all children to schooling; and (iii) improving the efficiency of the sector. The
                              proposed areas of focus for the project are the following: the development of teaching and managerial staff; strengthening the country's ability to
                              monitor quality through the regular participation in international assessments; school reorganizations, class mergers and nationwide Per Student
                              Financing. There will be no school construction or rehabilitation in this project.

                              The project is a result based sector investment loan that is to be implemented between 2013 and 2017, and will be financed by an IDA credit of US
                              $30 million. The project will be organized into two parts. The first part, consisting of the majority of project funds, will follow a results based
                              approach; and, as such, project disbursements would be triggered by the achievement of agreed specific results that can include actions, outputs
                              or outcomes (Disbursement Linked Indicators - DLIs). The second part of the Project would finance Technical Assistance (TA) for the Ministry of
                              Education. The TA will build capacity towards achieving the agreed results, support the social marketing campaign and would disburse based on
                              traditional disbursement methods.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project is part of a Government of Moldova program and will be implemented in schools country-wide. There will be no civil works in this
                              project.

                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              No environmental, resettlement or indigenous safeguards are triggered by the proposed project and therefore has been granted a Category C. A
                              non-safeguard social assessment will be prepared. This assessment will look into impact of the program on released school personnel, parents
                              and students in areas where school re-organization or closure has occurred or is being planned. Given the political and social sensitivity of school
                              optimization, the assessment (in particular, regional community consultations) will be conducted once government decisions regarding areas of
                              optimization have been taken and made public. Thus the assessment may be conducted in two stages: during project preparation, and at mid-term
                              evaluation.
