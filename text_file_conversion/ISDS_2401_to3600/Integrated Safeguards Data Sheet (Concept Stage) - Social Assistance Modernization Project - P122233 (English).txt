                              C. Project Description

                              Lending Instrument: The proposed project would be implemented over a period of five years with financing from World Bank IBRD in anamount of
                              US$25 million (tent                                 ative). In terms of lending instrument, the proposed project would be a specifi
                              c investment loan(SIL),that would disburse in two ways: (a) with disbursements f                                   or verified achievement of results
                              for implementation and improvements in the ma                                     in social assistance programs, using a "results-based
                              financing" (RBF) approach                                     (Component 1, for at least 80 percent of the loan funds); and (b) for technical
                              assistance activities (Component 2, traditional TA SIL). These approaches are                                      discussed in further detail below.

                               Project Components: The proposed project would consist of two inter-related components. The first component wouldsupport the actual
                              implementation of improvemen                                     ts in the main social assistance programs (NE and disability assistance
                              benefits                                  ).Such support would be provided by co-financing the eligible programs (on a rei
                              mbursement basis), and disbursing against measured improvements in their impleme                                        ntation (outputs) and
                              performance (outcomes), according to a results-based finan                                     cing (RBF) approach. Thesecond component would
                              finance select investments to st                                  rengthen the Government#s capacity for implementing such improvements. This
                              co                                  mponent, aimed at strengthening the capacity of the MOLSA, as well as other impl
                              ementation partners (including at decentralized levels of government), will foll                               ow standard World Bank procedures
                              for technical investments. The two components are inherently linked through definition of the results framework. Specifically, technical and
                              systems improvements in the Government's capacity supported by                                        Component 2 would contribute to improved
                              implementation of social assistance pro                                    grams, and the achievement of results thatwould trigger disbursements
                              under Comp                                    onents 1. With this approach, value-added would be generated from the interactio
                              n of the co-financing, results framework, technical assistance for administratio                                n of social assistance programs,
                              implementation support and the deeper, longer-t                                    erm partnership and engagement between the World Bank and
                              the Government of Alba                                    nia on social assistance reforms.

                               COMPONENT 1: Strengthening the Implementation and Performance of Social Assistance Programs (minimum 80 percent of the loan amount)
                               The objectives of this component are to support the actual implementation of improvements in the main social assistance programs (NE and
                              disability assistance b                                enefits). Specifically, the component would seek to partner with the Government
                              of Albania to support improved implementation of: (a) program parameters (revise                                   d eligibility criteria, benefits
                              menu); (b) benefits administration (business pr                                    ocesses, management of information and payments); and (c)
                              governance (oversight                                   and controls, monitoring and evaluation, and communications / awareness), as sho
                              wn in Figure 3 above (implementation road map).

                              Project disbursements under this component would be: (a) linked to defined eligible expenditure line items comprising the #Eligible Expenditure
                         Programs# or EEP                                     s; and (b) triggered by verified achievement of agreed specific results (disburs
                         ement-linked indicators, or DLIs) for strengthening the achievement of Albania#s                                     social assistance programs.
                         Specifically, the Eligible Expenditure Programs (EE                                    Ps) would include co-financing of NE program.

                          Disbursements would be triggered by achievement of results, which would be grouped into the three results areas: equity, efficiency and

                         transparency (see implem                                     entation road map in Figure 3, as well as the PDIs discussion above). Results
                         Chains for each results area would be developed to measure progress towards achi                                        evement of the PDIs. Within
                         each of these results chains, a series ofintermedi                                  ate monitoring indicators (IMIs) and disbursement-linked
                         indicators (DLIs) would                                    be defined to mark progress towards achievement of the PDIs . The results chain
                         s would also identify priority technical investments that would be crucial for b                                uilding the Government's capacity for
                         implementing the improvements (under Compo                                        nent 2) and achieving the results, as discussed below.

                          In terms of timing of actual implementation, MOLSA has indicated that it would adopt a phased approach to implementing systems improvements,
                         first piloting the                                reforms (e.g., in two regions) and then implementing them on a nation-wide
                         basis                                  , adapting the improvements by building in feedback from evaluations of the init
                         ial pilot tests.

                          In terms of ti ming of project disbursements, the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) would be defined as measurable output indicators, marki
                         ng improvements                                      in the parameters, administration, and governance of the two social assistance
                         programs (see Figure 4); as well as (b) intermediate outcome indicators, measuri                                         ng improved performance and
                         impacts of the social assistance system. These DLI                                          s would be defined and calibrated according to a
                         tentativetimetable that would a                                   llow sufficient time for their achievement. This tentative timetable would yiel
                         d a projected disbursement schedule (#target years 1, 2, 3, 4) for the purposes                                        of projecting disbursements and
                         facilitating Government budget planning. Howeve                                         r, the actual timing of achievement of results (DLIs) is not fixed
                         (in the legal                                  agreement). Rather, disbursements would be made upon verified achievement of t
                         he specified DLI at any time during the implementation period. Disbursed funds                                          for this component would be
                         made on a #reimbursement basis# to the Treasury (MOF                                             ), as a reimbursement for the financing of the eligible
                         expenditure programs(th                                     e social assistance programs). The proposed project would rely on Albania#s publ
                         ic financial management, monitoring and reporting systems.a

                          COMPONENT 2: Technical Assistance to Strengthen Implementation Capacity for Social Assistance Programs (maximum 20% of the loan
                         amount)
                          The objectives of this component are to strengthen the Government's capacity for implementing improvements in the delivery of social assistance
                         benefits. This                                    support comes at a crucial moment for social assistance programs, as it builds o
                         n the World Bank DPL on social sectors that supported the adoption of broad poli                                    cy changes in social programs
                         through revised legislation. By contributing to im                                 provements the Government's capacity to implement
                         improvements in the social ass                                    istance programs, this component will also contribute to actual implementation o
                         f results (outputs and outcomes) needed for achieving the DLIs for disbursements                                     under Component 1. This
                         component will not finance any civil works but will f                                 ocus on implementation capacity and other studies and

                          This component will adopt traditional instruments for financing technical assistance. Lessons-learned from other results-based financing SILs
                         (RBF SILs) suggest                                      that directly-financed technical assistance should: (a) be linked to results fr

                         The proposed Project supports the government social assistance programs (Ndihma Ekonomike and Disability assistance) that are executed
                         nation-wide in Albania. G                              iven the already broad nature of the project, no civil works, even minor civil w
                         orks and goods will not be included under Component 1 or Component 2.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                         The institutional structures for managing the social safety net in Albania are well defined. The central government is responsible for program
                         financing, design                                    (including eligibility criteria / filters), monitoring and oversight. Implement
