2. Project Objectives

The program aims at measurably reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change
impacts in the Eastern Caribbean sub-region. The objective of the Project in Grenada is to
measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change impacts in Grenada and in
the Eastern Caribbean sub-region. The objective of the Project in Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines (SVG) is to measurably reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change
impacts in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and in the Eastern Caribbean sub-region.

3. Project Description

The proposed lending instrument for the sub-regional program is a horizontal Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) implemented in parallel in the countries of the Eastern Caribbean region. Currently,
there are three confirmed participating countries: Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines. Country projects in Grenada and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines form the first
phase (APL 1). Saint Lucia constitutes the second phase (APL 2) of the program, and the third
phase would allow for the option of the remaining OECS countries, namely Antigua and
Barbuda, Dominica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis, to participate in the program, if requested.

This regional program will support regional agencies and interested government agencies in 6
island states (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) in the OECS to develop capacity and tools to assess and
communicate disaster risk to the general public and to decision makers in different sectors.
Furthermore, for Grenada, Saint Lucia, and SVG, the country-specific projects will finance
investments in disaster vulnerability reduction for public infrastructure. Civil works to be
financed would focus on retrofitting and climate-proofing existing infrastructure as well as the
construction of key infrastructure designed to protect the most vulnerable assets, including
infrastructure linking the sub-region. Collectively, these interventions will mitigate the adverse
affects of future economic and natural shocks in the sub-region and, at the same time, create an
enabling environment for sustained economic development better adapted to a rapidly changing
climate.

The four components of the Program are as follow:

Component 1: Prevention and Adaptation Investments. The participating countries would
implement a broad spectrum of interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and
infrastructure.

Component 2: Regional Platforms for Hazard and Risk Evaluation and Applications for
Improved Decision Making. This component would support building the regional capacity for
assessment of natural risks and integration of such assessment into policy and decision making

                                                                                                2
process for the development of investments, disaster risk mitigation and disaster response across
sectors, through the provision of technical advisory services, training and acquisition of goods.

Component 3: Natural Disaster Response Investments. This component would finance
emergency recovery and reconstruction subprojects under an agreed action plan of activities
designed as a mechanism to implement a country’s rapid response to an emergency. Following an
adverse natural event, and subject to a Government’s declaration of emergency in accordance
with national law and the submission of a recovery action plan satisfactory to the Association, a
participating Government would be able to request the World Bank to re-categorize financing or
provide additional financing to cover early recovery and rehabilitation costs.

Component 4: Project Management and Implementation Support. Activities under this
component would support strengthening and developing the institutional capacity for Project
management, including: (a) preparation for designs and tender documents; (b) preparation of
project reports; (c) processing of contracts and tender evaluation; (d) coordination of
participating line ministries; (e) supervision of the quality of works; (f) training of staff in Project
management and implementation support; (g) capacity building for accreditation to the United
National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Climate Adaptation Fund; and
(h) related activities on Project management and implementation, all through the provision of
technical advisory services, training, operating costs and acquisition of goods.


4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguard
Analysis

Grenada
Civil works under the proposed project would be carried out throughout the island of Grenada.
Construction activities are located in urban centers and along vulnerable roadway areas with
respect to landslip and rock fall. Some of the activities have been determined to involve land
acquisition, which include some loss of land use, crop losses, building modifications and other
property affects, and they are expected to include approximately 14 of the possible 20 project
sites. No sub-projects affecting sensitive coastal zones or endangered habitats have been
included under the program.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
Project activities are located throughout the capital island of Saint Vincent, Bequia, Union
Island, and Canouan. Civil works include urban infrastructure rehabilitation, retrofitting of key
government buildings, coastal sea defense construction, road construction, drainage
improvement, and river protection works. Some of the project activities, including slope
stabilization and coastal defense interventions would likely entail small amounts of land
acquisition.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Environmental Safeguards

In accordance with Bank environmental safeguards requirements, the program has been
classified as Category B, and the policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) is triggered.

Environmental Assessment. During project preparation, program-level Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) was completed and corresponding Environmental Management Framework
(EMF) for project implementation has been developed for each island. According to the EIAs,
works proposed under the program are largely rehabilitation and retrofitting of selected
infrastructure and public buildings, which are expected to be small and medium scale, generating
only minor and localized environmental impacts that are generally associated with the actual
construction phase of the works activities.

However, select works may involve new constructions - particularly those involving expanded
river defense works and drainage improvements, coastal protective structures and road
realignments, which may present the possibility for adverse environmental impacts. Each such
investment will be preceded by an investment-specific environmental assessment and in some
cases a social assessment and the development of associated management plans.

Natural Habitat. The program is not expected to impact critical natural habitats as no works are
currently planned in areas considered natural habitats. However, the Natural Habitats Policy (OP
4.04) is triggered as a precaution. The EMFs and the Operational Manuals include screening
procedures to ensure that potential sub-projects would not involve significant impacts to natural
habitats, in order to assure the proper application of the policy.



                                                                                               4
Physical Cultural Resources. It is highly unlikely that the current portfolio of proposed works
will impact physical cultural resources as no works are currently planned in areas of known
physical cultural resources. Nonetheless, the policy on Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) is
triggered as a precaution; the EMFs and the program’s Operational Manual for each island
include provisions to identify any impacts to physical cultural resources as part of the
environmental screening process for sub-projects. Additionally, all works contracts to be
executed under the project will include the application of environmental performance contract
clauses which, in addition to any requirements identified in the Environmental assessment,
include procedures for chance discovery of cultural/historical artifacts.


Social Safeguards

Involuntary Resettlement. Several activities both in Grenada and SVG have been determined to
involve land acquisition or resettlement, requiring the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard
(OP/BP 4.12) to be triggered. Since the exact nature and magnitude of land acquisition is yet to
be determined, a Resettlement Policy Framework is currently being finalized for each country,
which will outline the guidance for screening land acquisition and identify mechanisms for and
compensating affected communities. Where necessary, full-scale Social Impact Assessments and
the preparation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be undertaken, and implementation of
mitigation measures will be completed before the start of works.

Indigenous Peoples. The OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples is not expected to be triggered under
the program. However, during project preparation in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, the Bank
determined that the social assessment (SA) conducted as part of project preparation did extra due
diligence in consulting with and including the Garifuna population (located in Sandy Bay) and
documenting the outcomes of theses consultations. The SA findings confirmed that the
population does not meet the Bank’s definition of indigenous peoples and therefore OP 4.10 is
not triggered.

No issues relating to the program were identified requiring specific attention that is not addressed
under the Bank safeguard policy structure. No exceptions from Bank Safeguard policies are
being sought under this project.


2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.

The program neither stimulates indirect impacts nor induces future activities in the project areas.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

N/A




                                                                                                  5
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

Grenada:

Environment.
The government has prepared a program-level Environmental Assessment (EA) that examined
project activities and provided an environmental framework to guide project execution. Two
categories of projects have been identified that include those activities which will require a
stand-alone Environmental Assessment and those comprising uncomplicated rehabilitation works
where the impacts are limited to the construction phase (e.g. repair and retrofitting). To address
these activities, procedures have been included in the operations manual detailing requirements
for a stand-alone Environmental Assessment and the screening of uncomplicated activities for
the inclusion of environmental compliance contracting clauses to mitigate construction-related
impacts.

Sub-projects requiring an EA have been identified and contracting requirements have been
incorporated into the procurement plan. EAs will be completed during the preparation of works
activities and will establish environmental requirements for the design and construction phase of
the activity. Draft TORs are included in the operations manual. All such projects are subject to
prior review.

For uncomplicated activities, a screening procedure and draft construction contract clauses are
included in the operations manual to be applied as needed to works construction contracts.

As identified in the program-level EA, construction activities are located in urban centers and
along vulnerable roadway areas with respect to landslip and rock fall. No projects affecting
sensitive habitats, coastal zones, or involving any additional application of environmentally
related safeguard policy have been included.

Supervision for environmental compliance will be managed through the PCU in close
collaboration with the Ministry of Housing, Ministry or Works, Ministry of Planning and the
Ministry of Health and Environment as well as other affected ministries, and with the support of
the World Bank Environmental specialist. In addition to Bank requirements, the PCU will also
be responsible for ensuring the proper application of any national environmental laws. The PCU
will be responsible for ensuring environmental compliance in accordance with procedures
detailed in the Project Operations Manual and will be responsible for including these
requirements in associated works contracts as appropriate.

The PCU has managed several Bank projects and has experience with the application of Bank
Safeguard Procedures including the preparation of the project level EA for this project. While
the PCU does not support an environmental management staff, as needed, the PCU will engage
appropriate consultants to manage safeguard compliance. The PCU will contract the preparation
of EAs as required and will work closely with affected line ministries during EA preparation.
Additionally, in this case, subprojects are subject to prior review and the Bank will provide
supervision and technical assistance as required. Environmental Assessments TORs will be

                                                                                                6
forwarded to the Bank for review. EAs produced will be forwarded to the Bank for review prior
to the development of specific works contracts. All works contracts requiring an EA will be
subject to prior review and supervision missions will review project activities with respect to
environmental compliance.

Social.
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared and is currently being finalized. The
RPF will assist the PCU in: i) screening all subprojects for land acquisition and physical and/or
livelihood displacement resulting from such land acquisition; and ii) identifying documentation
and preparation requirements for compliance with World Bank Safeguards Policy. In the event
that some project activities lead to land acquisition and/or resettlement, Abbreviated
Resettlement Plans (ARPs) and/or Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), as may be applicable, will
be prepared for specific sub-projects in accordance with the program’s RPF.

During project preparation, the institutional capacity of the PCU to undertake the social
assessment and monitor safeguard compliance was assessed. It was concluded that the PCU
serves a fiduciary function and does not have staff with the requisite social development
credentials. A consultant has therefore been hired to undertake the social assessment and the
RPF. Given the potential significant social impacts generated by the project and the triggering of
OP/BP 4.12 by several sub-components, the PCU will throughout the implementation of the
project retain appropriately skilled part-time Social specialist to supervise the project elements
involving land acquisition and/or resettlement. Additionally, the Operations Manual will identify
focal persons in each of the relevant Government Ministries/implementing agencies who will
liaise directly with the PCU on these issues.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines:

Environment
During project preparation, GoSVG completed a program-level environmental assessment.
During the assessment, GoSVG identified 12 candidate projects of sufficient potential impact as
to require the preparation of environmental assessments under Bank Safeguard policies OP/BP
4.01. These projects will be subject to prior review.

An environmental screening procedure and application requirements is included in the project
operations manual and, in the case for works whose impacts relate to construction phase, a set of
standard environmental performance contract clauses has been provided.

The PSIPMU will initiate screening procedures as required and will modify construction
contracts as needed in the case of rehabilitation works. Specific works included in the portfolio
have been assessed as needing EAs prior to final design and execution. The PSIPMU will ensure
that EA findings are included in works contracts and that contracts require the implementation of
recommended Environmental Management Plans.

Having managed several Bank projects in the past, the PSIPMU has experience with the
application of Bank safeguards and most recently managed the preparation of the project level
EA for this project. The PSIPMU will engage appropriate consultants to provide compliance

                                                                                                7
support and will work closely with affected line ministries in the preparation of safeguard
compliance activities. Environmental Assessments TORs will be forwarded to the Bank for
review. EAs produced will be forwarded to the Bank for review prior to the development of
specific works contracts. All works contracts requiring an EA will be subject to prior review and
supervision missions will review project activities with respect to environmental compliance.

Social
An RPF has been prepared for the project. The RPF will assist the PSMPMU in: i) screening all
subprojects for land acquisition and physical and/or livelihood displacement resulting from such
land acquisition; and ii) identifying documentation and preparation requirements for compliance
with World Bank Safeguards Policy. In the event that some project activities lead to land
acquisition and/or resettlement, Abbreviated Resettlement Plans (ARPs) and/or Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs), as may be applicable, will be prepared for specific sub-projects in
accordance with the program’s RPF.

During project preparation, the institutional capacity of the PSMPMU to undertake the social
assessment and monitor safeguard compliance was assessed. It was concluded that the capacity
of the Social Development Specialist (SDS) - within the Social Policy Unit of the PSMPMU - to
manage the social and safeguard aspects of the project during implementation has been assessed
to be weak. It was therefore determined that a part-time social safeguards specialist be hired
during project implementation to assist the SDS.


5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, including the Safeguard Diagnostic Review (SDR) with an
emphasis on potentially affected people:

Environment
 For the majority of the works contemplated, activities involve the repair and retrofitting of
existing infrastructure. In these cases, impacts to stakeholders will relate to the temporary
inconveniences associated with construction activities. These construction activities are to be
managed to minimize these impacts to the extent possible. Public notifications will be used to
inform potentially affected persons in order that they may plan their activities to accommodate
construction. Relevant line ministries will assist the PSIPMU in St. Vincent and the PCU in
Grenada with the management of these activities. In the case of school rehabilitation, activities
are to be coordinated through the respective ministries of education to ensure activities are
managed to minimize impacts to students safety and maintain an effective learning environment.

Where subproject specific Social and Environmental Assessments are required, the EA process
requires the identification of specific stakeholders and the conduct of public meetings to inform
and include stakeholder concerns in the project design.

Two projects in Grenada have been identified where stakeholders involve specific local
communities. These are the improvement activities at La Sagesse and Beausejour. For these
activities, specific Social and Environmental Assessments will be required. Once specific
interventions have been identified, these assessments will be conducted and will require full

                                                                                               8
engagement of the affected communities through meetings and public consultations. Community
comments and concerns will be integrated into the project design and plans for public
engagement during construction activities will be provided as part of the assessment process. A
record of public meetings and community engagement activities will be required as part of the
assessment and implementation program.


Social
Land acquisition/involuntary resettlement concerns were integrated into the detailed social
assessments conducted during project preparation. In turn, the social assessments were based
upon extensive consultations with project stakeholders. In SVG, Focus Group Discussions and
Group Discussions as well as individual interviews with cross sections of the affected
populations were held in 19 separate locations across the Islands of Saint Vincent, Bequia and
Canouan and involved over 350 individuals. In Grenada impacts on land use, crops, buildings
and other property were determined to implicate approximately 14 of the possible 20 project sites
and involve up to 100 people. Stakeholders, include elderly residents in public facilities
(Grenada); pupils and teachers currently inhabiting dilapidated schools; communities,
businesses, public services in flood prone and landslide prone areas; communities frequenting
roads and bridges in various states of disrepair etc. The RPF’s will be disclosed in-country in a
manner accessible to project affected peoples, in addition social safeguard screening mechanisms
outlined in the respective RPF’s indicate that in the event that a sub-project activity triggers land
acquisition project beneficiaries will be consulted and fully compensated prior to the
commencement of any works.
