 2. Project Objectives
 The proposed project development objective (PDO) is to support the preparation of reforms
 for consumption subsidies and social security in order to improve the sustainability of the
 social protection system.
 3. Project Description

 International experience has demonstrated the need to have both accurate analysis of reform
 options as well as an effective management of the reform process, including dialogue and
 communication. The project will provide technical assistance to strengthen the Government’s
 capacity to more rapidly identify, prepare and formulate new regulation in coordination with
a broad array of stakeholders from different ministries and civil society.


The project will thus finance consulting services to provide technical assistance and support
to the Ministry of Finance for the implementation of a national dialogue and reforms plan,
which will liaise with an Economic Reforms Implementation Unit for coordinating the
implementation of high-profile and reforms that involve multiple stakeholders within the
Prime Minister’s Office.


The proposed project has three components: (1) Subsidy Reform; (2) Pension Reform, and
(3) Health Insurance Reform.

Technical assistance will comprise three broad categories:

      Development of the reform agenda: further refining and developing the
       Government’s concept for reform and elaborating a detailed implementation plan and
       schedule for its realization, including an analysis of technical and institutional
       barriers to meeting objectives and identifying alternative solutions;
      Design of reforms: helping to carry out the activities needed to implement the plan,
       including the reform of legislation, and
      Execution of reforms: including institutional capacity building and information and
       communication strategies required to implement the reforms.
