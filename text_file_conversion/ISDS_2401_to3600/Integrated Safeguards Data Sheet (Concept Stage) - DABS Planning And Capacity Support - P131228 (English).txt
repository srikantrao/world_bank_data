                         model itself and make use of training facilities. Such a utility would, ideally, be well performing,
                         relatively nearby, but with sufficient living memory that its staff can appreciate the challenges facing

                         progress of the proposed project will be essential to ensure that preparation of an investment project
                         is triggered at the right time and set at the right level of financing.

                               The capacity of DABS for safeguards is assessed as weak although senior management has
                               demonstrated commitment to improving its capacity by initially recruiting two safeguards specialists,
