                              The World Bank Government Services for Business Development (GSBD) Project is a GRANT under the WB Trust Fund for Gaza and the West
                              Bank (TFGWB) in the amount of US$ 3 million to support of the private sector development agenda of the National Development Plan (NDP)
                              2011-2013.

                              The NDP 2011-13 aims to shift the PA’s fiscal and institutional focus from reconstruction towards sustainability, by gradually reducing dependence
                              on foreign assistance, while continuing to improve the welfare of citizens. The private sector has a critical role to play in ensuring sustainability.
                              The PA is focusing efforts on improving the provision of services and information to enable businesses to grow and absorb a rapidly growing work
                              force. The proposed GSBD project’s goals are aligned with this effort.

                              The proposed GSBD Project's components are detailed as follows:

                              Component 1: Capacity Building to Promote Private Sector Development

                              The object of this component is to provide assistance to MoNE in delivering efficient and reliable data, information and services to companies in
                              the WB&G. Sub-components include:

                              Creation of the Business Development Unit (BDU)

                              The project will support MoNE in the establishment of the BDU to provide business related information, data and services to companies and
                              oversee MoNE’s business development agenda, through, inter alia, (i) the consolidation of information and knowledge on business policies,

                              MoNE’s technical contribution to the preparation of the investment climate assessment; and (iii) strengthening MoNE’s monitoring and evaluation
                              capacity including development and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of private sector
                              development initiatives.

                              The project will strengthen MoNE’s capacity in business development strategy through, inter alia, support for the preparation of surveys and
