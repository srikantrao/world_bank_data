                              consultants.

                              The proposed Project has four components: (i) increasing access to early childhood programs; (ii) upgrading general education content and
                              practices; (iii) improving learning environments; and (iv) strengthening system capacity. All components support major priorities of the MoE’s
                              education strategy (NSED) and medium-term Action Plan and complement support provided by donors.

                              Component One: Increasing access to quality early childhood programs (US$ 1.7 million equivalent; 10.5% of total project cost). The objective of
                              this component is to increase access to affordable and quality early childhood education (ECE) programs. As such this component would finance:
                              i) an analysis of the pre-school sector; ii) the reinforcement of state kindergartens and early learning centers; and iii) where possible, expansion of
                              the latter. The component would be implemented by the Department of Pre-School and General Secondary Education (DPGS). The Project would
                              finance technical assistance to support the DPGS to implement activities.

                              Component Two: Upgrading general education content and practices (US$ 1.75 million; 10.8% of total project cost). The objective of this
                              component is to focus the basic education program on competencies and broaden the teaching-learning process to encompass active learning
                              and formative assessment techniques. There are two sub-components, which focus on the primary and secondary levels, respectively. The
                              component would mainly finance: (i) training activities of teachers and methodologists; (ii) procurement and distribution of teaching-learning
                              materials. An impact evaluation on teacher-learning practices of the teacher training, and teaching-learning materials would be conducted at the
                              end of the project. For the secondary level, new standards and programs would be piloted for one subject (Mathematics). The component would
                              be managed by the Department of Pre-School and General Secondary Education (DPGS) and implemented by the Academy of Education (AOE)
                              and Republican Institute for In-Service Teacher Training (RIITT).

                              Component Three: Improved learning environments (US$ 11 million; 67.9% of total project cost). The objective of this component is to increase
                              access to improved learning environments in general secondary education. As such, this component would finance the construction or
                              rehabilitation of premises in approximately 40 schools, and provide them with furniture, to the benefit of approximately 18,000 students. The
                              Project would be managed by the Department of Capital Construction (DCC). It would finance technical assistance to assist the DCC to implement
                              sub-component 3.1, as well as a team of engineers to supervise work sites. It would also finance hiring a design firm to adjust standard designs to
                              specific work sites. The schools design will be done under ongoing FTI-3 once the sites are identified, as well as a qualified person to assist the
                              MOE in developing and monitoring site-specific Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) if needed.

                              Component Four: Strengthening system capacity (US$1.65 million; 10.2 % of total project cost). The objective of this component is to strengthen
                              the capacities at the central and local levels to manage the education system. It will have 5 subcomponents: (i) management capacity
                              strengthening, which would support: training, technical assistance and study tours to improve the capacities of the MoE; the development of an

                               M&E system for NSED; and the updating of NSED’s medium term action plan. This subcomponent would be implemented by the Department of
                               Personnel and Special Affairs (DPSA); (ii) directors training, which would finance training of school directors in financial management and
                               pedagogical leadersthip and would be implemented by the RIITT; (iii) per capita financing (PCF) which would finance the extension of PCF to the
                               preschool sector as well as its reinforcement in general education. This subcomponent would be implemented by the Department of Planning,
                               Budget Implemelntation and Forecasts in Education (DPB); (iv) EMIS, which would support the extension of the EMIS to preschool, vocational
                               education and training (VET) and higher education (HE). It would be implemented by the EMIS Department; and (v) Project management, which
                               would finance technical assistance and operating costs to: coordinate project activities with the various implementing agencies; support

                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any potential l arge scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                    As mentioned above along with different TA activities the project will finance also construction and rehabilitation of schools, as well as
                                  furnishing them. The proposed civil works may generate some environmental and social impacts. While these impacts are expected to be
                                  mostly positive (improved learning conditions, reduced student sick days), the project might also generate some adverse impacts which would
                                  be associated with possible land acquisition, air pollution, dust, noise, construction wastes, asbestos, occupational hazards, etc. All of these
                                  adverse impacts are minor, short term, site specific, and can be easily avoided and/or mitigated during project implementation. Taking into
                                  account the project might generate some environmental and social impacts it triggers the WB OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. As the
                                  new constructions may require land acquisition, the project triggers WB OPs 4.12. To address the resettlement issues the client has prepared a
                                  Resettlement Policy Framework which will be applied during the project implementation phase. The project will have no impacts on Forests and
                                  Natural Habitats as all activities will be implemented within the existing settlements. The client also confirmed the project will not support any
                                  projects involving buildings or archaeological sites which might be considered as Physical Cultural Resources and thus the WB OP 4.11 is not
                                  triggered.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                   The potential indirect and long term impacts are positive and relate to improved learning conditions and comfort for the students as well as
                                  reduced students sick days.
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                            prepared and applied for the similar Tajikistan Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund Grant 3 project (FTI – 3) project. The EMF: (i) outlines the
                            general anticipated environmental risks and impacts and associated mitigation measures, (ii) describes the process and provide specific
                            guidance on contents for preparation of Checklist Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and site-specific EMPs; and (iii) indicates
                            institutional responsibilities for preparation, review/approval, implementation and monitoring/reporting of the EMPs. Additionally the updated
                            EMF includes a new short section describing the requirements on handling asbestos material. As construction of buildings in new sites carries

                            additional risks associated with selection of the site, the EMF also includes a new section that provides a negative list of sites which will be not
                            considered as a location for the new school constructions.
                            The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Education which has assigned its Department of Capital Construction (DCC) as the main
                            subdivision responsible to the project implementation, including for responsibilities with regard to environmental and social safeguards. The
                            Ministry and DCC have adequate experience in implementing such projects as well as in ensuring compliance with the environmental and
                            social requirements as they have already implemented a similar Tajikistan FTI – 3 project. Several environmental reviews conducted previously
                            by the Bank team concluded that overall, environmental safeguards are being well taken care of under FTI-3. The DCC managers and its staff
                            have a good understanding of the EMF, EAs/EMPs and environmental risks associated with construction and demolition civil works. MoE has
                            also recruited well qualified engineers to supervise the works, including environmental aspects. Supervision and implementation support to the
                            DCC is provided at the central level by the Consultant Civil Works Engineer, at the oblast level by 2 Consultant Regional Engineers, and at the
                            site level by 13 Consultant-Site Engineers. All DCC engineers and relevant MoE staff have received training on the EMF; the training materials
                            were prepared by the Civil Works Engineer, who also delivered the training. Based on the FTI-3 EMF the DCC prepared site-specific EMPs for
                            all proposed investments. EMPs implementation is being monitored and properly documented.

                           The Resettlement Policy Framework will be used as a screening device for all activities involving temporary or permanent land acquisition. In
                           the event that such land acquisition results in temporary or permanent restrictions in land use, loss of access to resources or services or affects
                           any physical property, trees or crops, the affected persons will be consulted and informed and Resettlement Plans developed. Since the
                           previous projects have not had much experience with such Plans, the project has provision to employ an appropriately qualified person to assist
                           the MOE in the development and implementation of Resettlement Plans if any.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                            In the event that land acquisition results in affected livelihoods, the project will undertake consultation with the affected persons and prepare
                           RAPs. In case of a new school construction (in a settlement that previously lacked a school), a thorough social analysis of the catchment area
                           will be undertaken with special emphasis on identifying issues and needs of vulnerable sub-sections such as minority ethnic groups, female
                           headed households, girl students and handicapped.

                           The current EMF and RFP were consulted with key stakeholders in the country. The draft document in Tajik/Russian was initially disclosed by
                           the MoE for public comments on July 31, 2012 by posting the draft document on the Ministry web site: www.edu-maorif.tj. Until August 8, 2012
                           no comments have been received. A virtual conference for discussion of the EMF and RPF was conducted from August 1-13, 2012 with the
                           following ministries and departments of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan: Committee on Preservation of Environment, Agency on
                           Construction and Architecture, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Population, Committee on Extreme Situations and Civil Defence,
                           and the State Committee on Land Management and Civil Defense. Written comments are reflected and annexed in the final version of the EMF
                           and RPF, and where appropriate, incorporated in the documents. The Final version of the EMF and RFP were submitted to the WB for its
                           disclosure in the Infoshop and will be used during the project implementation.
