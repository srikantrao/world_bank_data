                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed Project is a follow on operation to the successful PAR I, which tested the model for improving market access.
                              In order to improve market access for small rural producers, the proposed Project will support the creation and maintenance of productive alliances
                              between small organized rural producers and effective value-adding buyers (intermediaries, retailers or transformers). Furthermore, it will empower
                              rural producers through the strengthening of self-managed grass-roots organizations; increase their access to productive assets and technology to
                              improve production; promote awareness and know-how on related environmental sustainability, and more effective, responsive and accountable
                              service provision at the local level. Three components have been designed to facilitate these aims:
                              (i)        Institutional support. Outputs from this component would include the identification of viable alliance plans, the institutional strengthening
                              of small-producer organizations and the consolidation of commercial relations between alliance parties.
                              (ii)       Implementation of rural alliances. This component would finance small-producer subprojects, designed to achieve agreed product
                              specifications, as well as small municipal public works required for the alliance viability. Alliances which introduce technological innovations and
                              provide access to more demanding markets would be eligible for greater funding levels than those which simply aim at increasing volume for
                              commodity production. Matching grants would cover goods, small works and technical assistance. Associations which have received funding from
                              PAR I, as well as those involved in non-agricultural production, would be eligible to receive funding for technical assistance only.
                              (iii)      Project management. In order to achieve effective and efficient implementation, this component would finance goods, consulting and
                              non-consulting services for project administration, M&E, transparency and accountability.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The Project would take place in three geographically different Departments across the country: (i) Northern La Paz; (ii) Santa Cruz and parts of
                              Beni; and (iii) the Chaco. These areas have been selected using criteria which identify poor municipalities with growth potential and exclude the
                              poorest and the richest municipalities of the country. A definitive list of eligible municipalities will be drawn before appraisal, depending on the total
                              funding available. In all Project areas, the Project will work with organized producer groups of indigenous peoples, peasant communities and
                              women.

                              The Departments include a variety of ecological regions spanning from high-altitude valleys to tropical humid forests. PAR I has already operated
                              in all these ecological zones, yet the proposed Project area encompasses new municipalities. The upcoming complementary EA will update the
                              earlier assessment of expected project impacts and requested environmental management guidelines for each ecological region, including a
                              specific view on each newly incorporated municipality.

                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           Overall Borrower capacity for safeguard implementation is low; however, safeguards management in PAR I has been satisfactory throughout
                           implementation. Based on an on-going Independent Environmental Assessment of PAR I, next phases of the Project preparation will contemplate
                           lessons learned and recommendations for improving the environmental know-how of the key stakeholders, for example the facilitators contracted
                           to support the implementation of the rural alliances.
