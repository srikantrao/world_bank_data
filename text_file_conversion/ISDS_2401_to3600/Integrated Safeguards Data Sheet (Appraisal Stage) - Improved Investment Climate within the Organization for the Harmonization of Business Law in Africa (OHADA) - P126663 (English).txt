                              3. Project Description

                              Project Components
                              1.        To achieve the above-mentioned objective, the Project consists of three components: (1) institutional strengthening of the OHADA
                              Secretariat and Project Implementation support; (2) institutional strengthening of the capacity of the Joint Court of Justice and Arbitration, and
                              Regional Superior Magistrate School (ERSUMA); and (3) improving corporate financial reporting.

                              Component 1: Institutional Strengthening of the OHADA Secretariat and Project Implementation Support (US$4.5 million)

                              2.        The objectives of this component are twofold: (1) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Permanent Secretariat to enable it to
                              discharge its institutional mandate by implementing critical recommendations of the 2009 operational and financial audits, and (2) to provide to the
                              Permanent Secretariat the needed assistance to become an effective project implementation unit (PIU).

                              Subcomponent 1.1: Strengthening the OHADA Secretariat institutional capacity

                              3.         Activities under this component are underpinned by the recommendations of the 2009 institutional and financial audits. These activities
                              will aim to (1) provide the necessary instruments and expertise to establish the Permanent Secretariat as an efficient organization to support
                              investment climate reforms in OHADA countries; (2) improve the financial autonomy of the organization; and (3) position OHADA as one of the key
                              instruments for business climate reforms in member countries. To this end, this component will focus on six activities:

                              a.          Improving OHADA organizational effectiveness and developing knowledge-sharing and operational process infrastructure. The project
                              will help establish systems and procedures that ensure organizational effectiveness and adequate coordination among the three OHADA
                              institutions and the OHADA member national commissions. The project will support the development of a digital law library, which will provide
                              electronic access to legal documents to internal users––other OHADA institutions and national commissions; and to external users––academics,
                              private sector, civil society, and other stakeholders.
                              b.          Enhancing leadership in formulating legislation. The legal department of the Permanent Secretariat plays a key role in identifying and
                              formulating legal reform projects within OHADA country members. The 2009 institutional audit found this unit understaffed and lacking the
                              adequate skill mix to carry out its technical mandate. To illustrate, as of February 2012, this unit comprised two legal experts. Therefore, to carry
                              out its mandate, the unit relies heavily on the expertise of the Permanent Secretary, who is statutorily mandated to the administrative management
                              of the Secretariat. Therefore, the project will provide technical assistance to reinforce the institution’s ability to identify and formulate new
                              regulation. Moreover, the project will finance feasibility studies for new reform areas (such as leasing, factoring, commercial arbitration, and dispute
                              settlements).
                              c.          Ensuring OHADA financial sustainability. The OHADA Permanent Secretary has difficulties in mobilizing the contributions of member
                                                                                                                                                                               Page 1 of 4
                         countries. Such difficulties negatively impact the implementation of activities by the Permanent Secretariat and jeopardize the long-term sustainab
                         ility of the organization. The project will provide technical assistance to assess the current funding scheme and highlight areas of improvement to
                         ensure full collection of the country members’ contributions. In addition, the study will explore alternative sources of funding, including fee-based
                         delivery of services or products by OHADA.
                         d.           Improving personnel management. The project will support the definition and implementation of a human resources management and
                         training system able to increase OHADA staff productivity and development. A needs assessment also will be conducted to prepare a multi-annual
                         training program for the entire staff that includes initial and follow-up training, and specialized technical training.

                         e.           Supporting OHADA outreach initiatives. The project will help OHADA elaborate and implement a communications strategy designed to
                         communicate the organization’s mandated role, achievements, and relevance. The strategy also will (1) promote the OHADA reforms agenda and
                         showcase success stories and achievements to strengthen governments' perception and facilitate resources mobilization and (2) support wide
                         dissemination of reforms and Uniform Acts.
                         f.           Monitoring and evaluation system of reforms implementation in member countries. The project will finance technical assistance to the
                         Permanent Secretariat for the design and implementation of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems to track the implementation of OHADA
                         reforms and their impact on the investment climates in the 17 member countries.

                         4.          OHADA national commissions will be fully involved in the reforms that will be undertaken in the context of this project. Their participation
                         is a result of the existing practices in amending any uniform acts. While the OHADA Permanent Secretariat leads the reform process, it fully
                         involves the national commissions of the member countries. Such strengthening of the OHADA Secretariat’s capacity, coupled with the new reform
                         momentum, should result in greater interaction between the OHADA Permanent Secretariat and the respective OHADA national commissions.

                         Subcomponent 1.2 Project implementation support

                         5.        In line with the spirit of the Paris Declaration and the increased emphasis on national systems to implement projects, the project will be
                         implemented by the OHADA Permanent Secretariat. No project-specific Implementation Unit will be set up. The Permanent Secretariat will carry
                         out technical aspects of project activities relating to its institutional strengthening and will have overall responsibility to manage project
                         administration. The latter will include the project’s fiduciary and administrative aspects, which cover financial management, disbursements, and
                         procurement for all participating institutions. The Permanent Secretary, recently recruited through an internationally competitive process, will be the
                         Project Coordinator. The project will help recruit and finance costs associated with the Permanent Secretariat’s fiduciary team, which includes a
                         procurement specialist and a financial management specialist. To strengthen rather than undermine the sustainability of the institution, the project
                         is not expected to finance operational costs forOHADA.

                         6.          This subcomponent also will finance carrying out strategic and logistic activities to backstop the efficient coordination of the institutions
                         responsible for the reforms supported by the Project and related activities by the Permanent Secretariat. An example of the latter activities is bi-
                         annual meetings with all the OHADA national commissions to take stock of reforms and to identify and agree on the next set of reforms. These
                         latter activities are essential to ensure effective implementation of reforms undertaken to date and planned by this project. While the project is not
                         providing direct technical assistance to OHADA national commissions, the project will support activities that can be undertaken at the regional level
                         to ensure greater effectiveness at the national level.

                         Component 2: Institutional Strengthening of the Joint Court of Justice and Arbitration (CCJA) and Regional Superior Magistrate School (ERSUMA)
                         (US$3.6 million)

                         7.        A strengthened, structured, and well-organized Permanent Secretariat alone is not sufficient to reassure private investors and improve

                         the investment climate within OHADA member countries. Judicial security is a key element of the orderly execution of commercial transactions and
                         of an enabling investment climate.

                         Subcomponent 2.1 Strengthening the institutional capacity of CCJA

                         8.           Given the project’s objectives of improving the investment climate within the OHADA, this subcomponent aims at strengthening and
                         improving the performance of this key judicial institution, both in efficiency and quality. Subcomponent 2.1 will include the following key activities:
                         a)          Promoting Arbitration and other alternative Dispute Resolutions (ADR) mechanisms. ADR mechanisms are essential in settling
                         commercial dispute and have proven effective across regions in the last few decades. ADR mechanisms offer not only alternative means of
                         resolving disputes but also an entirely more efficient way of doing business. Opening the possibility of ADR mechanisms in the OHADA region will
                         enhance its ability to facilitate business transactions throughout the region. International investors favor ADR for the resolution of transnational
                         disputes that are outside unfamiliar foreign court systems. The proposed project will support the use of ADR mechanisms by financing three main
                         activities: (1) strengthening the Institutional Arbitration organized by the CCJA, which doubles as the Arbitration Center; (2) revising the Uniform
                         Act on Arbitration to foster increased use of and access to arbitration; and (3) delivering training and awareness programs on the best practices in
                         Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolutions. For example, the revised Uniform Act should provide for a fast-track arbitration procedure and
                         correct some difficulties regarding the articulation between the CCJA Arbitration rules and the ad hoc Arbitration under the Uniform Act on
                         Arbitration itself.
                         b)          Supporting the interoperability of the computerized regional commercial registry, or Registre du Commerce et du Crédit Mobilier
                         (RCCM). The establishment of a functional regional RCCM requires functioning national RCCMs. Through several World Bank projects at the
                         national level, these national RCCMs are being, and will be, computerized. This project would complement these actions at the national level by
                         financing regional activities for the RCCM. More specifically, the project will support the upgrading and the finalization of the computerization
                         process of the regional RCCM. This includes technical assistance for adhering to the e-government platform norms and standards at the regional
                         level for the Regional RCCM as well as ensuring inter-operability and connectivity with the already computerized national commercial registries.
                         c)          Strengthening the CCJA’s internal capacity. The support under this sub component will include actions targeted on improving court
                         administration by providing limited equipment and technical assistance.

                         Subcomponent 2.2 Institutional strengthening of Regional Superior Magistrate School (ERSUMA)

                         9.         The objective of this subcomponent is to assist the ongoing efforts to strengthen the institutional capacity of ERSUMA and support its
                         mission. Project assistance therefore will focus on:
                         a.         Strengthening ERSUMA’s capacity. The project will finance the review of the relevance of the curriculum and course content provided,
                         and the design and implementation of a strategy that would use all technologies, including web-based, to deliver training across OHADA member
                         countries.
                                                                                                                                                                 Page 2 of 4
                               b.        Improving the delivery of selected training. The project will finance the reformulation of the curriculum and courses delivered by
                               ERSUMA. The project also will provide technical assistance including the delivery of four selected courses on OHADA laws. In addition, the project
                               will use ERSUMA’s location and staff to deliver training on ADR mechanisms.
                               c.        Fostering research, documentation, and dissemination of the courses and other publications. The project will finance the acquisition of
                               the books and didactic materials necessary for the Centre de Documentation de l’ERSUMA.

                               Component 3: Improving Corporate Financial Reporting (US$6.4 million)
Public Disclosure Copy




                               10.      This component aims at improving corporate financial reporting in OHADA countries. It includes three subcomponents: (1) improving
                               accounting standards, (2) strengthening professional standards and practices, and (3) developing a regional professional qualification curriculum.

                               Subcomponent 3.1 Improving accounting standards

                               11.        The objective of this subcomponent is to assist the OHADA Secretariat in modernizing accounting standards by (1) adopting the
                               International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board for Public Interest Entities (listed companies,
                               banks, insurance companies and State-Owned Enterprises) and disseminating the new accounting standards, (2) reviewing and updating the
                               SYSCOHADA for small and medium enterprises, and (3) strengthening the human and technical capacity of CNC OHADA. Successful
                               implementation of this subcomponent will converge with IFAC’s SMO 7 (International Financial Reporting Standards).
