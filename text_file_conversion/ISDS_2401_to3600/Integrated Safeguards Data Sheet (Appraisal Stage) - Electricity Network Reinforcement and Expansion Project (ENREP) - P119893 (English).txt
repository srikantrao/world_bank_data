                              The Development Objectives of the Electricity Network Reinforcement and Expansion Project are to improve reliability of the electricity network
                              and to increase access to electricity services in Ethiopia.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed project consists of four components: (i) Reinforcement of Electricity Network (Upgrade and Expansion), (ii) Access Scale-Up, (iii)
                              Market Development for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Products, and (iv) Modernization Support and Capacity Building to enable
                              government of Ethiopia (GOE) to meet its electrification goals over the next 5 years.

                              Component 1: Reinforcement of Electricity Network (estimated US$100 million): Reinforcement of the electricity transmission network component
                              includes two sub-components: (i) grid upgrade and (ii) grid extension in order to improve the overall service delivery of the Ethiopian electricity
                              network.

                              Component 2: Access Scale-Up (estimated US$50 million): This component includes extension of distribution network and intensification of
                              connections to the households and villages in the areas already connected by the grid and enhance connectivity in newly connected areas.

                              Component 3: Market Development for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Product (estimated US$40 million): This component will provide
                              access to finance to promote off-grid renewable energy programs to complement the electricity grid connection program. Development of off-grid
                              renewable energy programs such as, stand-alone solar home systems, solar lanterns, improved cook-stoves, biogas, etc. will provide modern
                              energy services to households in the areas that are not yet connected to the grid, and to those in the grid connected areas who are unable to
                              afford a connection.

                              Component 4: Modernization Support (estimated US$10 million): This technical assistance component includes support for key aspects of the
                              Government’s modernization program for Ethiopian Electric and Power Corporation (EEPCO) including enhanced planning capabilities, operational
                              efficiency improvements, contract management, asset management and other required commercial utility good practices. This component will also
                              include capacity building for Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs), and Alternative Energy Technology
                              Promotion and Dissemination Directorate (AETPDD) – Ministry of Water and Energy (MOWE).

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will be implemented nationally. The Project will renovate existing transmission lines which are now overloaded and operating above
                              optimum capacity. These transmission lines extends from the national grid to the distribution networks, draw electricity from a variety of lines, and
                              are not directly connected to any specific generation plants. The new transmission lines that will be constructed under the project will transfer
                              electricity from the existing grid network to new unelectrified villages to extend electricity network and increase access to electricity.

                                 nearby aquatic/drainage systems; air pollution; soil and water contamination from both liquid and solid waste; hazardous chemical poisoning of
                                 biotic life from use of weedicides and herbicides; etc) are foreseen during the construction phase as vegetation will be cleared to pave way for
                                 erecting substations and towers for power lines, constructing camp sites, material storage facilities, and access roads. The substations and
                                 power lines would avoid going through forests and natural habitats including protected areas, swamps/wetlands and any fragile and sensitive
                                 aquatic habitats. It is likely that transmission and distribution lines may traverse culturally sensitive sites such as graveyards, archaeological
                                 sites, etc.

                                 Electric power transmission lines are linear facilities in nature and since the work is mostly upgrading of the existing power transmission
                                 facilities through low and medium voltage distribution lines adverse social impacts will be limited. As a linear facility, the impacts of transmission
                                 line will be mostly localized within the Right-of-Way (ROW). The impact can be minimized through careful route selection. This type of
                                 distribution lines normally follows the road network except for bends and curves where it is more economical to make shortcut if that is
                                 technically feasible.
                                                                                                                                                                           Page 2 of 4
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                             The project area covers all nine Ethiopian’s Regional States, namely Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromiya, Somali, Benshangul Gumuz, Southern
                           Nations, Nationalities and Peoples (S.N.N.P), Gambela, and Harari Regional States. The specific locations and routes for the construction of
                           the electricity distribution lines in specific rural and urban towns are not yet known and will be identified after the project approval. While the
                           long term impacts of the project will most certainly have a positive impact on the lives of the poor people generally and a sustainable economic
                           development of the country. In the short term, during the construction phase, the implementation of the project components under the ENREP
                           might create adverse social impacts on the lives of the population living in the project areas. Consequently, to minimize the adverse social

                           impacts, such as loss of property and assets, income loss, involuntary resettlement and relocation, EEPCO has developed an Environmental
                           and Social Management Framework (ESMF) including a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to identify potential adverse social and
                           environmental impacts and to adequately mitigate these.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                             As the project objective is to reinforce the existing grid network and then expand electricity to newer areas, following the existing Right-of-Way
                           (ROW) rout is the least cost solution in terms of investment requirement and also environment and social impact. The project will mostly follow
                           the existing ROW. However, as the specific project sights are identified a detailed ESIA/EMP would be carried out to identify the best
                           implementable solution.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.
                            The project would take preventive mitigation measures to remediate any potential threats during the construction and O&M phases. A key
                           undertaking prior to starting the project would be to ensure the incorporation and implementation of the environmental and social clauses
                           annexed to the main ESMF into the works contract; and that an effective multi-stakeholder institutional and implementation framework/
                           arrangement is put in place for the management (including safeguard management) of all aspects of the project. This should include actions for
                           capacity building, training and skills upgrade.

                           The Borrower capacity to ensure environmental due diligence of the project is satisfactory. The Environmental and Social Management Unit
                           (ESMU) under EEPCO will implement and monitor the ESMFs. ESMU has implemented series of ESMFs and other safeguard instruments for
                           the EEPCO in a number of donor financed projects in the energy sector including hydropower generation, transmission and distribution.
                           ESMU’s capacity therefore has been enhanced through the active involvements in these projects and also on the number of in-house and
                           external training and skills upgrade received. However, given the sheer load of projects under their management, the ESMU’s capacity is under
                           stress. To mitigate this risk, an extensive program of capacity building will be financed as part of Modernization Support under the ENREP.
                           Under this component, EEPCO will contract experienced consultants to support EEPCO staff on social and environmental impact management
                           throughout the construction and the implementation of the project.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                            on potentially affected people.
                             In accordance with the World Bank’s operational policies, stakeholder consultations in the field with public and private sector institutions,
                           research and academia, civil society organizations, traditional authorities, communities groups have formed part of the ESMF formulation.
                           Stakeholder workshops have been carried out to discuss all aspects of the project prior to finalization of the ESMF. These workshops have had
                           the purpose of listening to all key beneficiary and stakeholder groups, particularly project affected persons/communities (PAPs); seeking
                           feedback and consensus from stakeholders; and incorporating comments, suggestions and remediation proposals into the ESMF and other
                           safeguard instruments. The final ESMF and the RPF have been publicly disclosed at the Bank’s InfoShop on January 20, 2012. These have
