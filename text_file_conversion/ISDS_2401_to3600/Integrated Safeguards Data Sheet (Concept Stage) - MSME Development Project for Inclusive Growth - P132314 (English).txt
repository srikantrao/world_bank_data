                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed operation’s development objective is to contribute to an improvement in access to
                           finance for MSMEs in Jordan.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed operation will be a FIL (as per the World Bank Operations Policy Directive OP 8.30)
                           in the amount of US$ 70 million. The Bank loan will be channeled through the CBJ—the envisioned
                           project implementing entity—which will be responsible for communicating the features of the loan
                           to the financial intermediaries and negotiating loan contracts.
                           The operation will enhance the role of financial institutions in economic growth through financing
                           and developing the MSME sector in Jordan, as well as, provide a special focus on increased long and
                           medium-term financing for these enterprises’ investment, and working capital. The line of credit will
                         also encourage the growth and expansion of new and existing enterprises, act as an incentive for
                         enterprises that previously refrained from accessing the formal finance market to tap on it. The line
                         of credit will not, however, support loan restructuring cases. The main clients will be the unbanked,

                         and existing clients that need longer maturity or additional financing.
                         The operation will be comprised of a line of credit that will be channeled through the CBJ to banks
                         that either have an active MSME portfolio or the willingness and capacity to develop one. The banks
                         will then on-lend the funding to micro and small enterprises or microfinance institutions and
                         financial leasing companies that will on-lend to MSMEs. Lending will only take place if the potential
                         bank meets specific eligibility criteria that will be designed based on similar operations elsewhere in
                         the region. These eligibility criteria will be agreed on with the Jordanian authorities and will include
                         ratios and benchmarks the bank will need to meet in order to gain access to the credit line.
                         Access to the line of credit will be subject to eligibility criteria and clear terms and conditions,
                         including commitments to, and time-bound actions towards, improving the quality and quantum of
                         bank lending to MSMEs. They will include specific ratios and benchmarks that will be designed with
                         the CBJ and will need to be met in order for the bank to receive the loan under the operation.
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the               safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented nationwide in all Jordanian governorates.

                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         Due to the very small scale of financing for the sub-projects under this project (between JD 100 and
                         JD 25,000), project activities are not expected to result in any potential large scale, significant and/or
                         irreversible impacts. Nonetheless, the sub-projects may result in minor negative environmental and
                         social impacts. Such impacts will be effectively mitigated through the development of an
                         Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and accompanying Environment and Social
                         Management Framework (ESMF), to be written and implemented by CBJ, the proposed
                         implementing agency.
                         CBJ will need to ensure that the borrowing banks adopt and implement the ESMF (or screening of

                         subprojects, and that IDA funds will not be used towards the funding of any category A type sub-
                         projects or other projects included in a negative list to be developed.
                         For successful safeguards implementation, the client’s social and environmental safeguards capacity
                         needs to be assessed, and arrangements made to ensure that the CBJ will have the necessary capacity
                         for safeguards management and monitoring. The CBJ will be responsible to ensure the necessary
                         compliance of borrowers, banks, financial intermediaries, etc. Consultant(s) with social and
                         environmental safeguards skills will be hired to assist CBJ in assessing the safeguards capacity of the
                         banks and other FI as part of the criteria of selection outlined in the Operations Manual. CBJ will be
                         responsible for additional training and monitoring of banks and other micro-finance institutions in
                         both social and environmental safeguards issues.
                         In terms of reporting on compliance with the ESIA/ESMF, CBJ will recruit capacity with requisite
                         social and social skills to undertake an annual social and environmental compliance and performance
                         audit, which the Governor of CBJ will share with the World Bank.
                         CBJ would ensure that necessary capacity building on safeguards is provided through the banks or
                         other means as needed in the chain of on-lending to micro enterprises and ESIA requirements will be
                         incorporated into Operations Manuals.
                         Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed. CBJ will
                         develop an ESIA/ESMF including elements that will need to be incorporated into each of the two
                         components’ Operations Manuals. This will be completed prior to project appraisal.
