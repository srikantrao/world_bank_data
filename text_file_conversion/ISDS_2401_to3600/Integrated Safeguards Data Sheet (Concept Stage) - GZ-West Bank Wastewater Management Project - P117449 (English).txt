                              The proposed project would aim to implement the first phase of the waste water management program for Hebron Governorate envisaged in the
                              West Bank Water Resources Program. It has two overall objectives: (i) to reduce the environmental pollution from wastewater produced in the
                              Hebron Governorate; and (ii) to provide a reliable supply of treated effluent and biosolids suitable for reuse in agriculture in the area.

                              C. Project Description

                              The project would implement the first phase of the Hebron Wastewater Master Plan, including: (i) the design, construction and operation of a
                              regional wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) for the Hebron Governorate; (ii) the design and construction of facilities for reuse of WWTP effluents
                              and biosolids in agriculture; (iii) capacity building of the organizations in charge of operation and maintenance of the WWTP and the waste water
                              reuse scheme; (iv) establishment and capacity building of a water users association for reuse of treated effluents; (v) establishing a Project
                              Implementation Unit. Beneficiaries would be communities affected by the uncontrolled disposal of raw sewage in the area of Wadi Hebron, the
                              farming communities that would have access to treated waste water in the Hebron Governorate, the PWA and the organization or organizations
                              that will manage the waste water treatment and reuse facilities.

                              Key Results

                              The proposed project would aim to achieve the following key results: (i) secondary treatment of the current wastewater stream discharged in Wadi
                              As-Samen, and corresponding reduction of nutrient loads in the wadi and infiltrating in the aquifer; (ii) sustainably managed treatment capacity of
                              projected additional wastewater loads; (iii) increase of water availability for irrigating farmers; (iv) reducing the annual wastewater treatment
                              charges levied by the Government of Israel to the Palestinian Authority; and (v) increase organic matter on the lands benefiting from treated
                              biosolids applications.

                              E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                              PWA and Hebron Municipality have limited capacity to implement World Bank safeguards procedures. It is therefore expected that qualified local
                              expert consultants may have to be hired by the PMU to support the preparation and implementation of safeguards instruments, depending on the
                              exact scope and content of these.
