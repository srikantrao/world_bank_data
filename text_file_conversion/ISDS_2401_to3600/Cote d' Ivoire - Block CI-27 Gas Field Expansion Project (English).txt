2. Project Objectives:

The Project’s Development Objective (PDO) is to maintain the availability of clean natural gas for lower
cost power generation.

3. Project Description:

The proposed operation consists of a credit enhancement mechanism to mitigate the risks of the low credit
worthiness of the power sector and the GoCI, thus enabling private investment in the expansion of the CI-
27 block gas fields. The proposed instrument is a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) back-stopping gas
payments under a Gas Supply and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) entered between GoCI and the Block CI-
27 Joint Venture Partners (JV), Foxtrot International, SECI, ENERCI and PETROCI.

Foxtrot is the only field in Block CI-27 currently in operation. Gas and a small volume of oil are
transported via pipelines to the Vridi terminal in Abidjan, where the gas is sold to the Azito and CIPREL
power stations and the oil to the SIR refinery. The supply lines and facilities that service the existing
Foxtrot platform will be reconfigured to ensure reliability and uninterrupted gas supply after the field
expansion.

The Marlin field will be developed as a new separate four-leg fixed platform with eight slots and five wells.
The Marlin platform was ordered in February 2013, after a 2 year delay, resulting from the unstable
political situation in Côte d'Ivoire, and gas payment arrears of the power sector.

The investment will enable Block CI-27 to reach a peak production capability of 154 mmscfd and allow
liquid handling of 12,000 bbls/day, with a contractual commitment to produce and sell gas to GoCI until
2024.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the assessment of environmental
and social risks and impacts:

Block CI-27 is located offshore Côte d’Ivoire approximately 70km southwest of Abidjan. It is part of
several blocks identified in this area, which have gas and oil potential. Some of these blocks are still being
explored while others are in production.

On the Foxtrot platform, which has been operational for several years (start-up was in 1999) will have its
supply lines and some other facilities reconfigured in order to operate in conjunction with the future Marlin
platform and ensure reliability and uninterrupted gas supply.

Regarding the Marlin field, it is located 18km off-shore of the coastal city of Jacqueville and 8 km away
from the Foxtrot platform to which it will be connected in order to manage efficiently the liquid and gas
production from these two platforms. An exploration campaign will be conducted slightly north of the
Marlin field and 6km from the coastline and will consist in a 45 days drilling campaign using an
exploration platform (Sapphire Driller).

The activities above have been subjected to Environmental and Social Impact assessments in compliance
with the government of Ivory Coast regulations (in particular the decree 96-984 dated November 8 1996).
The government has issued the required permits and is also now reviewing for validation an environmental
and social audit submitted by the Foxtrot Company.

6. Applicable Performance Standards                                 Yes          No          TBD
PS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and                 X
Social Risks and Impacts
The project has been categorized as a Category A project in accordance with the draft Bank procedure
applicable to Performance Standards.

The proposed works to install the Marlin Platform, pipelines and development of drilling operations, the
future oil and gas production as well as existing operations on the Foxtrot Platform present potential
significant adverse environmental and social impacts which may affect an area broader than the sites and/or
facilities given its location near ecologically sensitive areas. The key environmental and social issues
include: air quality and emissions, noise, management of drilling wastes and cuttings, oil spills,
occupational health and safety, aquatic/benthic life disturbance (marine mammals and turtles), well

blowout, community health and safety, accidental ruptures of pipelines, fishing activities, hazardous
materials and waste management. These potential risks and impacts can be managed through mitigation
measures and/or well-known procedures and technologies.

PS 2: Labor and Working Conditions                                       X
Foxtrot follows labor and working conditions policies compatible with international practice.
PS 3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention                       X
The Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS), prepared by MIGA, provides information that
the project follows good international industry practice as found in MARPOL, API standards, Guidelines of
the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers, etc. Moreover the updated ESIA refers and is
consistent with the WBG EHSGs for Offshore Oil & Gas.
PS 4: Community Health, Safety, and Security                             X
The company has emergency response procedures in place compatible with international practice, in
particular with regards to oil spills response
PS 5: Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement                      X
In its report, MIGA concluded that there were no major social safeguards risks for the operation. However
a land compensation claim was submitted to Foxtrot by a single party in February 2013, after approval of
the MIGA Guarantee. The Bank has consequently decided to apply PS5. The updated and consolidated
ESIA describes the issue as well as its resolution in a way that is satisfactory to the parties. The Bank has
exercised particular due diligence on the issue and has carried out an audit on the ground to ascertain that
the situation has been resolved satisfactorily for the concerned parties. This audit confirmed is consistent
with the description of the situation in the consolidated ESIA.
PS 6: Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management                 X
of Living Natural Resources
    See above
PS 7: Indigenous Peoples                                                                X
Indigenous People PS is not applicable as no indigenous peoples, as defined by the policy, have been
identified in the vicinity of the project area
PS 8: Cultural Heritage                                                                 X
Cultural Heritage PS is not applicable as no impacts to cultural resources have been identified resulting
from on-shore or offshore activities.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
This project is Category “A? under MIGA’s Policy on Social and Environmental Sustainability as well as
under the Bank/IDA draft procedures applicable to Performance Standards. The proposed works to install
the Marlin Platform, pipelines and development of drilling operations, the production and post-exploitation
operations as well as existing operations of the Foxtrot Platform and on shore pipelines and terminals
present potential significant adverse environmental and social impacts which may affect an area broader
than the sites and/or facilities given its location near ecologically sensitive areas.

The key environmental and social issues include: air quality and emissions, noise, management of drilling
wastes and cuttings, occupational health and safety, aquatic/benthic life disturbance (marine mammals and
turtles), well blowout, oil spill, accidental ruptures of pipelines, community health and safety, fishing
activities, hazardous materials and waste management. These potential risks and impacts can be managed
through mitigation measures and/or well-known procedures and engineering technology.

Further information are available in the Environmental and Social Review Summary prepared and
disclosed by MIGA (link: http://www.miga.org/projects/index.cfm?esrsid=63) and disclosed on August 30,
2012.
