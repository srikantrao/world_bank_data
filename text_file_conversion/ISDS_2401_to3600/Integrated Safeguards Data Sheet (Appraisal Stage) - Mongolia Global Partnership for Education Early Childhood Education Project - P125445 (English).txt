                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 As the construction for kindergartens is going to be undertaken in urban areas, there are likely to be some concerns relating to inconveniences
                                 or nuisances (e.g. dust, noise, construction waste) to surrounding areas during construction. However, these potential impacts on the
                                 environment are deemed to be minor, site-specific, and reversible in nature, and for which mitigation measures can be readily designed.

                                 The Bank's OP/BP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples was triggered because one of the subcomponents will be implemented in Bayan-Ulgii, which
                                 has a majority of Kazakh inhabitants. The Kazakh is an ethnic group distinct from Mongolians and according to OP4.10, the Kazakh
                                 communities are Indigenous People.

                                 All proposed 40 construction sites will be located on state-owned land and the use of land will not result in any (i) relocation or loss of shelter;
                                 (ii) lost of assets or access to assets; or (iii) loss of income sources or means of livelihood. Therefore, Bank's OP4.12 on Involuntary
                                 Resettlement was not triggered.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 N/A
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                 N/A
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.
                                 On environmental safeguards:

                                 Given the nature and small scale of the proposed civil works under the project, a formal environmental assessment report was not considered
                                 necessary. For the purpose of enhancing environmentally-friendly measures and mitigating any adverse impacts caused by the construction
                                 activities, an Environmental Safeguard Guideline has been prepared. It includes a checklist on construction sites, a checklist on
                                 Environmentally-Friendly Design Criteria, a standardized Environmental Management Plan, institutional arrangements to follow the Guideline,

                                 as well as requirements on monitoring, supervision and reporting. These guidelines will be included in the requisite bidding documents.

                                 Institutional Capacity
                                 At the management level, MECS, in cooperation with the Education Donor Consultative Mechanism (EDCM) and the World Bank, the Trustee
                                 of the Global Partnership for Education, will lead project activities. The PIU will be responsible for everyday implementation of the grant at the
                                 operational level. The MECS will appoint a Designated Technical Officer who manages the proposed civil works under their respective
                                 components. Separately a designated Safeguards Officer will be appointed in MECS who will be responsible for scrutinizing the environmental
                                 safeguards issues involved in each civil works project. The institutional capacity is deemed to be adequate for the project.

                                 On social safeguards:
                                 A social assessment was conducted in July 2011 to evaluate the subcomponent's potential positive and adverse effects on the Kazakh
                                 communities in Bayan-Ulgii and examine project alternatives where adverse effects may be significant. The assessment showed the strong
                                 support from the communities for the implementation of the subcomponent. Since the Kazakh communities are the overwhelming majority of the
                                 beneficiaries in Bayan-Ulgii, and the element of an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) will be included in the overall project design, a separate IPP
                                 is not required.
                               5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                                  on potentially affected people.
                                 On environmental safeguards:

                                 Public consultations have been conducted including consultation meetings with the project affected people and other stakeholders regarding
                                 the project and their concerns. Their feedback has been taken into account in the Environmental Safeguards Guidelines and the project design.

                                 The Environmental Safeguards Guidelines have been publicly disclosed on the MECS website, as well as in the two largest libraries within
                                 Ulaanbaatar (40 hardcopies of the guidelines were delivered to both the Mongolian National Library and the Library of Natsagdorj.) All 21 aimag
                                 education departments have disclosed the guidelines on their websites.

                                 On social safeguards:
                                 Free, prior and informed consultation with Kazakh communities has been conducted during the social assessment exercise. Focus group
                                 discussions with parents of kindergarten age children, kindergarten teachers, residents near project site and other stakeholders were
                                 conducted. Local government leaders, education professionals, and NGOs were interviewed.
