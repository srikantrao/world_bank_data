2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the Project is to improve the understanding of earthquake risk in Bhutan as well as
opportunities and challenges associated to its mitigation.

3. Project Description:
The Project consists of the following parts:

Part A: Investigations and Mapping for Improved Understanding of Seismic Risk

        Provision of goods, technical assistance, and training in collecting and integrating available
        information on earthquake hazards and seismic vulnerability in one single platform using the Global
        Earthquake Model methodology.

Part B: National Vulnerability Assessment and Retrofitting

        Provision of goods, works, technical assistance, and training in building capacity and providing tools
        for the Bhutanese Engineering community to improve seismic resilience of engineered buildings by:
        (i) compiling and updating guidelines for vulnerability assessments of buildings such as load bearing
        brick masonry buildings, stone masonry with mud mortar/cement mortar, rammed earth construction
        and reinforced concrete buildings with brick infill, and selected critical buildings such as hospitals
        and schools; (ii) forming an inter-department engineering task force for vulnerability assessments
        and retrofitting; (iii) preparing detailed vulnerability assessment and carrying out pilot retrofitting in
        selected public buildings; (iv) developing seismic resistance designs for new constructions and
        seismic retrofit for engineered buildings; (v) developing Geographic Information System-based
        database of assets and their vulnerability; (vi) developing archive of all collected information; (vii)
        creating awareness and familiarization of additional earthquake engineering components by
        involving students and lecturers of colleges and/or vocational training institutes in the vulnerability
        assessment and retrofitting projects; (viii) analyzing lessons learned from strengthening of guidelines
        and pilot retrofitting; and (ix) developing non-structural risk mitigation plans and manuals for
        selected sectors.

Part C: Improving Seismic Resilience of Traditional Bhutanese Buildings

        Provision of goods, technical assistance, and training in improving general understanding of existing
        construction technologies for traditional buildings and pilot strategies for improving seismic
        resilience of traditional buildings by: (i) developing seismic resistance designs for new construction
        of traditional buildings; (ii) reviewing existing construction practices and identifying seismic resilient
        features to be promoted; (iii) preparing a strategy for incorporation of seismic resilient features
        compatible to the local architecture and construction materials; (iv) capacity building of stakeholders
        on the design and methodology of new construction of traditional buildings; and (v) preparing skill
        development strategy to improve existing construction techniques.

Part D: Development of Emergency Structural Assessment Capacity

        Provision of technical assistance and training in developing structural assessment format suitable to
various typologies of buildings, including capacity building of local engineers to carry out the task by: (i)
developing guidelines for post-disaster structural assessment; (ii) contingency planning and developing
resource mobilization plan; and (iii) training of members of post-disaster structural teams.

Part E: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation

        Provision of technical assistance in supporting the project implementation, monitoring and
evaluation.


4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
 The project will be carried out in Bhutan. Physical works are envisaged in Component B:
National vulnerability assessment and retrofitting. This would consist in seismic retrofitting of
up to five existing public buildings (e.g. schools or health centres). Limited impact can be
expected from the related construction activities. The pilot retrofitting would be carried out on
engineered buildings and no physical intervention on cultural heritage buildings is envisaged.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Physical works are envisaged in Component B: National vulnerability assessment and
retrofitting. This would consist in seismic retrofitting of up to five existing public buildings (e.g.
schools or health centres). Limited impact can be expected from the related construction
activities. The pilot retrofitting would be carried out on engineered buildings and no physical
intervention on cultural heritage buildings is envisaged.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

No potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project
area have been identified.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:

N/A as no potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area have been identified

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

The proposed nodal Implementing Agency for the Project is the Department of Disaster
Management (DDM). The implementing agency will be responsible for: (i) ensuring the timely
procurement of consultants, works and equipment under the Project, in compliance with World
Bank fiduciary requirements, (ii) coordinating with other relevant technical department /
agencies of RGoB for them to provide their inputs in the design and implementation of the
proposed activities, (iii) collecting and compiling required information for project
implementation Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).
Component B, which would fund the pilot works will be implemented by the Department of
Engineering Services under the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement, which is currently
implementing the Bhutan Second Urban Development Project (BUDP II).


The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) prepared an Environmental Management Framework
(EMF). The EMF for the project identifies potential environmental and social impacts related to
the subcomponent for retrofit of pilot public buildings, and the sectoral environmental
assessment describes and recommends provisions such as institutional mechanisms,
environmental management guidelines including a management framework, and a generic
Environmental Management Plan for the sub-component to address environmental impacts.

Further, the Policy and Planning Division (PPD) under the Ministry of Works and Human
Settlements, which will have responsibility for the implementation of Component B has two
qualified environmental professionals who will be providing an oversight and monitoring of the
implementation of any specific Environmental Management Plan that would be prepared.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

Key stakeholders will be the line ministries and specific district level departments in charge of
operation of the buildings selected for retrofitting, as well as the staff and users of the respective
facilities. The EMF provides for consultation with the responsible ministries at the selection
stage, as well as consultation with the facility’s staff and users during the detailed design of and
planning for the retrofitting works so as to ensure that potential impact in terms of disruption in
the operation of the respective facilities or environmental nuisance are minimized and/or
mitigated.
The EMF has been disclosed on the website of the Implementing Agency and will be translated
and disclosed in the local language (Dzongkha) prior to the detailed design stage of the proposed
pilot works.
