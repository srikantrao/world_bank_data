                              The proposed Project Development Objective is to promote social inclusion of disadvantaged groups in the selected areas through access to
                              sports, physical culture and social activities. The project particularly targets three types of disadvantaged groups: (i) people with disabilities of all

                              categories; (ii) young people aged 15-29 years with incomes below the subsistence level and; (iii) at-risk children and adolescents aged 6-15
                              years, including those from poor and/or large families , orphans and adolescents with no adult supervision and juvenile offenders.

                              Social inclusion will be measured through indicators such as the increase in the level of participation of vulnerable beneficiaries in community
                              activities, the increase in access to social opportunities; and the increase in time spent by vulnerable groups in social and community activities.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed project will have three components:

                              Component One: Promoting Social Integration of Disadvantaged Groups through Sport ($30 million). This component is aimed at strengthening the
                              linkage between social inclusion and sports. It draws on lessons from both national and international good practice to develop a methodology and
                              strengthen human capacities to deliver sports and physical culture programming designed to promote social integration for disadvantaged groups.
                              A competitive grant scheme is also proposed to support local civil society organizations to implement innovative social inclusion through sports
                              activities. The component will also include communications activities to reach out disadvantaged people as well as to promote wider awareness of
                              social inclusion in society at large. No civil works are anticipated to be financed under this component. The component comprises the following
                              four subcomponents:
                              o           Subcomponent 1a) Review of Best Practices for Social Inclusion through Sports
                              o           Subcomponent 1b) Building Local Capacity to Deliver Support Services to Disadvantaged Groups
                              o           Subcomponent 1c) Sports and Social Integration activities for Disadvantaged Groups
                              o           Subcomponent 1d) Public Awareness of Social Exclusion

                              Component Two: Development of Accessible Sports Infrastructure ($115 million). An estimated total of up to six new accessible sports complexes
                              will be constructed and up to 24 facilities will be rehabilitated in six pilot municipalities, depending on local needs, population size, potential to
                              reach vulnerable groups, as well as on the affordability and financial sustainability of long-term operation and maintenance of the facilities. The
                              principle of "right-sizing" facilities for local needs and budget availability will be prioritized. Sports complexes may be equipped with sports facilities
                              for a variety of sports and games, including volleyball, basketball, tennis, football, wheelchair fencing, petanque, martial arts, table tennis, etc.
                              Sports fields could include running tracks, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and mini-football fields, and playgrounds for general fitness activities.
                              Complexes would also include multi-purpose rooms to support other social activities and socioeconomic support for project target groups. All
                              facilities supported by the project would be accessible for disabled people.

                              Component Three: Project Management ($5 million). In compliance with the RF Government Resolution No. 43 of 28 January 2005, a Project
                              Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established within MSTYP. This component will finance (a) operational costs of the project (including PIU staff
                              salaries, office consumables, utilities, in-country travel, office and vehicle maintenance, etc.); (b) annual audits; and (c) monitoring and evaluation
                              surveys and studies.
                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be implemented in selected locations to be determined by the implementing agency prior to project appraisal.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The counterpart for the project will be the Ministry of Sports, Tourism, and Youth Policy (MSTYP). The MSTYP has not implemented World Bank-
                           financed projects in the past. Due attention is required to ensure that the World Bank procurement and safeguard procedures are complied with,
                           especially concerning the construction of sports facilities which may trigger resettlement and other environmental safeguard policies. These
                           operational risks will, however, be minimized by the MSTYPs engagement of a PIU (as required by Russian legislation) which has experience with
                           implementation of World Bank projects. The World Bank project team will also provide ongoing guidance on the Bank safeguards policies to the
                           PIU. The MSTYP will prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and ensure that adequate resources and staff are allocated to implement
                           and monitor the social mitigation and consultation plans. Also, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) (or generic Environmental
                           Management Plan) will be prepared in order to minimize potential negative environmental impacts associated with project implementation. Site-
                           specific EMPs will be prepared for individual civil works once identified.
