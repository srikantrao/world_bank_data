Public Disclosure Copy




                              The MDTF activity will include four main components.

                              Component 1: Strategic Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Development Plan – Update of Thimphu City Development Strategy Proposals
                              ($30,000). The first activity will be the preparation of a strategic cultural heritage and sustainable tourism development plan. The activity will be
                              led by a committee that involves participation by a range of stakeholders at both the national and local levels, including government agencies,
                              NGOs, the private sector, and citizen representatives. Technical assistance for this activity will be provided by a MDTF-supported international
                              cultural heritage specialist. The component will involve: (a) a thorough review of the existing studies, assessments, and strategies relating to
                              cultural heritage protection and conservation, tourism development, and crafts; (b) assessment of the priorities identified in the Thimphu City
                              Development Strategy to see where the MDTF and Bank resources are best applied for maximum benefit and have the potential to leverage
                              additional investment; (c) consultative workshops; and (d) development of an action oriented cultural heritage and tourism plan.

                              Component 2: Implementation of Selected Elements of Strategic Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Action Plan (US$190,000). While
                              there will be broad consultation and updating of priorities in the City Development Strategy as described under Component 1, the available
                              analysis and priorities already established in the strategy indicate several areas that are expected to be the focus of MDTF activities. Thus,
                              pending the results of Component 1, the following are among the activities and investments that may be
                              funded by the MDTF and implemented under the ongoing Bhutan Second Urban Development Project:

                              Adaptive Reuse of Traditional Buildings
                              •         Analysis and recommendations for policies and programs to support adaptive reuse of traditional buildings
                              •         Identification, mapping, valuation, and assessment of historic buildings appropriate for adaptive reuse and DRM interventions
                              •         Determination of selected buildings’ financial viability based on market demand for new uses, potential revenues to be generated, and
                              cost of adaptation, operation, and maintenance

                              Historic Site Management and Improvements
                              •          Analysis and recommendations for development control mechanisms to protect sites from inappropriate development in their
                              surroundings
                              •          Development of site management plans for priority historic properties with a focus on protecting historic and cultural values, identifying
                              necessary conservation work, establishing routine management and maintenance procedures, and managing tourist visits
                              •          Investment in selected site improvements and amenities (for example, the purchase of waste bins, installation of public toilets,
                              development of site interpretation, improvements in safety, and investments to support new income generating activities such as
                                souvenir shops or cafes)
                           •         Exploration of public private partnerships in cultural heritage site management and sustainable tourism

                           Cultural Tourism Development and Interpretation
                           •          Analysis of barriers to increased tourism activity (for example, underdeveloped interpretation, lack of transportation links between sites,
                           absence of packages that encourage purchase of additional site visits, excursions or activities)
                           •          Development of a citywide interpretation plan with production of guidebooks and maps and development of tourist routes, coherent
                           storylines and linkages among sites.

                           •          Technical assistance for museums on improvements to interpretation, security, storage and display (for example, temperature control,
                           fire alarms, measures to increase visitor numbers, training for guides, options for adding crafts workshops or services)

                           Community Benefits and Poverty Reduction
                           •         Artisans needs assessment and support (for example, access to raw materials and labor saving technology, design support to update
                           products for high value sales, improved packaging and labeling and marketing networks and outlets)
                           •         Identification of opportunities and support for participation in the cultural tourism value chain on the part of the poor and unemployed
                           youth and women
                           •         Training for jobs in the heritage, tourism, and construction sectors (for example, hospitality services, tourist guiding, and building
                           conservation and repair)
                           •         Support for SME development through TA on business planning and development

                           Component 3: Capacity Building for National and Local Government Institutions, NGOs and the Private Sector (US$25,000). This component will
                           support institutional strengthening at both national and local levels to build capacity for cultural heritage management and cultural tourism
                           development.

                           Component 4: Preparation of Cultural Heritage and Sustainable Tourism Component for Third Urban Development Project (US$10,000). During
                           the MDTF period, the World Bank’s South Asia Urban Unit (SASDU) will initiate preparation of the Third Bhutan Urban Development Project. The
                           results and lessons learned during implementation of the MDTF activity will be used in the team’s dialogue with the Borrower in preparing a cultural
                           heritage component. The team responsible for managing the MDTF activity will be the same as that which will be leading discussions on the new
                           World Bank project currently in the pipeline.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The project will be carried out in the City of Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan.


                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The project will be implemented through the same project management arrangements as the Bhutan Second Urban Development Project (BUDP
                           II). The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) prepared an Environmental Screening and Sectoral Environmental Assessment that are fully
                           consistent with the Bank’s safeguard policies as well as the Bhutan Country System. The Screening Report for the project identifies potential
                           environmental impacts related to subcomponent/ subproject types, and the sectoral environmental assessment describes and recommends
                           provisions such as institutional mechanisms, environmental management guidelines including a management framework, and a generic
                           Environmental Management Plan for various subcomponent/subproject types to address environmental impacts. During implementation of BUDP
                           II, these would be adapted to the specific subproject/subcomponent through preparation of a specific Environmental Management Plan as well as

                           through the contractor’s Site Environmental Management Plan. The safeguard documents and arrangements established for BUDP II will guide
                           the MDTF operation as well. Further, the Policy and Planning Division (PPD) under the Ministry of Works and Human Settlements, which will have
                           responsibility for the MDTF activity has two qualified environmental professionals who will be providing an oversight and monitoring of the
                           implementation of any specific Environmental Management Plan that would be prepared.
