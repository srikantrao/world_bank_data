                              23.         This PDO will be achieved throughout the creation of an enabling environment for Sustainable Land and Water Management (SLWM),
                              within the broader NRM concept , to increase land productivity for food, fodder, fibre and fuel on all land-use types, namely cropland, grazing land,
                              forest and mixed land. SLWM is vital to preventing further degradation and restoring productive, resilient, and well-functioning biodiverse
                              ecosystems. It also supports promoting sustainable alternative livelihoods including ecotourism opportunities. More particularly, the key to
                              sustainable ecotourism is sustainable ecosystem management with the benefit shared among local populations. Support to climate change
                              adaption measure will strengthen adjustments of individual households, communities and producers’ group in order to increase climate resilience
                              and reduce vulnerabilities to risks. In line with current thinking, climate change adaptation will grow from a minor environmental concern to a major
                              challenge for human development.
                              24.         The project includes three components, namely:
                              •           Component 1: Strengthening institutions at national and local levels to support SLWM and livelihoods diversification
                              •           Component 2: Making investments to support SLWM practices and promote livelihoods diversification
                              •           Component 3: Knowledge management and Project co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation.
                              25.         Project beneficiaries. Potential beneficiaries of the proposed project are the populations administratively attached to Communes whose
                              territories are covered by the Malian GGW path (Annex 3), that present a potential for livelihood diversificationand which are mostly affected by
                              climate change. Those communes will typically be:
                              a.          Vulnerable rural producers in targeted areas will directly benefit from a number of initiatives aiming at making their agro-sylvo-pastoral
                              activities climate resilient.
                              b.          Community-based operators in targeted areas will benefit from the promotion of alternative livelihoods activities such as eco-tourism
                              (including environmental services, biodiversity protection measures, accommodation, food catering, tourist guide, etc.).
                              Other beneficiaries are national institutions - particularly the National Directorate of Water and Forestry (DNEF), the Agency for the Environment
                              and Sustainable Development (AEDD) of the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation, and Local governments (at Commune level), through
                              initiatives aimed at building their technical and institutional capacities to efficiently implement sustainable land and water management practices.
                              26.         Exact project’s locations and targeted communities will be determined during project preparation and after the necessary consultations
                              that will be carried out with key stakeholders. The final identification of targeted areas and beneficiaries will take into account relevant projects/
                              programs currently focusing on climate change and local livelihoods, by drawing key lessons from their approaches and establishing strategic
                              partnerships with them (Table 3 presents some of these projects).
                              27.         The proposed project will contribute the implementation of 11 out of the 19 Mali’s NAPA priorities as indicated in Table 4 below.

                              C. Project Description

                              Component 1. Strengthening institutions at national and local levels in support to SLWM and livelihoods diversification
                              31.    This component will support policy and institutional strengthening, improving enabling environments to scale up sustainable land and
                         water management and build national and local level capacities to implement, harmonize and coordinate investments and policies sustaining
                         alternative livelihoods at local level, including ecotourism.
                         32.         More particularly, throughout the organization of on-the-job and off-the-job trainings, this component activities will focus on:
                         •           Strengthening the capacities of the National Directorate of Water and Forestry in the areas Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation,
                         •           Strengthening the capacities of local governments (Collectivités) in mainstreaming SLWM and alternative livelihoods into their local
                         development plans and investment budgets,
                         •           Building the capacities and skills of local stakeholders in order to support diversified livelihoods and Adaptive Income Generating

                         Activities (beekeeping, handicraft, use of forest products for medical uses, food processing, environmental services, ecotourism, etc.)
                         •           Supporting a comprehensive and multidisciplinary assessment of potential alternative livelihoods and initiatives for local economic
                         development for targeted communes, especially in terms of ecotourism resources.
                         •           Mainstreaming climate change into national policy frameworks and local development planning.
                         33.         Furthermore, this component proposed activities will support the implementation of the NAPA priorities 12 and 16.

                         Component 2: Making investments to support SLWM practices and promote livelihoods diversification
                         34.        The main objective of this component is to improve the performance of the agro-sylvo-pastoral sectors, including generation of
                         renewable energy, and to promote alternative livelihoods, particularly ecotourism, at the level of local communities. Activities will strengthen the
                         management of natural resources by promoting adaptive community-based SLWM practices and favor the active participation of local
                         communities, mainly vulnerable people in conservation and promotion of alternative livelihoods.
                         35.        Of immediate importance are the opportunities that SLWM including SFM/REDD+ practices offer to help adapt to and mitigate climate
                         change. Adaptation to climate change can be achieved by adopting more versatile and climate change-resilient technologies – but also through
                         approaches which enhance flexibility and responsiveness to change. Overall, the approach of the proposed project will stress the importance of
                         climate change adaption measures and the need to increase the resilience of local livelihoods to climate hazards. Emphasis would be put on
                         adaptation measures rather than on coping strategies, because anticipatory and long-term initiatives would be favored in response to climate
                         change.
                         36.        This component will comprise a number of distinct and inter-related activities:
                         i)         Identify and assess resources in new protected areas and rehabilitate existing protected areas
                         ii)        Support forest conservation and sustainable use and management of forests,
                         iii)       Make investment in innovative and adaptive practices and technologies for sustainable soil fertility and water management, forest and
                         rangeland management activities including agro-forestry, afforestation and reforestation, and investment in local level renewable energy
                         generation sources. The proposed investments and activities will support the implementation of the NAPA priorities 1, 2, 7, 13 14 and 18
                         iv)        Provide short-term grants and subsidies to experimental initiatives aimed at supporting alternative livelihoods, including ecotourism,
                         possibly in public-private partnership contractual formats. These activities are fully in line with NAPA priority 3
                         v)         Build facilities and social infrastructures in targeted areas to favor alternative livelihoods, particularly ecotourism. – this will comprise
                         visitor centers, roads and recreational trails, erosion control measures, handicraft centers for women, warehouses for non-timber forest products,
                         etc.). These proposed activities will support the implementation of the following NAPA priorities: 3, 8, and 10.

                         37.       Key issues of land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change challenges will be addressed through a ‘Guide to Alternative
                         Livelihoods Development’, aimed at creating appropriate economic benefits from alternative livelihoods, including tourism, for marginalized groups
                         of people, such as social minorities, nomadic pastoral and fishing communities, particularly women groups and youth associations, and scaling-up
                         SLWM across the country (this will directly contribute to the implementation of the third Mali’s National Strategy of Fight Against Poverty).

                         •          In the field of Livelihoods diversification, the project is likely to promote a number of activities, such as the following:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         �          Support community-based initiatives and services aimed at protecting natural resources and biodiversity (creation of protected area
                         guides, inventory and monitoring of flora / fauna, water, caves, wetlands etc…),
                         �          Development of activities supporting high quality handicraft,
                         �          Identification and funding of biodiversity-friendly business development opportunities at community level)
                         �          Development of activities aimed at sustainable use of non-timber forest products (e.g., medicine, honey, etc.),
                         �          Construction of rural camping areas and small-scale accommodation (e.g. gîtes with Nubian vault roofs) including rest and picnic places
                         within tourist areas,
                         �          Construction of observation platforms (watchtowers); provision of transport (vehicles, camels, donkeys, horses) and electricity supplies
                         (fueled by generators using renewable fuel),
                         �          Development and the provision of posters and folders of information about each site, the development of hotels, travel agencies and
                         restaurants for various program circuits and excursions;
                         �          Creation of radio, television and newspaper publicity, also the development of reviews at the national and the international levels in order
                         to encourage customers; the participation in the international tourism fairs and conferences relating to ecotourism.
                         �          Etc.

                         •           In the field of Sustainable land and water management practices, the project will support the dissemination and adoption, among others,
                         of the following activities:
                         �           Soil conservation techniques,
                         �           Crop management practices,
                         �           Agro-forestry practices,
                         �           Water harvesting initiatives,
                         �           Improved livestock management activities,
                         �           Community based natural regeneration (to contribute in the reduction of land degradation in the targeted areas),
                         �           Etc.
                         38.         Combined incomes will be generated by alternative livelihoods particularly ecotourism and environmental services, on the one hand, and
                         livestock breeding, arable agriculture, and small trade, on the other hand, in addition to remittances from migrants. Women, who are socially and
                         economically marginalized, will in particular benefit from opportunities that are offered, provided they receive appropriate financial and technical
                         support. In the same way, young people can find appropriate employment and business opportunities and will be supported by adapted training
                         programs. This should reduce the exodus of young rural men towards urban areas in search of altern ative livelihoods.
                         39.         Mali is a diverse country, where practically all areas lend themselves to the ecotourism. The challenge is to attract customers and to
                         develop the potentialities of the various areas of the country. This will spread the benefits and reduceany negative environmental impacts.
                           Component 3: Knowledge management and Project co-ordination, monitoring and evaluation.
                           40.     This component will support the Government at the national and local levels to generate and share SLWM knowledge and implement
                           and manage the project.
                           41.     More specifically, the component will :
                           •       Strengthen the existing SLWM Information System and reinforce its knowledge and information sharing component
                           •       Set-up the project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems
                           •       Collect, analyze and communicate valuable lessons learned from the various activities, for dissemination of results and scaling up.

                           •       Coordinate the activities of all the participating stakeholders (at national and local levels).

                           B. Lessons learned
                           42.         A key assumption of the proposed project is that in areas affected by severe climate risks, conservation, protection and management of
                           natural resources can only be successful through the involvement of the people closest to the resources. Lessons from previous experiences
                           indicate that Malian populations are considerably aware of climate issues and have already developed several strategies to adapt to climate
                           variability. The proposed project will combine sustainable natural resource management and local livelihood priorities.
                           43.         The scope of the proposed project is to scale up and disseminate community-based adaptation and coping strategies and to support
                           local livelihoods. Its design will reflect a number of key lessons learned so far in Mali, such as the following:
                           •           Building a full sense of ownership of the development process. A number of programmes/projects (in Tombouctou, Gao and Mopti, for
                           instance), supported by international development partners, have already achieved promising results at all levels, from the central government and
                           the concerned sectoral ministries and institutions down to local governments, civil society and private-sector organizations.
                           •           Empowering local actors. Lessons learned from previous programmes indicate that various activities tailored to different stakeholders
                           (local authorities, community leaders, representatives of civil society and private sector) are a powerful catalyst for change. The empowerment of
                           local governments ‘Collectivités communales) will guarantee long term sustainability of key activities (after the end of the project), as these
                           activities will be included in local development plans and budget and will be eventually financed by the existing ‘basket fund’ system for local
                           governments.
                           •           Avoiding duplication and ensuring coherent and coordinated implementation. Close collaboration and coordination between the
                           proposed project and on-going Bank’s supported projects will be key to the success:

                           ecological and climate crises, degradation of the natural resource base and low productivity.
                           �           Optimization of stakeholders’ engagement and coordination will draw lessons from the ‘Disaster Risk Management and climate change
                           adaptation Project’
                           �           The approach of the ‘Integrated Land and Water Management for Adaptation to Climate Variability and Change’ (ILWAC) project will be
                           adopted for activities aimed at mainstreaming risk mapping and scaling-up of sustainable land and water management practices through the
                           enhancement of the land and climate information system.
                           �           Activities aimed at reducing biodiversity degradation trends and creating conservation areas will benefit from lessons learned by the

                           territories are covered by the Malian GGW path (Annex 3), that present a potential for livelihood diversificationand which are mostly affected by
                           climate change. Those communes will typically be:
                           a.          Vulnerable rural producers in targeted areas will directly benefit from a number of initiatives aiming at making their agro-sylvo-pastoral
                           activities climate resilient.
                           b.          Community-based operators in targeted areas will benefit from the promotion of alternative livelihoods activities such as eco-tourism
                           (including environmental services, biodiversity protection measures, accommodation, food catering, tourist guide, etc.).
                           Other beneficiaries are national institutions - particularly the National Directorate of Water and Forestry (DNEF), the Agency for the Environment
                           and Sustainable Development (AEDD) of the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation, and Local governments (at Commune level), through
                           initiatives aimed at building their technical and institutional capacities to efficiently implement sustainable land and water management practices.
                           26.         Exact project’s locations and targeted communities will be determined during project preparation and after the necessary consultations
                           that will be carried out with key stakeholders. The final identification of targeted areas and beneficiaries will take into account relevant projects/
                           programs currently focusing on climate change and local livelihoods, by drawing key lessons from their approaches and establishing strategic
                           partnerships with them (Table 3 presents some of these projects).

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Mali has the basic environmental and social institutional and regulatory framework and had ratified almost all the relevant multilateral
                           environmental agreements (MEA) for the implementation of this project. For instance, two institutions are in charge with environmental
                           assessment, and mainstreaming procedures enforcement and compliance: The DNACPN (Direction National de l’Assainissement, du Contrôle des
                           Pollutions et Nuisances) and the AEDD (Agence pour l’Environnement et le Développement Durable). Unfortunately, their capacities are still weak
                           while the sector ministries and local governments do not have their own environment unit.
