2. Project Objectives
The project's PDO is to (a) increase access to reliable, affordable and sustainable water
supply and sanitation services; and (b) to improve water and wastewater services in the
areas served by Athi Water Services Board (AWSB), Coastal Water Services Board
(CWSB) and Lake Victoria North Water Services Board (LVNWSB).

3. Project Description
The project comprises three components. These are:

 (1) Support to the AWSB, which will support the rehabilitation and extension of
water supply systems including the development of additional water sources for Nairobi
and other drought mitigation measures, and improvements in wastewater collection and
treatment facilities in AWSB's area. Technical assistance will also be provided to the
AWSB and its Water Services Providers, Water Services Regulatory Board (WSRB) and
the Water Appeal Board (WAB).
  (2) Support to the CWSB, which will support the rehabilitation and extension of
water supply schemes including drought mitigation measures and institutional
strengthening of the CWSB and its various water service providers.
  (3) Support to the LVNWSB, which will support the rehabilitation and extension of
water supply schemes including drought mitigation measures and institutional
strengthening of the LVNWSB and its various water service providers.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Projects will be in areas in and around Nairobi and the Athi River basin, the Lake
Victoria region and various locations in Coast Province. Some drought mitigation
measures such as supplying water tanks, mobile treatment units, bore-hole drilling will be
country wide.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
ENVIRONMENT: The project includes the northern collector tunnel, which is a
relatively large investment that has potential impacts on downstream hydrological flow.
While it includes construction of a 3.2 meter diameter 11 kilometer long tunnel, it does
not traverse critical natural habitats, protected areas, natural forests, or densely populated
areas. Hydrological assessments will be undertaken to ensure that under periods of
naturally low flows, sufficient flows are allocated to cater for downstream demand and to
provide environmental flows of sufficient quantity to prevent the critical decline of
downstream aquatic environments. The Environment Management Plan (EMP) requires
monitoring to ensure that adequate protection measures will be inserted into the design of
the weirs to allow for the safe passage of fish. Although the project does pass close to
forested areas, and may involve the removal of some trees along pipeline routes, this is
not at a level to merit the triggering of OP 4.36. Nevertheless, the EMPs for sub-projects
will specify that measures be taken to route along old growth trees whenever possible,
and where not possible, to replant and monitor the planting and nurturing of saplings, in
consultation with Kenya Forest Service. OP 4.11 is triggered as a precautionary measure,
and to ensure the insertion of chance finds procedures in bidding documents. The sub-
projects identified to date do not traverse areas of noted cultural heritage, but triggering
the policy ensures that any chance finds will be properly handled, and also provides for
the protection of sacred fig trees which may grow along the routes. The new pipeline to
be constructed on the Sabaki-Malindi-Kilifi route will be adjacent to the existing
pipeline, will follow an existing road, and will not encroach on the protected Arabuko-
Sokoke Forest. This has been confirmed by a site visit on March 17, 2012 along the
entire proposed routing. Although OP 4.37 is triggered due to the northern collector
tunnel going into the existing Thika Dam, consultations with the Bank’s Dam Safety
Advisor confirm that an Independent Panel of Experts is not necessary. He requested that
the Dam Safety Plan and Emergency Preparedness Plan be updated. This is being done
under AfD financing. The AWSB has received a financial proposal from the consultants
for technical assistance for surveillance, monitoring analysis and safety procedures for
Sasumua-Thika-Ruiru dams and elaboration of standard operation procedures (SOP or
O&M Manual) for Thika& Ruiru dams. OP 7.50 was triggered for the parent project, and
LEGEN has advised that no additional notification letters are required under this AF.

 SOCIAL. An RPF has been prepared to address resettlement and compensation issues,
primarily along the route of the northern collector tunnel, although there is likely to be
some level of resettlement and/or compensation required under other sub-projects.

 Lake Victoria North Water Services Board has been working with the Sengware/
Cherangany Indigenous Peoples to address water supply originating from their ancestral
area. With the formation of a Kapcherop water users association, indigenous peoples are
actively participating in project planning and operations of water supply.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Due to potential hydrological impacts from the northern collector tunnel, the
environmental impact assessment (EIA) includes a cumulative impact assessment, and
effects on river flow will be monitored and mitigated throughout the project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The routing of the northern collector tunnel and the new pipeline parallel to an existing
pipeline along a road passing through through Arabuko-Sokoke Forest is being designed
to avoid loss of biodiversity or natural habitats, and to minimize resettlement.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has substantial experience in the preparation and implementation of Bank-
standard environmental assessments(EAs) and EMPs under the framework approach
adopted for the parent project. EAs have been cleared for the following AWSB projects
under the parent project: Dandora sewage treatment and Ngong trunk sewer, Riruta
Lavington, Mataara, Thiririka;Gatharaini, Komothai, upgrade of Nairobi water supply,
Karimenu, and Ndarugu. Under LVNWSB EMPs have been cleared under the parent
project (pending minor revisions) for: rehabilitation and expansion of Kimilili water
supply system, rehabilitation and augmentation of Chesikaki, Cheptais and Sirisia water
supply system; rehabilitation and augmentation of Funyula, Sio Port And Port Victoria
water supply systems, Lessos water supply augmentation works, Kapsowar and
Kapcherop water supply augmentation works, and construction of a new water supply
system for Lumakanda and Kipkaren. Under Additional Financing, for all proposed
investments for which preliminary and/or final designs have been carried out, nine draft
EAs/EMPs have been received. These are : (a) CWSB: construction of Sabaki-Gogoni
water supply system in Malindi, and financing of provisional items in Kilifi, Tavevo,
Lamu and Tana River. The CWSB EMPs were reviewed and cleared by the Bank. (b)
LVNWSB: under rehabilitation of water supply systems EMPs have been received for the
independent rural water supply schemes of Sio Port/Port Victoria, Musanda/Navakholo,
and Kwanza, and under expansion of water supply systems, EMPs have been received for
Butere and Malaba/Malakisi towns. The LVNWSB EMPs have been cleared by the
Bank.

  The Borrower is coordinating the safeguard policy framework activities of the three
Water Boards through Athi Water Services Board, which is the Board with the largest
and most knowledgeable environmental and social team. The need to increase
environmental and social management capacity at LVWSB and to a lesser extent, at
CWSB, is recognized and has been budgeted for in the project cost. At present, capacity
is supplemented by high quality local environmental consultants.Given that the exact sub-
projects to be financed have not been finalized at this time (and that for those whose
inclusion is certain, the exact alignment of the tunnels and pipelines are not known at this
time), an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) have been prepared, consulted upon, and disclosed after
consultations with stakeholders and prior to appraisal. A consultant with extensive Bank
experience has been retained to update the ESMF and RPF for WASSIP AF projects in
all three Water Boards. An Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) has also
been updated to reflect the formation, and involvement, of the Kapcherop water users
association. This user association membership is predominately representatives of the
indigenous community who are being empowered to participate in water planning,
management, and maintenance.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are those in the vicinity of the northern collector tunnel, and the
existing water supply systems. Most have already been extensively consulted under the
original WASSIP, but as needed, consultations will be conducted again. It is planned that
project affected persons along the northern collector tunnel will be provided with water
collection points so that they benefit from the proposed water tunnel passing through
their area.
