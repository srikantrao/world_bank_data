2. Project Objectives
The main objective of the SMARTD project is to improve the institutional capacity and
performance of the Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development
(IAARD) in developing and disseminating innovative technologies.

3. Project Description
The Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and Development (IAARD) in the
Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) is the implementing Agency. The project interventions
that are necessary for attaining the objectives are grouped into the following components:
Component A. Development and Management of Human Resources ($40 M).
  The objective of component A is to enhance and strengthen the capacities of and to
improve management of IAARD human resources. It is expected that agency capacity
will be built by: (a) improving the agency’s human resources through the development of
the technical, managerial, and leadership skills of staffs working in the corefunctional
areas of the agency; and (b) improving the internal operating environment through the
enhanced ability of these staffs to implement Bureaucracy Reform within the agency as
well as the impact on organizational culture a nd processes of sufficient numbers (or a
‘critical mass’) of skilled and reform-minded staffs in the agency. Ideally these
developments would be mutually reinforcing.
  Component A will comprise of three sub-components: (1) Scientific Training and
Communication; (2) Technical and Management Training; and (3) Human Resources
Management.

  Component B: Improvement in research infrastructure and facilities ($ 35 M)
  The mainobjective of the component B is to improve the research facilities and
infrastruc ture of IAARD to function at level that meet world standard based on ISO.
Component B will comprise of four sub-components: (1) Laboratory Improvement; (2)
Field Station Improvement; (3) Building Construction and Renovation; and (4) Grand
Design of IARRD Facilities and Infrastructure Beyond 2020 .

  Component C. Research management and policy support ($ 15 M)
  The objective of component C is to support the increasing efficiency and effectiveness
of the resources utilization of research and development through improved management
strategies and instruments. Component C comprises the following sub -components: (1)
Research Priority Setting, Planning and Programming; (2) Research Collaboration and
Networking; (3) Diversification of Research Funding; and (4 Improvement of
Technology Dissemination Systems.

  Component D. Project Management ($ 15 M)
  This component will provide support for the preparation of project implementation,
administrative support during implementation; and monitoring and evaluation and
supervision related to project implementation. The Project willprovide the following
supports:
  (1) Staffing, operational costs, equipment, and consultant support for a national
Project Coordination and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) to be established in the Secretariat of
IAARD, to prepare project implementation, support for consultant costs of preparing
project reporting formats and other project documents. A budget will be allocated to the
PCMU to undertake these activities. (2)       Staffing, operational costs, equipment, and
consultant support for project implementation at the selected research centers/research
institutes/AIATs.
  (3) Support for external audits and independent reviews. The PCMU will be provided
with a budget for the activities and will administer the budget.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will work in up to 33 Provinces nationally with research and outreach
institutions and will cooperate with provincial administrations at a policy and
coordination level. It will also work nationally with district-level extension institutions.
From a physical environmental perspective, the project will cover a range of agro-
ecological production zones, including areas of differing natural resource related
environmental stress. The principal zones include: upland rain-fed mixed cropping;
smallholder tree crops; and agro-forestry. Within these zones, a wide variety of farming
systems have evolved, many of which are facing problems relating to monoculture,
decline in soil fertility and ground water quality as well as increasing incidence of pests
resulting from poor farming practices. These issue                                    s will
inherently be addressed by developing the skills needed in research and outreach to
provide for more sustainable farm systems.

  Some of the project areas may have isolated vulnerable groups and all of the areas will
have vulnerable disadvantaged groups such as poor women, landless and minority ethnic
farmers. The project will not have a particular focus on any area but will develop skills
and facilities to assist all stakeholders.
