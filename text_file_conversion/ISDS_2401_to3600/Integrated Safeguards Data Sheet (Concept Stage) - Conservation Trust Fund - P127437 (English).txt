                              area system.

                              C. Project Description

                              The proposed Project has two components which will support the establishment and capitalization of a Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) to improve
                              the sustainability of DRC’s national protected area system by (i) providing a reliable source of financing for the recurrent costs of managing
                              selected protected areas that have achieved a desired level of conservation management, and (ii) building the management effectiveness of the
                              CTF Board and management, and strengthening the capacity of the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) to fulfill its national
                              leadership role for the management and expansion of the national protected area system.

                              The project will establish a CTF of $35.84 million, with a GEF capital contribution of $9.34 million leveraging incremental capital co-financing of
                              $26.5 million. This will provide sufficient annual income to support basic management activities in three protected areas, costing an estimated $0.5
                              million per park per year. The protected areas to receive CTF support will be selected based on (i) significance for the conservation of biodiversity
                              and the likelihood of success in managing threats to successful conservation, (ii) existence of adequate capacity for financial management at the
                              park level, and (iii) complementarity with other sources of financing for the national protected areas network.

                              The CTF will be set up as a “Parks Fund?, building on the successful CTF experience in Colombia. During preparation of the proposed Project, the
                              team will review in more detail experience with similar funds, ICCN's funding needs, and the goals of interested donors, to guide the detailed
                              design of the CTF, including the possible use of sinking, endowment and revolving components, as well as the capacity to accept further
                              contributions to replenish and increase the initial capitalization. Drawing on the factors identified in the GEF review of CTF operations as being
                              important for successful operations, the proposed DRC CTF will be governed by an independent Board with a majority private sector and civil
                              society membership, appropriate checks and balances, conflict of interest provisions, and succession procedures. An Executive Director, with
                              support from a lean structure, will be responsible for the implementation of the CTF Board’s decisions, and daily management of the CTF.

                              The CTF will provide ICCN with a reliable stream of funding to augment the minimal budget received from the state, and to supplement the less-
                              predictable project-based and off-budget financing the national protected area system receives from donors and other international partners. The
                              Project is expected to double the annual financial resources managed directly by ICCN, from $1.8 million to $3.6 million. This will enhance ICCN’s
                              overall capacity and profile, contribute to a stronger coordination among partners, and help promote an integrated approach to biodiversity
                              conservation. A strong ICCN, providing national leadership and improved park management services, will mitigate threats to biodiversity. It will
                              also gain credibility in the international community, leading to better opportunities for leveraging sustainable funding sources, and thus improve
                              biodiversity conservation of the Congo basin as a whole.
                           The project design also includes a component to provide technical assistance to support the establishment and operation of the CTF, with a GEF
                           contribution of $2 million leveraging incremental in-kind co-financing of $3 million. This component will provide legal, financial and fiduciary advice
                           and oversight, strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacities and activities, develop sustainable financing plans, as well as both a fund raising
                           strategy to enhance donor contributions and a communication strategy.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The resources generated by the CTF will be used by ICCN for the management of three protected areas and for central administrative functions.

                           The protected areas to receive CTF support will be selected based on (i) significance for the conservation of biodiversity and the likelihood of
                           success in managing threats to successful conservation, (ii) existence of adequate capacity for financial management at the park level, and (iii)
                           complementarity with other sources of financing for the national protected areas network. Protected area management activities include (i)
                           conservation enforcement, (ii) conservation monitoring, (iii) development and maintenance of park infrastructure, and (iv) support for local
                           development initiatives. ICCN's central administrative functions include financial and human resource management, policy development,
                           representation and advocacy at the national and international levels, monitoring and evaluation of conservation management at the park level, as
                           well as activities in support of the Government's goal of expanding the protected areas network from the current 11% to a target 17% of national
                           territory.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           Since the World Bank’s re-engagement in DRC in 2006, considerable progress has been made in building national capacity for management of the
                           environmental and social impacts of investments, culminating in 2011 with the adoption of a new framework law on the environment, which
                           established for the first time a national requirement for environmental impact assessment.

                           Safeguard implementation under the proposed project will be the responsibility of ICCN, at the national and park levels. Through the ongoing
                           National Parks Network Rehabilitation Project, ICCN’s capacity to manage the safeguards aspects of its operations has been strengthened, in
                           particular through the creation of a social development team at the central level focused on issues associated with community conservation, the
                           participation of indigenous pygmy groups, and access to resources. Nevertheless, capacity for management of safeguard policies remains at a
                           nascent stage in ICCN, and will require considerable on-going support. The proposed Project will help to achieve this by providing support for
                           safeguard-related studies during preparation, and by requiring that the annual budgets to be financed by the CTF and subsequent reporting
                           include specific provision for safeguard-related activities and associated technical assistance.
