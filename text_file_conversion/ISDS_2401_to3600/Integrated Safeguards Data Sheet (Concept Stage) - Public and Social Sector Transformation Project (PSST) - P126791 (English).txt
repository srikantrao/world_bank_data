                              Concept

                              1.        The World Bank proposes a three-pronged project to support the NEST plan in Antigua and Barbuda through better public service
                              management, better capacity of the government to implement social protection programs, and investment in a nation-wide active labor market
                              program. The project will therefore include three primary areas of activity requested by the GOAB: (a) Public Sector Transformation; (b) Social
                              Sector Transformation; and (c) Active Labor Market Policies (ALMP). The proposed project builds on recommendations from the Bank's SPA and
                              payroll audit reviews carried out under the Public Sector IDF. It will be implemented over a three year period during FY13-FY15.

                              Description

                              1.        This project addresses the structures and processes within the public sector that define how money, people and physical resources are
                              deployed and accounted for. The proposed operation will support the Government's Social Transformation Plan, strengthening its capacity to
                              develop and monitor social programs and developing a set of interventions of ALMPs that provide adequate response to the challenges of the
                              labor market in different phases of the economic cycle.

                              2.           The components are:

                              •          Component 1 - Human resource modernization: Unifying the public service by integrating the non-established employment into a single
                              public service and revising the present classification of the public service post, with the aim to create a foundation for the integration of the
                              established civil service with the non-established government employees.
                              •          Component 2 - Strategic planning and policy coordination: Setting procedures and processes for policy development, public
                              consultation, impact analysis, development of a policy framework as a basis for budget planning, establishing guidelines for policy documents.
                              •          Component 3 - Improving social sector performance: enhancing government capacity to design, implement and monitor coherent social
                              policies and interventions. Improving the implementation capacity of the Ministry of Health, Social Transformation and Consumer Affairs
                              (MoHSTCA) and solidifying its role as the lead agency for Social Protection Policy in Antigua and Barbuda.
                              •          Component 4 - Improving and expanding an Active Labor Market Program: Implementing a set of interventions of ALMPs that provide
                              adequate response to the challenges of the labor market in different phases of the economic cycle. A Temporary Employment Program would
                              provide income support to the unemployed poor and/or less employable through a temporary job and the possibility to be trained in life skills and
                              language and math literacy. A training program would provide to the more experienced among the unemployed population the opportunity to
                              improve their employability through re-training or competence certification.
