                              The Development Objective of the project is to strengthen institutional capacity for improved management of the education system. This would be
                              carried out through reinforcement of the institutional organization and systems, applying management tools and training of human resources.

                              C. Project Description

                              III. Project Context

                              Building on the reform efforts in the education sector, the proposed Project would provide financial and technical assistance to improve the
                              management of the education system. The Project would have two main components:

                              Reinforcing institutional capacity. Capacity constraints in management as well as monitoring and evaluation of the education system have been
                              identified and acknowledged at the highest level and are part of the country's development strategy as well as the Education Strategy. Therefore,
                              the Project would aim to reinforce the capacity of the Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training (MNEVT) through the following areas:
                              (i) strengthening management, monitoring and evaluation by introducing management tools such as annual work programs, helping the ministry
                              organize and coordinate its activities between the various departments and levels, and clarifying roles and accountability structures; (ii)provide
                              technical assistance and tools to improve collection and reporting of education outputs and learning outcomes; (iii) strengthening the management
                              structure of the TVET Department through material resources and capacity building activities and supporting the establishment of a governance
                              structure that will have better links with the private sector. The Project may also pilot some activities to develop skills required by the labor market;
                              and (iv) supporting the development of a strategy and system for improved distribution, maintenance and management of textbooks. The Project
                              may also support the piloting of digital textbooks in some schools, including incorporating a strong impact evaluation mechanism to measure the
                              effectiveness of the digital approach.

                              Consolidating efforts in increasing quality to education. The Government of Djibouti has expressed the need to continue its efforts in expanding
                              access and quality in basic education. The Bank, through earlier projects in the education sector, has invested in building primary and middle
                              schools. The government has asked the Bank to assist in providing computer classrooms and other necessary rooms in one of the IDA financed
                              middle schools to further enhancing quality in learning and fostering a better school environment. This component will therefore focus on
                              supporting activities in improving quality at the lower secondary level. It will include the provision of school equipment and learning material and
                              some minor construction work within the school compound that would enhance the school environment.

                              D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project mainly focuses on technical assistance and the provision of equipment. There will be some construction of rooms within an already
                              existing school compound which was built on publically owned land. Therefore there are no issues with regards to safeguard analysis.
                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           The Government is increasingly committed to tackling environmental issues. In the National Development Initiative (INDS), environmental
                           protection, climate change and biodiversity are highlighted as priority areas of action. An institutional and regulatory environmental framework
                           exists, with some gaps and poor implementation due to both financial and human resource constraints.

                           The proposed operation will focus less on construction activity and more on reinforcement of capacity in terms of human and material resources.

                           The environmental risk post-construction can be managed effectively, in part through ongoing monitoring and a program of reactive and preventive
                           maintenance. A maintenance strategy was prepared for the on-going School Access and Improvement Project and, if effectively implemented and
                           resourced, combined with broader, regular environmental monitoring in the Environment Management Plan, would represent an effective risk
                           management strategy.
