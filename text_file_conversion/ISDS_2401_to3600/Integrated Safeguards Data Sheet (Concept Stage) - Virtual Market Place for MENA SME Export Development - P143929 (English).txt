                           C. Project Description
                           The project is articulated around three components: (i) a Virtual Market Place (VMP); (ii) a
                           comprehensive and targeted capacity building program for Export Promotion Agencies (EPAs); and

                         Under this component, a VMP will be implemented and made accessible to beneficiary SMEs and
                         buyers. Basically, the VMP will look like an online catalog of all the goods and services sold by the
                         transition countries’ SMEs, classified by category. Buyers (individuals, SMEs, large companies)
                         from all over the world will have a free access to the VMP and be able to: i) browse the products, ii)
                         consult the profile of the beneficiary SMEs, and iii) inquire about the beneficiary SMEs online (or to
                         get the contact information of the beneficiary SMEs in order to contact them by phone or email).

                         Component II: A comprehensive capacity building program for EPAs

                         The VMP will be fed and operated in a decentralized manner by Export Promoting Agencies (EPAs)
                         (one by transition country) which could be Chambers of Commerce or the relevant Department
                         within Ministries of Commerce of the transition countries. The roles of these units would be, in
                         particular, to:

                         i.      identify the beneficiary SMEs in their country,
                         ii.     register them in the VMP,
                         iii.    assist them in the posting of their products and contact information,
                         iv.     monitor the activity of the VMP (for example make sure that all buyers inquiries are
                         answered in a timely manner by the beneficiary SMEs),
                         v.      assist the beneficiary SMEs in their first export transactions,
                         vi.     deliver training in export activities to beneficiary SMEs,
                         vii.    monitor on a regular basis and update the information made available online to the
                         beneficiary SMEs,
                         viii.   deliver trustworthiness ratings to beneficiary SMEs,
                         ix.     provide beneficiary SMEs with Customer Relationship Management –CRM- services.

                         Component III: Support to the Regional Implementing Agency

                         To ensure neutrality of the project as well as its swift and coherent implementation across the
                         transition countries, an RIA will be identified and assessed by the Bank. This RIA will be tasked
                         with the following activities:

                         i.      It will procure the development of the VMP based on Terms of Reference jointly developed
                         by the Bank and Microsoft;
                         ii.     The RIA will design training curriculum and capacity building programs to assist the EPAs;
                         iii.    The RIA will promote the VMP in search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo!), forums,
                         blogs and all other relevant events.
                         iv.     At the request of the World Bank or the transition countries, the Business Desks could also
                         conduct quick surveys and mine the database for research and policy recommendation purposes
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         This is a regional project with several transition countries as beneficiaries: Morocco, Tunisia, Libya,
                         Egypt and Jordan. The Grant will be implemented by each country’s respective export promotion
                         agencies.
