                              The Development Objective of the proposed Danube Region Water Supply and Waste Water Sector Capacity Building Program would be to
                              support institutional capacity building and the development of regulatory and policy instruments in the water supply and waste water sector in
                              participating countries in the Danube Region. The program would support (i) development of regulatory and policy instruments, and (ii) training and
                              capacity building.

                              3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                              The proposed Program will be financed through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund, with an initial contribution in the amount of up to EUR4.5 million from
                              the Government of Austria. Contributions from other donors will be sought after implementation start. Additional funds would be used to scale up
                              activities and/ or include further beneficiary countries into the program. The Program would comprise two components and support country-specific
                              and cross-country activities targeted at the national and utility level. It would be implemented as a hybrid Trust Fund. Component 1 would be Bank-
                              executed, whereas Component 2 would be recipient-executed, regulated under a separate Grant agreement between the World Bank and the
                              International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD):

                              Component 1 (Bank executed): Policy, Regulatory and Implementation Support (up to US$2.1 million). This component will support activities to
                              provide policy and regulatory support, including through analytical and advisory work predominantly targeted at the national level. This part of the
                              partnership will be administered and executed by the World Bank. This component will also cover the cost of Program supervision and preparation,
                              including consultants, travel and Bank staff. Component 1 would comprise of two sub-components:

                              (a)         Sub-component 1.1: Sector-specific Technical Assistance and Analytical Work (up to US$1.9 million). This sub-component will finance
                              policy and regulatory support activities in three main areas: (i) tariff regulations; (ii) conditions and options for private sector participation in the
                              water supply and waste water sector; and (iii) efficiency improvement advisory support and assessments, including energy audits. This component
                              will also include benchmarking of water utilities performance and collection of baseline data for monitoring and evaluation. Up to two Bank staff, to
                              be based in the Bank's Vienna office, would be financed under this sub-component.

                              (b)        Sub-component 1.2: Program Implementation Support and Supervision (up to US$0.2 million). This sub-component will finance activities
                              to provide implementation support and supervision during program implementation, including Bank staff time and travel cost. The sub-component
                              will also cover cost associated with program preparation.

                              Component 2 (Recipient executed): Water Supply and Waste Water Utility Capacity Building (up to US$3.9 million). Component 2 will support
                              capacity building activities for senior technical and managerial staff of water and waste water utilities, including training courses, exposure visits,
                              knowledge exchanges, coaching, on-the-job training, and other capacity building activities. The component will be implemented by the
                              International Association of Water Supply Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD). Component 2 would comprise of three sub-
                              components with two funding windows.

                              (a)        Sub-component 2.1: Regional Capacity Building and Training Activities (up to US$1.8 million). The first window would support regional,
                              cross-country activities for capacity building, coaching, and on-the-job training structured along specific thematic lines (thematic window), including,
                              but not limited to: business planning, operational performance improvements, institutional design and organizational structure.

                                                                                                                                                                            Page 1 of 3
                               (b)         Sub-component 2.2: Country-specific Utility Management and Operational Practices Improvement Support (up to US$1.1 million). The
                               second window would provide support to country-specific activities selected competitively on a rolling basis (competitive grants window). Selection
                               criteria will be developed and agreed with the Bank, but include at a minimum (i) government endorsement of the activity; (ii) counterpart
                               contribution; and (iii) clear commitment to publish performance data.

                               (c)          Sub-component 2.3: Technical Secretariat (up to US$1.0 million). This component would support the Secretariat function at IAWD.
