                              Financial Sector Stability

                              Component 1: Strengthening the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for banks, MFOs, and credit unions
                              This component will support measures to improve the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework for the banking sector, MFOs, and credit
                              unions, and increase the NBKR capacity to monitor and address vulnerabilities.

                              Access to Finance

                              Component 2: Expanding financial services via KPOs network
                              This component will transform KPOs existing operation into a cost-effective distribution channel for basic financial services, in order to increase
                              access by poor and rural communities. Corporate governance, managerial capability, and market orientation are currently at a very limited stage of
                              development. The Project supports a first phase of operational and financial enhancements beyond the current commitment to corporatize KPO.
                              It will take the Government and KPO continued effort to complete this transformation and ensure its sustainability in the long term. The Project is
                              funding the building blocks for this transformation, focusing predominantly on postal financial services, but including all of KPO activities to some
                              extent. The Project supports three main subcomponents that require close coordination: (i) strengthening of financial management; (ii) business
                              process modernization; and (iii) expansion of financial services. All three subcomponents will include considerable training of KPO staff to ensure
                              the necessary capacity building.

                              Component 3: Supporting Aiyl Bank for deposit mobilization and privatization
                              This component will support Aiyl Bank by providing: (i) technical assistance to mobilize deposits; (ii) technical assistance to finalize an Action Plan
                              for privatization; (iii) technical assistance to implement the Action Plan for privatization; and (iv) a credit line to respond to liquidity needs while
                              deposits are building and privatization is being prepared and carried out.

                              Component 4: Modernizing the secured transactions and debt resolution regimes
                              This component will strengthen the regime for moveable collateral registration and execution through: (i) improvements in the legal and regulatory
                              framework for secured lending and debt resolution; (ii) modernization of the collateral registry; and (iii) capacity building of stakeholders.

                              Only component 3. iv. (Aiyl Bank credit line) of the proposed project triggers the Environmental Assessment safeguard policy (OP 4.01); no other
                              safeguards policies are triggered by the project. The credit line will support increased productivity in the agricultural sector, by improving access to
                              finance for investments in farm inputs, agricultural machinery, agribusinesses, and marketing infrastructure. The credit line (US$3.2 million) will
                              enable Aiyl Bank to continue lending to the rural sector during the transfer to deposit mobilization and privatization. The Credit Line will increase

                                                                                                                                                                           Page 1 of 3
                               farmers access to financing in order to promote increased productivity in the rural sector. The Credit Line will likely consist of two products:

                               i.        Working capital loans, providing access to much needed short-term financing for spring and winter planting (agricultural inputs, such as
                               seeds, fertilizers and fuel) and harvesting activities for small farmers and farmer cooperatives.
                               ii.       Investment loans and leases, to enable farmers and farmer cooperatives to purchase farm machinery, invest in warehouses and other
                               productive assets in the heavily under-invested farming sector. Long-term investment loans and leases will be provided under the sub-component.

                               Aiyl Banks mission is to increase the efficiency and profitability of the rural sector in the Kyrgyz Republic and improve living conditions of the village
                               population by providing financial services. Aiyl Banks objectives are to: (i) provide high quality financial services to agricultural and rural sectors in
                               an efficient and cost-effective manner; (ii) support the development and raise efficiency of production and incomes of the private agricultural and
                               rural sectors of the country; (iii) meet the client target groups demand for credit resources; (iv) provide high quality management of the credit
                               portfolio ensuring appropriate pricing, minimization of lending risks, diversification of the portfolio, and sustainability of the lending operations
                               through timely repayment of the loans by the borrowers. Aiyl Bank devotes 70 percent of its lending to agriculture (including agribusiness) and 30
                               percent to non-agricultural businesses. The credit line under FSDP will be used to finance projects that fall within the agricultural portion of Aiyl
                               Banks lending policy, subject to provision of the FSDP EMF. The average working capital loan size is expected to be around US$5,000, while the
                               average investment loans is expected to be in the range of US$25,000 equivalent, with a maximum of US$50,000 per loan under this Credit Line.
                               The Credit Line beneficiaries will receive sub-loans/leases in accordance with agreed eligibility criteria. The financial and commercial viability of the
                               sub-projects and beneficiaries under this facility will be assessed by Aiyl Bank. It is estimated that around 500 farmers will have access to sub-
                               loans under this program.

                               4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                               Aiyl Bank and the project credit line will operate in rural areas throughout the Kyrgyz Republic. The project will be implemented countrywide based
                               on demand for services and loans, and will not be located in protected areas. The focus will be on agricultural areas currently under cultivation.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                  With respect to OP 4.01, Environmental Assessment, the project is assigned World Bank environmental category FI, as the exact sub-projects
                                  to be funded under the credit line are not identified prior to implementation. However, only sub-projects that present moderate environmental
                                  risks that can be readily mitigated during implementation will be eligible for funding. The planned new Credit Line for farmers and
                                  agribusinesses is intended to support productivity increase in agriculture. These activities may generate some positive and adverse
                                  environmental impacts.

                                  There are potential positive and negative environmental impacts that may result from the implementation of the Project. The identified positive
                                  impacts of the Project include improved soil fertility due to fodder crop sowing (enrichment by nitrogen) and use of phosphorus-potassium
                                  fertilizers. The potential negative environmental impacts that may result from implementation of the Project include: (a) increased pollution of
                                  ground and surface waters due to soil erosion and use of fertilizers and pesticides; (b) threats to human health and wildlife due to improper
                                  handling of treated seeds, fertilizers and pesticides; (c) increased siltation of water bodies due to soil erosion; (d) introduction of genetic
                                  monoculture through seed purchased with credit line financing; and (e) construction waste. These potential negative impacts will be mitigated
                                  through the environmental screening and sub-project environmental management plans (EMPs) under the Environmental Management
                                  Framework (EMF). The project will not finance acquisition of land, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), pesticides, or World Bank Category
                                  A sub-projects under the credit line.

                                  No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated under the project.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                  N/A
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

                                                                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 3
                              The project team considered omitting a credit line for this project, but decided that the economic and social benefits of providing the credit line
                              to Aiyl Bank greater outweigh the moderate and manageable environmental risks presented by this sub-component.
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                              The CLMU under the Ministry of Finance will implement the credit line and undertake the safeguards functions for the Project. Aiyl Bank will
                              serve as the financial intermediary and implement the credit line. The CLMU has prepared an EMF for the Project, based on their previous
Public Disclosure Copy




                              experience with the similar World Bank-financed Agricultural Productivity Assistance Project (APAP) and previous Agri-Business and Marketing
                              Project (ABMP). Because of the similarity in the credit line objectives and the EMF for APAP and the current proposed project, consultations on
                              the EMF for APAP, conducted in March 2011, are considered adequate for the proposed project EMF. The CLM✵ s experience in supporting
                              implementation of the Project in keeping with the EMF is considered very strong, based on its role with previous similar World Bank projects.
                              The CLM✵ s capacity will be strengthened by recruitment of the local environmental specialist for this Project. Aiyl Bank also has good
                              experience with similar environmental procedures through serving as a participating financial institution for on-lending under both the APAP and
                              ABMP. Aiyl Bank loan officers at HQ and all branch offices will receive training on the EMF procedures, and will be able to draw on support
                              from the CLMU environmental specialist in case of need.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                              During project preparation, counterparts including MoF, CLMU and Aiyl Bank were consulted extensively to identify and agree appropriate and
