                              support the institutional reform aiming at conferring more autonomy to HEIs and strengthening the oversight role of the MOHESR and (ii) assist in
                              improving the quality of programs offered by HEIs through aligning HEI programs with the LMD standard and supporting to the implementation of
                              a set of new, labor market oriented, academic programs. It is expected that, upon successful completion of the project, the higher education sector
                              would have developed the capacity to make more efficient and effective use of physical, financial and human resources to produce graduates
                              relevant to the needs of the economy, and be prepared to engage in further reforms aiming at increasing access to and quality of higher education
                              programs.

                               Component 1: Sector Management and Governance Reform (Estimated cost including contingencies US$15.7 million, IDA US$9.3 million).
                              The objective of this component is to strengthen management capacity of the higher education sector at both central and HEIs levels. Activities
                              under this component will assist in establishing and building the capacity of the new Direction Générale de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la
                              Recherche Scientifique (DGESRS) which is expected to play a key role in overseeing HEIs and guiding sector policy. By the end of the project, the
                              DGESRS is expected to have developed a shared long-term vision for the sector, and designed and started implementing a sector program with a
                              view to improve access to and quality and relevance of higher education. This component will also assist HEIs in their transition toward more
                              autonomy and accountability. It is expected that, by the end of the project, six HEIs will have established three year business plans approved by
                              their Boards of Directors (Trustees), and at least two of them will have negotiated and signed with the Government program contracts. Specific
                              activities under this component include:

                              Sub-component 1.1: Strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Higher Education to articulate and implement reform. Activities under this sub-
                              component will support the establishment of and capacity building for the new DGESRS with a particular emphasis on the new Planning and
                              Quality Assurance units to be established.
                              Sub-component 1.2: SIGES: The design and implementation, under the leadership of the MOHESR, of a standard management information
                              system for HEIs (accounting, budgeting, personnel, academic and students’ management, facilities management, etc) which will be gradually
                              deployed and refined to meet each HEI requirements, and will enable the production of basic data and indicators to feed the MOHESR central
                              database for monitoring and planning purposes. This sub-component will also finance IT equipment and consultant services needed for the
                              implementation of the SIGES at both the central and HEIs levels.
                              Sub-component 1.3: Support to the Emergency Plan The four new universities resulting from the scission of the University of Bamako, and the
                              University of Ségou have identified basic resources needed for the functioning of the new universities and to face the dramatic increase in newly
                              admitted students for the academic year 2011/12. This sub-component will contribute to this Emergency Plan through financing equipment,
                              furniture and consultancy services.
                              Sub-component 1.4: Development of new university structures. This sub-component will assist the IESs in the implementation of the governance
                              reform and the LMD system. Activities for this component include; (i) training to members of Boards of Administrators and academic committees,
                              and HEIs administrative staff; (ii) consultant services to develop management systems and tools; (iii) support to the development of business plans

                                                                                                                                                                      Page 1 of 3
                               and the piloting of two contract programs between HEIs and the Government. Funding mechanisms and procedures to define what program
                               contracts will finance; and (iv) support to the establishment of QA units.

                                Component 2: Quality Improvement and Diversification for Higher Education Programs (Estimated cost including contingencies US$15.5 million,
                               IDA US$15.3 million).
                               This component will support Government efforts aiming at improving the quality and diversifying higher education programs by improving their
                               relevance to the needs of the economy. This would be achieved through, on the one hand, the development of new programs responding to the

                               labor market needs and aligned with an internationally recognized standards; and, on the other hand, upgrading the quality of inputs in the delivery
                               of higher education programs.
                               Sub-component 2.1: Support to new academic programs. The UMEOA is financing a Technical Assistance to identify and develop the content for
                               22 labor market oriented academic programs aligned with the LMD system for each of the eight member countries of the West-Africa region..
                               Sub-component 2.2: Support to the creation of new HEIs. Another measure planned under the sector Operational Plan is to diversify the supply of
                               higher education through the creation of new institutions. First, the University of Ségou, the first regional university in Mali, will start its operations
                               within the new institutional framework involving more autonomy and stronger accountability, and is therefore expected to serve as a model for the
                               university governance reform. The project will finance the preparation of academic programs, business plan including organizational arrangements
                               and business processes, and architectural and engineering studies. Second, the government is planning to develop a network of Instituts
                               Supérieurs de Technologie Appliquée (ISTA) to be deployed across the country (Bamako, Sikasso, Kayes, Mopti and Ségou). The ISTAs are
                               expected to produce the mid-level technical cadre needed in sectors such as IT, textile, agro-industry and mines. The project will finance
                               preparatory studies for the ISTAs including employers’ surveys, development of academic programs, and feasibility studies.
                               Sub-component 2.3: Training of Trainers Program (PFF).
                               Sub-component 2.4: Upgrading libraries. This sub-component will finance, first, an assessment study to identify the needs of the main and based
                               on the recommendations, the project will finance: (i) refurbishing works (repair, painting and light rehabilitation) and furniture to upgrade the
                               facilities of HEIs libraries as needed; (ii) IT equipment and software; (iii) training to HEIs librarians; and (iv) basic reference books.

                                Component 3: Project Management and M&E (Estimated cost including contingencies US$3.7 million, IDA US$2.43 million)
                               This component will support the implementation of the project and the strengthening of the MOHESR and HEIs capacity to implement policy
                               reforms and new activities. The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be responsible for the daily management, implementation, administration,
                               project coordination, and monitoring and evaluation of the project. A more detailed description of this component is provided in Annex 3. It will
                               finance the equipment, training of staff, the preparation of monitoring reports and technical assistance required for procurement, capacity building
                               of the DGESRS, coordination with HEIs, implementation of the scholarship program for PhDs, and the implementation of environmental action
                               plans.

                         II.   Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                               A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

                               1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe any potential large scale,
                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                     n/a
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                     n/a
                               3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                                     n/a
                               4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                                  and implement the measures described.

                                                                                                                                                                              Page 2 of 3
                               The project, regarding the activities to be financed, will not have adverse impacts on any environmental or socioeconomic resources in the
                              implementation areas. But, the refurbishing of libraries will produce some solid wastes, which will be disposed through the existing city waste
                              management systems. The contracts to be passed with enterprises for these activities will entail provisions for adequate collection and disposal
                              of waste produced during their works. These works/activities will be carried out in accordance with national and local laws and regulations.

                              A review of the institutional capacities of the implementing institutions revealed that there is a basic institutional and regulatory framework for
                              waste management in Mali (Decree no. 01-394/P-RM of September 2011) enforced by the “Direction Nationale du Contrôle des Pollutions et

                              Nuisances? (DNACPN) and its decentralized units. Thus, almost all the major municipalities have set up a waste management system run in
                              partnership with the private sector and NGOs. Notwithstanding some difficulties in the collection of domestic hazardous wastes, significant
                              efforts are ongoing for the improvement of the sanitation of public areas.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
