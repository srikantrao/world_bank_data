     B. Project Objectives
     The project development objective (POO) is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) through
     improved energy efficiency in street lighting on public highways.

     c. Project Description
     This carbon finance operation includes a small scale program of activities (PoA) to be
     implemented by the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). The PoA sims to improve the
     energy efficiency of street lights within the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) service area
     by replacing 250 1 watt High Pressure Sodium (HPS) units with 156 watt Light Emitting Diode
     (LED) units. The total number of 250 W HPS lamps to be replaced with 156 watt LED lamps is
     approximately 455,0002• The existing lamps are owned and managed by the Department of
     Highways (DoH), Ministry of Transport, but the electricity for the lighting system is provided by
     PEA free of charge. The installation of LEDs is expected to substantially reduce the electricity
     consumption paid for by PEA. When compared to the HPS units, the LED system can save

     1 The total HPS unit typically consumes 31 S W including ballast
     2 This number might change with the progress of the implementation   orthe program
around 50% of electricity consumption and therefore the electricity expenses that PEA pays to its
electricity supplier, Electricity Generating Authority ofThailand (EGAT).

D. Project location (if known)
The PoA will be implemented within the geographical boundary ofThailand, in the following
regions: (i) North; (ii) North-east; (Hi) Central; and (iv) South.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The implementing agency, PEA, is a major state-owned enterprise, that has undertaken their own
funded large infrastructure projects. The TT's preliminary assessment is t1:tat PEA, with support
from the TI has the required in..house capacity to meet both Thailand's and the World Bank's
environmental and social safeguards policies.

Environmental Assessment (OPIBP 4.01)                              X
The proposed pr~ject will only involve replacement of existing street lighting units ( the poles
will remain in place) with more energy efficient ones. Therefore, the environmental safeguards
issues associated with this project only involve the removal, handling, storage and disposaI of the
removed units. To this end, PEA will prepare a Waste Management Disposal Plan for Safe
DisposaJ of Replaced HPS Light Bulbs.

Also, in compliance with Thailand's own Environmental Laws, PEA will need to prepare an
Initial Environmental Evaluation (IEE).

Therefore, it has been agreed that the Waste Management Disposai Plan will be part of the IEE
document. The document will be publicly disclosed locally in Thailand, in the Thai language and
also in English at the World Bank's Infoshop, prior to appraisal of the pro·ect.
