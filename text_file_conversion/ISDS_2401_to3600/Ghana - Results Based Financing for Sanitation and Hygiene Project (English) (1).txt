B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
Project Objective: The Grant development objective is to improve the sanitation and hygiene
practices of an estimated 112,500 poor and vulnerable persons in four districts of northern Ghana

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The proposed project will have four components as follows: (i) Stimulating demand for
sanitation and hygiene services through behavioral change communication (BCC), (ii)
Stimulating willingness of communities to take lead in investing in household latrines and
provision of waste collection bins and matching community contributions with project funds to
provide more improved latrine at a lower cost to households, (iii) direct investment from project
funds into school sanitation and hygiene facilities in 16 schools, (iv) monitoring and evaluation,
knowledge dissemination and project management and administration. The project adopts the
Results based financing approach, stimulates bottom-up approach implementation and
strengthens local private sector participation.

D. Project location (if known)
Project will be located in four districts of northern Ghana.

E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The borrower has capacity to address and manage safeguards. The Community water and
sanitation agency (CWSA), the EPA and the district assemblies are currently implementing the
Sustainable Rural Water and Sanitation Project. The capacity of these institutions have been built
through safeguards training. Application of knowledge will be monitored regularly to fill in any
gaps that may be identified.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered                                          Yes            No          TBD
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                   X
    The project triggers this policy becuase of the construction of water source points and
sanitation facilities at household and institutional levels. For these activities, there are likely to be
some minimal impacts that can be managed or contained if not completely avoidable. An ESMF
will be prepared by the borrower to address or mitigate potential environmental impacts
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)                                                         X
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)                                                                  X
Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                                             X

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)                                   X
    The subprojects at the household and institutional levels may require land. This may have
potential impacts on people's livelihoods, access and possible restrictions temporarily or
permanently. An RPF will be prepared to outline the processes for addressing any such impacts.
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37)                                                           X
