                           process and enhance efficiency of both the administrative staff of Rosh ydromet and the entire Roshydromet's system; (ii) develop a standard
                           technology to deliver information and warnings on hydrometeorological emergencies and disasters from Regional Branches and Centers to
                           divisions of Ministry of Emergency Situations through an open segment of the integrated information-telecommunication system of Roshydromet.
                           The related operational procedures will be developed along with the revision of a list of hydrometeorological thresholds critical for economic
                           activities to ensure hydrometeorological safety in the regions and federal districts.

                           19.       Component 4: Project management and systems integration (Estimated cost: US$4.0 million). This component will finance project
                           management, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation of project implementation. To ensure integrity and operability of operation of multiple
                           monitoring networks and information systems it is planned to hire a Systems integrator. The importance of such an assignment was confirmed by
                           the lessons learned of Hydromet-1 Project and similar projects.

                            D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                           The proposed project is not expected to have negative social and environmental impacts. The Hydromet-2 project investments are expected to
                           generate positive environmental and social benefits in the form of increased preparedness of populations to weather, hydrological, and climate
                           related hazards, and avoided losses of life and properties. The project is not expected to have negative environmental impacts related to
                           installation of observation and monitoring infrastructure. There are no affected peoples as a result of the proposed project interventions. An
                           Environmental Assessment Category of "C" is proposed for this project, and therefore, no Environmental Assessment is required.

                           The main project activities will be conducted within Roshydromet Headquarters in Moscow and its Regional Centers in St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk,
                           Rostov and Khabarovsk and will primarily include minor refurbishments of those sections of Roshydromet buildings where new equipment will be
                           placed. No land acquisition will be required. Renovation will be conducted within the existing Roshydromet premises with little or temporary
                           disturbance of employee's working conditions. Additional activities dealing primarily with replacement of site hydrometeorological observation
                           instruments will be undertaken in a few dozens of Roshydromet sites on the territory of the Russian Federation. Their locations will be determined
                           by the implementing agency prior to project appraisal.

                            E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

                           There are minimal environmental and social risks related to project activities under the proposed project. Experience during the implementation of
                           RU-Hydromet -1 indicates that the Borrower has built adequate capacity to manage site specific activities and impacts during installation of
                           observation equipment at monitoring posts in a way which does not impact local environmental conditions or harms ecosystems. The proposed
                           project will put in place proper supervision arrangements which will be sufficient for monitoring any safeguards risks during implementation. The
                           Operations Manual for RU- Hydromet-2 will include a section on management of environmental and social risk with adequate provisions in the
                           Implementation Agreement.
