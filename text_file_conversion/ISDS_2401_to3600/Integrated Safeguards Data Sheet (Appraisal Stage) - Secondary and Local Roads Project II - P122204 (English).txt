                              The proposed project follows the successful implementation of the ongoing Secondary and Local Roads Project (SLRP).
                              It will consist of two components:

                              Component 1: Rehabilitation and Improvement of Selected Secondary and Local Roads (US$ 82 million equivalent total, US$ 65.6 million Bank
                              Financing). This component will finance rehabilitation of a number of secondary and local road sections throughout the country. The Government
                              has identified 17 road sections with a total length of about 200 km. The first year program will include the 6 road sections for which the designs
                              have been completed. This component will also supports the implementation of both; the pilot performance-based and design-build contracts.

                              Component 2: Institutional Strengthening (US$5.5 million equivalent total, US$4.4 million Bank Financing). This component involves provision of
                              advisory services for: (i) strengthening of RD and Foreign Project Unit (FPU) capacity in project management and implementation, road
                              management, environmental and social safeguards compliance, road safety audits, and identification and implementation of road safety measures;
                              and (ii) implementation of the road management system.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              The project will cover the selected sections of roads throughout the country.

                                 of Shio Mgvime and David Garevi, and one – passing through difficult mountainous terrain in Tusheti. Works on these roads will require more
                                 caution as compared to others. Rehabilitation of sections of road leading towards Shio Mgvime and David Gareji will not directly affect these
                                 historical monuments, though, being an access road to these tourist destinations, their rehabilitation will require particular attention to clean-up
                                 and landscape harmonization upon completion of works, so that aesthetic features of the sites are not compromised. Works in the critical
                                 sections of the narrow mountainous road to Tusheti will be aimed at improving safety of driving in the locations prone to slope erosion and
                                 avalanches. Organization of works in this area will require smart solutions for traffic management, careful operation of construction vehicles and
                                 machinery, and strict adherence to workers personal safety rules. For all other sections of roads the potential environmental issues are
                                 expected to be minor and typical for small-scale rehabilitation works on roads, mainly comprising: construction waste management, sourcing of
                                 natural construction materials (soil/gravel/sand), running of small asphalt/concrete plants, and maintaining/servicing construction machinery.

                                 No major land acquisition or physical displacement of residents is expected to be required under the project; the project will not finance new
                                 road construction and maintenance works will be carried out within the existing alignment of roads. Nevertheless experience from SLRP I
                                 shows that minor land acquisition along existing rights-of-way may contribute to the improvement of geometric standards of the existing right-of-
                                 way, provide adequate space for drainage, and enhance add road safety solutions such as sidewalks, road crossings, guardrails, and safety
                                 barriers. In addition, land acquisition may be necessitated in response to unforeseen events such as landslides whereby previous alignments
                                 are no longer feasible and the optimum design for a modified road stretch requires additional and an increased land foot print.
                               2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area:
                                 Upgrading of the target sections of the secondary and local roads will cut travel time, increase road safety, and decrease fuel use by individual
                                                                                                                                                                             Page 2 of 4
                           vehicles. It is expected that annual traffic volumes on these roads may increase to some extent, though not above the designed carrying
                           capacity. Therefore, the anticipated long term environmental and social impacts of the project implementation are positive.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                            and implement the measures described.

                           An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is developed for the project, building on the similar documents prepared by the
                           client for the Bank-financed road rehabilitation operations in the past. ESMF provides an overview of the expected environmental and social
                           issues related to the project implementation and will offer comprehensive guidance on the site-specific environmental management planning to
                           be carried out by the client for all sections of roads to be proposed for the project intervention on the rolling basis. Although the tentative list of
                           the individual road sections to be rehabilitated under the SLRP II may be updated as implementation progresses and despite the fact that
                           detailed designs are not finalized for all sections currently on the work program list, the nature, scope, and potential impacts of upcoming works
                           are well known upfront. Potential negative impacts are typical for the small road rehabilitation projects and pretty similar for all intended
                           individual investments. Therefore, the Environmental Management Checklist for Small Scale Road Construction or Rehabilitation will be used
                           as a tool for planning, implementing, and monitoring site-specific environmental management work. Checklists to be completed for each section
                           of road included in the project will carry: brief description of a site, technical outline of planned works, potential environmental and social risks of
                           such works, set of measures for their mitigation, and a plan for monitoring application of mitigation measures. Completed environmental
                           management checklists will be subject to the World Bank review and approval.

                           LIkelihood of any type of involuntary resettlement under the project is little, though largely as a precautionary measure, the project triggers OP/
                           BP4.12. According to this safeguard policy, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) is prepared by the RD MRDI and approved by the World
                           Bank. Site-specific RAPs will be developed - if and as necessary - in the course of the project implementation. The RPF and RAP will ensure
                           the proper calculation and recording of the amount land to be acquired as well as identification and mitigation of the impacts of land acquisition
                           for the affected people. The purpose of the RPF and implementation of the RAP is to ensure that there is no adverse effect on the living
                           conditions and livelihoods of the affected people as a result of loss of land.

                           RD MRDI is responsible for due application of environmental and social safeguards. Due environmental and social diligence of RD MRDI will
                           include assuring (i) presence of satisfactory site-specific EMPs for all sections of roads under rehabilitation and RAPs if and as required; (ii)
                           presence of the required permits for waste disposal, quarrying and borrowing, operation of asphalt/concrete plants, etc. as applicable; (iii)
                           proper application of mitigation measures provided in the site-specific EMPs and RAPS in the course of works and upon their completion; and
                           (iv) observance of occupational safety rules as well as safety of traffic and pedestrian movement in and around work sites. For meeting such
                           standards RD MRDI will develop site-specific EMPs for the sections of roads selected for rehabilitation, exercise quality control of EMPs for the
                           road asset management areas prepared by contractors under performance-based contractual (PBC) arrangements, guarantee inclusion of
                           EMPs in the bidding documents for rehabilitation works and their incorporation into the works contracts, maintain efficient mechanism of field
                           environmental monitoring of works, and evaluate environmental performance of PBC contractors as part of their payment release clearance
                           procedure. RD MRDI will be capable of performing these functions through strengthening its institutional capacity for environmental
                           management by maintaining an environmental unit comprising five staff members of RD with relevant education and professional skills, as well
                           as hiring of an external highly qualified environmental specialist. These arrangements are intended to serve critical institutional needs of RD
                           MRDI in general, as well as to ensure smooth implementation of SLRP II and other ongoing operations being implemented by RD MRDI with
                           the Bank support.

                            on potentially affected people.
                           Population of provincial municipalities and rural areas using the roads selected for the project intervention for travel and transportation are the
                           main beneficiaries of the project. Some of the target roads provide access to the remarkable touristic sites and potential visitors of these sites
                           will also benefit from safer and smoother driving conditions. Secondary and local roads, depending on their classification, are operated and
                           managed either by the local municipalities or by RD MRDI. These governmental institutions are the key stakeholder of the project

                           RD MRDI, in the capacity of the project implementing entity, disclosed ESMF and RPF documents in Georgian and English languages through
                           its web page and solicited feedback on them. Once the site-specific EMPs and RAPs (whenever required) are drafted as the detailed designs
                           arrive on the rolling basis, RD MRDI will ensure their disclosure as well, with an emphasis on accessibility of these documents for local
                           communities likely to be affected by the project implementation. Consultation meetings will be organized and comments will be considered for
                           finalizing site-specific environmental and resettlement documents. Minutes of such consultation meetings will be documented and kept on file.
                           Presence of the approved EMPs and RAPs (if required) will be mandatory for allowing mobilization of works contractors to the individual project
                           sites.
