                           C. Project Description
                           The project will have the following components:
                         (1)      Construction of two underground stations La Magdalena and El Labrador. Using own funds,
                         the DMQ held a bid for this construction contract and works have started. The estimated cost is $ 83
                         million.

                         (2)      Construction of 23 km of tunnel, 16 stations, and provision of all track and
                         electromechanical equipment needed (signaling, power supply, communications, control center, fare
                         collection, etc.). The World Bank will finance $200 million of this contract worth around $1.23
                         billion. IDB, EIB, and CAF will also finance this contract using co-financing. The bidding process
                         for this contract has started already and the Bank is involved under the figure of Advance
                         contracting/retroactive financing. When required, the client will request an official response from the
                         Bank in accordance to the applicable procurement guidelines.
                         (3)      Acquisition of 18, six-car trains, with four motorized cars per train. This rolling stock will be
                         built to meet the specifications of the Quito Metro. This component will be financed by the DMQ
                         with own funds. The estimated cost is US$ 193 million.
                         (4)      Technical Assistance. Supervision of works is essential to ensure design standards and
                         specifications are met. Project management is needed to emulate the successful Spanish experience
                         with subway construction in which a knowledgeable set of experts is able to address rapidly
                         controversies that emerge between contractor and owner. This component will be financed by the
                         IDB, CAF, and the DMQ. The estimated cost is $ 51 million.

                         The total cost of the project is estimated to be $1.680 billion dollars, including all applicable taxes.

                         The expected construction period is three and a half years, from 2013 to 2016. The proposed closing
                         date is December 31, 2017.

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project is located in Quito, Ecuador in an urban setting. A small portion of the project
                         construction will take place historic center of Quito which is a World Heritage site.. While the tunnel
                         between stations will be built using tunnel boring machines, the stations will be built by excavating

                         from the surface. One station will be in Plaza San Francisco, possibly the most historic squarein the
                         city. Another possible station would be in Plaza del Teatro station, which is a building in poor
                         condition and would be demolished to expand the square.
                         E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                         Quito Metro is responsible for the project environmental and social aspects. Quito Metro has
                         established an Environmental and Social Division responsible for environmental and social aspects.
                         Various components of the project Environmental and Social Management Plan will be implemented
                         by the project construction company. Quito Metro reported that they are presently developing a plan
                         to improve their institutional capacity related to environmental and social aspects, and to develop and
                         implement an environmental and social management system. Quito Metro will hire an independent
                         consultant firm to perform project supervision on environmental and social aspects. The project will
                         also conduct an annual environmental and social audit. The Ministry of Environment is responsible
                         for issuing the project Environmental License and subsequent supervision. Quito Metro has reported
                         that they have been coordinating with other relevant governmental agencies.
