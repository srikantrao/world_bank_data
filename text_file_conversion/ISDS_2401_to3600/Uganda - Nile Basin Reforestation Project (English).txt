2. Project Objectives:

This carbon offset operation corresponds to the investments under IDA project P073089 and its
Additional Financing P111366.

The overall goal of this Carbon Finance project is carbon sequestration through the reforestation
of 2,137 ha within Rwoho Central Forest Reserve (CFR). The project includes 5 small-scale self-
standing CDM projects. It is estimated that the overall project will generate on average
50,000 tCO2 a year.
3. Project Description:

The project will provide access to carbon markets to the National Foresty Authority (NFA), as
well as 6 community groups that participate in the benefit-sharing through Collaborative Forest
Management. Emissions Reductions (ERs) are generated through reforestation. The carbon
project is a component of an investment project P073089 and its Additional Financing P111366.
There will be no additional investment for this carbon component.

The NFA manages Rwoho CFR on behalf of the Government of Uganda as stipulated in the
National Forestry and Tree Planting Act, 2003. NFA intends to re-forest 2,137 ha within the
Rwoho CFR. The plantation is established in blocks of 25 ha on average, grouped in 5 small-
scale CDM projects (Project 1 – 468 ha; Project 2 – 370 ha; Project 3 – 341.9 ha; Project 4 –
347.1 ha; Project 5 – 487.6 ha). The blocks are separated by the fire breaks.

The project area will be covered with 75% Pinus caribaea planted on hill tops and slopes, which
has already been introduced and tested in the area. In addition, valley bottoms and sheltered sites
will be planted with Maesopsis eminii and Prunus Africana (20% and 5% respectively). Pinus
and Maesopsis will be managed on a 22 year rotation cycle or until the target diameter of 45 cm
is reached for timber production. Prunus will be managed on a similar rotation cycle for timber
production, and, additionally, on a 10 year harvesting cycle for medicinal bark production.

For all project-supported tree planting activities the NFA uses a preference scheme sourcing
labor for clearing, planting, weeding, etc. mainly from the communities adjacent to the target
forest reserves.

A total area of 346.7 ha is planted by 6 community groups under the Collaborative Forest
Management (CFM) agreements, including Project 1 – 65.6 ha; Project 2 – 35.9 ha; Project 3 –
22.7 ha; Project 4 – 22.2 ha; and Project 5 – 74.6 ha. Community groups that have CFM
agreements for the project area are: BECA (Bushwere Environmental Conservation Association),
KADA (Kanywamaizi Development Association), KAFODA (Kagoto Foundation for
Development Association), RRECSO (Rwampala Rural Enterprises Cooperative Savings and
Credit Society Limited), SWAGEN (Support for Women in Agriculture and Environment), and
RECPA (Rwoho Environmental and Protection Associations).

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

The project area is within the Rwoho Central Forest Reserve in Mbarara, Isingiro, and Ntungamo
Districts in south-western Uganda. The topography is mid altitude hill ranges from 1,400 metres
to 1800 metres above sea level. The area is drained by numerous streams, some of which drain in
Mishumba river in Rwoho, which itself drains into the Kagera river that is part of the Nile river
system. The forested areas in the CFR are dominated by Albizzia-Markhamia tree species, which
occur in valleys. Plantation establishment in Rwoho CFR with conifer species started in 1964.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

The BioCF resources will help promote sustainable forest management in Uganda. Thus, the
project is conceived and designed to have significant positive environmental and social impacts.
The project will be supporting the rehabilitation of degraded forest areas in Uganda by replanting
trees using the community co-management model. The aim is to improve the forest cover and
environmental protection of the watersheds. The project will not result in any potential large
scale, significant or irreversible impacts.

The carbon offset operation corresponds to the investments under P073089 and P111369, and no
additional investment will be needed. All necessary safeguards have been conducted under the
parent project and disclosed under the same.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:

No negative long-term impacts are anticipated due to project activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
N/a

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

Strong capacity exists for safeguard issues - the project is implemented by experienced technical
staff in the national forestry agency that deal with the national environmental safeguards in their
daily work, mainstream them as part of the core activities, and have received the Bank
safeguards training.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The management of the reserve is the responsibility of the NFA. However, the National Forestry
and Tree Planting Act, 2003 requires that the NFA manages the reserves in close collaboration
and consultations with the different stakeholder categories. The key stakeholders are the
communities surrounding project sites. They are consulted in the course of preparing
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Forest Management Plan (FMP) in accordance
with the requirements of the Government of Uganda and the World Bank, as prepared under the
parent project. The EIA and FMP were duly disclosed in-country and through the InfoShop
under the parent project (P073089).
