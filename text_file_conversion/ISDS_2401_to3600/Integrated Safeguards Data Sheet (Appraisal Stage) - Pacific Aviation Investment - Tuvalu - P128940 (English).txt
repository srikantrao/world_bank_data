Public Disclosure Copy




                              Component A: Aviation Infrastructure Improvements: This component will invest in the aviation infrastructure at Funafuti (FUN) airport so that it is
                              able to meet minimum ICAO standards, while preserving and extending the service life of existing airport assets. The activities include:
                              # Rehabilitation of airport pavement: The project will rehabilitate the runway, taxiway and apron. This will see the existing surfaces milled (if
                              needed) and replaced with asphalt concrete, cement concrete and/or interlocking concrete/stone pavers as appropriate, with proper attention to
                              airfield drainage to prevent ponding on shoulders, aprons and other critical areas.
                              # Terminal building and Control tower: Construction of a new terminal and control tower at Funafuti airport.
                              # Air Traffic Control Equipment: Provision of ceilometers, signal lamps, radios, backup generator, along with the necessary communication and
                              surveillance equipment, including Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B)
                              # PASNet: Provision of the PASnet secure communications system;
                              # End Obstacle Survey: WGS S84 - End Obstacle survey for instrument approach;
                              # Security improvements: Provision of X-Ray equipment and screen facilities for both hold baggage and carry-on baggage;
                              # Fire safety: Provision of a fire tender; provision of fire equipment for firemen (jackets, oxygen, etc.).
                              # Weather monitoring: Automatic Weather Observation computer linkage to Meteorological weather station.
                              # Consulting services: (i) Procurement of design and supervision consultant; and, (ii) Specialists for preparation of technical specifications on
                              aviation equipment.

                              Component B: Aviation Sector Reform: The project will provide support to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to adopt and implement the new Civil
                              Aviation Regulations as well as the agreed corrective action plan following the ICAO safety and security audits.

                              Component C: Strengthening Airport Operations and Management Capacity. The project will assist Tuvalu to establish appropriate operating
                              structures through a study to identify options for creating separate operating company for operating Funafuti airport. Financing and support for the
                              implementation of the recommended framework is not currently included in the project.

                              Component D: Project Support. This component will finance project monitoring and operation support required for implementation.

                              4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if known)

                              Funafuti International Airport (FUN) is located on the largest island in Tuvalu, Funafuti, the width of which ranges from 20 meters to 400 meters.
                              The airport is surrounded by villages and government buildings. There are no official protected areas on Funafuti island.

                                  significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                 The physical interventions include (a) resurfacing of the existing runway; (b) demolishing the existing control tower and constructing a new one
                                 at a new location; (c) constructing a new terminal building; and (d) installing air traffic control equipment.
                                 The project is Category B based on the screening criteria provided in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared
                                 for the Pacific Aviation Investment Project. The potential environmental impacts from the above interventions are mostly construction-related,
                                 temporary in nature and can be addressed through engineering design and by implementing sound environmental management of construction
                                 activities. The area of influence is very limited as the civil works will be carried out within the existing property boundary of, or on land directly
                                 adjacent to, the airport. In summary, the main potential environmental impacts and concerns identified include: (i) construction-related
                                 nuisances such as noise, dust from construction and exhaust emissions from machines; (ii) disturbance to local traffic; (iii) construction workers'
                                 and community safety; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous materials such as used fuel and lubricants; (v) land clearance around
                                 the boundary of the airport; (vi) solid waste and wastewater management during construction and operation.

                                 Following the safeguards approach laid out by the ESMF, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared to address the afore-
                                 mentioned environmental impacts and concerns. The EMP will form part of the contract and hence the contractor will be legally bound to
                                 comply with the EMP. The EMP comprises four main components, namely, mitigation plans, monitoring plans, institutional arrangements, and a
                                 field supervision checklist. It covers the design, construction and operational phases of the project, and summarizes the budget, reporting
                                 arrangements, timing and the responsibility for its implementation and supervision. The mitigation measures are built on relevant national laws
                                 and regulations, EHS Guidelines
                                 for Occupational Health and Safety, and OP4.01. The field supervision checklist will be used by the supervising engineers. The signed
                                 checklists will be provided to the Head of Civil Aviation Department (CAD), who will be responsible for the compliance reporting to the Bank.

                                 The project does not trigger OP4.12 Involuntary Resettlement as no land acquisition is needed. A due diligence review was also undertaken to
                                 confirm that there are no outstanding land issues in the project area. Consultations with government officials, local households, site inspection,
                                 as well as review of land registration and lease payment records obtained from the Department of Lands and Surveys confirmed that no land
                                 acquisition will be necessary, and the Project will not result in either the physical displacement of people or the economic displacement of

                              of the limited availability of suitable land in Tuvalu. The EMP discussed alternative sources of construction materials. Depending solely on local
                              resources may result in dredging of coral reefs, which could affect the suitability of the atoll islands, local marine environment and fisheries. As
                              a result, it was determined that the contractors will only be allowed to use recycled construction wastes and materials obtained from sustainable
                              excavation of local resources without influencing the environment, with the remaining demand of construction materials met by importing from
                              foreign countries
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan
                               and implement the measures described.
                              Given that this is the first World Bank financed investment project for Tuvalu, the Bank assisted the government in preparing the EMP. The
                              government assisted the World Bank in conducting its due diligence and provided information regarding the ongoing leases and land tenure
                              arrangements in the project areas. The EMP was disclosed and public consultation was undertaken. Potential risks in implementing the EMP
                              due to low client capacity will be mitigated by having the project's Design and Supervision Consultant monitor and report on safeguard
                              compliance as part of their project supervision activities. The Bank and the Design and Supervision Consultants will also provide training to the
                              Airport operational staff and the environmental staff in Tuvalu.
                            5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis
                               on potentially affected people.
                              The key stakeholders of the project are the people who live or work in buildings close to the airport, and passengers at the airport.
                              Consultations have been held to inform stakeholders of the proposed project, the potential impacts, and proposed measures and arrangements
                              to address the impacts.
