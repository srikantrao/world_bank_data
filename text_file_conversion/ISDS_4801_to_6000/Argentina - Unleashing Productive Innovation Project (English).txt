B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The high-level objective of the project would be to support the competitiveness of the Argentine 
economy by promoting innovation and the diversification of the production base. More 
specifically, the project seeks to support the creation of new knowledge-based companies, 
develop the capacity for innovation in priority sectors, expand human capital for productive 
innovation, and strengthen the policy framework for innovation.  
 
Progress towards meeting these objectives could tentatively be measured by two types of 
indicators: (i) output indicators (firms assisted, service satisfaction rates as revealed by clients 
survey, number of trained technology brokers and entrepreneurs) and (ii) outcome-indicators 
such as increase in sales and exports of knowledge
ñbased spin-offs and firms assisted with 
project funds and number ofknowledge-based start-ups attributed to the project.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would foster important, missing linkages across agents within the national 
innovation system. The project would have four components: (i) developing entrepreneurial 
Page  2
capacity for productive innovation; (ii) supporting knowledge-based start ups, (iii) fostering 
sector specific capacity for innovation; and (iv) strengthening the policy and institutional 
framework for innovation.  
 
Component 1: Developing entrepreneurial capacity for productive innovation  
 
The component would help to fill critical gaps in human capital for productive innovation. It 
would achieve the above through two subcomponents. The first would support the development 
and training of experts that would help enterprises understand their technology needs and/or act 
as bridges between research institutions and the productive sector. These types of experts are 
commonly referred to in the innovation community as ìtechnology brokersî and require a unique 
combination of knowledge in a technical field (e.g., ICT or biotechnology) with business skills. 
The component would upgrade the skills of professionals currently operating as ìtechnology 
brokersî, including practical training with industry overseas; develop new graduate business 
programs that will train professionals as ìtechnology brokersî and link these programs to similar 
international programs; and help insert these new professionals in the market. Subcomponent 
two will seek to promote a greater entrepreneurial orientation of engineering programs and other 
S&T careers by incorporating new entrepreneurial modules, including practical training with 
industry.  
 
Component 2: Support for knowledge-based companies  
 
The objective of this component would be to promote the development of new knowledge-
based companies. This project component would consist of three complementary 
subcomponents. The first part would provide pre-seed capital (small grants) to assist researchers 
and potential entrepreneurs with proof of concept of new technologies. This would fill an 
important gap that the market will not provide due to very high risks and uncertain returns in the 
future. The second part would support ìincubation structuresî accelerating the formation of new 
companies and serving as a demonstrative effect. The task of these ìincubation structuresî would 
be to actively seek promising ideas and entrepreneurs and provide them with specialized 
managerial, marketing and technical expertise transforming technical ideas into commercial 
projects. The structures would be based on public-private partnerships. Some of those projects 
would then be suitable for venture capital financing. The pilot venture capital fund would be 
privately-managed and comprise a very limited public contribution, for example 80 percent 
private and 20 percent public. Through very limited public participation (e.g., about US$5 
million), the pilot would help catalyze potential private investors. The pilot fund would be 
subject to a feasibility study to be performed during project preparation and a suitable 
governance framework. It would draw from other international experiences adapted to the 
realities of the Argentine context.  
 
Component 3: Fostering sector specific capacity for productive innovation  
 
The objective of this component is to develop critical knowledge and technological capacities 
in priority economic sectors as well as in sectors that contain a high public good component (for 
instance, energy, environment or health). International experiences indicate that market failures 
warranting state intervention need sufficient scale of investments to secure impact. This creates a 
Page  3
need to allocate part of STI funding strategically and with a clear focus towards selected priority 
sectors. Only sectors that have demonstrated a potential for excellence would be supported. The 
component would finance a few sectoral funds. The Funds would consist of several lines of 
support, such as (i) generating new knowledge with high sectoral impact and/or (ii) identifying, 
adapting and transferring knowledge to the sector, particularly to small and medium enterprises.  
Special emphasis would be placed on supporting centers of technological innovation with a 
strong sectoral focus or consortia among firms and knowledge institutions inside a specific 
sector.  
 
The selection of the sectors would be based on factors such as the strategic relevance for the 
country, potential for excellence, commitment of the sectoral ministries, demand from the private 
sector, the potential sector impact and the commitment and participation of provincial 
governments.  
 
Component 4: Strengthening the policy and institutional framework for innovation  
 
This component component would help to consolidate the capacity of SECyT to develop 
innovation policies in coordination with other ministries. This would be conducted in 
coordination with the IDB.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The activity will be executed in the capital as well as in provinces.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
No safeguard policy issues have been identified. The project is expected to have a neutral or 
positive impact on the environment. Only research projects and programs that are 
environmentally sound will receive funding. The project could have a positive impact to the 
extent that it may finance research to promote more environmentally sound practices.  
 
The Agency for Promotion of Science and Technology (ANPCyT) under the auspices of the 
Secretary of Science and Technology (SECyT) would coordinate the overall project and 
implement the first three project components. Tentatively, the three subcomponents of 
component IV would be implemented by SECyT, and the ANPCyT. ANPCyT has gained and 
proven a strong implementation capacity. During the last the 15 years it has successfully 
implemented a total of three IDB projects. The fourth IDB-project regarding Science, 
Technology and Innovation is in preparation.  
 
The unit for socio-
environmental management (Unidad de gesti√≥n socioambiental) within the 
agency will monitor that research projects and other entities in the agency comply with 
environmental and ethical guidelines. This unit has been established in the course of the IDB-
financed Modernization Program (PMT) II-III and has gained enormous experience. Therefore 
the unit can be considered a capable, knowledgeable and experienced partner in ensuring 
safeguards policies. Based on the already existent experinces with multilateral donors, the unit 
will prepare an Environmental management Plan in coordination with a safeguards specialist and 
adapt it to World Bank specific requirements.
