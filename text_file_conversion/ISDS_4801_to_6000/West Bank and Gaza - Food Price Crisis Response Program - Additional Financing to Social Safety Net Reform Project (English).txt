2. Project Objectives 
To mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the poorest 
and most vulnerable households.  An additional objective would be to strengthen 
MOSA’s institutional capacity to manage cash transfer programs.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed Additional Financing grant (out of the Food Price Crisis Response Trust 
Fund - FPCR-AF) gives the Palestinian Authority (PA) the opportunity to scale up its 
existing safety net instruments to demonstrate its commitment to the poorest and most 
vulnerable population groups in the West Bank and Gaza.  The Grant would finance one 
payment of $200 to about 25,000 of the poorest households that have been adversely 
affected by the recent increase in food prices.  These households will be selected using 
the SSNRP poverty targeting database using a “proxy means test” (PMT) to determine 
household eligibility.  
 
The proceeds of the additional financing grant will finance only cash benefits to poor 
households under component 1 of the SSNRP.
