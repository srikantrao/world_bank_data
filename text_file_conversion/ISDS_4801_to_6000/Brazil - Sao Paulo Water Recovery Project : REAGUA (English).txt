B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed project development objective is to increase water availability in the Stateís 
critical watersheds through: (i) improving water demand management and water consumption 
efficiency, controlling and reducing water losses, and reusing wastewater; (ii) building new and 
optimizing existing sewerage systems, and cleaning selected water streams; and (iii) improving 
the WSS sectorís legal, institutional, and regulatory framework in the State, and supporting the 
project beneficiaries (municipalities and WSS providers) in the design, operation, and 
maintenance of the programs and facilities. The project should directly benefit the population of 
S√£o Paulo, notably the poor, who suffer greatest from inadequateprovision of WSS, the critical 
watersheds, and the local environment. Project interventions will prioritize areas of extreme 
water scarcity as well as focus on serving the poor as defined by the S√£o Paulo Social 
Vulnerability Index (IPVS).The expected benefits of the project are the: (i) expansion in the 
access to WSS services by increasing water availability; (ii) reduction in the levels of water 
pollution; (iii) sustainable use of watersheds; (iv) reduction of long-run costs of WSS provision 
by increasing the efficiency of service providers; (v) improvement in the levels of human and 
environmental health in the state by reducing exposure to water borne and environmental related 
Page  2
diseases; and (vi) enhancement in the quality of life for the urban population affected by 
deteriorating environmental conditions and the deficient provision of WSS.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would encompass three components. The first two components would be focused on 
increasing the quantity of available water and improving the quality of water, respectively, and 
would be structured around functioning programs developed by SABESP, which make them 
ideal candidates to apply results-based financing approaches. The third component would be 
focused on the institutional and technical development of Sao Pauloís WSS sector.  
 
Component One: Increasing water availability. This component would finance activities aimed 
at increasing the quantity of available water in the targeted watersheds. Specific activities to be 
financed by this component include the reduction and control of water losses; the reduction of 
water consumption in buildings and public places; the implementation of reduced water 
consumption appliances in low-income housing; environmental education to spread knowledge 
on the control and rational use of water; and the reuse of treated wastewater.  
 
Component Two: Enhancing water quality. This component would finance activities aimed at 
improving the quality of water in the targeted watersheds. Specific activities to be financed by 
this component include the construction of new sewerage systems, notably where wastewater 
currently goes untreated and small-size treatment plants offer satisfactory solutions; the 
optimization of existing sewerage systems, notably by building new sewerage connections to 
existing networks; and the control and reduction of water pollution in selected water streams.  
 
Component Three: Developing institutional and technical capabilities. This component would 
finance activities aimed at increasing the efficiency of Sao PauloísWSS sector by enhancing and 
consolidating its institutional, legal and regulatory framework and the strengthening of its 
technical expertise. Specific activities to be financed by this component include establishing a 
complementary and more detailed WSS information system in the State to be used by ARSESP 
to develop additional/more precise performance indicators to better inform and monitor WSS 
providers, by the state government to better define policy and planning, and by the WSS 
providers to improve their service; technical assistance to the State Secretary for Water and 
Energy (SSE), ARSESP, local governments, and service providers to speed up their compliance 
with the new federal and state laws; and technical assistance, capacity building and training to 
service providers in the design, operation, and maintenance of programs and facilities associated 
with the implementation of components one and two, including institutional restructuring, 
corporate governance and project preparation.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Project interventions will be focused on the watersheds of Piracicaba/Capivari/Jundia√≠, Alto 
Tiet√™, Sapuca√≠ Mirim/Grande, Mogi Gua√ßu, and Sorocaba/M√©dio Tiet√™ ñ S√£o Pauloís 
five most critical watersheds based on a water demand/availabilityratio of higher than 80 percent.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Environmental management mechanisms will be developed during the project preparation phase 
to examine the projectís potential negative and positive impacts anddefine measures needed to 
Page  3
prevent, minimize, mitigate or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental 
performance. These mechanisms will be submitted for Bank review and approval prior to 
appraisal. Moreover, the general quality of the State of Sao Pauloís procedures for ensuring good 
environmental resultsand its extensive experience addressing environmental matters, are widely 
acknowledged, as is the appropriateness of the environmental legislation and institutional 
capacity in place. As required by the local law, the project activities will also be submitted for 
review and approval by the State environmental authorities. To ensure that the project complies 
with the Bankís environmental and safeguard policies a framework for social and environmental 
assessment will be developed by SSE defining a set of minimum standards that should be met by 
any investment activity to be financed by the project. SSE will put in place a screening process 
that will identify and exclude from project financing any subproject that involves involuntary 
resettlement or that could result in significant and permanent negative impacts on the 
environment. Besides subproject eligibility criteria, specific criteria will also be defined for 
assessing and approving selected activities. An assessment of institutional capacity for 
environmental management will be conducted as part of project preparation. Moreover, the 
activities financed by the project must comply with both federal and local legislation in Brazil 
and be compatible with social and environmental assessment in the country. In addition, this 
project is under consideration to become a pilot under OP 4.00 for the application of country 
systems in the context of OP 4.01, OP 4.04, and OP 4.11.

The team considers the project to be Environmental Category B based on the nature of the 
expected environmental impacts that would accompany the type of investments envisaged under 
the project, and environmental management mechanisms to be adopted by the State of Sao Paulo 
for project preparation.  
 
It is not envisioned that the project will entail any significant or irreversible negative 
impacts on the environment; on the contrary it is expected to have a positive environmental 
impact in the State by (i) preserving/increasing water quantity in critical watersheds; (ii) 
improving the quality of water; (iii) connecting people to existing and new sewerage collection 
and treatment systems; and (iv) increasing efficiency in the provision of water and sanitation 
services. Potential investments include a myriad of interventions such as installing/replacing 
water meters and pressure valves, updating commercial cadastres, finding/eliminating hidden 
water losses,  installing reduced water consumption appliances, increasing riparian vegetation, 
integrating urban water streams within the neighborhoods, developing and implementing 
appropriate environmental education programs, building new and optimizing existing small-size 
wastewater treatment plants, building new and expanding existing sewerage networks, and 
connecting new customers to new and existing sewerage networks. Furthermore, selected 
investments will only be executed in consolidated urban areas, some of which might include 
improvements to protect river banks located in urban areas (OP/BP 4.04). Furthermore, all 
project financed infrastructure facilities will be small
