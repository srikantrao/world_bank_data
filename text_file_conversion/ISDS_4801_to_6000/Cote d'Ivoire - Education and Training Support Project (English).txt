B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The  Development Objective (DO) of the restructured PASEF will be to assist the Ministry of 
National Education to resume the delivery of education services in primary, which implies (i) 
providing quality school inputs to guarantee teaching and learning in classrooms, and (ii) 
improving access to education and retention of school children in primary.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The restructured project includes the following four components:  
 
Component 1: Improving the quality of basic education. This component will involve: (i) 
developing, printing, an
d
distributing textbooks and teachers’ manuals to achieve a ratio of 3 
textbooks for students in grades 1 and 2 and 5 textbooks for students in grades 3 to 6, and 
improving the existing textbook rental scheme in primary; (ii) finalizing the primary education’s 
curriculum reform based onthe competency-based approach and providing related training to 
Page  2
teachers and other pedagogic supervisors in the school districts; (iii) strengthening the national 
student evaluation system, conducting student evaluations in one grade in primary and secondary 
education, and analyzing and distributing the results; (iv) rehabilitating and re-equipping teacher 
training centers (CAFOP ), providing teaching and learning materials to student-teachers and 
training teacher-trainers in the competency-based approach; and (v) supporting the National 
Literacy Support Fund (FNAA) to provide literacy training to 6,000 people (5,000 women) in the 
Zones CNO.  
 
Component 2: Supporting access to primary and lower secondary education. This component 
will: (i) finance the construction and equipping of 300 primary classrooms, and 8 lower 
secondary schools; and (ii) provide support to school management committees (COGES) so as to 
improve school conditions and efficiency. This support will involve, among others, training 
COGES members in budgeting, accounting, and infrastructure maintenance, providing small 
grants to schools in the poorest areas that have COGES, and conducting an impact evaluation 
regarding the effectiveness of those grants to support access and retention in primary schools.  
 
Component 3: Developing institutional capacity.  This component will include support and 
capacity building for each of the three Ministries of education, but with a larger focus both 
financially and technically on the MNE.  First, the project aims to reinforce the strategic and 
operational capacity of the MNE through: (i) the setting up and staffing of a 3-person strategic 
executive unit located in the Minister’s Cabinet; (ii) the development and installation of an 
educationand management information system (EMIS); (iii) the strengthening of human 
resources in charge of education statistics, human resource management, PER  and EPTS, school 
mapping, elaboration of an education CSR and support for the EFA-FTI endorsement process 
and (iv) the re-equipping of central and decentralized MNE structures (DREN and IEP ).  
Second, in both the METPF and MESRS, support will be provided for: (i) the development and 
installation of EMIS; (ii) human capacity development  - notably by means of technical 
assistance - in the areas of statistics, human resource management PER/EPTS; (iii) studies and 
consultations for the elaboration of national strategies in the technical and vocational training 
sector and higher education; and (iii) small provision of vehicles and equipments for planning 
divisions and a few decentralized structures in both education Ministries.  
 
Component 4: Project management. This component will finance the running costs of the 
project execution unit (BEP). The BEP is responsible for fiduciary management, civil works 
management, programming and monitoring of project activities, and production of execution and 
audit reports. Expenditures under this component will include: (i) the purchase of new 
equipment; (ii) certain expenses as described in the Credit Agreement; (iii) consultant services; 
(iv) studies; and (v) training.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The MEN with
 support from the Bureau d’ExÃ©cution des Projets (Project Implementation Unit 
responsible for fiduciary management of education projects executed by the Education 
Ministrires) will be responsible for overall oversight and reporting of the project compliance 
Page  3
with the arrangements detailed in the Environment and Safeguard Management Framework 
(ESMF).  The BEP is already in charged of several other large donor-financed education 
investment projects and comprised staff to carry out period technical audits. A unit within the 
MEN is also in charge to work with the education administration at central and local levels to 
ensure that the project activities comply with and enforce the World Bank safeguard policies.  
Training, workshop and materials will be distributed to local stakeholders, so that they can 
ensure that their rights are taken into account and the plan is fully enforced.

The land for school constructions will be given by communities and local authorities (in 
processes to be described in the forthcoming ESMF). The land will not be occupied by people 
for housing, or used for economic activities or as source of livelihood, and no one will have to be 
removed from the land, thus losing the assets or access to assets as a result of the donation.

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
A
draft of the ESMF is ready to be disclosed now; a more detailed version will be prepared 
and disclosed after reactivation. This ESMF will include and/or address: (i) legal and 
regulatory concerns in country's environmental management; (ii) an Environmental 
Management Plan with well structured institutional arrangements for addressing potential 
impacts, costs, frequence of monitoring, and capacity building; (iii) an environmental and 
social screening checklist that will be used to screen the different works; (iv) public 
consultation; and (v) monitoring and evaluation. In addition, it will describe in further detail 
processes related to land donation under the project, and will also provide for land 
acquisition screening and monitoring to ensure the land donation system works in practice.
