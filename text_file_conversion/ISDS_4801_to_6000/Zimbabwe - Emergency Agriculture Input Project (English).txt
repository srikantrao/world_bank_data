2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the project is to increase access to improved seed among 300,000 
smallholder farmers farming in targeted food-insecure communal lands of Zimbabwe.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed operation will finance the distribution of improved maize seed to 300,000 
households in 10 kg packs to strengthen their capacity to produce more grain necessary to 
meet family consumption requirements. This will reduce the country#s dependence on 
expensive grain imports and food aid. The project will have two components: (i) the 
provision of improved maize seed necessary to expand planted area and improve crop 
yields and (ii) project coordination, monitoring and evaluation.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
This project will be implemented nationally, in the Communal Lands of Zimbabwe.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The only safeguard issue is the maize seed to be distributed to farmers will be treated 
with a pesticide commonly used by seed companies with an active ingrediant that may be 
slightly hazardous. There are no large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project is not expected to have any indirect or long term impacts.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
No alternatives were considered because maize seed treatment is a long standing practice 
in Zimbabwe under local regulatory supervisoion.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The grantee will place a clause in all seed tenders indicating seed company facilities must 
be open to inspection to assure the safe application, use and storage of seed treatment 
pesticides.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include government regulatory officials, seed companies and farmers. 
Their views were considered in drafting the Emergency Project Paper.
