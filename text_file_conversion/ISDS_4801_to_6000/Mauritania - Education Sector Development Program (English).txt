B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
Overall the Catalytic Fund (CF) will support the Government of Mauritania in accelerating the 
implementation of its Education Sector Development Program (EDSP 2001-2015). Activities 
financed by the CF are within the plan of action of the ESDP for the period 2008-2010 of the 
entire EDSP.  
 
The CF would have the following specific objectives: (i) promote access to education, improve 
equity and retention in the sector; through the expansion of schools by building additional 
classrooms in the existing incomplete schools and the acquisition of equipment and furniture ; 
(ii) improve quality of the pedagogical content of the primary education and the efficiency of the 
education system; and  (iii) improve the quality of teaching and internal efficiency of education 
to improve monitoring and management of the education system.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
In order to achieve these objectives the CF will focus on the following components:  
 
Page  2
Component 1: Promote Access to Education, Improve Equity and Retention in the Sector 
through the expansion of existing schools by building, equipping and furnishing new classrooms 
(US$ 9.14 million). This component will help: (i) building 600 classrooms equipped with 20,100 
studentsí desks.  The additional classrooms will be built in the existing incomplete primary 
schools to increase the number of schools that will offer pedagogical continuity from grade one 
to grade six.  Consequently, the percentage of primary schools offering 6 grades will raise from 
43.3% to 78% in 2010 consequently drops out will decrease and retention will increase. As a 
result the proportion of students who complete primary education will increase; (ii) the 
decentralization process by training the parents association for their effective involvement in 
school management; and (iii) the expansion of the school feeding program to improve retention 
of students in areas where poor are concentrated.  
 
Component 2: Improve Quality of the Pedagogical Content of the Primary Education and the 
Efficiency of the Education System (US$ 2.83 million). This component will support the 
following activities: (i) implementation of the recently adopted textbook policy aiming at 
increasing the availability of textbooks and teachers' guides in schools through the acquisition 
and distribution of 3 million textbooks; and (ii) acquisition of 75,000 instructional materials to 
supply the small school library and reading corners.  
 
Component 3: Improve the Quality of Teaching and Internal Efficiency of Education. (US$ 
2.03 million). This component will contribute to the Governmentís strategy to: (i) support the 
incentives system to encourage teachers who are effectively teaching (prime de craie), who work 
in a difficult context (prime dí√©loignement); (ii) finance the development of teacher evaluation 
to monitor the most important aspects of classroom practices and teacher behavior (attendance, 
preparation of lesson plans, planning teaching for the school year, pupil evaluation) to promote 
the best teachers; and (iii) support the improvement of quality of student examination as well as 
the activities of the student learning monitoring unit (Cellule díevaluation des acquis des 
√©l√®ves).  
 
C. IMPLEMENTATION 
ARRANGEMENT 
 
 
1.
Overall Coordination.  
 
The CF will be implemented over a period of three years by the Ministry of National Education 
(MEN) through the Directorate of Education and Training Projects (DPEF), in close 
collaboration with the MEN procurement sub-committee as well as the national procurement 
committee. The DPEF is an existing structure and is experienced in the implementation of World 
Bank-financed projects as well as Catalytic Funds (having implemented the first Fast-Track 
grant).  
 
Planning will be conducted according to the guidelines outlined in the current Project 
Implementation Manual, which includes a disbursement schedule that will be used as the basis 
for preparing annual budgets. The project accounting system will be based on the Manual of 
Financial and Accounting Procedures in use by the DPEF.  
 
2.  Institutional arrangements are similar to those established for the implementation of the 
ESDP (Credit 3573-MAU), as well as two previous Grants: Education For All Catalytic (TF 
53481); and the Netherlands Education For All (TF 53485- BNPP).  These arrangements were 
validated by a capacity assessment undertaken in 2001, and updated in February 2004. During 
Page  3
the appraisal of the Catalytic Fund in November 2007, an institutional assessment was conducted 
and confirmed the viability of the arrangements. CF oversight will be assured by the Program 
Coordination Committee (PCC) of ESDP, which includes the MEN directors.  
 
The Financial Division is staffed with an experienced financial specialist and accountants who 
have already implemented several Bank-financed projects. It is headed by a senior officer 
supported by sufficient accountants and assistants regularly trained during the implementation of 
the education program. They are equipped in managing the financial tasks for this Fast Track 
Initiative. Nevertheless, an internal audit function was carried out in November 2007 to ensure 
strong supervision and quality assurance for various parts of the project.  
 
The DPEF is using well-established accounting software to manage its accounting functions. 
The project chart of accounts has been established. The accounting software would be properly 
configured to meet fast track objectives and requirements.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project is targeting incomplete schools in most of the region in rural areas. Mostly in the 
poorest region such as Assaba, Brakna, HEG, Gorgol,Guidimaka.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Currently classrooms construction is carried out under the responsibility of the communities, 
(parents associations, ìmaires des communes ruralesî) which are also responsible for the 
procurement of material, and contracting to an enterprise or specialized workers. The project has 
put in place 3 "mobile teams", each one comprising a civil engineer and an assistant recruited 
from the private sector on a competitive basis. The mobile teams have a long experience and are 
well trained in term of environnement and sanitation. Construction performance is monitored by 
one such team, under the supervision of an engineer. The latter will also provide communities 
with technical advice, follow-up on environment guide lines and help communities use sound 
procurement practices. He will certify the conformity of works with both environmental issues, 
architectural plans and technical specifications, which will constitute authorization of payment of 
the tranche of the subsidy. Communities, teachers and students training related to environment, 
sanitation and HIV/AIDS is provided by the directorate of Health, Sanitation and HIV/AIDS of 
the MEN, that is responsible for the implementation of the Educator sector policy in term of 
health, sanitation and HIV/AIDS. Similar arrangements will be used for the implementation of 
CF.

CF will finance the construction of additional classrooms in uncompleted schools. Mitigation 
measures will be implemented by communities and as part of their contract conditions as 
required. To address potential negative impacts consistent with the requirements of these 
safeguard policies, the project has prepared an ESMF. In addition to describin

environmental and social screening process, the ESMF makes recommendations regarding 
capacity building needs to ensure its effective implementation, and consultations with 
communities as part of the screening process that will take place at the time of construction.
