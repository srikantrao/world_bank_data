E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Both Borrowers and their PIU staff are experienced with World Bank projects, and have 
implemented the safeguards policies satisfactorily in the past.  
 
TSKB, a non-deposit taking private investment and development bank owned by local 
commercial banks and business groups, is the existing Borrower and Implementation Agency for 
EFIL III and will continue in those roles for Component I of EFIL IV. A Project Implementation 
Unit (PIU) team is already established under the supervision of one of TSKB's executive vice 
presidents and will oversee the implementation of EFIL IV. The PIU is staffed with experienced 
management and staff.  
 
Eximbank will be a new Borrower and Implementing Agency for Component II and 
Component III. Eximbank was the Borrower and Implementing Agency in the predecessor 
project, EFIL I, and implemented it in a satisfactory way. Eximbank has established a PIU team 
under the supervison of a Deputy General Manager, and most team members including the 
Deputy General Manager have experience from the implementation of EFIL I.
