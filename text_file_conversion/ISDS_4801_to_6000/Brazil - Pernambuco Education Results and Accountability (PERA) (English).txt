2. Project Objectives 
The development objectives are to: (a) improve the quality, efficiency and equity of 
public education in Pernambuco; and (b) introduce management reforms that will lead to 
greater efficiency in the use of the Government of State of Pern
ambuco’s (GOP) public 
resources in the Education sector.   
 
3. Project Description 
The PERA  is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), structured in large part as a SWAp that 
addresses activities in both the education sector and in public procurement and financial 
management that are needed to improve educational outcomes, and set the basis for 
future reforms in public sector management in other sectors of the GOP. The operation 
will address educational priorities by leveraging funds and mobilizing programs through 
disbursements linked to pre-identified Eligible Expenditure Programs (EEPs) in 
education and technical assistance.  It has been proposed that the Bank loan finances 
$154 million: $150 million in education sector investments under the SWAp portion and 
about $4.0 million (including the front-end-fee) for technical assistance needed in 
education and to define and design activities to guide procurement and financial 
Page  2
management reforms in Pernambuco’s public sector in general, and their immediate 
application to the education sector.  
 
Project Components  
 
Component I: Improvement of Basic Education  
 
The PERA reaffirms the state’s priority towards addressing educational issues first 
identified and included in EDUQ and further elaborated in the PERA proposal.  
 
Sub-Component 1: Basic Standards Program.  The State Secretariat of Education (SEE) 
has defined basic standards to be applied, over time, to all state schools in all levels of 
education.  These basic standards include: (i) rehabilitating and upgrading infrastructure, 
furniture and equipment; (ii) introducing computer labs and training of teachers in their 
use; (iii) developing and/or stocking school libraries; (iv) providing appropriate teaching 
materials; and (v) assuring the adequate number and types of teachers per classroom.  
The implementation of basic standards is supported by eight EEPs totaling $511.9 million 
equivalent.  
 
Sub-Component 2:  Literacy Program.  An important sectoral priority is to ensure the 
conditions for children to become literate in the early years of Fundamental Education 
(Low EF).  To achieve this, SEE has introduced a comprehensive teacher training 
program that supports the training of literacy tutors for subsequent replication to teachers 
in Low EF and the provision of educational materials.All Low EF teachers in the state 
school system are being trained, as well as teachers in the municipal school systems that 
join the program. Evaluation of the program is to be carried out by an external agency.  
The implementation of the Literacy Program is supported by one EEP (budget line) 
totaling $37.3 million equivalent.  
 
Sub-Component 3: Overage Correction Program.  There are three EEPs that address 
age-grade distortion, each of which targets overage students of a segment of basic 
education.  In the early years of EF, SEE provides both literacy (for overage students 
without the basic elements of literacy) and acceleration (for overage students already 
literate).  In the later years of EF, and in secondary education, SEE is proposing to use the 
methodology for acceleration provided by the Roberto Marinho Foundation.  The 
implementation of the overage correction program is supported by three EEPs totaling 
$25.9 million equivalent.  
 
Sub-Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation.  SEE recognizes both the importance of 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as well as the limitations of the ongoing activities in 
this area.  The PERA will finance the upgrading and operalization of the individual 
student monitoring system and the implementation of Pernambuco’sstudent assessment 
system (SAEPE).  The goal is to provide a greater focus on feedback to parents of 
individual students and better usage of assessment results in the development of 
classroom remedial measures. The implementation of the overage correction program is 
supported by two EEPs totaling $5.3 million equivalent.  
Page  3
Component II: Public Sector Management Interventions (PSM)  
 
The PERA would support GOP’s efforts to modernize its public sector through 
strengthening the performance of the state expenditure management systems (including 
public financing management, procurement and results-based budgeting) and supporting 
other targeted technical assistance activities.  The aim is to establish an initial governance 
platform, which will support the state to deepen and broaden institutional interventions 
and improve expenditure quality.  One PSM sub-component will put in place critical 
cross-cutting instruments that will benefit public sector management, in general. A 
second PSM sub-component will further strengthen education management through 
sector-specific technical assistance.  
 
Sub-Component 1: Procurement and Financial Management Interventions.  The GOP 
will carry out studies and initiatives aimed at better understanding and reforming some of 
the state’s most critical managerial challenges.  Bank financing will be channeled to 
procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation-related activities. 
Cost of TA estimated at $3 million equivalent.   
 
Sub-Component 2: Education Sector Management Interventions.  The SEE will prepare 
a
prototype education sector strategic plan with priority activities and suggested 
monitoring indicators to guide future programs and budgets as disbursement conditions. 
Subsequently, SEE results-based management (RBM) will be mainstreamed through the 
budget cycle (strategy, budget formulation, budget execution, M&E, feedback loop, 
budget for following year), making use of performance indicators and addressing 
necessary systems and organization reforms to support this effort.  The development and 
implementation of the strategic plan will be captured as a project disbursement-linked 
indicator.  Formulation of the first strategy (and recommendations for mainstreaming 
RBM workshops and training) will be supported by technical assistance.  Cost of TA 
estimated at $0.6 equivalent.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project-supported activities will be implemented mostly by the SEE, and will affect 
schools located throughout the State of Pernambuco.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Project’s Component I is organized in four sub-components, none of them financing 
construction of new schools.  The first sub-component will provide financing for existing 
schools through the rehabilitation of facilities (particularly furniture and equipment), 
computers and teachers training. The second sub-component is essentially an early 
literacy program. The third sub-component is designed as a correction program for 
overage distortions. Finally, the fourth sub-component will create conditions for 
monitoring and evaluating student performance.  Component II refers to Public Sector 
Management Interventions only.  Therefore, the Project will not trigger OP/BP 4.01 
(Environmental Assessment); it will not affect Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) or Forests 
(OP/BP 4.36) or produce any impacts on Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.12).  
 
Given the type of interventions contemplated, the Project has received an Environmental 
Category C. Not only the potential for negative impacts resulting from the Project is nil 
but several positive impacts will be derived from the Project-financed activities, such as 
ensuring that schools have access to safe water, latrines and clean kitchens – whose lack 
is an important impediment to schools fulfilling their expected educational role. A 
checklist of environmental protection procedures for the small works that might be 
involved in rehabilitation activities was developed for the previous EDUQ Project and for 
FUNDESCOLA II.  In addition to a check list developed by the Bank to accompany 
small rehabilitation works in the Project, they will support all activities regarding the 
implementation of the Project.  
 
As schools targeted by the Project should have at least 400 students, at its outset, the 
Project does not trigger OP/BP 4.10. Nevertheless, since during the ProjectÂ´s 
implementation a few Indigenous schools may reach this number, provisions were 
developed based on Bank guidelines and are part of Annex 10.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No impacts anticipated.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The analysis of social issues and the cultural diversity of stakeholders recommend the 
design of a set of comprehensive activities to address the following issues deemed 
indispensable:  
 
a. 
As almost the totality of schools have Bolsa FamÃ­lia, implement its educational 
conditionality and take serious measures to avoid dropout from 4th to 5th grade and from 
fundamental to middle cycle.  
 
b. 
Transform Indigenous and Quilombos schools from barely functioning assistance 
instruments into real educational institutions.  
 
c. 
Improve infrastructure in schools, including the provision of water, electricity, 
ventilation, bathrooms, and kitchens.  
 
In the Quilombos, conduct an assessment of school conditions, including whether they 
are located at a reasonable distance from households, planning the establishment and 
construction of new schools whenever necessary; and reforming the existing schools that 
do not meet the minimum standards.  
 
In addition, ensure that all environmental guidelines developed by the Bank and the 
Government are in place whenever small works are implemented.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The GOP has agreed to establish a consultative group to continuously review and provide 
input on SEE’s investment program, including the EEPs under this Project.
