B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed operation aims at (Project Development Objective) reducing land degradation, 
increasing and sustaining agriculture productivity, and (Global Environmental Objective) 
protecting and restoring ecosystem functions and services in priority agro-ecological zones by 
scaling-up sustainable land management.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed operation would contribute to this objective by (1) strengthening some key 
elements of the enabling environment for SLM scale-up at national and local level (e.g. 
strengthening cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms and institutional capacity for SLM; and 
strengthening the capacity of main agricultural research institutions to generate and disseminate 
SLM applied research and knowledge); and (2) supporting the adoption of SLM technologies 
and practices in selected priority areas (i.e. the Groundnut Basin) (e.g. by strengthening the 
capacity of producer organizations to adopt SLM measures; setting-up financial/incentive 
mechanisms to facilitate the adoption of SLM; and supporting agricultural service providers in 
Page  2
delivering SLM opportunities and providing adequate technical backstopping). Considering that 
the yet uncertain effects of climate change may undermine the gains made from SLM 
investments, special attention will be given to adequately take into consideration risks associated 
to climate change and to design adaptation measures.  
 
The proposed operation - one of the operations under the GEF-Strategic Investment Program to 
scale-up SLM in Sub-Saharan Africa (SIP) - would be implemented with the financial support of 
GEF (US$ 4.8 million, grant). The operation will be blended with the IDA/IFAD Agricultural 
Services and Producer Organizations Project 2 (PSAOP2). The alternative would have been to 
develop a stand-alone operation. However, considering that PSAOP2 represents a well 
established instrument for engaging the Government on broader policy issues and institutional 
reforms, it is believed that the GEF supplemental would have more leverage in influencing the 
policy dialogue and mainstreaming SLM into the agricultural sector if blended to the PSAOP2.  
 
As blended with the PSAOP2, the activities proposed in this operation are organized along the 
four components of PSAOP2. Each component would integrate/complement the respective 
PSAOP2 component.  
 
a. 
Support to the Agricultural Research System (indicative budget: US$ 0.5 million): in 
PSAOP2, this component seeks to increase the capacity of the National Agricultural Research 
System (NARS). GEF supplemental would be used to strengthen the capacity of the main 
agricultural research institutions (e.g. ISRA, ITA) to specifically generate and disseminate SLM 
applied research and knowledge (e.g. develop specific SLM indicators and baseline studies; 
support SLM-targeted research; develop mechanisms for collection and dissemination of SLM 
knowledge, etc.).  As it is the case for PSAOP, research activities would be financed under the 
competitive mechanism of FNRAA.  
 
b. 
Strengthening Agricultural Advisory Services (US$ 0.7 m): in PSAOP2, this component 
is aimed at supporting the extension of the agricultural advisory system and the consolidation of 
a
pluralistic network of service providers. GEF supplemental would complement these 
interventions by strengthening the capacity of the agricultural extension system to specifically 
deliver SLM packages and provide adequate technical backstopping on SLM to farmers.  
 
c. 
Support to Producer Organizations (US$ 2.6 m): in PSAOP2, this component is aimed at 
strengthening the capacity of producer organizations (POs) to access technical and economical 
services, and participate in policy formulation. GEF supplemental would provide additional 
resources to (i) strengthen the capacity of POs to identify, adopt and maintain SLM technologies 
and practices; (ii) establish financial/incentive mechanisms to facilitate the adoption of SLM 
(e.g. SLM matching grants or credit facilities, local investment funds, insurance systems, etc.); 
and (iii) empower PO leaders to integrate SLM in land-use planning and policy formulation. The 
seed producing areas of the groundnut basin, characterized by stronger degradation, are deemed 
particularly relevant to implement SLM measures. Where quality production is practiced, 
integrated good agricultural practices that include SLM practices could be certified. This could 
be incorporated as a quality parameter in the labeling of products derived from sustainable 
agriculture.

d. 
Support to Sectoral Coordination (US$ 0.6 m): in PSAOP2, this component is aimed at 
strengthening the capacity of sectoral ministries (e.g. Agriculture and Livestock) on policy 
formulation, planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation. GEF supplemental would be 
used to strengthen the enabling conditions to allow the Government to move towards a more 
cross-sectoral and programmatic approach to SLM, and particularly (i) to establish/strengthen 
cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms and coalitions for SLM (including the design of a 
national framework for SLM investments); and (ii) to strengthen institutional capacity for SLM 
(e.g. policy formulation/coordination, integrated land use planning/management, M&E, etc.) at 
various levels.  
 
The operation will adopt the same institutional arrangements as PSAOP2.  Specifically, project 
activities will be under the overall supervision of PSAOP2 Coordination Unit (UCTF), which 
will have oversight on technical and fiduciary aspects.  As a general rule, implementation of 
components will be entrusted to the agencies implementing PSAOP2 components. However, the 
National Soil Science Institute (Institut National de PÃ©dologie, INP) will play a key role in 
coordinating the activities aiming at strengthening cross-sectoral coordination mechanisms and 
building a national coalition for SLM.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will be implemented in the seed producing areas in the Groundnut Basin (which 
administratively entirely covers the regions of Kaolack, Fatick, Diourbel, and a large part of the 
region of Thies and as well as the southern part of the region of Louga and the western part of 
the region of Tambacounda).

rrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Having already prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for PSAOP2 in 2005 (updated in 2008), the Government 
has already acquired experience and capacity to apply safeguard policies.  
 
The ESMF is currently used to screen sub-projects against possible environmental impacts.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
This policy will be triggered due to the implementation of sub-projects for agricultural 
productive investments. The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF)of the 
parent project (PSAOP2) allows for the identification, assessment and mitigation of potential 
negative environmental and social impacts related to these activities.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 X  
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
X
This policy is triggered because of the possibility of increased use of pesticides. PSAOP2 
already has a Pest Management Plan (PMP)in place. The ESMF of the PSAOP2 includes 
Page  4
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
information on the status of pest management/integrated pest management in the project area and 
specific recommendation on the use of pesticides,if and when used.   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
This policy will be triggered due to the potential need for land acquisition for sub-projects.  
The PSAOP already has a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) outlining the principles and 
procedures to be followed in the event that any of the proposed project activities involve land 
acquisition.   
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) 
 X  
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP
 
7.50) 
 X  
Even though the parent project triggered OP 7.50 as a precaution, this additional financing 
will not involve any water-related investment.   
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60)

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  N/A 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  09/15/2008 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) were updated in May 2008 to reflect screening requirements for SLM sub-
projects. This additional financing will not have any activities with impacts not foreseen in 
the parent ESMF/RPF. The ESMF outlines (i) an environmental and social screening process 
for pilot sub-projects supported by the two implementing agencies ANCAR (Agence 
Nationale de Conseil Agricole et Rural) and ASPRODEB (Association Senegalaise de 
Promotion du Developpement a la Base); (ii) environmental assessment criteria for ANCAR 
and ASPRODEB sub-projects; (iii) a separate screening form for research sub-projects, 
including environmental evaluation criteria; and (iv) a summary of environmental impacts to 
be taken into account in research sub-projects. The updated ESMF and RPF can thus be 
applied to future SLM sub-projects. The ESMF and RPF reflecting the adjustments for SLM 
sub-projects will be disclosed in Senegal and at the Bank's Infoshop prior to appraisal.

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
