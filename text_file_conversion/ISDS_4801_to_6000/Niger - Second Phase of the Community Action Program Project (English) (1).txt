B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of CAP II is to contribute to effective implementation of the 
decentralization law, and improve access to socio-economic services in targeted communes and 
communities.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
As a key element of the Governmentís Rural Development Strategy, the PAC-2 (i) will scale up 
local communities and communesí development, (ii) improve the decentralization framework, 
(iii) improve access to socio-economic services and ensure capacity building for sustainable 
management of natural resources. To do so, the project will build on the following three 
components:  
 
Page  2
Component A. Strengthening Decentralization at the National Level and Capacity Building for 
Local Governments and Communities  
 
Sub-component A-1. Capacity building for the communes and the communities: This sub-
component aims at empowering the newly created communes to ensure that they are fully 
equipped to carry out the responsibilities conferred upon them by the decentralization law 
including the conception and implementation of their own development agenda. Therefore, it 
will support capacity building for both communes and local communities, and strengthen civil 
society organizations in participatory local development management. Specifically, the sub-
component will finance inter alia, (i) a communication strategy to help beneficiaries understand 
project objectives and intervention mechanisms and share good practices, (ii) capacity needs 
assessment at the commune and communities levels, and elaboration of a capacity assessment 
plan for local development management including on decentralization., financial resource 
management,  participatory diagnostic and planning, micro project design and execution; (iii) 
training activities as identified in the capacity assessment plan, and (iv) study tours, etc.  
 
Sub-component A-2: Support for Decentralization and Local Development Framework at the 
national level: This sub-component aims at creating an enabling environment for the 
decentralization and for local development management. The sub-component will support 
capacity-building for central and decentralized government entities to carry out additional 
activities that are required to improve the decentralization and local development frameworks. It 
will support the following activities: (i) Undertaking key studies to improve the existing 
regulatory framework and assisting the Government of Niger in drafting operational tools and 
guidelines needed to support the implementation of the decentralization law, including a ìcode 
des collectivit√©s localesî, (ii) setting up mechanisms for the effective transfer of resources to 
the communes including the mobilization of their own resources; and (iii) study tours and 
training of staff at the national level; and (iv) supporting the elaboration of the SLM country 
Strategic Investment Framework and its implementation at all levels.  
 
Sub component A-3. Capacity building and Technical Assistance for BioCF initiative and 
sustainable natural resource management: The project will: (i) support training activities and 
technical assistance to consolidate the carbon fund (BioCF) program achievements, (ii) promote 
sustainable land management practices and train the communities on sustainable management of 
natural resources, (iii) support studies to improve land tenure policy and dissemination of 
sustainable land management practices, (iv) adaptation and dissemination of innovative 
technologies (biodiversity garden, sahelian ecofarm, demi-lunes, etc), and (v) support studies to 
analyze distribution mechanisms of revenues from carbon and Arabic gum markets within 
communities.  
 
Component B. Decentralized Financing (Local Investment Fund): The component will finance 
the national Local Development Fund which was established during the first phase of the CAP, 
and channel funds to communes and local communities for financing socio-economic 
infrastructure micro-projects identified through participatory processes and included in the 
integrated local development plans. The micro-projects to be financed through the LIF would 
promote access by the populations to basic socio-economic services, and sustainable natural 
resources management (including acacia plantations for the BioCF initiative).  
Page  3
Component C. Project Coordination, Management, Monitoring and Evaluation: This component 
will support: (i) the administrative and financial management, (ii) result based monitoring-
evaluation system of the performance and impact of the project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Project implementation will be countrywide and will involve local communities.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower knows very well and has already experienced bank safeguard policies during the 
first phase of the project and through other Bank-financed project in the country. Institutional 
capacities for Safeguard Policies implementation and supervision remain good. Specific capacity 
building activities will be carried out during implementation.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
Because there are no significant changes in project description and investment types from the 
previous phase, the project will update the existing environmental instrument, in this case, the 
ESMF, based on lessons learned from its implementation during Phase I of project. As in the 
existing instrument, the updated ESMF will formulate standard methods and procedures along 
with institutional arrangements for screening, review, approval and implementation and 
monitoring of subprojectsí specific EMPs, including the preparation of environmental clauses to 
beinserted in contractorsí bidding documents.  Any changes that occurred overtimein 
institutional set-up for screening, review, approval, implementation and monitoring of sub-
projects will be reflected in the ESMF.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 
X
As the project might intervene in new sites different from the existing ones, the ESMF will 
determine whether or not this policy is triggered.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 
X
As the project might intervene in new sites different from the existing ones, the ESMF will 
determine whether or not OP 4.36 is triggered.   
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
Similarly, the existing RPF will be updated, based on lessons learned from its 
implementation during the previous phase, as well to reflect, if any, changes that took place 
overtime in the institutional arrangements for implementing and monitoring the instrument. 
Consistent with the requirements for OP 4.12, the updated RPF and eventually a Process 
framework will be used as a guide to conduct specific Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) as 
needed, as they relate to land acquisition and loss of economic activities issues, as well as
