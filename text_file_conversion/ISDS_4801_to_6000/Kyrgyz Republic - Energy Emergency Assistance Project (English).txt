The project encompasses routing technical works as well as the supply of fuel oil. For the 
latter handling and storage might be of concern. One of the two project sites, the Bishkek TPP 
was visited and inspected by the team and found in satisfactory condition. Also an EMP was 
prepared to ensure due diligence in fuel handling and storage on the site as well as 
implementation of basic environmental principles during all construction works.
