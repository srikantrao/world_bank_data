B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The primary development objective of this project is to help small and medium enterprises in 
Argentina with inadequate access to credit to improve their compliance with environmental 
regula
tions, while simultaneously boosting their industrial competitiveness. Using a “carrot and 
stick” approach, the proposed project aims to support SMEs with a matching grants program for 
investments in environmentally sound production processes, provided they agree to comply 
(through signed PRIs) with environmental regulations under specified deadlines. As a secondary 
development objective, the project also seeks to support on commercial credit terms, broader 
competitiveness activities that are complementary to improvements in environmental 
management. This hierarchy of objectives will also feed into the eligibility criteria for choosing 
SMEs, as well as determine the sequencing of financing extended to these SMEs. The project 
also seeks to enhance technical capacity and support institutional-strengthening measures to 
bring longer term sustainability beyond the life of the project.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Through the proposed project, the Bank will be supporting the efforts of the government to 
design and implement a broad-based, multi-year program aimed at removing structural barriers 
Page  2
and providing effective drivers to control, manage, and prevent industrial pollution of river 
basins and other sensitive ecosystems by means of efficiency improvements. The program will 
be targeting SMEs with inadequate access to credit and focused on highly polluting sectors. The 
proposed project has developed both sector-based as well as area-based components. The sector-
based component will be initially targeting a few key SME sectors; while the spatial area-based 
component will focus on targeted industrial estates in Argentina.  
 
Component 1: Improving Compliance with Environmental Regulations ($77 million)  
 
The main objective of this component is to assist small and medium enterprises in key sectors 
in Argentina through matching grants in order to comply with environmental regulations through 
the adoption of cleaner production technologies to augment the efficiency of the plants and 
processes; minimize the use of resources; eliminate toxic inputs; and reduce the quantity and 
toxicity of emissions. In addition, this component will provide financing broader competitiveness 
activities.  
 
Sub-component 1.1: Financing Sustainable Production and Competitiveness in Key SME 
Sectors  
 
Sub-projects financed in four key pre-identified sectors, viz. tanneries, electroplating, meat-
processing and dairy 
–chosen on basis of their pollution intensity, competitiveness potential and 
expressed interest. Eligible subprojects expanded to three additional sectors – food processing, 
chemicals, and pulp and paper- during the second year of implementation. Financing for broader 
competitiveness investments will be conditional to receiving financing for investments to 
improve environmental management (and thus signature of a PRI).  
 
Sub-component 1.2: Achieving Environmental Sustainability in Industrial Estates  
 
Financing provided to improve environmental practices in industries that are located in 
industrial estates (IEs) and promote the development of environmentally efficient industrial 
estates in lesser developed areas to boost local economic development.  
 
Component 2: Supporting Technical Capacity and Institutional Strengthening ($3 million)  
 
Subcomponent 2.1: Technical Assistance for sub-project implementation  
 
Financing technical assistance relating to (i) cleaner production measures; (ii) broader 
competitiveness activities and (iii) environmental and planning guidelines for the management of 
existing industrial estates, to support the SME activities in Component 1.  
 
Sub-component 2.2: Institutional Strengthening  
 
A
“Sustainable Production/ Cleaner Production” unit will be set up within the Secretariat of 
Industry, Commerce and SMEs to mainstream the sustainable industrial production agenda 
within the institutional structure of the SICyP and to ensure program sustainability. In practical 
terms the unit will coordinate the search for potential sub-projects and provide technical advice 
on identifying industrial competitiveness measures. Additionally, this unit will oversee the 
management of the selected financial mechanism(s).  
 
Total project cost: The Project’s total estimated cost is US$ 96 million. Of this amount, the 
Bank would finance US$ 80 million, and the Government/ private sector would provide 
Page  3
counterpart financing of US$ 16 million. The potential for carbon finance revenues will be 
determined during appraisal.  
 
Selection of Participating Sectors and Enterprises: During the preparation phase, the meat-
processing, tanneries, electroplating, and dairy sectors were pre-identified essentially on basis of 
their pollution-intensity and competitiveness potential. Specific companies were selected based 
on expressed interest. Selection criteria were applied to a representative sample of industries 
(including SMEs) in Argentina’s biggest industrial hotspot: the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin.  The 
analysis reveals high contaminant loads attributed to the selected e sectors. For example, 
tanneries contribute about 26 million kg of BOD per year or 61% of the total discharge to the 
basin, while meat-processing and dairy industries together contribute about 10.3 million kg of 
BOD annually, or 17% of the total. Toxic effluents are also high, particularly for tanneries with 
discharges to the basin of 34 tons/year of chromium VI (100% of total discharge to the basin) as 
well as 20,000 tons/year of sulfates (100% of the total discharge to the basin). Toxic discharges 
from the metallurgy industry are also significant and include chromium, zinc and cyanide.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Nation-wide, as potential sub-projects are expected from small and medium enterprises from all 
parts of the country, including industrial hotspots such as the Matanza-Riachuelo Basin.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Secretariat of Industry is already engaged in a program to promote cleaner production 
practices, in close coordination with the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable 
Development (SecretarÃ­a de Ambiente y Desarrollo Sustentable, orSAyDS). Environmental 
authorities possess adequate capacity to monitor overall compliance with the environmental 
requirements resulting from the sub-project screening process. Screening will take place at the 
Secretariat of Industry’s proposed unit on Sustainable Production/ Cleaner Production.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
The activities to be funded by the project are not expected to have significant, irreversible or 
have unprecedented environmental impacts. In fact, the project will have a positive 
environmental effect by helping reverse or mitigate the contamination in some industrial areas in 
Argentina, through the adoption of cleaner production practices. The potential environmental 
impacts from this project will be addressed through measures to prevent, contain, and treat 
effluents and solid waste resulting from industrial processes. These impacts are expected be area 
site-specific; and mitigation measures can be designed.

Yes No TBD 
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 X  
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)

Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
Involuntary resettlement is triggered as a precautionary measure. During project preparation, 
no resettlement associated with the activities to be funded is foreseen. However, policy OP4.12 
may be triggered if a new industrial park; or the consolidation of industrial areas is financed 
under the project. In the event that a project activity involves involuntary resettlements, the 
project will follow a resettlement framework that will be developed before project appraisal.   
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) 
 X  
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP
 
7.50) 
X
Projects on International waterways: No potential sub-projects affecting international 
waterways have been identified during project preparation. However, there may be potential 
impact to international waterways as wastewater from industrial enclaves may stream down to 
riparian areas. Therefore Environmental Safeguard PolicyOP.7.50 is triggered as a precautionary 
measure.
