B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project development objective is to increase rural competitiveness in Paranaís Regiao 
Central.  
 
The project would contribute to the Governmentís overall strategy for helping this region to 
catch up socio-economically with other parts of the State. It would do so: by helping small 
producers associations to access new business opportunities and increase their income; and by 
helping the Region as a whole to consolidate its social capital, build on its comparative 
advantages, and develop economic ties with other regions. More specifically, the project would:  
 
-
help small producer associations of the Central Region to increase their productivity, 
quality and access to markets;  
Page  2
-
promote new business initiatives in areas other than agriculture that have the potential to 
generate off-farm employment and diversify the local economy;  
 
-
strengthen business ties with partners and markets outside the Region and help integrate 
the Regionís products (agricultural and others) into broader value chains;  
 
-
strengthen the organizational and managerial capacity of local producers associations 
(agricultural and others), and promote new products and businesses arrangements;  
 
-
improve local capacity for inter-municipal coordination and sharing of experiences, and 
help deliver public services that support the competitiveness agenda; and  
 
-
help overcome legal and physical barriers to rural competitiveness in the area of land 
regularization and transport.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed lending instrument is a Specific Investment Loan of US$50.4 million over a four-
year period. The total project cost is estimated US$83.4 million, including US$33.0 million of 
counterpart funding from the State of Paran√°.  
 
The project is comprised of three components. Components 1 and 2 seek to improve the 
institutional framework, build local capacity, and overcome some physical and legal barriers that 
impede the competitiveness of rural businesses. Component 3 would finance small rural business 
initiatives (agricultural and non-agricultural) proposed by local producersí associations, with 
demonstrated economic viability and potential for replication.  
 
Component 1:  Building Capacity (estimated total US$ 21 million)  
 
This component would aim to strengthen the capacities of direct beneficiariesññmainly small 
producersí associationsññand the capacities of public institutions involved in promoting rural 
competitiveness. It would include three sets of activities as follows:  
 
Subcomponent 1.1 (Institutional Strengthening) would train and improve the capacity of an 
estimated 1,000 technical staff, managers and members of territorial, municipal and micro-
catchment councils involved in the project, including EMATER,  to enable them to better advise 
small producers on all aspects relevant to rural competitiveness. It would also support a series of 
studies on rural competitiveness and economic diversification in the Central Region, to help all 
parties involved in the project better identify the regionís comparative advantages, draw the 
lessons from more successful parts of the State, and develop new businesses and/or trade 
partnerships. Finally, it would also support the Stateís rural school programs benefiting about 
1,500 young rural people.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2 (Assistance to beneficiaries) would first support general training and 
awareness-raising programs aimed at an estimated 30,000 rural families, small entrepreneurs and 
their associations, as well as indigenous groups, women associations across the Region. This 
effort would aim to help potential beneficiaries identify ways of increasing their competitiveness 
and opportunities for creating new farm or off-farm employment; hence stimulating the 
emergence of business initiatives for possible funding under Component 3. Second, this 
subcomponent would assist interested producersí associations in the preparation of business 
proposals. Among others, it would help carry out feasibility assessments and financial and 
Page  3
technical analysis, and it would assist in identifying business partners and negotiating business 
arrangements. Third, for business initiatives effectively being financed under Component 3, this 
subcomponent would provide continued technical assistance to and monitoring of selected 
beneficiaries throughout the implementation phase in areas such as financial management, 
associative governance, technical and marketing issues, and social and environmental 
monitoring. This subcomponent would involve a series of collaboration with specialized service 
providers, with municipal councils, and academics.  
 
Subcomponent 1.3 (Project Management) would support organizational, administrative and 
consultative functions related to the project including: financial management and procurement; 
implementation of the environmental and social frameworks; monitoring and evaluation; 
stakeholder participation in the project; and communication.  
 
Component 2:  Structural Actions (estimated total US$ 27 million)  
 
This subcomponent would support key public functions aimed at improving the incentive 
framework in favor of rural competitiveness, including the removal of legal and physical 
barriers. It would include three sets of activities as follows:  
 
Subcomponent 2.1 (Pilot Initiatives) would help pilot innovative business ideas that may not 
emerge from purely demand-driven proposals, and may be scaled-up if proven successful. It 
would seek to foster the emergence of new rural products
ññagricultural and non-agricultural, 
new technologies, new farm and off-farm employment, and new partnerships with private 
operators within the region and in other parts of the State. It would be implemented in 
partnership with trade associations, universities, and the State Service of Support to Small 
Enterprises.  
 
Subcomponent 2.2 (Municipal Investments) would support selected public 
investments/programs identified at municipal and territorial level and pertaining to legitimate 
public functions in support of the competitiveness agenda. These may include for example: the 
improvement or maintenance of basic infrastructure such as roads and access to energy and 
water; the promotion of regional labeling for specific products; the leasing of equipment and 
facilities to facilitate the emergence of new businesses and new associations; awareness raising 
and training programs. The design, selection and monitoring of proposals would follow an open 
process involving municipal and territorial councils, and representatives of project beneficiaries, 
private operators, civil society, and relevant State Secretaries. As far as rural roads are 
concerned, the project would involve a partnership with the Highway Department of the State 
Secretariat of Transport.  
 
Subcomponent 2.3 (Land Regularization) would provide technical, legal and financial 
assistance to small farmers in the Central Region to help them complete the formal titling 
process. It would deal with small properties whose occupation is consolidated and undisputed (as 
evidenced by peaceful appropriation and provisional title), and where the main barrier to formal 
titling is the lack of financial resources.  
 
Component 3:  Support to Rural Business Initiatives (estimated total US$33 million)  
Page  4
This component would finance selected business initiatives (farm-based or not) submitted by 
small producers, aimed at increasing their competitiveness and showing demonstrated market 
viability. Beneficiaries would include a variety of small producers associations based on 
geography or products (cooperatives, micro-catchment committees, other forms of associations).  
 
Criteria of eligibility would be used to signal the focus on competitiveness, economic 
diversification and social inclusion. Proposals would have to demonstrate market viability. 
Preference would be given to initiatives with potential for replication. Other criteria would 
include consistency with territorial and municipal development strategies; adequate financial 
management capacity; and the use of sound environmental practices techniques.  The selection 
would be done through a transparent and technical process involving relevant Secretaries, 
beneficiaries, practitioners, academics, and municipal and territorial councils.  
 
Examples of business proposals that would receive support include: increasing local processing 
and value-added (of agricultural and non-agricultural products); linking small producers to larger 
industries and value chains; accessing new market niches using regional branding and quality 
labels; and supporting any business innovation (farm-based or not) that show market viability 
and potential for replication. Activities likely to emerge in proposals include: rural tourism; small 
manufacturing; contract farming and services linked to larger agribusiness in other regions; and 
local processing and packaging of milk, meat, and fruits combined with regional labeling.  
 
This component would also include a window dedicated to supporting business initiatives 
developed by women and youth enterprises, indigenous communities, and other vulnerable 
groups. It would also help improve living conditions (housing, sanitation) of extremely poor 
rural families as a starting point for them to gradually engage in profitable businesses. This 
subcomponent would involve a partnership 
with the Housing Company of Paran√° being 
supported by the State and FederalGovernments.  
 
This component would disburse through a regular project-based disbursement system following 
Bank procedures. In total the project would be able support approximately 300 rural 
competitiveness initiatives.  
 
Through sub-component 1.1, the project would assist potential beneficiaries to develop their 
business initiatives. It would continue to provide beneficiaries with technical assistance on 
organizational, financial, or technical issues during the implementation phase, and it would 
monitor progress and performance. It is envisaged that participating associations would enter at 
different levels of managerial capacity, with some receiving project support to achieve minimum 
levels of take-off, while others will already have the capacity and experience to engage in more 
complex business undertakings.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The target area would be the Regiao Central which includes the Stateís eight poorest territories 
encompassing 127 municipalities with about 40% of their population living in poverty. The 
project would also promote links with other regions of the State.  
 
Page  5
The target population would consists of an estimated 30,000 poor rural families, living in the 
Central Region and including vulnerable groups such as women, youth and indigenous people, 
which the project would reach through their own producersí associations. The project would also 
benefit public institutions (extension service, municipal councils) to the extent that is needed to 
support the overall objective of rural competitiveness.  
 
Environmental Issues:  Paran√° is the second largest of the southern Brazilian states. It has a 
humid, subtropical climate, and soils are generally fertile, although prone to erosion. Expansion 
of the agricultural frontier for over the past decades has reduced the native vegetation.  Poor 
management of fragile soils has led to their degradation and threatens farm productivity, 
especially in the rugged Central Region where steep slopes have been continuously cultivated. 
Bank-supported projects (Land Management Project, 1989-1997, Rural Poverty Alleviation and 
Natural Resources Management Project, 1998-2006; GEF grant for biodiversity 2003-2008) 
helped introduce environmentally sound agricultural practices and promote environmental 
awareness. Nevertheless, the natural resource-base, especially in the targeted Central Region, 
remains fragile with the need for continued mainstreaming of sound land and water management 
practices into agricultural systems and for protection of remnant natural vegetation. The State is 
preparing an Environmental Assessment as the basis for preparation of an Environmental 
Management Framework (EMF).  
 
Social Issues:  The client will carry out one comprehensive Social Assessments combining: (a) 
an assessment of indigenous peoples ñ one of the projectís targeted beneficiary populations - 
specifically addressing their needs and opportunities, and the consultation process.  An 
Indigenous Peoples Participation Framework (IPPF) will be prepared and will be published 
separately in conformity with OP 4.10; and (b) an assessment of the socio-economic 
characteristics and dynamics of the non-indigenous target population. Here, special attention is 
being given to social differentiation and social risks, as well as their implications for project 
design, and also to stakeholder concerns and input for the project. Assessment (b)will also focus 
specifically on issues pertinent to project targeting, such as ethnic minorities (i.e., quilombola 
communities) and other social groups (i.e., women and youth). Socio-economic diagnoses have 
already been conducted in priority territories and further studies/consultations are planned at the 
municipal and micro-catchment levels.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrowerís institutional capacity for Safeguard policies is relatively goodat the state level 
but tends to be uneven at decentralized levels. The State Secretariat of Agriculture and Supply 
(SEAB) would manage the project at the central level. Implementation responsibilities would lie 
with a Project Management Unit (PMU) within SEAB, and the State Secretariat of Planning 
would facilitate inter-institutional coordination and integration. These institutions have 
substantial experience working with Safeguard policies from their implementation of the 
previous Bank-supported projects. The proposed project plans to utilize the expertise and 
experience of the Environmental Institute of Paran√° through a partnership arrangement with the 
PMU, and will include training/measures to ensure that Safeguards performance is upgraded and 
standardized at the municipal level.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
Based on the assessment of potential impacts, a Category B designation is proposed for the 
project. Despite the positive or neutral impacts foreseen, some small-scale investments could 
potentially have adverse environmental impacts. Types of small-scale investments might include: 
(i) rehabilitation or maintenance of municipal feeder roads; (ii) improvements to small 
producersí farm and off-farm infrastructure; (iii) improvement of production technologies 
(agricultural and others) (e.g., product diversification, value-added products). Any environmental 
impacts are expected to be localized and preventable through responsive mitigation measures. 
Environmental screening, evaluation and mitigation procedures would be built into the 
investment subproject analytical process, and be brought to bear on all project activities where 
relevant.  
 
Given that the exact location and nature of potential small investments to be financed under 
the project has not yet been determined (these would be decided on a demand-driven basis 
through a process of formulating local plans), specific environmental impacts cannot be 
ascertained at this time. Therefore, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) would be 
prepared as part of the Environmental Assessment (EA) during project preparation. These 
processes would ensure conformity with Bank Safeguard policies, as small investments would be 
subject to an adequate EA process to avoid adverse impacts on the local environment, and 
appropriate mitigation measures would also be included in their designs. Approval by the Bank 
of the draft EA and EMF would be a condition for appraisal.  The Operational Manual will 
include guidance regarding direct and indirect impacts and screening and monitoring of project 
activities.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The proposed project would support sustainable agriculture and other rural activities. It 
would promote the use of better land and water management practices in rural landscapes. It will 
also promote the protection of remnant natural vegetation within the rural landscapes. Project 
activities will not take place in protected areas and would not significantly modify or degrade 
natural habitats. The EMP and Operational Manual will include clear guidance regarding direct 
and indirect impacts on natural habitats.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
X
The requirements of OP 4.36 for this project overlap with those of OP 4.04. The project 
would also test models of sustainable, non-timber use of remnant native forest areas in small 
rural properties. This would be carried out in accordance with addendum 2166-67 to Federal 
Law 4771/65, which allows for sustainable agro-forestry activities in small rural properties as 
long as they do not change the overall character of the forest cover and do not alter ecosystem 
functions in the area. Although the project is not expected to have negative impact on native 
forests, the EMF would include clear guidance regarding the screening and monitoring of 
project-supported activities in order to avoid such impact.   
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
X
While the project would not finance the proc
urement of any pesticides or other chemical 
Page  7
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
amendments, nevertheless, it should be noted that minor amounts of pesticides would probably 
continue to be used by some farmers in targeted micro-catchments for which disposal containers 
may be requested by communities to reduce health and environmental risks associated with 
pesticide use.  Given the challenging soil conditions in the rugged Centro Expandido region, 
rural extension and technical assistance services would encourage organic farming methods to 
increase farm productivity in a sustainable way.  This would reduce input costs and human health 
risk, as well as adverse environmental impacts.  The EMF will include guidance on pest 
management following OP4.09 for the safe handling, storage, use and disposal of pesticides as 
well as for Integrated Pest and Plant Management (IPPM).   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
It is not expected that project implementation would have any negative impact on physical 
cultural resources. However, ìchance findsî during implementation activities are a possibility 
and to handle such findings, Brazil has a well-developed legislative and normative framework 
which is under the oversight of the National Institute for Protection of Historical and 
Archeological Sites (IPHAN). In addition, SEAB and SMA have proven experience and 
appropriate procedures to recover ìchance findsî and these procedures would be in all bidding 
documents and contracts for civil works.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
The Client has confirmed that indigenous communities are present in the project area and 
will be explicitly targeted to benefit from the project. Given that SEAB lacks depth of experience 
in working with indigenous peoples, the project would heed lessons learned from related Bank-
financed operation in Santa Catarina (Natural Resources Management and Poverty Reduction 
Project, P043869) where the agricultural extension agency under the State Secretariat of 
Agriculture (SAA) targeted indigenous peoples. The total indigenous population in Paran√° is 
around 9,000, divided into three ethnic groups: Guarani, Kainkang and Xet√°.  The vast majority 
live in some 16 indigenous reserves speaking mainly the Tup√≠-Guarani and J√™ languages. In 
line with OP 4.10, a screening will be carried out by the Client to support preparation of the 
indigenous peoplesí component of the comprehensive Social Assessment (see Section D, Social 
Issues above) and Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF).  Upon its completion, the 
IPPF would incorporate the findings of consultations with indigenous groups and will document 
a
process of free, prior and informed consultation during preparation. Approval by the Bank of 
the Social Assessment and IPPF would be a condition for project appraisal.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
While it is unlikely that the project would cause physical resettlement or non-physical 
displacement, the project does include financing for the rehabilitation of municipally-
administered rural feeder roads and TA to develop Municipal Roads Management Plans. Full 
agreement of all potentially-affected parties would be obtained prior to road rehabilitation and 
maintenance works. Nonetheless, some potential right-of-way issues may arise, so the state will 
prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Approval by the Bank of the RPF would be a 
condition for project appraisal.
