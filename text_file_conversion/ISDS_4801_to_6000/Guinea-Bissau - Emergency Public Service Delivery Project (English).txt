2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the proposed project is to contribute to macroeconomic stability and 
uninterrupted delivery of critical public services.  This will be achieved through provision 
of resources for payment of salaries of teachers in the government payroll. This operation 
is a key to ensuring implementation of the macroeconomic program and fully funding the 
budget.   
 
3. Project Description 
The operation is focused on a single component, which involves payment of selected 
salaries, specifically that of teachers.  The component thus aims at supporting the 
Government in maintaining macroeconomic stability, and funding critical expenditures 
and services.  The full US$10 million grant will be disbursed against this component.  
 
Expected Outcomes  
 
Given the simple nature of the proposed operation and its function as a bridge towards a 
DPO that funds the remaining fiscal gap in 2008, there are three expected outcomes of 
the activities to be financed under the project:

proxy indicator for this will be successful completion of the IMF EPCA program.

indicator is that teachers do not go on strike and the school year is successfully 
completed. Indicator to be provided by the Ministries of Finance and Education.
