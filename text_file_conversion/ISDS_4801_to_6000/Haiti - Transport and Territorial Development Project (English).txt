2. Project Objectives 
Project Development Objective: Lower the marketing costs for small farmers in two 
selected micro-regions. (marketing costs are those costs incurred in the aggregate of 
functions involved in moving goods from producer to consumer) and rebuild selected 
infrastructure in areas struck by natural disasters.   
 
Page  2
3. Project Description 
The Haiti Transport and Territorial Development Project (The Project) was originally 
approved by the Board of Directors on April 11, 2006 and became effective on December 
13, 2006.  However, the Project is currently undergoing a Project Restructuring (the 
Restructuring). The proposed restructuring would reallocate project resources to 
reconstruction activities following the occurrence of the hurricanes and tropical storms 
that struck Haiti in 2007 and 2008, causing major damages, particularly on transport 
infrastructure. This is a first-order restructuring in that it involves changes in the Project's 
development objectives.  
 
The project includes four components:  
 
Component 1 (road rehabilitation and maintenance): the objective of this component is 
to improve the transport conditions in a sustainable manner in the two micro-regions, 
through selected interventions on roads and critical points that are essential to the rural 
economy. The project will finance the cost of the works, but also related technical and 
economic studies as well as supervision. The project will also finance the maintenance 
costs for the roads that have been rehabilitated and encourage the GoH to increase 
funding for road maintenance. Funding for maintenance will be channeled through the 
Road Maintenance Fund (FER in French).  
 
Component 2 (complementary investments identified through consultative process): a 
consultative process with local stakeholders will be used to identify priorities based on a 
multi-sector territorial development strategy for the micro-regions. Priority investments 
identified from this planning process would be selected from a menu of eligible 
investments. These investments would be of micro-regional interest and support 
economic growth.  
 
Component 3 (Project administration, monitoring and evaluation): This component 
would finance expenditures for project administration, including environmental 
management, monitoring and evaluation as well as the project's impact evaluation.  
 
Component 4 (Post natural disastersí reconstruction of selected infrastructure): This 
component would finance the reconstruction works for selected transport infrastructure 
and other investments to protect roads from erosion (eg. slope stabilization), as well as all 
related design studies and supervision works. A list of priority reconstruction activities 
has been prepared after tropical storm Noel that struck Haiti in October 2007. This list 
was then updated after the series of four hurricanes and storms FGHI (Fay, Gustav, 
Hanna and Ike) that struck Haiti in August-September 2008.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project adopts a territorial approach focused on the micro-region, which is new in 
Haiti. It would be implemented on a pilot basis in the two micro-regions covered by the 
project. If successful, this model could be replicated in other micro-regions in Haiti.  
 
Page  3
The two micro-regions that have been selected are: (1) micro-region of Dondon-St. 
Raphael, which covers 5 communes in the Northern region, which is connected to Cap 
Haitien, the second biggest city in the country; and (2) micro-region of Thiotte-
Anse √  
Pitre covering 4 communes in the South-Eastern region, located along the Dominican 
Republic border.  
 
The reconstruction activities implemented under component 4 are located in areas struck 
by natural disasters (Noel in 2007, FGHI in 2008). These areas are mostly located in the 
South of the country.  
 
Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
Institutional capacity in Haiti is generally very low. Technical assistance has been 
provided during preparation and implementation to strengthen the borrower's capacity. A 
safeguardsí specialist has been hired by one of the implementing agency (Bureau de 
Mon√©tisation, formerly named ìPL480î) to follow on safeguard-related issues during 
project implementation.  In order to further reinforce the capacity of the main project 
implementing agency (UCE), a social and environmental specialist is scheduled to be 
hired to follow up on the Transport and Territorial Development Project, as well as on 
another Bank-financed project (Emergency Bridge Reconstruction and Vulnerability 
Reduction Project).

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project aims at improving transport infrastructure in Haiti, as well as to improve 
territorial development. This will lead to many environmental and social benefits at the 
local and regional levels. Positive environmental impacts would include boosting the 
local and regional economy through the creation of jobs for the local population and 
companies. This project will promote agriculture, commerce and tourism through 
regaining access to regions of the country previously cut. It will also raise the standard of 
living of isolated population by integrating them in the national system and re-gaining 
services such as health care that were previously lost.  
 
Implementation to date of both social and environmental safeguards policies has been 
satisfactory. In particular, design studies for road rehabilitation works in the Northern 
micro-region have proposed the recycling of existing materials. A specific baseline study 
has been prepared for the monitoring of HIV/AIDS in project areas. Finally, the 
participatory process conducted under component 2 have helped involving local 
stakeholders in the definition of more sustainable development activities.  
 
This project is classified under Environmental Category B because of the limited 
potential for adverse environmental impacts.  Any impacts associated with the project are 
likely to be temporary, highly localized and easily mitigated with known management 
techniques.  Since the project primarily involves rehabilitation and reconstruction at 
existing sites, the potential for incremental environmental impacts are low.  Thus, a full 
environmental impact assessment will not be undertaken. However, in the context of 
components 1, 2 and 4, some activities might engender negative impacts.  
 
The rehabilitation works conducted under component 1 will be limited to the 
rehabilitation of existing roads, and are expected to generally preserve the physical 
characteristics of roads (same surface treatment, same width, same right-of-way). In the 
Northern micro-region, the project will finance the rehabilitation of 8 km of a paved road. 
The design study is being prepared and the recycling of existing materials has been 
proposed, thus limiting both costs and the environmental impact. In the Southern micro-
region, the design study is also being prepared and has proposed to maintain this road 
unpaved (gravel), considering existing traffic levels.  
 
The rehabilitation of roads could cause individual trees or population of trees to 
disappear due to their increasing use. The project plans to support the rehabilitation of 
forest areas through the monitoring of possibly aggravated deforestation and through 
supporting reforestation and soil rehabilitation micro-projects.  No critical natural 
habitats will be affected by the project but efforts will be made to avoid and mitigate any 
damage to locally important habitat values.  
 
Page  5
For most of the small scale work performed under components 1, 2 and 4, construction 
contractors will be required to adhere to an agreed site management plan to address the 
local issues where necessary.  
 
The infrastructure investments could require the resettlement of population from their 
own fields or could possibly require temporary or permanent land acquisition at 
construction sites. The Haitian government has set a ìCadre díExpropriationî 
(Resettlement Policy Framework, RPF). This Resettlement Framework is currently being 
revised in order to meet the additional scope of the project (inclusion of component 4 in 
response to the damages caused by natural disasters). The revision will also include the 
following improvements: (1) an initial socioeconomic assessment of the conditions of 
affected populations; (2) a broader description of the process for consultations; (3) a 
compensation system aiming at restoring ìprevious conditionsî for affected populations; 
(4) the institutional arrangements for managing and implementing the framework; and (5) 
a
description of the proposed grievance mechanism. Once approved by the Government, 
the revised framework will be published in Country and in the Infoshop. It is estimated 
that such publication should take place prior to the proposed Board date for this 
amendment (Nov. 18, 2008).  
 
The rehabilitation of roads could lead to the discovery or damage of cultural resources. 
It hence requires a supervision to make sure that the cultural and art objects be correctly 
identified and that adequate measures be set in place.  
 
An Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework for the project has been prepared, 
approved and published by the Bureau de Mon√©tisation when the project was initially 
prepared. This framework is being revised in order to cover the environmental issues 
associated with the reconstruction activities to be performed under component 4. The 
EMF describes the activities to be developed as well as a screening and evaluation tool, 
identifies likely impacts, and offers suggestions on mitigation measures for the most 
likely impacts.  The EMF also describes institutional arrangements for the 
implementation of the measures. A draft version of the revised EMF was received by the 
Bank on Nov. 4, 2008. Once finalized, this framework will be published in the Infoshop 
and in-country. The publication date is expected prior to the proposed Board date for this 
amendment.  
 
Component 4 is likely to finance the repair of an existing dam, thus justifying the 
triggering of OP4.37. As envisaged, the dam repair works include the consolidation of an 
existing small ñscale infrastructure. However, the EMF is being reviewed in order to 
make sure that works will be performed according to OP4.37.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The rehabilitation works would restore and improve the situation that prevailed before the 
disasters. It would mitigate erosion of rivers and improve resilience to disasters. No long 
term negative impacts are anticipated and the relevant screening and assessment 
procedures will be used to guide the identification and mitigation any adverse impacts.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The implementin
g
agency for component 2, the Bureau de Mon√©tisation, has a full-
time environmental specialist who is responsible for assuring that those policies laid out 
in the Environment and Social Safeguards Framework and ensuing Manual are respected. 
The Bureau de Mon√©tisation has and will continue to finance numerous environmental 
safeguard and environmental training sessions under the Emergency Recovery and 
Disaster Management Project (P090159). In addition, a social and environmental 
specialist will be hired by the UCE to ensure a sound implementation and supervision of 
the Projectís Social and Environmental Framework. A provision (US$200,000) was also 
included in project design to finance activities aiming at improving the management of 
the social and environmental impacts of project activities. Arrangements have been found 
satisfactory by visiting Bank missions and will be maintained.  Construction contractors 
will be required to adhere to a site plan for managing potential environmental impacts.  
 
During project implementation, it is expected that the proposed safeguards arrangements 
will also help the Government improve the management of social and environmental 
issues related to natural disasters and, thus, build capacity beyond the project scope.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the MTPTC and the MPCE and those individuals that benefit 
from a functioning and resilient national transportation infrastructure and an improved 
national disaster risk management system.
