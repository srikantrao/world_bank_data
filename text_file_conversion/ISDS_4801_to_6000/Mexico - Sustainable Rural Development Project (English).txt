2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective of the proposed project is to promote the adoption of 
energy efficient and/or emission-reduction technologies in agribusinesses, thus 
contributing to both Government development objectives and the goals of the National 
Strategy on Climate Change and Mexicoís commitments under the Kyoto Protocal.  The 
project would also assist the GOM to develop policies and regulatory frameworks that 
would strengthen the contribution of the agricultural sector in achieving Mexicoís goals 
under the Kyoto Protocol.  Under blended financing from IBRD and GEF, Government 
counterpart funds, beneficiariesí contributions,and eventually carbon financing, the 
project objective would be achieved through: (i) promoting increased private investment 
in energy efficiency practices and renewable energy sources in existing small and 
medium-scale agribusiness; (ii) increasing sustainable biomass production, conversion, 
and use as energy; and (iii) strengthening SAGARPAís institutional capacity to 
effectively address the agricultural sectorís impact on climate change.  
 
The global environment objective of the proposed project is to contribute to the goals of 
the National Strategy on Climate Change by reducing GHG (CO2) emission through the 
Page  2
adoption of emission-reduction technologies and the support to the implementation of the 
Presidentís Special Program for Climate Change (PECC), with special reference to the 
improved environmental sustainability of existing small and medium-scale agribusiness.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is proposed to achieve its objectives through four components:  
 
Component 1, Promotion of energy efficient agribusiness investments: Under this 
component, the project would promote energy efficient and low emissions technologies 
in existing agribusiness operating at the various stages of the production chain of 
agricultural products. The funding would be provided through a matching grant (amount 
to be determined at appraisal) mechanism to ensure the highest level of ownership by 
small and medium-sized investors and cost-effectiveness of investment, primarily in the 
fruit, vegetable, and intensive livestock (dairy, beef, and/or pork production) sectors. The 
project financing would promote: (i) the modernization of existing small and medium-
sized agribusinesses to improve their environmental sustainability, with particular 
emphasis on their energy consumption efficiency (e.g. improved production technologies, 
efficient milking equipment and cooling for dairy products, drying and packaging 
facilities for fruit and vegetables, meat processing plants); and (ii) the development of 
energy production from biomass. The GEF support would be primarily granted to provide 
the initial capital investment and remove technological barriers.  
 
Component 2, Investment and Production Support Services: This component would 
include technical assistance to beneficiaries in sub-project preparation and 
implementation; demonstration and validation of energy efficient technologies; and 
training in integrating energy efficient production and processing technologies in their 
farms and agribusinesses.  
 
Component 3, Institutional Strengthening: Activities to be financed by the project under 
this component would include assistance for policy development to address issues related 
to climate change and the environmental impact of sub-projects.  In particular, 
institutional strengthening of areas within SAGARPA that will address the targets 
outlined within the National Strategy on Climate Change and the Presidentís Special 
Program for Climate Change (PECC).  Also, support to FIRCO would be given to 
improve their capabilities, at both the central and local offices, with regards to both the 
promotion and implementation of the proposed project and the coordination and 
execution of programmatic CDM activities.  
 
Component 4, Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation:  Under this component, 
the project would finance, in part, project-related activities undertaken by the Project 
Implementation Team within FIRCO that will be responsible for project execution, and 
the development and operation of a Monitoring and Evaluation System.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The scope of the project is national in nature, but activities would be carried out in areas 
of the country which currently have a relatively high concentration of agricultural activity 
(including agribusiness), as well as potential Programmatic CDM activity. These areas, 
identified by the client during project preparation, are the 10 states of Jalisco, Coahuila, 
Durango, Chihuahua, Veracruz, Sonora, Guanajuato, Michoac√°n, Yucat√°n and Nuevo 
Le√≥n.  Project objectives are expected to be achieved through demonstration mode, for 
the most part, as sub-projects would be designed to be catalytic for expansion of similar 
activities in other regions of Mexico.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) will be triggered as well as Indigenous Peoples 
(OP/BP 4.12) by the proposed project. Other relevant safeguards (Natural Habitats, 
Physical Cultural Property, Pest Management, and Physical Cultural Resources) are 
discussed below, including the mechanisms by which the project would undertake to 
avoid triggering them. Any potential impacts would be included in the in-depth screening 
process of sub-projects which would take place to ensure their compliance with local 
legislation and Bank safeguards. As it is envisaged that Bank financing would be utilized 
for small and medium sized sub-projects, an amount to be defined at appraisal, this 
project is not expected to have significant environmental impacts. Though demand-
driven, the project would not fund those sub-projects with investments included in a 
restrictive list to be prepared by appraisal and included in the Project Operational 
Manual. This list will exclude, among other restrictions, projects with significant adverse 
environmental impacts.  The project is classified as Environmental Category B ñ Partial 
Assessment.  Inconformity with Bank policy, the client has prepared the Environmental 
Page  4
Assessment (EA) of the project.  All activities are designed to have positive 
environmental and economic impacts as a result of technical and financial support to 
investments in both improved energy efficiency in selected agro-industries, as well as 
installment of bio-digestors to improve manure management in main dairy and pig 
production areas of the country. Investments in these two sectors would have positive 
economic returns to beneficiaries, providing a win-win situation with positive returns as 
well as positive environmental impacts with regards to climate change mitigation efforts. 
Potential adverse environmental impacts would be minor or non-existent, as they would 
be avoided or minimized through appropriate preventive actions and mitigation measures.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10): The project would seek to increase the participation 
of small agri-businesses.  Some of the eligible agri-businesses could belong to indigenous 
peoples (IP) or groups of indigenous peoples.  Though any existing agri-business, 
regardless of its ownership, is invited to participate in the program, it is considered 
relevant to have a specific information and dissemination program designed to reach IP 
(taking into account language requirements for example).  SAGARPA has a Sub-
Secretariat for Rural Development that deals specifically with IP. The Project will 
collaborate with SAGARPA's Rural Development Sub-Secretariat in order to ensure that 
the dissemination of information regarding the project is designed to reach IP. In 
addition, IP may require specific attention regarding training and capacity building, 
which will be taken into account under the training program.  An Indigenous Peoples 
Framework will be prepared as part of the social assessment presently being carried out.  
 
Natural habitats (OP 4.04): Though no conversion of critical natural habitats are 
envisioned to be either promoted or permitted under activities under this project, all sub-
projects would ensure that proposed actions are consistent with the policy OP/BP 4.04 
and specifically address issues in the sub-project design to avoid any possible activities 
that result in natural habitat conversion.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11): Sub-projects are expected to involve the 
expansion and/or upgrading of existing agri-businesses, thus no major construction work 
is expected to take place with project financing. The assessment of this project indicated 
that it is highly unlikely that any activity may have any negative or positive impact on 
objects, sites, structures, natural features or landscapes with archeological, 
paleontological, historical or any other aspect of cultural significance. Based on this, in 
the unlikely event that project activities were to have a potential impact on features of 
cultural significance, all bidding documents, contracts, and work-orders for civil works 
would follow standard environmental rules for contractors, including chance find 
procedures for cultural property.  
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09): As this project promotes the adoption of energy efficiency 
and/or emission-reduction technologies in existing agri-businesses, and not direct 
agricultural production (which could include pest management practices), this safeguard 
would not apply to this project.   Further analysis and definition would be conducted at 
appraisal.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts would be included in the in-depth 
screening process of sub-projects which would take place to ensure their compliance with 
Bank safeguard standards prior to financing. As it is envisaged that Bank financing would 
be utilized for relatively small to medium-sized projects, this project is not expected to 
have significant environmental impacts. Though demand-driven, the project would not 
fund those sub-projects mentioned and included in the restrictive list which excludes 
projects with significant adverse environmental impacts.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
No significant negative environmental impacts from project activities are envisaged 
because the projectís components and activities would all be oriented towards positive 
economic impacts as a result of its technical and financial support to investment in both 
improved energy efficiency in selected agri-businesses, including bio-digestors to 
improve manure management and reduce methane emissions in the main dairy and pig 
production areas of the country. As such, the project is expected to have significant 
positive environmental impacts.  Furthermore, improved capacity for environmental 
management by both private and public sector would also result in a positive impact on 
the environment in general.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Since the FOMAGRO Program was launched in 2002, FIRCO has developed an even 
more broad experience in its operations (which begun in the 1980s). At present, sub-
projects received by the FOMAGRO must comply with the operation requirements 
specified in the Federationís Official Gazette (Diario Oficial de la Federaci√≥n - DOF) 
published in March 2005 and revised in March 2006. All the information needed for a 
sub-project to be analyzed is there provided. SAGARPA/FIRCO has developed a 
verification process by means of a Regional Technical Committee for Evaluation (known 
as COTREF), which authorizes the allocation of resources to different agro-industrial 
proposals. This Committee also verifies that sub-projects comply with environmental 
guidelines. There are two sessions in which sub-projects are reviewed to verify 
compliance with the sanitary and environmental issues for each agri-business and a 
specific norm annex where permits and authorization issued by the pertinent authorities 
are to be included. The external evaluation to FIRCO for the FOMAGRO Program 
carried out and published in 2006 reviewed pertinent aspects of 30 agri-businesses and 
this resulted in 84% of fulfillment with the required information on sanitary and 
environmental aspects. Of the 1,288 agri-businesses financed in part under the 
FOMAGRO program, the potential environmental impact of these agri-businesses was 
carried out based on considerations of impact on vegetation, soil, fauna, and air.  Several 
measures for preventing and mitigating the potential impacts were provided and in some 
cases environmental indicators derived from the federal legislation were also included.  
 
Page  6
The projectís main investment tool would be the financing of eligible sub-projects 
presented by beneficiaries. Each demand-driven sub-project would be screened by the 
Project Implementation Team, based on a checklist adapted from the current 
FOMAGROís experience and used by a Regional Committee to assess potential 
environmental impacts. Proposals with environmental risk would be thoroughly analyzed 
and the Project Implementation Team may require design revisions and/or mitigation 
measures where appropriate prior to approval, being licensed eventually according to the 
current legal framework. Annual evaluations will be carried out, as this innovative 
program may require improvements in its mechanism of implementation. The annual 
evaluations will assess the effectiveness of the screening process.  
 
The Project Operational Manual would include the necessary checklists to screen and 
highlight such sub-projects and will include detailed provision of the steps such sub-
projects would need to go through in order to ensure compliance with the Bankís 
safeguards. Compliance with the EMP would be assessed by an environmental specialist 
during supervision both in how the screening process of subprojects is conducted an also 
through field visits.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are small to medium-sized agri-businesses, as well as organizations 
of small producers.  Agri-business representativesí participation in investment decision 
making processes, as well as the demand-driven approach that will characterize project 
execution, have already been tested by the implementing agency.  The EA will be 
disclosed on FIRCOís website and through INFOSHOP prior to appraisal and during 
project implementation.
