2. Project Objectives 
The revised Project Development Objective is to improve efficiency quality and equity in 
provision of basic education in Congo. The results would contribute to the Government 
efforts to achieve universal quality primary education by 2015.In order to achieve the 
objective the proposed Additional Financing would pursue a four-fold agenda of action: 
(i) support the Government of Congo to prepare and implement a sustainable, long-term 
EFA FTI education sector plan for all educational levels; (ii) build the capacity of the 
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, in particular to improve planning, human 
resources and budget management, and strengthen the capacity of the Regional 
Departments of Education (DDEPSA) to provide support to the school system; (iii) 
provide support to increase equity in the provision of services, by providing free 
textbooks and focusing on infrastructure expansion efforts in underserved areas; and (iv) 
provide support to out of school youth and excluded populations, such as pygmies. 
Project specific indicators and benchmarks for monitoring the achievement of these 
objectives would be included in the context of an updated results framework, which will 
be based on the education results framework for the Africa Region.  
 
Page  2
The proposed objectives and activities of the Additional Financing for PRAEBASE are 
fully consistent with the Interim Strategy Note (ISN), which covers the period FY07-09 
and with the preliminary version of the Country Partnership Strategy FY10-FY12.  The 
ISN provides a framework to assist the Government to create conditions for equitable 
growth.  The two main expected outcomes are; (i) adherence to good governance 
principles; and (ii) improved emphasis on poverty reduction.  The main objectives of the 
ISN are to improve governance, better procurement of public goods and services, and 
improve health and education indicators.  Although education indicators have 
significantly improved since the return to peace, much remains to be done to meet the 
MDGs.  
 
The proposed Additional Financing are also in line with the Congo-PRSP of June 2008: 
the enhancement of the management and institutional capacity, the improvement in the 
efficiency in the allocation of resources, increasing the quality of education and the 
reduction of gender and regional inequities.   
 
3. Project Description 
Most project components, sub-component and activities would remain unchanged, and 
the Additional Financing would therefore essentially focus on the scaling-up of the 
original activities.  The proposed changes can be summarized as follows: (i)Component 
1: Two new activities would be included: the support to the development of specific 
policies of the EFA FTI sector plan (including those for upper and technical secondary 
and higher education) to ensure comprehensiveness and sustainability, and a specific 
activity to support increasing the fiduciary management capacity of the MEPSA; (ii  
 
Component 2: the construction of new classrooms would be added as an eligible activity 
of the project (in addition to rehabilitation); and support to the development of School 
Improvement Plans by the SMCs, to enhance its capacity and sustainability; (iii) 
Component 3: the development and administration of standardized tests for primary and 
secondary levels.  
 
Description by Component  
 
Component 1. Capacity building of the MEPSA (total cost: US$ 4 million equivalent, 
whereof IDA US$ 2 million and the Government US$ 2 million). This component would 
comprise four sub-components. A new sub-component (1.3) would be added to support 
the current context of sector policy development and the former sub-components 1.2 
(“Support to Decentralization”) and 1.3 (“Improvement of human resources and 
management”) would be merged in the new sub-component 1.2 (“Institutional 
strengthening of MEPSA”). A summary of each subcomponent is presented below.  
 
Sub-component 1.1. Capacity building for planning. This sub-component would provide 
support for the completion and making operational the Education Management 
Information System (EMIS).  The original project supported all preparatory activities of 
the EMIS including the design, development and piloting of school questionnaires 
treatment, annual data collection, key indicators, school map methodology, information 
management manuals, training of DDEPSAs, and a pilot experience in one department. 
Page  3
The proposed Additional Financing would scale-up the EMIS, making it operational in 
the entire country, supporting the timely delivering of school statistics and providing 
additional necessary equipment and training.  
 
Sub-component 1.2. Institutional strengthening of MEPSA. This sub-component would 
support the completion and scale-up of the implementation of the activities initiated with 
the original project: the institutional reorganization of the MEPSA, the decentralization 
process to DDPESAs, and the reform of human resource and budget management. 
Therefore, the main activities would consist of supporting the implementation of the 
action plan developed under the original project and/or the completion of actions already 
initiated: (i) the institutional reorganization of the MEPSA (centralized and decentralized 
levels); (ii) development of the annual education plans with participation of DDEPSAs; 
(iii) support to SMC in the development of the School Improvement Plans (inspections 
and planning units of DDEPSAs); (iv)  reformulation of the personnel management 
policies, notably the reallocation of teaching staff, and the revision of incentives 
mechanisms for keeping teachers in schools in disadvantaged regions; (v) completion of 
the reallocation or elimination from 
the MEPSA’s budget of “ghost” personnel;  and (vi) 
improvement in budget management.  
 
Sub-component 1.3. Support to the development and implementation of the EFA FTI 
Sector Plan.  This new sub-component would support the development of key 
policies/actions of the Sector Plan that are not already included as activities in other 
components/activities.  Importantly, it would support the development of the strategy and 
action plan for the sub-sectors of secondary general, technical and vocational secondary 
education and higher education.  In addition, this sub-component would provide technical 
assistance, and as necessary and justified, workshops, training and study tours.  
 
Sub-component 3.4. Project management. This sub-component would support the costs 
of the project management unit including fiduciary management.  In addition, it would 
support the transfer of fiduciary management capacities to MEPSA, through training, etc.  
 
Component 2. Rehabilitation and expansion of school infrastructure and enhancement of 
school management committees (total cost: US$ 13 million equivalent, whereof IDA US$ 
6.5 million and the Government US$ 6.5 million).  This component would scale-up the 
activities of the original project, including: (i) the rehabilitation of around 240 classrooms 
and the construction of around 200 new classrooms, 80 bathroom blocks and 50 houses 
for teachers in rural areas.  The original project comprised only rehabilitation of 
classrooms damaged during the war.  The proposed activities for the Additional 
Financing would comprise not only rehabilitation, but also construction of new 
classrooms.  This can be justified by the important need of additional infrastructure to 
accommodate students in some regions in a context of increasing enrollment (country 
average student/class ratio is around 76, far higher than the recommended ratio of 40).  
The procedures for preparing, selecting and executing the School Implementation Plans 
would remain mostly unchanged, with the exception of: (i) new criteria to evaluate the 
selection of sites for expansion of facilities based on objective criteria for prioritizing the 
Page  4
most needed, which would be added to the operational manual; (ii) the upgrading of the 
ESMF to address new construction.  
 
With regards to the activities related to SMCs, since most of them were already created 
and trained in the original project, the proposed Additional Financing would support: (i) 
the creation and training of SMCs in the remaining schools, estimated at around 100 (out 
of 1,600); and (ii) activities to enhance SMCs capacity and sustainability.  For this 
purpose a competitive fund would be created to support small scale School Improvements 
Plans.  
 
Component 3. Support to the improvement of quality of education (cost: US$7 million).  
This component would consist of scale-up activities under the original project, including 
a
new activity to support the development and introduction of standardized tests to 
evaluate learning outcomes.  Therefore the component would support: (i) training of 
teachers, currently in primary level, in teaching assignments; (ii) training of all school 
directors and inspectors; (iii) providing support to trainers and inspection staff in order to 
facilitate their support role to schools; (iv) completing the review of secondary education 
curricula and supporting the development of a strategy introducing a new curricula; and 
(v) providing textbooks and teachers’ guides for primary education (in Civic Education, 
French and Science and Technology) and for secondary education (in Sciences and 
Technology, English, History, Geography and Biology).  
 
Sub-component 3.1. In-service training for primary school teachers and directors: This 
sub-component would support the in-service training of around 7,500 primary level 
teachers (about 2,500 by year), including volunteers (“benevoles”) andin-service training 
for all school directors.  The component would also support the revision and 
improvement of the in-service training programs based on the evaluation and lessons 
learned from the original project.  The training approach would follow the same approach 
as the original project --a cascade methodology in which trainers are selected and trained 
in all departments.  
 
Sub-component 3.2. Support to inspections to enhance pedagogical support to schools:  
This sub-component would scale-up the activities initiated in the original project, 
providing in-service training for inspectors.  
 
Sub-component 3.3. Textbooks and pedagogical material.  This sub-component would 
scale-up the original project activities by providing: (i) textbooks and teachers’ guides, 
which were not included in the first stage.  For primary level the following text books 
would be provided: Science and Technology, Civic Education and French (complement 
as needed).  For secondary level the following text books would be provided: Sciences, 
Technology, English, History, Geography, Biology and Environment; (ii) pedagogical 
material for Sciences, and books for school libraries; and (iii) revision of texts that need 
to be adapted to the current programs.  
 
Sub-component 3.4. Curriculum development and in-service training for secondary 
schools.  This sub-component would support: (i) the review and development of the 
Page  5
primary and secondary level curricula; (ii) the review and improvement of the pre-service 
and in-service training programs for secondary teachers; and (iii) meeting secondary 
teachers’ needs in terms of teaching materials and practices.  
 
Sub-component 3.5. Introduction of standardized tests for primary and secondary level.  
This sub-component is new and would support the development and introduction of 
standardized tests at primary and secondary level. The project will provide technical 
assistance during the first year with the objective to carry out the first tests at the end of 
school year 2009/2010. The results of the first tests will be used as baseline to measure 
learning outcomes.  
 
Component 4. Support to out of school youth and schooling of pygmies (estimated cost: 
US$ 4 million): This component would scale-up the following original activities:  
 
Sub-component 4.1. Pilot programs for out of school youth:  This sub-component would 
support: (i) the scale-up of the training program to Pointe Noire and Dolisie; (ii) the 
dissemination (including the improvement) of the first stage of the youth work insertion 
strategy; (iii) the development of an observatory of the labor market (in the urban zones) 
in collaboration with the private sector; (iv) reinforcement of the institutional capacity in 
the Ministry of Technical and Professional Teaching (METP), in collaboration with other 
principal actors in this field, accompanied by a public-private partnership; (v) the 
development and implementation of a training plan for master craftsmen (those who 
guide the young people from day to day and ensure a connection with the local market); 
(vi) continued reinforcement of the capacity to evaluate the impact of this sub-
component, including an effective system of follow-up; and (vii) the creation of an 
“Insertion Fund ” for young people, supported by local companies. Support from national 
and international experts would be essential for the implementation of the activities under 
this sub-component.  
 
Sub-component 4.2. Support to education programs for pygmies:  Under this sub-
component, the proposed Additional Financing would expand and reinforce the following 
activities from the original project: (i) dissemination and implementation of the strategy 
for the schooling of pygmy children; (ii) the continuation and the expansion of the 
support to pygmy children (teaching material, schoolbooks, food in the schools, school 
uniforms, school rehabilitation and other measures); and (iii) the development and 
implementation of a strategy providing incentives to mobilize pygmy parents for the 
schooling and the elimination of illiteracy among their children.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The proposed Additional Financing environmental screening category is B in recognizing 
potential environmental and social impacts that are the likely result from planned 
construction
 and rehabilitation of educational facilities (Component 2 “Rehabilitation and 
expansion of school infrastructure and enhancement of school management 
committees”). As a result, safeguard OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment has been 
triggered.  
 
At the time of the preparation of the original project Environment and Social 
Assessments were carried out. Their main conclusions and recommendations remain 
valid for the proposed Additional Financing. However, the impact of the construction of 
new classrooms (not planned for the original project) implies adjustments in the 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF).The main adjustments to be 
made are the inclusion of: (i)  “General Environmental management conditions for 
construction contractors” in the ESMF; (ii) a more specific environmental screening 
process to identify social and environmental issues and decide on any mitigation 
measures, which will be part of the component’s operational manual.  
 
Moreover, since the proposed Additional Financing includes support for Pygmies, OP 
4.10 had been triggered for the original project. During the preparation of the original 
project an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was prepared and used as a base for the 
appraisal of the activities to be carried out in the context of the activity of the Component 
4
“support to pygmies schooling”. The IPP plan includes an assessment of the situation of 
the pygmies in Congo.  From the legal point of view, the pygmy population (estimated at 
around 40,000 individuals) are citizens equal to all other people born in Congo, but they 
have neither the same political influence, legal status, organizational, technical or 
economic capacity as the Bantus, the main ethnic group in Congo. In addition, as a result 
of the activities planned for the original project, an updated strategy for pygmies 
Page  7
schooling has been completed by February 2009 and disclosed in-country by March 9, 
2009.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Indirect and/or long term impacts due to future activities are not anticipated. The 
rehabilitation and construction of classrooms might have negative impacts specially when 
dealing with scrap metals, nails, cement blocks, paintings, installation of doors and locks. 
However, these possible impacts are so minor that they cannot justify any cancellation of 
the rehabilitation effort.  In terms of the eventual need for sites for new construction, no 
involuntary resettlement will occur since eventual acquisition of land will be done on a 
voluntary basis and voluntary donations will be documented and verified as voluntary. 
Therefore, OP.12 is not triggered.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
A
discussion of alternatives to the planned construction and rehabilitation of school 
classrooms was not relevant. The preparation of the school improvement plans must 
follow the guidelines for meeting the environmental safeguards and the screening, 
evaluation and monitoring process that have been set up for the decentralized 
management of Component 2, takes into account at each of its steps the meeting of the 
environmental guidelines. An environmental report has been prepared and disclosed 
among the main authorities and stakeholders in Congo at the time of the preparation of 
the original project.  
 
The original project as well as the proposed Additional Financing has taken into 
consideration actions designed to address all social aspects noted.  
 
I. 
To address equity issues the proposed Additional Financing is taking the 
following measures: (i) provision of free textbooks, (ii) priority for support to 
infrastructure improvement or expansion to school in deprived areas; (iii) specific support 
to disadvantaged population such as pygmies.  
 
II. 
To address the poor conditions of the schools the proposed Additional Financing 
will rehabilitated and build around 500 classrooms.  
 
III. 
To address poor conditions of work noted by the teachers (social assessment) the  
the proposed Additional Financing is supporting the following: (i) redeployment of 
teachers to change the current 1/76 teacher student ratio to 1/56 at the end of the project; 
(ii) improved financial management that will help regularize payments of all teachers on 
a
monthly basis; (iii) revision of teacher development policies and practices.  
 
IV. 
To improve the learning environment the project will support: (i) provision of free 
textbooks to all primary students in French, Civic Education and Science and 
Technology; (ii) in-service teacher training for all teachers currently assigned to teaching 
in the classroom; (iii) provision of pedagogical and learning material to all schools.  
Page  8
V. 
To improve management in the schools: (i) School Management Committees 
(SMCs) will be trained and assisted to ensure that their members are elected; (ii) SMC 
will be trained on the preparation of Schools Improvement Plans, which will constitute 
the basis for the rehabilitation and construction of classrooms.  
 
VI. 
To promote community participation: (i) SMCs will be responsible for managing 
funds; (ii) SMC will be responsible for monitoring completion of civil works, and other 
school improvements activities.  
 
VII. 
In light of increasing education of vulnerable population, the original project as 
well as the proposed Additional Financing has design a component 4 that will carry out 
activities to meet education needs of the pygmy population. In the context of the original 
PRAEBASE, several planned activities were implemented under the sub-component 4.2 
to support to pygmy schooling: distribution of school kits, uniforms, agreements with 
organizations dealing with pygmies’ education(UNESCO, UNICEF, CARITAS, etc). A 
total of 1,612 pygmy children were supported by the project.  However, the development 
of a suitable specific strategy to comprehensively address pygmy schooling is still 
underway and would be completed before the closing date of the project. 
The 
Additional Financing of the PRAEBASE would expand and reinforce the actions taken 
during the original project: (i) dissemination and implementation of strategy for the 
schooling of pigmy children; (ii) the continuation and the expansion of the support to 
pygmy children (teaching material, schoolbooks, food in the schools, school uniforms, 
school rehabilitation and other measures); and (iii) the development and implementation 
of a strategy to create incentives to mobilize pygmy parents for the schooling and the 
elimination of illiteracy among their children. In addition, the strategy will address 
mitigation of loss of culture risk ensuring that any boarding schooling is voluntary, not 
forced.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Government has shown commitment and ownership regarding the safeguards 
included to mitigate potential social and environmental negative impacts. An ESMF has 
been prepared by the Government to ensure that rehabilitation activities under the project 
are carried out in an environmentally and social sustainable manner. The evaluation of 
sub-project at the level of Department Selection Committees will include a screening 
process to identify social and environmental issues and decide on any mitigation 
measures, which will be in the component’s operationalmanual. In addition, since the 
Additional Financing includes the construction of new classrooms a “General 
Environmental management conditions for constructioncontractors” would be included as 
part of the ESMF. Finally, adequate sanitation infrastructure will also be included as a 
condition for all interventions and the Additional Financing will support its construction 
as needed.  
 
Concerning the pygmy population, a national strategy has been prepared by the 
government to address education needs of the pygmies. The strategy has been completed 
Page  9
by February 2009. The Additional Financing will have a specific subcomponent to 
address pygmies schooling and to support the new strategy/ IDPD concerning: (i) 
dissemination of the strategy for the schooling of pygmy children, including mobilizing 
pygmy parents for the schooling ensuring that any residential schooling will be voluntary, 
not forced; (ii) the continuation and the expansion of the support to pygmy children 
(teaching material, schoolbooks, school uniforms, and other measures).   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The people consulted during the time of the original project preparation comprise 
teachers, school principals, students, children 6-16 out of school, pygmies, parents and 
teachers associations, local leaders, teachers unions, NGOs, SMCs, Regional Department 
Education staff, and inspectors staff. The people interviewed and suveryed were from the 
regions of Pool, Plateaux, Cuvette, Brazaville and Pointe Noire.  
 
The safeguard documents required for this project, Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) and Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP) were 
disclosed prior to Project Appraisal in Congo and the World Bank Resident Mission, 
UNDP, UNICEF, UNESCO, Ministry of Primary, Secondary Education in Charge of 
Literacy, Ministry of Technical and Vocational Training, Ministry of Higher Education, 
General Direction of Environment and NGOs working with pygmy populations. They 
were also disclosed at the Infoshop in Washington, DC.
