                                                                                                  Public

                                                                                                            by: (i) expanding the overall infrastructure of the 2IE campuses, including administrative
                                                                                                            buildings and student life facilities; (ii) improving the pedagogic capacity with two large

conference halls (500 seats each), and classroom facilities; and (iii) increasing the boarding
capacity in both campuses, as well as rehabilitating infrastructure in Ouagadougou's campus.

 2 Improving the quality of training and research (US$17.5 million) by: (i) developing
postgraduate diplomas and equipping world class scientific research laboratories in key areas :
Pollution control and water treatment in tropical environment, water and irrigation in Sub-
Saharan environment, biomass energy and bio-fuel, interdisciplinary mathematics modeling,
environment and eco-health and building eco-materials, (ii) strengthening the capacity of
teaching staff and developing international partnerships; and (iii) increasing the dissemination of
knowledge and technology in the areas of water and environment and strengthening the
partnership with the private sector and employers.

 3 Improving the management and communication capacity of the institution (US$2.2 million)
by: (i) strengthening 2IE's outreach towards non-Francophone studentsand countries,
Anglophone teachers (to implement bilingual programs) and African higher education
institutions (to ensure greater cooperation); and (ii) strengthening 2IE's management capacity for
project monitoring, including the technicalsupervision of construction, as well as improving
2IE's financial sustainabilitythrough a stronger internal control and auditing process.

D. Project location (if known)
2IE has one existing campus in Ouagadougou. This campus will be rehabilitated with Modern
conference room, cafeteria, scientific bloc and accommodations for students.
 The second existing campus,in Kamboinse, will be expanded to accommodate more students.
The site was given by the Government of Burkina to 2IE in March 2006.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The component designed to increase the capacity of 2ie will draw on Burkina Faso's technical
standards and capabilities for the construction of classrooms and the provision of water and
sanitation and apply environmental guidelines during construction activities.
 2ie trains environment engineers, experiment and do research about protecting safe drinking
water and environment.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered                                         Yes          No        TBD
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                                X
    The Environmenal Category is B. The Environmental category is B. The project has
triggered OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment due to the potential negative environmental
impacts related to the extension of the campus in Kamboinse. The project has prepared an
ESMF to address these potential negative impacts. This report has been reviewed by the Bank's
safeguards team and will be finalized to be disclosed in the country and at the Bank's InfoShop
prior to negotiations.

Safeguard Policies Triggered                                          Yes          No         TBD
     The ESMF includes the following measures, some of which have already been completed
during the first phase of the 2IE expansion: (i) the conservation and utilization of rain water for
irrigation; (ii) the optimization of water consumption based on simplified systems; (iii) the
natural treatment of sewage; (iv) the construction of student boarding facilities in local materials;
(v) the sustainable waste management and utilization for agriculture; and (vi) the development of
an arboretum adapted to Sahelian climate.

     A social analysis has been carried out after the identification stage, during which the local
community has been consulted. The social analysis has concluded that Policy 4.12 related to
population resettlement does not need to be triggered because the population is not negatively
affected by the project. In particular, the conclusions of the social analysis are the following: (i)
the new land given in March 2006 by Burkina Faso was administrative and not been used for
agricultural purpose; (ii) only three persons were concerned during the first phase of the
expansion of 2IE: the two teachers have been redeployed and rehoused by the Ministry of
Agriculture and the guard is employed by 2IE at a higher salary than before and has found
accommodation in the village of Kamboins√©; (iii) the track that is crossing the Kamboinse
Campus on a 200 yards land will be modified to run in parallel the campus border; (iv) the
community is benefiting from the expansion of the campus through new opportunities (small
shops, food services for students, etc.); and (v) a permanent consultation group between 2iE,
local administrative authorities, and village traditional authorities has been set up and will
develop joint projects benefiting the local community.
