2. Project Objectives 
Framed within the long-term objectives of the Health Reform Program, the project 
objectives are to:  
 
(i) improve family health care practices for women (during pregnancy, delivery and 
breast-feeding) and children under three years old in the nine poorest provinces;  
 
(ii) strengthen health service network capacities to solve obstetric, neonatal and infant 
emergencies, and provide comprehensive health services to women (during pregnancy, 
delivery and breast-feeding) and children under age three in the nine poorest provinces;  
 
(ii
i)  support MINSAís governance functions of regulation, quality, efficiency and 
equity for improving the new health delivery model of maternal and child health care in a 
decentralized environment.   
 
3. Project Description 
This proposed second phase APL would have four components and total project costs of 
US$162.4 million.  This project has been jointly prepared with the IADB.  The GoP has 
requested that the Bank and IADB finance up to US$15 million each, with the remainder 
Page  2
to be covered by other fiscal resources.  The project will be implemented in the same 
Regions as under the APL I (Amazonas, Hu√°nuco, Huancavelica, Ayacucho, 
Apur√≠mac, Cusco and Puno) plus two additional Regions: Cajamarca and Ucayali. 
These Regions were prioritized because IMR and MMR still remain well above the 
national average in each, and thus need further intervention. Disbursement for this project 
will be based on standard mechanisms for investment projects as requested by the GoP 
and the categories under which funding will cover components were prepared by the 
borrower.  
 
Component 1. Improving health practices at the household level for women and children 
under age three in rural areas of the nine targeted Regions (US$6.0 million). This 
component will finance three lines of actions:  
 
Subcomponent 1.1. The design, implementation, and monitoring of a Behavioral 
Change Communication and Education Program (BCCEP). The BCCEP aims to promote 
healthy practices at the household level, including increase demand for health services, 
with a focus on mothers during pre- and post-natal periods and children under three, 
taking into consideration the cultural context of rural and indigenous populations.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2. The provision of national identity cards to unregistered pregnant 
women. This sub-component aims to support the GoP in enrolling eligible women and 
their children for SIS benefits.  
 
Component 2. Increasing the capacity to provide better maternal and child health 
services for the poor (US $142.3 million). This component would strengthen the health 
delivery model through improving the capacity of health service networks to attend 
obstetric and neonatal emergencies, to improve the integration between pre-natal and 
post-natal care, and health care for children under three.  The component would support:  
 
Subcomponent 2.1. Improvement in the quality of services in health facilities. This 
subcomponent includes minor constructions, rehabilitation, and equipment investments 
for the networks in the regions supported by the Project; technical assistance and training 
for health personnel; and the inclusion of an intercultural focus in service provision  
 
Subcomponent 2.2. Raising the efficiency and effectiveness of networks. The main 
purpose of this subcomponent is to improve the new health delivery model to be 
implemented under the Project.  
 
Component 3.  Strengthening government capacities to offer more equitable and 
efficient health system in a decentralized environment (US$5.2 million). This component 
would work towards the strengthening of MINSA, and the decentralization of the health 
system through:  
 
Subcomponent 3.1. Regulatory framework in support of service quality. This 
subcomponent includes technical assistance to support the integrated health model and 
the development of support systems.  
Page  3
Subcomponent 3.2 Strengthening of SIS. The Project would support SIS develop the 
public insurance system.  
 
Subcomponent 3.3.Systems development to enhance the monitoring capacity of 
MINSA. This set of activities would support the improved implementation of existing 
systems, namely SIS, SISMED and SIGA all of which can produce monitoring data and 
thus introduce greater accountability into the system.  
 
Subcomponent 3.4 Support to decentralization. The Project would support the continued 
implementation of Management Agreements (MA) now in place, as instruments for 
supervision and accountability between the central regulatory level and the Regions, 
which are responsible for service provision.  
 
Component 4. Project Coordination and Monitoring (US$ 8.9 million)  
 
This component would finance activities related to the administration of the project, 
such as: (i) The financing of external concurrent auditors, (ii) monitoring and evaluation 
activities, and (iii) project management and procurement team within MINSA.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project will work to serve the rural population in eight selected regions of the 
coun
try:  Amazonas, Hu√°nuco, Huancavelica, Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac, Cusco, Puno, 
Cajamarca and Ucayali.  These areas were chosen using health and poverty indicators, 
including high maternal, neonatal and child mortality.  The population in these areas is 
primarily indigenous and speaks a native language (except for Cajamarca where the 
population speaks Spanish).

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Project triggers the Environmental and Indigenous Peoples Safeguard Policies.  With 
respect to the Environmental Safeguards, the Project is rated as B.  
 
Social-Indigenous peoples  
 
As part of the project preparation process, consultations with future beneficiaries of 
PARSALUD II and the current beneficiaries of PARSALUD I were carried out in four 
indigenous areas of the country: Ayacucho and Cusco in the Andean region and Ucayali 
and Amazonas in the Amazon region, in March 2006. Consultations included 
representatives of 33 Quechua communities and 52 communities belonging to the 
following ethnic groups: Shipibo-
Conibo, Ash√°ninkas, Piros (yine), Cacataibos, 
Aguaruna, and Huambisa.  
 
The consultation process included an assessment of health issues for these groups, 
access to health services and concerns with respect to cultural appropriateness. The 
objective was to collect information regarding problems that the mothers face during their 
pregnancy and delivery in the health facilities, as well as issues with breastfeeding. The 
participants also shared their opinions about what should be done to improve the service. 
Three main problems were identified during the consultation:  
 
(a).  Lack of friendly service to clients: Poor disposition and negative attitude of health 
personnel, which is interpreted by the Andean women as discriminatory and 
exclusionary. Women reported mistreatment, yelling, lack of use of their own language, 
and lack of consideration for their cultural practices.  
 
(b).  Lack of education and information: MINSA does not educate women on the 
advantages of skilled professional attended deliveries. In addition, women also perceive a 
lack of information and education about advantages of breastfeeding and benefits of SIS.  
 
(c).  Accessibility of services: health facilities are located far away and there are no 
ìcasas maternasî or ìcasas de esperaî (facilities specifically designed to house women 
during the last weeks of their pregnancy who live far from the health facility); poor or no 
community organization to help the patients find health centers; and lack of resources to 
cover expenditures not paid by the SIS. Lack of access to health facilities is especially 
difficult in the Amazon region.  
 
Recommendations proposed during consultations include the following: (i) cultural 
appropriateness strategies; (ii) strategies to strengthen the institutional capacities of the 
sector, taking into account the attention of dispersed indigenous populations; (iii) cross-
cutting education and communication approaches.  
 
Based on the consultation process and proposed recommendations, an Indigenous 
Peoples Plan was developed. This Plan includes (i) findings from the social assessment, 
(ii) a description of the free, prior and informed consultation process, (iii) an plan of 
Page  5
actions to ensure that indigenous peoples receive culturally-sensitive and appropriate 
health services, (iv) procedures for the resolution of grievances arising from project 
implementation, and (v) monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for implementation of 
the action plan.  
 
Environment  
 
The second objective of APL II comprises infrastructure activities that entail minor 
construction, rehabilitation and provision of new equipment for the health facilities. It 
does not include major building construction but represents the adaptations that most 
common buildings need to become functional in the health obstetric and neonatal health 
network. In this sense, no environmental impact is expected from construction of new 
health facilities. On the other hand, the possible environmental impact in liquid and solid 
wastes in the health facilities network, due to the anticipated increase in the use of health 
services will result in increased health care waste (HCW) production. However, since 
waste management is expected to comply with current legislation, and appropriate current 
practice in the health system, the impacts will be low (i.e. no higher than those allowed 
by law).  
 
The EA conducted during project preparation includes a diagnostic of solid and liquid 
wastes that would be generated by project interventions. To reduce, prevent and mitigate 
risks, the EA includes measures that will be taken into account in the specific design of 
all minor constructions and rehabilitation of facilities, as well as agreed self-evaluation 
by hospitals with a methodology that has been successfully implemented in other 
countries.  
 
The EA proposes constant monitoring to mitigate potential environmental risks. This 
monitoring will ensure compliance with the standards and requirements established by 
law, as well as assure the use of the guidelines and technical procedures adopted by the 
health facilities.  
 
Following the EA, specific manuals for waste management were developed to be shared 
with each health facility. As a part of this project, there will be a component of technical 
assistance that will work directly with MINSA to institutionalize these manuals.  
 
The EA proposes a Solid and Liquid Waste Management System which (i) establishes 
basic procedures in each of the management stages for solid and liquid waste produced in 
health facilities and proposes best practices for implementation; (ii) defines monitoring 
and evaluation processes for the management of solid and liquid waste produced in the 
health facilities; and (iii) estimates the costs and capacity building strategies for the 
implementation of the Solid and Liquid Waste Management System, including 
intercultural and regional adaptations (Andean/Amazon regions, rural/urban areas).  
 
In addition, the Project will work with MOH to promote the application of the 
Environmental-Friendly Hospitals Accreditation Program, through which health facilities 
Page  6
are self-accredited if they comply with minimal environmental-friendly practices, 
including proper management of healthcare waste (HCW), efficient energy use, etc.  
 
No large scale, significant, or irreversible environmental or social impacts are expected.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No long term negative impacts are foreseen arising from the Project.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Even when there is not a specific adverse impact, to minimize the risks highlighted 
related to indigenous groups: PARSALUD will primarily intervene in areas whose 
populations are more than 70% indigenous. In these areas there are widespread practices 
of traditional medicine that would require special efforts of cultural adaptation by health 
facilities and providers. A National IPP has been approved by the Bank. It makes 
reference to a National Health Promotion strategic plan for social communication in 
health (NHPP). This NHPP was already presented and approved by the Bank. The plan 
addresses the health services cultural adaptation to practices, beliefs and attitudes to the 
health of indigenous populations. The IPP for each region where the project operates will 
adapt both the National IPP, and the NHPP to the specific regional situations. 
Management Agreements to be signed between the central government and the regions 
will include the regional IPP.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower's institutions are fully prepared to apply the safeguard policies.  The 
PARSALUD I ICR reported that during APL I various supervision teams regularly 
monitored the compliance with the environmental regulations and appropriate procedures 
for handling and managing medical waste at the participating health facilities, finding no 
relevant issues. In addition, PARSALUD I addressed key issues linked to Indigenous 
peoples through a number of activities related to the cultural adaptation of maternal and 
child health services. For example, during the APL I a number of interventions were 
tested and, when successful, were standardized by the sector‚
 îin particular, the vertical 
birthing practice (used by all Indigenous women) now has a health protocol.  In addition 
the Ministry developed a Program for ìHealthy Districts and Communitiesî which 
clearly requires that interventions take into consideration local culture and language.  The 
SIS also gives priority to Amazon and Andean populations, where the Project will be 
working.  Finally, the Ministry is revising its ELITE program (itinerant health teams that 
visit highly dispersed populations), to make it more effective and responsive to local 
demands and needs.  
 
In addition, due to Peruís large indigenous composition, and the political movement 
toward inclusion in previous years, the country and the health sector have accumulated 
extensive experience working on cultural appropriateness.  In this regard, the project has 
prepared a state of the art Communication and Health Promotion Strategy that addresses 
Page  7
cultural differences, with strong emphasis on indigenous behaviors, beliefs, and practices 
of maternal and child health care.  
 
The PARSALUD I ICR further reported that the project complied with OP 4.01 
(environmental assessment) and OP 4.10 (indigenous peoples). PARSALUD II will build 
upon lessons learned on PARSALUD I.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
MINSA's specific area, PARSALUD II coordination Unit, as well as the 9 health offices 
of the Departments selected, will be in charge of project implementation regarding 
indigenous peoples plan. The IPP has been publicly disclosed in both, printed and 
electronic format.  
 
The Project area covers 15 Indigenous peoples groups in 639 communities in the 
Amazon Basin, and Quechua and Aimara populations in about 4000 communities in the 
Andean Region.  After the four consultation workshops that were carried out in 
Ayacucho and Cuzco in the Andean Region and in Ucayali, and in Amazonas in the 
Amazon Basin, stakeholders raised critical issues and demands with respect to the 
provision of health services.  These demands were discussed with the Project preparation 
team in the MINSA, and are reflected in the Indigenous Peoples Plan.
