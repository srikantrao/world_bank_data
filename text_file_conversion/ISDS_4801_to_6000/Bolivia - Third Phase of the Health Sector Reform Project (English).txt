2. Project Objectives 
1. 
The original purpose of the Health Sector Reform Program was to help reduce the 
infant mortality rate and the maternal mortality ratio by introducing several key sector 
reforms, including: i) the design and implementation of a basic health insurance program 
targeting the poor (SBS) that later was upgraded to become the SUMI program; ii) 
strengthening the immunization program and introducing new vaccines in the national 
schedule of vaccines that are being fully financed by the Government; iii) introducing 
new management and implementation instruments such as performance agreements, 
investment mechanisms to promote maternal and child interventions, an equitable system 
to finance municipal investments, and treatment protocols for mothers and babies and for 
children under five years old;  iv) a National Program for the Expansion of Coverage of 
the SBS/SUMI (EXTENSA); and many other sector interventions.  In parallel, the Health 
Sector Reform Program was designed to be complemented by many other interventions 
in education, rural productivity, and water and sanitation included in the equity pillar of 
the Bolivia 1998 CAS, and later in the 2001 CAS Update, and Bolivia's Poverty 
Reduction Strategy.

2. 
As in the previous two phases, the activities of APL III would have two primary 
goals:  a) to increase coverage and quality of health services and related programs that 
would improve the health of the population (specifically, mothers and children) and to 
empower communities to improve their health status; and b) to strengthen national, 
regional and local capacities to respond to health needs.  In addition, this phase would 
introduce a multi-
actor targeting strategy to focus critical interventions on Bolivia’s most 
vulnerable populations.  
 
3. 
As a medium-term objective, the APL series pursued the reduction of the infant 
and maternal mortality rates by one-third, as per the proposed indicators for the Program.   
Progress is being made, as indicated in the table below:

While the use of IMR/U5MR/MMR as PDOs seems the rational way to measure 
the final impact of any health program focusing on maternal and child health, later 
analysis identified a critical problem.  These indicators are affected by a number of issues 
which are outside the control and scope of the project, making it nearly impossible to 
attribute changes in the indicators directly to project activities.  This is compounded in 
Bolivia by the lack of accurate vital statistics systems (or difficulties obtaining precise 
and timely data from DHS/surveys) which would make it easier to identify precise 
origins of change.  Finally, focusing on IMR/U5MR/MMR can distract stakeholders from 
focusing on mid-level indicators and goals that are very much within their control.  
 
5. 
Accordingly, the Project Development Objectives for APL III are five: i) to 
reduce occurrence of critical risk factors affecting maternal and infant health in the 
targeted areas so that current gaps between regions are reduced; ii) to reduce chronic 
malnutrition among children under 2 years of age in the targeted areas; iii) to increase 
health insurance coverage in the targeted areas; iv) to implement a new incentive 
environment for providers and provider networks focused on changes in health 
indicators; and v) to upgrade the National Health Information System (Sistema Nacional 
de InformaciÃ³n en Salud –SNIS) so that it will be integrated with Bolivia’s new health 
insurance program.

6. 
The following indicators will be used as key performance indicators (for 
quantitative targets and definitions, see Annex 3 of the PAD):  
 
•
Ratio between the percentage of pregnant women receiving four pre-natal care 
check-ups in the target areas and the rest of the country  
 
•
Ratio between the percentage of institutional deliveries in the target areas and the 
rest of the country  
 
•
Percentage of children receiving exclusive breast feeding at 6 months in the target 
areas  
 
•
Percentage of children 2 years old taller than -2Z scores in the target areas 
 
•
Percentage of population enrolled in health insurance in target areas  
 
•
Percentage of providers successfully achieving goals to trigger maximum 
capitation payments  
 
•
Health insurance reports generated by software system include information about 
production of services   
 
3. Project Description 
7. 
This APL III is being designed and proposed as the last phase of a 12-year Health 
Sector Reform Program.  This third phase would have two scopes of intervention: first, 
nation-wide; and second, targeted on 166 of the most vulnerable municipalities and 6 
peri-urban areas surrounding three cities.  APL III would include the following four 
components:  
 
Component 1. Stewardship Role of Health Authorities - Essential Functions in Public 
Health  
 
8. 
This component would strengthen the capacity of national, regional and local 
health authorities so all can effectively perform the critical EFPH.  Component One will 
focus on the need for robust information systems to improve the health sector’s response, 
the need to increase disease prevention and good health promotion as key elements of 
reducing the disease burden among the poor, the need to strengthen capacity, regulation 
and monitoring to improve the quality of the health services, and measures to promote 
accountability of both providers (accountability for quality services) and users (awareness 
of their right to receive services) of the health system.  
 
9. 
Activities under this component would focus on making the SNIS more robust, 
efficient and relevant.  On the human resources side, management tools and processes 
would be upgraded, including extensive management training for health authorities at 
central, regional and local institutions.  Donor coordination will also be a priority, as well 
as public outreach to local populations regarding health issues.  Two new concepts would 
be launched under this component: a national program of quality for the health sector, 
and an environmental health unit within the MSD.  
 
Component 2. Family, Community and Intercultural Health  
 
Page  4
10. 
This component would improve access to maternal and infant health services in 
the project’s target areas. Activities would support the development of Intercultural 
Maternal and Infant Health Referral Networks, complementing the existing EXTENSA 
health brigade program.  These networks would promote the demand for maternal and 
infant health care by focusing on the following three goals: 1) increasing the number of 
safe institutional childbirths; 2) increasing the numbers of referral of obstetric 
emergencies directly from the community; and 3) providing access to a referral system 
for children with acute respiratory and digestive diseases.  The health challenges 
addressed by these goals disproportionately affect vulnerable communities.  The 
component’s activities would also focus on increasing community participation in health 
issues, and on increasing the management capacity of departmental and local health 
institutions.  
 
11. 
Activities under this component would also focus on strengthening the referral 
networks that already exist in the project’s target areas.  Activities wouldbuild human 
resource capacities and physical infrastructure in the networks’ institutions, including 
upgrading or purchasing equipment.  Community participation in health issues would be 
encouraged under this component, via solicitation of participation in the planning phase 
of local activities, and via a coordinated public awareness campaign on disease 
prevention and good health practices.  
 
Component 3. Health Insurance  
 
12. 
Component Three would support the GOB’s implementation of the new SU 
SALUD health insurance program through four project subcomponents. The three 
components would focus on strengthening implementation capacity: a) Strengthening of 
the enrollment system; b) Strengthening management practices; and c) Development of 
SU SALUD’s monitoring and evaluation system.  
 
Component 4. Project Administration (US$1.04 million)  
 
The fourth component would support project administration with equipment, technical 
assistance, training, and operating costs to finance the administration of the project, and 
financial and procurement audits.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The activities of component I and III will be carried out in the whole country while the 
activities of component II, which is the only component that envisioned rehabilitation 
civil works, will be carried out in 82 highly vulnerable municipalities and three peri-
urban areas El Alto, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The two most relevant environmental issues resulting from the implementation of this 
project would be an increase in the production of Health Care Waste (HCW), and the 
impacts associated with the physical rehabilitation of health centers and other 
construction activities.  As a part of the supervision of the APL II Project and the design 
process of this Project, an environmental assessment was undertaken to review and 
analyze: (i) Bolivia’s public health policies associated with the environment; and (ii) the 
policies and specific standards related to HCW and its environmental impact.  The 
assessment identified  needs and recommendations, reflected on Annex 10.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
We do not anticipate any long term environmental impact due to the activities of the 
project.  The Government already has norms and guidelines in place to manage the 
disposal of hospital waste and to avoid environmental impact of civil works on hospital 
rehabilitation.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
In order to avoid or minimize adverse impacts the project has prepared and 
Environmental Assessment and a Social Assessment.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Upon request of the Ministry of Health of Bolivia, and consistent with the WB 
Operational Policy 4.10, the Health Reform Project III will be treated as an Indigenous 
Project because (a) The targeted population is mostly Originary/Indigenous in the 17 
health networks of the 82 municipalities and 3 peri-urban areas of El Alto, Santa Cruz 
and Cochabamba selected for intervention; and (b) The project is designed to deliver a 
culturally-appropriate health model.  
Page  6
The project uses an ‘intercultural health’ approach which requires that both bio-
medicine and traditional medicine be practiced in an articulated, parallel but 
complementary manner to obtain best results on targeted population.  
 
The Vice-Ministry of Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Health is the institution 
providing the norms of intercultural health. This institution is in the process of 
reorganization and strengthening, to be able to provide guidance and assistance to the 
units responsible for implementation.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are the Vice-Minister of Traditional Medicine and Intercultural Health 
at the MSD. Also, the medical SAFCI teams, the traditional health networks (including 
traditional authorities) existing in all rural contexts, the medical staff who speak the 
indigenous languages of their patients and carry on their traditions, and the indigenous 
communities themselves, particularly their health committees.  
 
The borrower carried out free and informed consultations by means of the local multi-
disciplinary firm Centro de Estudios y Proyectos (CEP). The assessment included 
consultations on a sample of 40 rural communities showing low health indicators in the 
Western highlands, Eastern lowlands and Chaco regions. The objectives of the 
consultations were to (a) provide a diagnosis of the present state of health care services 
(preventative and curative) offered to Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples; (b) assess 
the use of intercultural approaches to health at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of 
care; (c) assess the cultural access of users to health units and hospitals, assess cultural 
barriers and preferences; (d) assess good practices (traditional and non-traditional); and 
(e) assess the relationship between the official health services and traditional therapists. 
The results of the social assessment provided lessons learned and recommendations to be 
used in the project design and implementation. Annex 10 articulates the intercultural 
health approach of the project in each one of the components. A separate assessment of 
the outreach program EXTENSA is being carried out by the MSD at this time with the 
purpose of improving the program during implementation.
