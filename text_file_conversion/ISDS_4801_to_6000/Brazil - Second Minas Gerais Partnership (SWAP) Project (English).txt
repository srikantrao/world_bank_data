2. Project Objectives 
The project has three fundamental development objectives:  
 
•
Help the Government of Minas Gerais to improve the efficiency of public 
resource use (getting more out of each Real spent) and the effectiveness of public 
resource allocation. Success in meeting this objective on the efficiency side will be 
measured by some basic fiscal measures (share of personnel expenditure in total 
expenditure of the Executive part of the Government) as well as the existence, 
measurement and tracking of cost information in the health, education and transport 
sectors. Success in meeting the objective on the allocation side would be measured by 
investment expenditure as a share of total expenditure and expenditure on the strategic 
projects as a share of total expenditure.  
 
•
Support the adoption of innovations in public management of the State.  Success 
would be measured by the extension of implementation of the Results Agreements in key 
Page  2
sectors, the number of public private partnerships (PPPs) contracted by the State, the 
percentage of hospitals of accredited, and the  percentage of state paved roads network 
under results 
–based maintenance and rehabilitation contracts.  
 
•
Support the Government of Minas Gerais in strengthening the system of 
monitoring and evaluation of results.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project is a US$976 million Investment loan using the SWAP modality to 
support implementation of the Government's program over a three year period. The 
project aims at financing expenses associated with priority expenditure programs that are 
fundamental to achievement of the Government's program, while at the same time linking 
disbursement of these resources to continued improvements in fiscal management, 
improvements in the efficiency of spending and in achievements of specified results in 
the results areas. The project will also have a $ 18 million TA component.  
 
The operation will focus on three cross-cutting themes that will themselves be 
strengthened, but will also be the focal points for drilling down into the results areas. 
These three areas are: 1) improving fiscal quality (the efficiency of expenditures); 2) 
innovation in and strengthening of public sector management; and 3) further development 
of monitoring and evaluation tools. While the operation will support the Government's 
program as a whole, particular attention will be paid to drilling down in the following 
areas: Public Sector management; Private Sector Development: Health; Education; and 
Transport. These areas were chosen as those in which the Government sought Bank 
assistance and in which the Bank could provide the highest value added.  
 
Swap Component  
 
Public Sector Management - An overriding goal of the government is to extend the 
culture of results management created under the first administration to the line 
Secretariats, so that this approach to public sector management is internalized across the 
Government.  In order to assist the Government in implementation of the four challenges 
identified in Technical Annex 1, this component of the project focuses on: i) 
implementation of the results agreements; ii) professionalization of public managers; iii) 
building on continued improvements in budget and financial management,  and continued 
strengthening of the system of procurement. Priority objectives and problems targeted are 
the implementation of results agreements, strengthening professionalism of public 
managers, building on continued improvements in budget and financial management, 
continued strengthening of the systems of procurement and strengthening of monitoring 
and evaluation systems. As a consequence, the following Eligible expenditure programs 
will be funded: a) Professionalization of Public Managers; b) Sectoral Public Reform 
Agenda; c) Tax Efficiency and Simplification; and d) Modernization of Fiscal 
management. Disbursement-linked indicators:  
 
o
Implementation of Results Agreements - Number of Secretariats with verified 
performance above 70%.  
Page  3
o
Certification of Public Managers - Number of processes of certification 
accomplished in the year  
 
o

Primary Result and ratio of personnel Expenditures to Net Current Revenue  
 
o
Participation of Structuring Projects in total Expenditures  
 
o
Implementation of Information Management Systems for Procurement  
 
o
New instruments for M & E 
–
household survey, quality surveys, impact 
evaluation surveys  
 
Private Sector Development - This sector of the project will focus on actions that are 
under control of the state to foster innovation and technology adoption and to improve the 
business environment. It will also support the state leading role in implementing public 
private partnerships. Support in these last two areas will be provided in close 
collaboration with the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Priority objectives in this 
sector are to improve the business climate of the state and to foster innovation and 
technology adoption in the state. Selected Eligible expenditure programs are: a) Business 
Simplification; b) Public Private Partnerships (PPPs); c) Technical Formation for the 
Market; d) Network for Innovation Technology; and e) Certification and health 
inspection of agricultural production. Disbursement-linked indicators:  
 
o
Time to start a business at Minas Facil  
 
o
Implementation of Minas Facil in the entire State  
 
o
Number of contracted PPPs  
 
o
Number of Technological Innovation Centers established and consolidated  
 
Health - Minas Gerais’ health sector faces a number of systemic challenges thatare 
similar to those faced by many states in Brazil. (i) Oversupply of hospitals, particularly of 
underutilized small facilities; (ii) inequitable access to basic and specialty care; (iii) low 
quality and inefficient service delivery; (iv) little coordination or integration among 
health care providers at different levels of care; and (v) weak information environment. 
Each of these problems has implications for resource allocation and management, quality 
of spending, and ultimately health outcomes. Improve the quality of hospital and Family 
Health Team care and strengthen the efficiency of hospital management are the main 
objectives here and led to the selection of three Eligible expenditure programs: a) 
Regionalization of Healthcare Services; b) Home Healthcare (“SaÃºde em Casa”); and c) 
Live Life. Disbursement-linked indicators are:  
 
o
Percentage of hospitals of PROHOSP program assessed for accreditation by ONA  
 
o
Implementation of standardized cost accounting systems in hospitals  
 
o
Impact Evaluation of Viva Vida Centers  
 
Education - The main sector challenges are no different from the ones encountered 
elsewhere in Brazil: (i) implement a student testing cycle, (ii) improve literacy, (iii) 
upgrade expenditure efficiency and quality, and (iv) improve State/municipal cooperation 
in delivering primary education. Considerable progress has been made in each of these 
areas, sufficient for the administration to refine these priorities and add a focus on 
Page  4
educational performance. The Priority objectives and problems targeted are thus 
insufficient information on student learning achievement and early-primary-school 
literacy. The project will support the following Eligible expenditure programs: a) 
Management of Elementary Education Services; b) Secondary Vocational Education; and 
c) Personnel expenditures of the State Secretariat of Education. Disbursement-linked 
indicators:  
 
o
Percentage of students registered in state schools with expected reading level in 
the 3rd year of elementary school  
 
o
State evaluations of student learning in different grades  
 
o
Cost  per Student  Informational System (SICA) implemented  
 
o
Students enrolled in technical and secondary vocational schools  
 
Transport -
 The state’s long-term development plan (PMDI, Plano Mineiro de 
Desenvolvimento Integrado) indicates the state’s macro-objective in the transport sector 
is to: (a) reduce transport costs and expand access to the markets of production through 
the supply of a sufficient, adequate and safe road network; and (b) overcome bottlenecks 
and improve the quality of transport infrastructure in order to expand the integration of 
the competitive economy and the development of low dynamic regions. According to the 
PMDI, these objectives are to be achieved through: (i) a result-based approach to 
management in the sector, which opens the door to increased efficiency and improved 
quality of spending; and (ii) innovative partnerships with the private sector, through PPPs 
and other mechanisms. Priority objectives and problems targeted: a) Need to increase the 
efficiency of priority Government programs; b) Reduce transport costs and c) Increase 
private sector participation in the provision of transport infrastructure. The program will 
support the following Eligible expenditure programs: a) PROMG PLENO – 
Highwayrecovery and maintenance; and b) PRO-ACESSO - Road surfacing program. 
There will be five Disbursement-linked indicators:  
 
o
Percentage of the state paved road network under results-based maintenance and 
rehabilitation contracts

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Minas Gerais is a rich and dynamic state, in Brazil’s Southeast region, with a population 
estimated in more than 19 million people, of which 15% is rural.  Minas Gerais is one of 
Brazil’s most densely populated and intensively used territories. The state’s land use is 
characterized by its extensive agricultural area in which few natural areas remain. As in 
the rest of Brazil, Minas presents high levels of social and economic heterogeneity and 
inequality. The predominant economic activities in Minas Gerais are industry, mining, 
plantation forestry and agribusiness. The physical investments and financing of 
government recurrent expenditure under the proposed project will therefore be 
implemented on this geographic context. Given the nature of these investments 
(explained below)it is not expected that any significant negative social or environmental 
impacts will occur because of the project.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The MG SWAP will support broad state programs in the health, education, 
environmental, transport, public and private sectors that have been prioritized by the State 
through a consultative process. The potential negative impacts associated with the 
proposed project would be linked to investments in: (i) small works for the up-grading 
and maintenance of health and education facilities and (ii) larger works under the state 
road paving and rehabilitation programs (Pro-MG and Pro-Acesso). Impacts of small 
works for the up-grading and maintenance of health and education facilities are mostly 
associated with noise, dust and the disposal of materials. The rehabilitation under Pro-
MG will not require involuntary resettlements or land acquisitions, nor will they interfere 
with indigenous peoples territories. The paving works will not interfere with indigenous 
peoples territories, nor will they require involuntary resettlements, but there is a need for 
a
small amount of land acquisitions and chance findings of archaeological and 
paleontological artifacts may occur. The potential adverse environmental impacts on 
human populations or environmentally sensitive areas associated with the aforementioned 
investments are therefore site-specific and reversible and associated with the construction 
phase. No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There are no potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project. As described above, the project will support small works on 
health and education facilities and road rehabilitation and maintenance mostly within the 
paved area, and eventually to roads’ rights-of-way (ROW).  Most of the Project’s impacts 
would thereforebe site specific, reversible and related to the works phase of the 
investments.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The measures taken by the Borrower to address safeguard policy issues included: 1) the 
preparation of a strategic environmental assessment for the transport sector investment 
programs; 2) preparation of environmental, indigenous peoples and involuntary 
resettlement frameworks; and 3) preparation of a specific public consultation manual for 
the roads works. The assessments and frameworks were reviewed and were considered 
acceptable to the Bank. It should be emphasized that all of the aforementioned documents 
include provisions for the institutional strengthening of the involved institutions so as to 
strengthen social and environmental impact risk management. The Borrowers capacity to 
address safeguard policy issues is considered satisfactory.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
In the preparation of the “The State for Results” program, along with the formal 
discussions by the legislative power, multiple consultations were organized by the 
Government with local governments and civil society organizations, which are the 
Programs main stakeholders. Additionally the above mentioned social and environmental 
assessment and frameworks will be subject to the State’s Environmental Council 
(COPAM) scrutiny. COPAM is a decentralized participative policy and decision making 
body which convenes 900 members from civil society, government, academia and private 
sector. COPAM is responsible for validating all environmental policy directives in Minas 
Gerais and is the locus for public discussion of all relevant state environmental policy 
matters. In preparation for this meeting, all safeguards documents have been posted on 
the web and comments were requested. As for specific consultation in the case of the 
works to be carried out under the transport sector programs a specific public consultation 
manual was prepared by the State. The Bank reviewed the public consultation manual 
and found it acceptable.
