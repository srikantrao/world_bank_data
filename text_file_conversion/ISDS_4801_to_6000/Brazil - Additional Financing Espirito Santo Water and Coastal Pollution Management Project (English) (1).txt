B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to enable the beneficiaries in the project area to 
benefit from improved quality of and access to water supply and sewerage services. This will be 
achieved by: (a) improving the efficiency of the water supply and sewerage systems of CESAN 
by supporting its efforts to operate on a commercial basis with financial self-sufficiency; (b) 
increasing the coverage level of CESANs water supply and basic sanitation services (sewage 
collection, treatment and disposal) in the urban areas of the Metropolitan Region of Grande 
Vit贸ria (MRGV) and other towns located mainly in the Santa Maria and Jucu river basins; and 
(c) providing appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban areas of 
Grande Vit贸ria and Guarapari. Strengthening the States environmental management capacity 
has also been a complementary purpose of the project since the approval of the original loan.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The additional loan would finance activities under the following four components:  
 
Page  2
a. 
Sewerage. Completion and operationalization of the sewage collection and treatment 
system of the MRGV by: (a) building additional sewage collection networks to connect to the 
trunk infrastructure built with financing from World Bank loan 3767-BR; (b) building new 
sewage collection systems; (c) expanding the sewage treatment system of Grande Vit贸ria to a 
nominal treatment capacity of 540 l/s; and (d) preparing a sanitation master plan for the MRGV 
and developing a model for receiving water bodies in such region.  
 
b. 
Water Supply. Capacity expansions for raw water intakes and water treatment plants, 
construction of storage tanks and distribution mains to improve the quality and service continuity 
of water supply in the MRGV.  
 
c. 
Institutional Strengthening of SEAMA/IEMA. This component would strengthen the 
environmental management capacity of the State Secretariat of the Environment and Water 
Resources (Secretaria de Estado do Meio Ambiente e Recursos H铆dricos,SEAMA) which is 
charged with defining Esp铆rito Santos environmental policies and its sister institution, the 
State Environmental Institute (Instituto Estadual de Meio Ambiente e Recursos H铆dricos, 
IEMA) which is responsible for carrying them out. Possible activities include: (a the design of an 
institutional strategy for SEAMA/IEMA; (b) implementation of an integrated environmental 
information system; (c) improvements to the environmental licensing process in Esp铆rito 
Santo;(d) implementation of a monitoring network for water resources; (e) construction of a 
water resource management system; and (f) environmental education.  
 
d. 
Institutional, Financial and Operational Strengthening of CESAN. This component would 
include activities designed to: (a) improve CESANs financial and operational performance; and 
(b) hold CESAN accountable to its customers in terms of performance.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Water supply and sewerage investments will be located in the MRGV (Vit贸ria, Vila Velha, 
Cariacica, Serra, Viana and Guarapari municipalities). All of these areas (except for Cariacica 
and Viana) have beaches and in-land waterways that are contaminated by uncollected and 
untreated sewage discharges. The project will improve the quality of these water bodies by 
building new sewerage networks in Vitoria, Vila Velha, Cariacica and Guarapari; expanding the 
Mulemb谩 sewage treatment plant, connecting additional users to existing secondary sewage 
treatment plants and constructing new systems in unattended areas (Nova Almeida/Praia Grande 
and Manguinhos in Serra).   
 
E.  Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The ongoing project execution has been properly following the Bank social and environmental 
safeguards, and fully complied with the national environmental legislation. Environmental 
licenses have already been issued for the transportation and final disposal of sludge generated in 
the wastewater treatment plants. This compliance has been ensured by the presence of 
environmental specialists in the Bank supervision team as well as by the increased local capacity 
of the state environmental agency and the state water company. The strengthening of 
SEAMA/IEMA will continue under the proposed additional loan.

The ongoing project was classified as Category B under the Bank's environmental guidelines. 
The activities to be financed under the proposed additional loan were the subject of another 
updated Program Environmental Assessment and an updated Environmental Management Plan, 
which were also prepared and discussed in public consultations in the State. Water supply and 
sanitation investments under implementation or to be carried out under the additional loan have 
also been classified as Category B.

environmental licenses. Archeologists will accompany construction works, from the preparation 
of the executive projects to their completion, including the laying down of the collection 
network.
