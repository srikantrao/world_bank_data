2. Project Objectives 
The project development objectives (PDO) and beneficiaries would be the same as for 
PNDP I. The project supports the overall objective of the Community Development 
Program to enhance the opportunities and livelihoods of rural people in Cameroon. To 
that end, its Development Objective is to improve delivery of specified services in 
targeted communities, and extend the ongoing process of decentralization to new regions. 
The main beneficiaries will be the communes and communities supported during PNDP 1 
plus at least 100 communes in five new provinces.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project coverage will be extended to the remaining five regions where PNDP I was 
not active. Communes in these and previously covered provinces will be selected using 
criteria as defined in consultation with mayors, the Government’s administrative services, 
civil society, and development partners. These criteria include the poverty level of the 
commune, the quality of local governance, and the performance of the commune in 
preparing CDPs and implementing them.

The project has three components:  
 
Component 1: Local Development Support  
 
Component 2: Decentralization support for communities  
 
Component 3: Coordination, management, communication, monitoring and evaluation   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will be implemented in the rural areas of the country's ten provinces. The 
environmental characteristics of the project area range from the humid forest zone (south, 
West, Center Regions), to the high plataux of the Western and North-Western Regions, to 
the savannahs of the Adamaoua Region, to the Sudano-Sahelian zone of the North and 
Extreme North Regions.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The potential safeguard issues relate to air, soil, water and noise pollution, loss of 
vegetation, generation of medical waste at the health centers to be constructed, and loss 
of livelihoods due to the planned construction activities under future micro-projects.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
In light of the provisions made under the project for environmental and social 
management, potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to the planned construction 
activities are not anticipated.   
Page  3
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Since this is the second tranche of the governments Community Development Program, 
alternatives were not considered.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower has prepared (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF)which outlines the environmental and social screening process for micro-projects 
and includes the medical waste management plan for health centers and a market waste 
management plan; (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) which outlines the 
policies and procedures to be applied in the event that some micro-projects involve land 
acquisition; and (iii)an action plan for pygmies to be implemented under the proposed 
project; this action plan was prepared on the basis of the Indigeneous Peoples Plan 
prepared for the first phase.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The stakeholders involve farmers, municipal staff, mayors, representatives of the various 
ministries, NGOs, and local governments. The potentially affected persons will be 
consulted as part of the micro-project environmental and social screening process which 
includes relevant questions in this regard.Notifications were sent to the riparians 
requesting that any responses be sent to the Government of Cameroon by March 15, 
2009. On January 30, 2009, the Lake Chad Basin Commission informed the Bank that it 
had no objections to the proposed project. No response was received from the Niger 
River Basin Authority by the stated deadline. A memorandum discussing the results of 
the notification process has been sent to the Regional VP for Africa. The relevant 
documents (ESMF, RPF, Action Plan for Pygmies) have been publicly disclosed by the 
government via public radio announcements, publication in newspapers, municipalities 
and communes.
