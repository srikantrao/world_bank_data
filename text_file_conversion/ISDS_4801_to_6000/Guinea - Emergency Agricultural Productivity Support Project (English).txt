2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the grant is  to increase rice yields by 30% on 1,000 hectares of irrigated 
rice during the 2008-
09
dry season (“contre-saison”, i.e. November2008-March 2009) 
and 40,000  hectares or rain fed rice during the 2009-10 cropping season (June – October 
2009).  This will result in an additional 75,000 tonsof paddy rice production.   
 
3. Project Description 
Three three sets of activities are envisioned under this emergency response project:  
 
(i) Support for the production of  2000 tons of  improved and certified seed during the 
2008-09 rainy and ‘contre-saison’ through a scaling up of the existing farmer seed 
multiplication network and the purchase, treatment, and stocking of the seed for 
distribution during the 2009-10 cropping season.  
 
(ii) Purchase of 2000 tons of fertilizer and 20,000 liters of herbicides and pesticides.  
 
(iii) Distribution of input packets (seed, fertilizer, herbicide/pesticide) though the 
existing farmer organization networks and support for advisory services necessary.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
From an environmental and social safeguard standpoint, the Guinea Emergency 
Agricultural Productivity Support Project a Category B project.  This suggests that 
environmental and social impacts of the project, for the most part, will be minimal, site-
specific and manageable to an accepted level. This emergency operation triggers two 
safeguard policies: the Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01) and the Pest 
Management Policy (OP 4.09), predicated on program objectives to increase agricultural 
production and productivity with the provision of certified seeds and fertilizers to rice 
producers. The project will prepare one safeguards document - combined Environment 
and Pest Management Plan - to be submitted to the Bank within 90 days of signing of the 
grant agreement.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
Page  3
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The PCU of the Village Communities Support Program will provide both fiduciary and 
safeguard oversight for the project.  The PCU has a technical specialist responsible for 
the GEF components of the VCSP and has recently hired a safeguard specialist to 
reinforce the Borrower’s institutional capacity in addressing safeguard issues. The 
Government team will receive guidance from the Bank’s safeguards specialists on the 
project team.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are rice producers and their organisations. Mechanisms for consultation 
include meetings organized by the National Confederation of Producer Organisations and 
individual producer federations and unions at the local level. Additional consultation is 
provided through field visits to famers and farmer groups and monitoring by agricultural 
advisory service staff.
