2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to increase the effectiveness of Argentinaís income 
transfer programs for the unemployed and families with children, by expanding the 
number of participants and improving design features, transparency and accountability in 
two core social protection programs.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project is a US$ 450 million Specific Investment Loan, to support 
implementation of the Government program during approximately one year period. The 
project would finance social protection transfers, focusing on two programs that are 
considered core to the Governmentís social protection strategy: the Seguro (Employment 
Benefit and Training) program and the ìFamily Allowancesî program.  
 
The project will have three components. These will respectively support: (i) 
improvements and expansion of Seguro; (ii) improvements in Family Allowances; and 
(iii) a Technical Assistance component for monitoring and evaluation of social protection 
programs.  
 
Page  2
These components were selected as the programs and activities to be supported are 
expected to have significant impacts on children and unemployed welfare in the short 
term, and to create conditions for further improvements in the future. Components I and 
II will provide financial support to two of the social protection programs in Argentina 
with the highest current and potential impact on living conditions and human capital 
accumulation among two particularly vulnerable populations. The programs (Seguro and 
Family Allowances) offer, through a simple and efficient design, basic protection to these 
populations. Improvements currently under way should increase their effectiveness in the 
short term, thus justifying the Bankí support, and create conditions to further expand their 
coverage in the future.  
 
The third component will provide technical assistance to improve monitoring capacity at 
the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security. For years, social policy 
designers and officials in Argentina have had serious limitations due to the lack of 
complete, reliable data on some basic indicators. Most social indicators in Argentina are 
based on a household survey that is collected in 30 urban centers across the country and 
no information on small urban centers or rural population is available. Furthermore, the 
survey was mostly designed to collect data on labor market trends, and as such it does not 
get enough information about access, use, and impacts of social protection policies. 
Finally, accessibility of microdata has been limited since early 2007, due to problems at 
the statistical agency. The component will support the design and implementation of a 
new Social Protection survey, with national coverage, that will produce quality 
information to be used in the analysis and redesign of social policies.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project activities have national coverage.  For Component 1 (Seguro de 
Capacitaci√≥n y Empleo) municipal employment offices offering Seguro exist in 186 
locations with a targeted expansion to 250. Family Allowances (Component 2) are fully 
managed from the National Social Security Administration, with no local services linked 
to them.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The proposed project triggers the safeguard policy relating to indigenous peoples. The 
objective of the Basic Protection Project is to increase the effectiveness
 of Argentinaís 
income transfer programs for the unemployed and families with children, by improving 
design features, transparency and accountability in two core programs and transferring 
beneficiaries from other, less effective schemes, to them. No large scale, significant 
and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated. In the case of the first Project component 
(Seguro de Capacitaci√≥n y Empleo) the location of project activities will depend on the 
location of municipal employment offices. Though the specific municipalities 
participating in the project will be determined during its implementation, at least some of 
them are expected to contain indigenous communities, making the application of the 
requirements under OP 4.10 relevant to these areas.  Application of the OP is not 
expected to be relevant to actions under the Asignaciones Familiares component because 
the cash transfer benefits provided in this case are is not in any way differentiated or 
targeted based on ethnicity.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
In the long term, the Project is expected to enhance the effectiveness of social protection 
policies and contribute to an improvement in the standard of living of the working poor.  
In the case of Seguro de Capacitaci√≥n y Empleo, one wouldexpect to see some re-design 
of interventions to better address the needs of this group (including those who are 
indigenous) and promote a stable, sustainable integration of these workers in formal jobs. 
In the case of Family Allowances, the expected outcome would be better developmental 
outcomes of young children, particularly those from poor families, thereby helping to 
improve the equality of opportunity in the country.   
 
Page  4
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Given the nature of the Basic Protection project, no adverse impacts are expected.  On the 
contrary, the Government is making efforts to ensure that the benefits indigenous peoples 
receive from the delivery of services through Seguro are culturally appropriate.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Argentine government is executing the Lifelong Learning project (Loan AR-7474), 
which overlaps with the current operation in important ways. In coordination with the 
Bank, the Government (through the same implementing agency) prepared an Indigenous 
Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) and submitted it for Bank review and approval. This 
IPPF has been submitted to the Bank Infoshop and disclosed by the Borrower in 
compliance with OP 4.10.  Seguroís participants are part of the priority targeting 
population of services developed and supported by Lifelong Learning.  The education 
and training services associated to both projects are similar.  Therefore the actions taken 
in the context of Lifelong Learning project preparation and implementation are highly 
relevant for the Basic Protection project.  
 
The Ministry of Labor is committed to assisting indigenous peoples and encouraging 
their participation as project beneficiaries through a number of specific actions that aim at 
including and reaching out to this sector of the population. The project will build on the 
experience of the Lifelong Learning Project in provinces currently working with 
indigenous peoples.  
 
Seguro is a government program already under implementation. Its development has 
required several actions of cultural adaptation, that were already implemented before the 
Bank indicated the need to develop a formal framework. These actions include:  
 
ï
The elaboration of bilingual material to disseminate information about 
Seguroamong indigenous communities in Formosa  
 
ï
As a Mapuche community from Neuquen asked to participate in the program as a 
community in the program (instead of individually), so the program adjusted its 
regulations to accomodate this request.  
 
ï
A
Diaguita community from La Rioja proposed to start a plan involving all 
stakeholders, including local producers, municipal officials and themselves, through 
public meetings, to discuss Seguro, so the program organized the meetings and registered 
its results.  
 
The above mentioned show the MTESS willingness and institutional capacity to 
respond to Indigenous communitiesí proposals and demands.  
 
Provinces and Municipalities are required to sign an agreement with the Ministry of 
Labor to participate in LLL and Seguro. These agreements, where relevant, include a 
clause regarding the need to design and implement an IPP, to ensure that indigenous 
communitiesí needs and interests are addressed.  
 
Services involved and beneficiary population of LLL and Seguro are similar, and the 
implementing agency is the same for both programs. Thus, in order to avoid duplication 
of efforts and waste of resources, the Government will implement the process of 
Page  5
information and consultation for both programs together, and IPPs under preparation or 
to be prepared in the future will explicitly cover activities under LLL and Seguro.  
 
In keeping with the provisions of the IPPF, Provincial- or Municipal-level indigenous 
peoples plans (IPPs) will be prepared as the municipalities with an indigenous presence 
come on board.  In addition to specifying the measures taken to ensure that indigenous 
peoples will receive culturally appropriate benefits from the project, these plans will 
incorporate specific strategies of promotion and communication in order to foster an 
adequate understanding of the project among the indigenous communities involved. In 
particular, the following is envisaged:  
 
(a) 
the use of existing material in the original language;  
 
(b) 
training of local agents to register participants in these communities;  
 
(c) 
promotion and communication campaigns;  
 
(d) 
mechanisms to provide information and respond to complaints, at the national as 
well as the provincial level;  
 
(e) 
training for tutors to work with the participants from these communities; and  
 
(f) 
a description of the specific modality that would be used to offer these services in 
each indigenous community.  
 
The Provincial or Municipal IPPs could also include activities that the Province or 
Municipality is developing, in cooperation with the local indigenous communities, to 
improve the quality and access to basic education services and work experience and 
training opportunities.  
 
The Provinces or Municipalities where the specific activities take place will have the 
primary responsibility for preparation and implementation of the IPPs, taking advantage 
of their experience in responding to needs and demands of indigenous population. The 
Ministry of Labor has hired specialists to advice on the preparation of the social 
assessments and the IPPs when necessary.  
 
These mechanisms would ensure the implementation of an appropriate intercultural 
approach for Indigenous populations. In addition, the technical project coordination unit 
in the Ministry of Labor, as well as Bank staff, would monitor implementation of the 
requirements of the IPPF during Project implementation through the regular missions.  
 
Finally, and given the nature of the Project, no negative impacts are expected. However, 
it is possible that some groups or communities may have concerns about the 
implementation process, particularly regarding access difficulties to services. In order to 
prevent and solve possible conflicts appropriately, the standard complaints resolution 
channels of the Ministry of Labor would be used. These channels operate through the 
provincial offices of the Secretariat of Employment (Offices of Employment and 
Professional Training).

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders for the IPPS are the Indigenous Participation Council (IPC) of INAI 
(National Institute of Indigenous Affairs) the Indigenous Provincial Institutes and 
indigenous communities across the country.  
 
The Ministry of Labor presented the Lifelong Learning Project, including all services to 
be provided under Seguro, to the members of the IPC, and to the communities of 
Amaicha del Valle and Quilmes in the province of Tucuman in order to provide 
information on its activities, promote participation of indigenous communities in its 
implementation, and to receive suggestions. During Project implementation, the 
consultations and collaboration between the Ministry of Labor, INAI and IPC will 
continue with the aim of improving the efficiency and cultural appropriateness of the 
specific activities of the Project in order to increase the levels of schooling and skills 
within Indigenous communities.  
 
Seguro was discussed in meetings with IPC and with Diaguita, Calchaqui and Lules 
communities in Tucuman, as well with Toba and Mocovis communities in Chaco, when 
LLL was presented to them. During these meetings, MTESS provided information on 
Seguroís activities, and promoted the participation of indigenous communitiesin its 
implementation, while receiving suggestions on the IPPF and the program. During 
Project implementation, the consultations and collaboration among the MTESS, INAI, 
the Indigenous Participation Council and Indigenous Provincial Institutes will continue, 
aiming at improving the efficiency and cultural appropriateness of the specific activities 
of the proposed Project.
