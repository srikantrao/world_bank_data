2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to increase agricultural production through 
provision of better services and investment support to rural smallholder farmers in 
selected comunas and municipios of targeted Provinces, including Bi√©, Huambo and 
Malanje.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is financed by a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), comprising IDA Credit 
US$30 million; IFAD credit US$8.2 million on joint co-financing; and US$4 million 
from the Japan PHRD grant for capacity building. The Government contribution would 
be equivalent to US$4 million and the beneficiariesí contribution to US$3 million with an 
implementation period of 6 years.  
 
The project strategy is to enable smallholders in the project area to increase their 
productivity and competitiveness and to benefit from improved access to market by 
Page  2
focusing on the establishment of rural-urban commercial circuits that can generate a self-
sustaining growth. Producing for expanding food markets in cities as well as supplying 
inputs to emerging agro-based manufacturing enterprises will facilitate integration of the 
rural economy in the countryís overall economy. This strategy is in line with the basic 
principles outlined in the food security and rural development section of the Poverty 
Reduction Strategy of the Government of Angola. 
 
The project will focus on: 
 
ÔÇß 
Building and strengthening capacity of the smallholders groups and associations 
to produce and market agricultural products 
 
ÔÇß 
Strengthening government institutional capacity mainly the Agricultural 
Development Institute at Central and local levels to support the smallholder market 
oriented agricultural production; 
 
ÔÇß 
Strengthening capacities of private sector and non-governmental agricultural 
services providers in the project area; 
 
ÔÇß 
Support the rehabilitation of productive infrastructure; and 
 
ÔÇß 
Support the Ministry of Agriculture to establish a credible monitoring an 
evaluation systems. 
 
The key expected outcomes are: 
 
ÔÇß 
Increased agricultural production of participating smallholder farmers as 
compared to the base year; 
 
ÔÇß 
Improved access to markets; and 
 
ÔÇß 
Improved infrastructure and productive assets to rural smallholders. 
 
Project components 
 
The project has three components: (i) capacity building, (ii) agricultural investment 
support; and (iii) project management.  
 
Component 1: Capacity Building (US$11.2 m) 
 
The objective of this component is to strengthen the technical, institutional, managerial 
and marketing skills of 126,000 smallholders and their organizations, as well as of 
government institutions and service providers involved in agricultural production and 
value chains, to more effectively operate in a market-driven environment and to prepare 
for the agricultural investment support opportunities under component two, agricultural 
investment support.  There are three sub-components: 
 
(i) 
Building and strengthening capacities of smallholder groups and their 
organisations. Using a gender-sensitive approach, this includes: (i) capacity building of 
participatory smallholder groups and organizations, including technical, managerial, and 
marketing skills, organizational structure and legal status; (ii) improving smallholders 
agricultural and marketing skills and ability to access better extension services, including 
Page  3
the scaling up of the Farmer Field Schools currently underway in the project area; and 
(iii) functional literacy and numeracy for groups who need it.  
 
(ii) 
Strengthen capacities of relevant government institutions: (i) 
The 
Agricultural Development Institute (ADI) at local and central level will be strengthened 
in a way complementary to PEDR. Each EDA should have 7 full time extension agents, 
transport and other equipment, as well as a budget for operational costs; (ii) 
local 
government (municipios and provincias); and (iii) specific policy and strategy planning 
and formulation units of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and other 
relevant institutions, to develop an appropriate policy framework for agricultural 
intensification and marketing.  
 
As a result of the capacity building activities, it is expected that the ADI extension 
agents and other local service providers will be able to (i) carry out participatory planning 
exercises related to agriculture and marketing, in 800 rural communities of about 100 
families each (80,000 families, or 400,000 beneficiaries); (ii) about 30% of the families in 
these communities will benefit directly from investment sub-projects (24,000 families, or 
120,000 beneficiaries). This component will also include investments in rehabilitation 
and equipment of some of the EDAs.  
 
(iii) 
Strengthen capacities of traders, processors and service providers, including 
support to their establishment, organizational structure and legal status; management and 
business skills; strengthen capacity to work with contracts and simple accounting, create 
networks and professional organizations. Training is aimed specifically at local micro and 
small enterprises, and local NGOs. Priority will be given to small enterprises and NGOs 
already part of professional organizations, and membership will be encouraged. 
 
Component 2: Agricultural Investment Support (US$ 29.4 m)  
 
The objective of this component is to improve the productivity, competitiveness and 
market access of 24,000 smallholders in the project area. This component will provide 
demand-based support, in the form of matching grants, to rural communities and 
smallholders groups, for productive investment sub-projects, prepared with the assistance 
of service providers trained and equipped for the task under component 1.  
 
(i) 
Sub-projects with a high public value and/or use content, for which the matching 
grant ratio will be 90% project contribution and 10% beneficiary contribution (either in 
cash or in kind). These sub-projects can include, for example: small-scale irrigation, 
drinking water, dip-tanks, stores, spot improvement of feeder roads, and sub-projects that 
have a positive impact on the environment, such as reforestation. 
 
(ii) 
Sub-projects that naturally reproduce and can be further distributed, for which the 
matching grant ratio will be 85% project contribution and 15% beneficiary contribution 
(either in cash or in kind), under the condition that the beneficiary group agree to a 
further distribution mechanism under which the whole group or the whole community 
Page  4
will eventually benefit. Examples: livestock (cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, etc.) and seed 
multiplication. 
 
(iii) 
Sub-projects that largely consist of equipment that requires a business-type use 
and management to be sustainable and profitable, for which the matching grant ratio will 
be 85% project contribution and 15% beneficiary contribution (either in cash or in kind), 
under the condition that the beneficiary group has a contractual agreement with one or 
more of its members to use and manage the equipment as a micro-enterprise, providing 
services to the whole group and/or community. These sub-projects include: agricultural 
production equipment, agricultural processing equipment, such as grain and cassava 
mills, oil presses, and agricultural marketing equipment. 
 
Component 3: Project management (US$8.7 m) 
 
The objective of this component is to manage and use resources in accordance with the 
projectís objectives and procedures, and includes two sub-components - management and 
monitoring and evaluation. 
 
Management includes the day to day management of all project activities, including 
technical supervision and coordination, overall project planning, quality oversight, 
procurement, financial management, and monitoring of project activities at national, 
provincial and municipal levels. At the specific request of MINADER, a Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established within MINADER and will be responsible 
for the management of fiduciary issues, in conformity with the standards and 
requirements agreed upon with the World Bank and IFAD and in conformity with the 
Project Appraisal Document (PAD). The PIU will be within the ADI framework and the 
Director General of ADI will be the executive level public manager of the project. The 
PIU will include a Project Coordinator, a financial manager, a procurement specialist and 
an (ADI-staff) accountant, as well as a monitoring and evaluation officer. A national 
level Project Coordination Committee will monitor project progress and make decisions 
in line with the objectives and institutional arrangements defined.  
 
At the specific request of MINADER, three Provincial Project Implementation Units 
(PPIUs) will be established within ADI in Bi√©, Huambo and Malanje, to conductthe 
operational management of the project. Each PPIU will include a Provincial Project 
Coordinator, a financial accountant, a procurement officer and a monitoring and 
evaluation officer, as well as technical assistance from an agronomist and an agribusiness 
specialist. Short term consultants can be recruited according to needs. Three Provincial 
Project Coordination Committees will monitor local project progress and make decisions 
in line with the objectives and institutional arrangements defined.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will target 12 municipalities in the provinces of Bie, Huambo and Malanje. 
The selection has been guided by the following criteria: (i) favorable agro-climatic 
conditions; (ii) significant population density; (iii) market access; (iv) existence of some 
Page  5
supporting infrastructure; and (v) potential synergies with other operations. The number 
of project beneficiaries is estimated at 150,000 smallholders, or about 750,000 people.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
A. 
Summary of Key safeguard issues 
 
1.
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The potential environmental concerns are those associated with the proposed project-
financed investments under Component 2.  The project will finance rehabilitation of 
small-scale irrigation, drinking water, dip-tanks, stores, and spot improvement of feeder 
roads which triggers Bankís Safeguard Policies OP 4.01 and OP4.12. However, given 
their size and nature, they are expected to cause no or very limited environmental 
impacts. 
 
The environmental classification of the proposed project is Category B and as a result, 
an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) were prepared and disclosed in the country and at InfoShop on March 
20, 2007. These documents are designed to: (i) assess the environmental and social 
impacts of expected sub-projects; (ii) outline environmental management procedures and 
provide requisites tools, including a screening process with a sub-project assessment 
forms and guidelines for mitigating impacts; (iii) integrate environmental considerations 
into each phase of the sub-projects cycle; (iv) provide guidelines for the preparation of 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), if needed; and (v) determine the capacity building 
needs. Apart from formal disclose, the content of these documents will be disseminated 
Page  6
in Angola through a series of stakeholder workshops. The frameworks and the screening 
processes will be integrated into the Operational Manual of the project. 
 
The ESMF and RPF have been integrated into the draft Operational Manual, including 
an annex, on social and environmental check list.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project activities are small, and the project does not anticipate any long term or 
irreversible damage caused by these activities. In any case preventive measures are taken 
through the preparation of the framework documents which will screen every sub-project 
on their social and environmental merits to ascertain that any indirect impact will 
appropriately captured and addressed in time.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not Aplicable   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Because of the precise nature and location of subprojects investments will only be 
determined during project implementation, an ESMF and RPF have been prepared to 
address safeguards policy issues as they are identified. Borrower capacity to address 
these issues, specifically at the local level, is weak so both the ESMF, and RPF have 
identified the need for substantial training and capacity building. Adequate funds will be 
provided under the project for training and technical assistance, and studies as required.  
Budget funds are also anticipated to cover preparation and implementation of RAPs, as 
needed.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
During the preparation of ESMF and RPF consultations were limited to central level 
institutions and main stakeholders, and  a larger dissemination program is scheduled 
during implementation with a total budget of US$900,000. 
 
A
communication strategy stressing awareness raising activities about the program and 
possible compensation procedures and entitlements will be carried out through 
preparation and implementation of RAPs in order to promote dialogue and reduce 
misunderstandings and grievances. Communities will be involved in awareness raising 
and training concerning community rights and obligations; how to obtain legal advice and 
representation, and how to seek redress against what they could regard as unfair process. 
Training of technical staff and the Ministry of Agriculture, municipality and comunas is 
also planned and will minimize negative impact of conflicts.
