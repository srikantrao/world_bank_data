2. Project Objectives 
The proposed project development objectives (PDO) are to improve the coverage, 
quality, efficiency, and financial sustainability of water and sanitation services in selected 
urban and rural communities. Achievement of the PDOs will be measured through 
specific key indicators including: (i) the number of hours of water service; the share of 
households connected to a piped water and sewerage network (for improving the 
coverage of water and sanitation services in urban communities): (ii) the share of water 
supply samples meeting Moldovan water quality standards (for improving the quality of 
water and sanitation services in urban communities); (iii) the non-revenue water (NRW) 
(for improving the efficiency of water and sanitation services in urban communities); (iv) 
the ratio of cash operating costs (without depreciation)/cash operating revenue (for 
improving the financial sustainability of water and sanitation services in urban 
communities); and (v) the number of rural water supplies that have been rehabilitated; 
training days provided to staff in Apele Moldovei and Apa Canal (for improving the 
environmental sustainability of water and sanitation services in urban communities).

3. Project Description 
Component 1 Water and wastewater management in selected Apa Canals (US $ 8.0 
million) would help improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and sustainability of water 
and sanitation services in selected urban municipalities (Apa Canals). Tentatively, the 
Apa Canals in Balti, Cahul, Cau≈üeni, Floresti, Orhei, Soroca, and Ungheni have been 
identified as suitable sub-project towns for selected water and sanitation rehabilitation 
investments. The component would finance: (i) the installation of water pipe that was 
procured by the Apa Canals in Balti, Cahul, and Cau≈üeni under the Pilot Water Supply 
and Sanitation Project (PWSSP); (ii) the rehabilitation of a water treatment plant in Cahul 
and of water supply networks and pumping stations in Floresti, Soroca, and Ungheni; and 
(iii) the procurement of construction machines and trucks.  
 
Component 2 Rehabilitation of rural water supply systems in selected villages (US$ 4.0 
million) would aim at rehabilitating water supply services in selected rural communities 
including the rehabilitation of the water systems in up to 50 rural communities. This 
component would finance: (i) the rehabilitation of the existing deep wells and piped 
water systems in 50 villages, identified as priority villages within the Government 2007 
water and wastewater strategy. The majority of these villages were affected by the 
2006/07 drought in Moldova. The component aims to provide safe water to each village 
school, health center or administrative center, and to those villagers who are willing to 
pay to connect to the piped system. Furthermore, it will finance an education campaign 
including selected programs on health and sanitary education in the 50 villages that 
intend to educate the population on safe water consumption habits.  
 
Component 3 Capacity building and project management (US$ 1.0 million) would 
enhance the capacity within Apele Moldovei to prepare, appraise, and supervise the 
implementation of water supply and sanitation projects. The component will finance: (i) 
Equipment, services and incremental operating cost to enhance the capacity of Apele 
Moldovei to select, appraise, and supervise water supply and wastewater investment 
programs; (ii) activities to increase the level of external financing to the sector; (iii) 
project management in relation to the enhanced capacity of Apele Moldovei to manage 
externally financed projects, and (iv) training programs aimed at the staff of Apele 
Moldovei.  
 
Component 4 Energy Efficiency Program (US$ 1.0 million) would help to demonstrate 
and disseminate through energy audits, workshops, and sharply targeted investments the 
potential for increasing energy efficiency in municipal water and wastewater operations 
with a view of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from the sector. The component 
will finance goods and services to increase energy efficiency in urban water and 
wastewater systems.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Investments financed by the proposed project under Component 1 will rehabilitate and 
upgrade existing water supply networks and wastewater systems in seven selected towns 
(Balti, Cahul, Cau≈üeni, Floresti, Orhei, Soroca, and Ungheni)throughout Moldova. 
Page  3
These towns were considered the most important ones in the country in relation with 
institutional, socio-economic, financial and technical aspects according to a Feasibility 
Study (FS) prepared by the Client in September 2007. Also, the project will finance under 
Component 2 the rehabilitation of the existing deep wells and piped water systems in 50 
villages, identified as priority villages within the Government 2007 water and wastewater 
strategy.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
In accordance with the World Bankís safeguard policies and procedures, including 
OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, the project has been classified as a Category B 
for environmental assessment purposes given that it will finance only rehabilitation of 
existing water and wastewater infrastructure. An EA report including an EMP has been 
prepared by the Agency ìApele Moldoveiî to analyze the potential adverse 
environmental issues related to the proposed infrastructure investments and to ensure that 
these aspects are mitigated during the project design. Furthermore, a separate EMP 
document was prepared specifically for the water supply rehabilitation investments in 
selected villages (Component 2).  
 
No major impacts on physical cultural resources are expected during the project 
implementation, yet attention should be paid to the possibility of built PCR (e.g., 
churches) being affected by dust and vibration during construction.  
 
The involuntary resettlement safeguard OP/BP 4.12 is not triggered: (a) there will be no 
land acquisition for the works under the project as these will all take place on public 
property; and (b) extension of water and wastewater networks financed under the project 
Page  4
will be built on public property, where there are no squatters occupying all or part of the 
land. Therefore, there will be no compulsory land acquisition under the project.  
 
Although the project areas are on two international waterways, the Nistru and Prut 
Rivers, the investments proposed under the project are only for rehabilitation and 
improvement of existing water supply and wastewater schemes, which are not expected 
to change the volume of extraction/discharge water or quality of water of these rivers. 
Therefore, given the rehabilitation nature of the activities under the project, the team 
considers that no notification to other riparian states is required under the Bank policy. 
However, the OP/BP 7.50 policy applies to this project and falls within the exemption to 
the notification requirement under paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy. The team has prepared 
and requested such exemption in a memo addressed to the ECA VP.  
 
It is important to note that none of the water supply sources in this project will be from 
dams or reservoirs. The deep wells proposed for rehabilitation investments under the 
project Component 2 are providing water from a local shallow aquifer. Therefore, this 
project investments do not trigger the OP/BP 4.37 on Safety of Dams.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The EA identified a number of minor negative environmental impacts such as 
infrastructure construction related effects (dust pollution, noise and vibrations, waste 
management), impacts of accidental pollutant discharge on water/groundwater, soil and 
air quality, and possible temporary effects to local vegetation (trees), landscape and 
cultural properties. However, these impacts are temporary and may be effectively 
prevented or reduced through application of appropriate protective actions, mitigation 
measures and monitoring activities.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The proposed project activities are in line with the short-term investment priorities in the 
water supply and sanitation sector launched by the Government during 2007-2009. 
Therefore, these rehabilitation infrustructure investments include the most urgent 
activities propsed in the selected 7 mid-towns and 50 rural communities throughout 
Moldova. The medium- and long-term investment priorities planned by the Government 
(which are not financed by thie project) include, among other activities, the construction 
of new wastewater treatment plants and the affiliated sewerage networks in selected 
towns, construction of new water supply networks for better coverage to the entire rural 
population, and rehabilitation of all water supply network pumping stations and sewerage 
networks in the country.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Environmental Assessment (EA) including EMP prepared by the Government of 
Moldova confirmed the environmental category ìBî designation for the proposed project. 
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared by Apele Moldovei to ensure 
Page  5
that mitigation and monitoring activities protect the population and environment from 
key risks related to rehabilitation works such as noise, soil erosion on steep slopes, 
protection of waterways. The EMP also includes a check on potential impacts on Physical 
Cultural Resources.  
 
The project implementation agency is Apele Moldovei that will be strongly supported 
by PIU staff initially responsible for implementing the Pilot Water Supply and Sanitation 
Project (PWSSP) and the Moldova Environmental Infrastructure Project. Therefore, this 
PIU staff has experience in implementing World Bank financed projects including 
addressing and monitoring safeguard aspects related to the proposed project. This PIU 
staff has been legally transferred to Apele Moldovei (AM) in December 2007 and is now 
physically located in the Agency's offices.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Public consultations on the drafts EIA and EMPs related to project component 1 were 
held in selected municipalities during February 1-13, 2008. The draft project EA 
including specific EMPs was publicly disclosed timely in the mass media sources such as 
the municipalitiesí web sites and local newspapers. Minutes of these public meetings and 
a
list of participants are included in the final reports before their final disclosure in 
country and at the Bankís Infoshop. Public meetings to discuss the EMP document 
prepared for investments financed under the project component 2 took place with 
interested parties from the North, South and Central regions of Moldova on February 28, 
2008. Any comments discussed during these meetings were  incorporated in the final 
EMP and sent officially to the Bank for final disclosure at the Infoshop.
