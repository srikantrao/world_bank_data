                               The restructured UPSPEP remains with two components. The first one supports the
                               implementation of the government’s public service reform program (PSRP) through a
                               sector-wide approach program (SWAp)and remains unchanged. The second component
                               will support the establishment of a Civil Service College, and the development of
                               strategic capacity in targeted areas to support better service delivery and economic
                               growth.The targeted areas include training and research in agro and other processing to
                               help boost industrialization, and closing gaps in leadership and management skills.
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
This is a national project to be implemented by the Ministry of Public Service.The
National Records and Archives Centre will be constructed in Kampala. The site for this
National Records and Archives Centre has been identified, and a site specific
Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA), and an Abbreviated Resettlement plan
(ARAP)were prepared and disclosed both in Country and in the World Bank.

 The revised Component 2, includes the refurbishment and upgrading of an existing
facility into establish a Civil Service College. The refurbishment and upgrading of an
existing facility is envisaged to have minimal potential impacts. The specific existing
facility to be refurbished is yet to be decided, and when known, the same impacts like
those identified for the Records and Archives Centre apply for the refurbishment and
upgrading of the Civil Service Centre. This refers mainly to impacts during the
construction, and operational phases, and the Environmental Monitoring Plan.The
Government has communicated to the World Bank confirming this commitment.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The construction of a National Records and Archives Centre will lead to minor road
diversions, noise and dust pollution and this is be mitigated by measures described in the
site specific EIA which was prepared by Government and approved by the National
Environmental Managament Authority. In addition seven (7)families will be affected and
have to be moved from the site needed for the Archives Centre and as such, an
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) was prepared and approved by the
Ministry of Public Service. Both the EIA and the ARAP were disclosed in the country on
April 3,2006, and at the World Bank ’s Infoshop in Washington D.C. on October 25,
2006, respectively.
  Further, the refurbishing and upgrading of an existing facility to establish a Civil
Service College will not cause major disruptions to the environment and does not trigger
land acquistion as the existing facility is on Government of Uganda land held in trust by
the Uganda Land Commission. The same impacts like those identified for the Records
and Archives Centre apply for the refurbishment and upgrading of the Civil Service
Centre. This refers mainly to impacts during the construction, and operational phases, and
the Environmental Monitoring Plan.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
N/A.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
To support the construction of a National Record and Archives centre under the project
the Government has through the Ministry of Public Service developed the site specific
Environmental Impact Assesment(EIA)with very clear mitigation measures.The site
specific EIA has been reviewed and approved by the Borrower. Similarly the
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared,reviewed and approved by the
Borrower. This proces has helped build basic knowledge about the safeguards
instruments.
 The borrower has taken the initiative to further disseminate both the EIA and ARAP to
all regulatory agencies in the City of Kampala where construction is to take place to
ensure appreciation and monitoring of mitigation measures proposed.The Ministry of
Public Service will provide one staff to follow up the implementation of both the EMPs
and ARAP with the construction firm, and will seek support from NEMA for monitoring
compliance during the implementation period. The EIA and ARAP have also been
recieved and disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders include Ministry of Public Service and the members of the seven
households.
 The affected families under the 7 households have been consulted prior to the
preparation of the ARAP and duly informed of proposed activities as well as the
measures to be taken to minimize the potential negative impacts. A joint Mission by the
Bank’s project team and the Borrower carried out the consultation in accordance with the
policy requirements. A provision has been made within the ARAP to allow for the
affected 7 households to seek redress to the Uganda law where grievances arise.Other key
stakeholders include the Government of Uganda, which through NEMA has approved the
site specific EIA and the ARAP.
