B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The Project would build the capacity for participatory, integrated, basin-scale WRM by 
strengthening institutions at the central level and in three pilot river basins   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed lending instrument is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$ 10 million over a 
five-year period.  The overall project cost is estimated at US$ 25 million, including parallel 
financing with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for US$ 1.5 million.  
 
Component 1.  Strengthening WRM capacity at the national level (total cost US$ 4.5 million, 
IBRD loan US$ 1.5 million)  
 
This component aims at improving the institutional capacity at the central level to 
facilitate/support integrated, participatory WRM at the basin level.  It will include five 
subcomponents:  
Page  2
Sub-component 1.1.  Capacity building of the newly created ANA at the central level in order 
to make it operational.  
 
Sub-component 1.2.  The Project will finance the formulation of a strategy for financing WRM 
at the national and river basin levels, including regulatory instruments as necessary, to ensure 
adequate financing for WRM.  This strategy will recognize the need for increased budget 
allocation from national and, possibly regional governments, and for increased contribution from 
users and polluters.  It will also grant some degree of financial autonomy to the river basin 
organizations.  
 
Sub-component 1.3.  The Project will finance the design, setting-up and early operation of a 
National water information system integrating data and information generated from ANA, 
DIGESA and SENAMHI.  This will improve significantly access by water professionals, policy 
makers and the general public to adequate and reliable water information.  
 
Sub-component 1.4.  National Water Quality Management Strategy.  The Project would support 
the formulation of a national strategy for water quality management including water monitoring, 
discharge control and enforcement, based on a thorough diagnostic of water quality situation and 
management.  The strategy will include a national program for improvement of water quality.  
 
Sub-
component 1.5.  “Cultura de Agua” Program.   The Project would support ANA in the 
design and launch of a “Cultura de Agua” program aimed at raising awareness of the policy 
makers and the general public on the need and ways to better manage water resources.  It would 
also support the capacity building of water professionals and decision-makers in WRM, in 
particular those directly involved in the implementation and/or monitoring of the Project 
activities at the river basin level supported under component 2, including officials from ANA 
and its “deconcentrated” offices, regional governments, SENAMHI and DIGESA.  
 
Component 2.  Improving WRM in selected River Basins (Total cost: US$ 19.0 million, IBRD 
loan: US$ 8.0 million)  
 
Sub-component 2.1.  Implementation of participatory, IWRM in three pilot river basins  
 
The Project would support the capacity building and early operation of the local ANA office, 
Multi-sectoral Basin Committees (MBC) and DESAs.  This will include: (a) the design of the 
institutional organization and functions of the local ANA and MBC in each river basin, including 
the coordination and accountability mechanisms between these entities and other stakeholders; 
(b) the development of operational management instruments for local ANA; (c) technical 
assistance and training for MBCs, local ANA and DESAs; and (d) incremental operational costs 
of local ANA, MBCs and DESAs.  
 
A
key activity will be the definition of the financing mechanisms (in line with the strategy 
developed in sub-component 1.2) detailing how water users and polluters and central, regional 
and local governments would participate in the financing of WRM in each of the three pilot 
basins.  
 
In addition, the Project would finance the development/strengthening of key WRM instruments, 
including: (a) the formulation of a detailed participatory, integrated WRM plans for each of the 
pilot river basin; (c) bulk water distribution models and decision aid tools for flood (including 
alert systems) and drought management and adaptation to climate change, including hydrological 
and hydrologeological models and scenario simulation models and (d) plan for the operation and 
maintenance of major hydraulic infrastructure, including dam safety procedures.  
Page  3
The Project would finance the improvements of the meteorological and hydrological 
monitoring system through: (a) design of the improved meteorological and hydrological 
networks; (b) rehabilitation, improvement and installation of automatic and conventional 
meteorological and hydrological stations; and (c) improvement of the calibration equipment and 
structures of the hydraulic laboratory.  
 
It will also support the improvement to water user rights administration through the 
development of procedures and their implementation in the three river basins for: (a) the 
completion of formalization of agricultural water rights, (b) the formalization of non-agricultural 
water rights and (c) monitoring of users compliance and enforcing the terms and condition of 
water rights entitlement.  
 
The Project would support the design and implementation of surface and groundwater quality 
monitoring and discharge control programs in the three pilot basins.  
 
In addition, the Project will support the implementation of the “Cultura de agua” program in the 
pilot river basins.  
 
Finally, the Project would finance small civil works, as defined in the IWRM plans, which may 
include upper watershed protection to control erosion and river embankment protection.  
 
Sub-component 2.2.  Sensitization to the creation of multi-sectoral basin councils in 8 River 
Basins and validation of IWRM plans  
 
The Project will prepare the groundwork in 8 river basins for the creation of MBCs as a locus 
for participation and consensus building among all stakeholders in the water sector around an 
IWRM plan for their river basin.  This will be done through the discussion of preliminary 
diagnostics and water management plans , which will be improved and validated.  
 
Component 3.  Project implementation (total cost: US$ 1.5 million, IBRD: US$ 0.5 million)  
 
This component would support Project implementation, including monitoring and evaluation 
activities.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The WRM capacity building Component 1 will benefit the entire country, which faces increasing 
water shortages (especially in the coastal area) in dry season and frequent floods and droughts.  
Some 53 rivers, flowing west from the Andes to the coast supply the bulk of the water used in 
the coastal area.  Of these rivers, more than half carry only seasonal flow.  The Peruvian 
piedmont and coastline are prone to devastating floods and mud-floods mainly due to the high 
precipitation on degraded upper basins; while the Southern part of the country is particularly 
prone to droughts.  Aside from natural causes, such as the El NiÃ±o occurring roughly every 
seven years, the effects of droughts and floods have been exacerbated by man-made 
interventions, including soil erosion stemming from poor cropping and grazing practices, 
deforestation and poor land use practices.  Preventive laws and measures (related to zoning, 
deforestation, etc.) are not enforced and there is no reliable early warning system network.  The 
consequence is increasing negative impacts from droughts and floods in the different regions 
with an increasing impact on the Peruvian economy. In addition, water quality is deteriorating 
due to the release of untreated effluents from mining, industries, municipalities and agriculture.  
Moreover, water use efficiency is low, particularly in the agricultural sector which accounts for 
about 80% of freshwater withdrawals.

Component 2 (Improving WRM in selected River Basins) will primarily work in three river 
basins, where the Project will pilot the implementation of an integrated, participatory, water 
resources management (IWRM) approach.  Two of the three basins have already been identified 
(Chancay-Lambayeque and Chili), based on the following criteria: (a) important water issues 
requiring IWRM (such as water conflicts, water quality issues, over-exploitation of 
groundwater), (b) existence of a basic organization for IWRM and (c) water users’ ability to pay 
water user fees (la retribuciÃ³n econÃ³mica).  The third basin will be identified during the first 
year of Project implementation.  In addition, the Project will prepare the groundwork for basin-
scale participatory, IWRM in 7 other basins.  These river basins were selected for their socio-
economic importance and the intensity of the water conflicts that afflict them.  The seven basins 
are located in the Pacific Basin where most socio-economic activities are located and where most 
people live.  They represent a population of about 8 million people, or about 30 per cent of the 
national population.  
 
The project is expected to have substantial social benefits and no adverse social impacts.  
Specific benefits include:  (a) a decrease in water conflicts arising from competition over the use 
of an increasingly scarce resource and between polluters and water users; (b) a more equitable 
and transparent decision making process over WRM; (c) increased participation of all water 
stakeholders in the management of the resources.  
 
Participation.  The Project will support integrated WRM at the river basin involving the 
participation of all water stakeholders, including public sector organizations, local and regional 
governments, water users and the private sector in the formulation and implementation of river 
basin integrated WRM plans.  Participation aims at building long-term ownership of IWRM and 
solve water conflicts.  To ensure participation, the Project will create/strengthen multisectoral 
basin committees in each pilot river basin.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The National Water Authority (Autoridad Nacional de Agua-ANA), the Project executing 
agency, was created on March 13, 2008 from the former Intendencia de Recursos HÃ­dricos 
(IRH) which was part of INRENA.  ANA is a public agency reporting to the Ministry of 
Agriculture (MINAG).  ANA institutional capacity for Safeguard policies will be strengthened to 
meet the Project’s requirements. This will involved the hiring of adequate staff or consultant and 
training.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
The project has been classified as "category B" because despite overall anticipated positive or 
neutral impacts, some small-scale physical investments in pilot river basins under sub-
component 2.1. could potentially have adverse environmental impacts.  Those small-scale 
physical investments concerns: (a) the installation or rehabilitation of
water monitoring

equipment and (b) would finance small works, as defined in the IWRM plans, such as upper 
watershed protection to control erosion and river embankment protection.  
 
Given that the specific location and nature of potential small works to be financed under 
Sub-component 2.1 has not yet been determined (these will be decided by stakeholders during 
the process of formulating integrated, basin-scale WRM plans, supported under Subcomponent 
2.1), specific environmental impacts, location and magnitude cannot be ascertained.  Therefore, 
an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) will be prepared as part of the environmental 
assessment (EA) during Project preparation to ensure that small works are subjected to an 
adequate EA process, that they do not create any serious adverse impact on the local 
environment, and that appropriate mitigation measures are included in the designs and 
cumulative impacts are duly taken into account.  In addition, the EA will include screening 
procedures and TORs for Strategic Environmental and Social Assessments to be mainstreamed 
into the formulation process of future new Integrated WRM plans (or improvement of existing 
WRM plans).   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)

Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
The safeguard is triggered because: (a) while neither Chancay-Lambayeque basin nor the 
Chili Basin is expected to have Indigenous Peoples, the third, unidentified basin might and (b) 
the project is developing approaches/procedures to participatory, basin-scale IWRM that should 
eventually be replicated in other basins.  The Terms of Reference for the Strategic 
Environmental and Social Assessment (SESA) that will be prepared during Project preparation 
will describe how Indigenous Peoples Safeguards considerations will be mainstreamed into the 
formulation process of the participatory, IWRM plans.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
 X  
The safeguard is not triggered because a screening mechanism will be put in place as part of 
the EMF to exclude any small works envisioned in component 2.1 that could cause involuntary 
physical displacement or any land-related loss of assets or livelihoods.
