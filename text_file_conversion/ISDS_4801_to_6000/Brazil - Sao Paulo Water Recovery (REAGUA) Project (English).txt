2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to increase clean water availability in the State of 
S√£o Pauloís critical watersheds. The specific objectives are:  
 
(i) Increase the quantity of water by controlling and reducing water losses, promoting 
the rational use of water, and reusing wastewater.  
 
(ii) Enhance the quality of water by connecting additional (and mostly poor) households 
to existing and new sewerage networks as well as building new and optimizing existing 
wastewater treatment plants.  
 
(iii) Develop institutional and technical capabilities by improving the State of S√£o 
Pauloís WSS legal, institutional, and regulatory framework and by supporting the project 
beneficiaries (WSS service providers) in the design, operation, and maintenance of the 
programs and facilities.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project has been designed to respond to the water scarcity challenges in the State of 
S√£o Paulo from several angles, therefore was divided in three main components. The 
State Secretary for Water, Sanitation, and Energy (SSE) will be the key institution 
responsible for the preparation and implementation of the project. The project will apply 
Page  2
a
results-based financing mechanism to achieve its objective. Project funds will be 
disbursed to incumbent service providers (state-owned or municipal) against agreed and 
verified outputs. The results-based scheme will explicitly link the cost of each output 
through reference unit costs to the amount of financing that the project will provide. 
Therefore, the outputs will be tangible and measurable, and their financing will be 
methodologically linked to their cost structure.  
 
Component One: Increase Water Availability. This component will finance activities 
aimed at increasing the quantity of available water in the targeted watersheds by 
controlling and reducing real water losses, promoting the rational use of water in public 
schools and reusing treated wastewater. It will be 100 percent financed using a results-
based financing mechanism, with payments to the service providers tied to the 
achievement of clearly specified outputs during a period long enough to ensure 
sustainable results. This component would consist of three subcomponents: (i) control 
and reduction of real water losses; (ii) rational use of water; and (iii) reuse of treated 
wastewater.  
 
Component Two: Enhance Water Quality. This component will finance activities aimed 
at improving the quality of water in the targeted watersheds by building new sewerage 
connections to new or existing networks, installing pipes and pumps to transport sewage 
to new or existing wastewater treatment plants and constructing new or upgrading 
existing wastewater treatment plant. It will be 100 percent financed using a results-based 
financing mechanism, with payments to the service providers tied to the achievement of 
clearly specified outputs during a period long enough to ensure sustainable results. This 
component would consist of two subcomponents: (i) sewage collection and transport 
networks; and (ii) upgrading existing and constructing new wastewater treatment plants.  
 
Component Three: Develop Institutional and Technical Capabilities. This component 
will finance activities aimed at increasing the efficiency of S√£o Pauloís WSSsector by 
enhancing and consolidating its institutional, legal and regulatory framework and 
strengthening of its technical expertise. This component will be the only one that will be 
input-based financed. Specific activities include: (i) establishment of a complementary 
and more detailed WSS information system in the State to be used by ARSEP to develop 
additional and more precise performance indicators to better inform and monitor WSS 
providers, by the state government to better define policy and planning, and by the WSS 
providers to improve their service; (ii) technical assistance to SSE, ARSESP, local 
governments, and service providers to speed up their compliance with the new federal 
and state laws; and (iii) technical assistance, capacity building, and training to service 
providers in the design, operation, and maintenance of programs and facilities associated 
with the implementation of components one and two, including institutional restructuring, 
corporate governance, and project preparation. This component will also include 
financing for project management, supervision and audit costs, including the hiring of 
consulting firms to assist the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the management of the 
project, the verification of outputs and the carrying out of impact evaluation studies.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will prioritize interventions in areas of extreme water scarcity. According to 
the State Council for Water Resources definition of water scarcity (a situation where the 
demand/availability ratio exceeds 50 percent), eleven of Sao Pauloís twenty-two 
watersheds are in critical condition. However, given the limitation of resources available 
to tackle the enormity of the problem, interventions will focus solely on the five most 
critical watersheds, as defined by a demand/availability ratio of 80 percent. These 
watersheds are: Piracicaba/Capivari/Jundia√≠; Alto Tiet√™; Sapuca√≠ Mirim/Grande; 
Mogi Gua√ßu; and Sorocaba/M√©dio Tiet√™. In addition, given that the poor suffer the 
most from water scarcity, interventions focused on serving the densely populated poor 
areas will receive priority.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The proposed project has received an Environmental Category B rating in accordance 
with the corresponding safeguard policies. Environmental management mechanisms was 
developed during the project preparation phase to examine the projectís potential 
negative and positive impacts and define measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate 
or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. These 
mechanisms will be submitted for Bank review and approval prior to appraisal.  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01). The project is classified as Category B as it will 
have primarily positive environmental impacts on localized areas of the five critical 
watersheds. In essence, the project is one of environmental recovery and improvement in 
the quality of life for local residents, and its objective is to reduce both quantitative and 
Page  4
qualitative limits on water resources in the targeted watersheds. An overarching 
Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) was developed in coordination with SSE, 
and it will be complemented by environmental assessments of the subprojects selected for 
financing. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) defines the criteria and 
procedures required for subproject design and their corresponding environmental 
analysis, which will take place during implementation. The ESF was submitted for public 
disclosure and consultation before the State Environmental Counsel (CONSEMA) and 
the water basin committees. In addition, the EMP contains specific procedures for 
disclosure and consultation to be adopted by selected subprojects during implementation.  
 
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04). Component 2 of the project, through its focus on sewage 
collection, transport and treatment, will affect Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs) 
which are protected by the Brazilian Forest Code - Federal Law 4.771/65. APPs are 
located along the banks of the watersheds which are targeted by project interventions. 
These contain a number of stretches which have been degraded by irregular urban 
occupation and pollution from inadequate sanitation systems. In addition, the following 
conservation areas are located in the targeted watersheds: (i) sustainable use and 
environmental protection areas, such as national forests and areas of ecological interest; 
and (ii) integral protection areas, including, inter alia, state parks, ecological stations, 
biological reserves and state reserves. Project interventions will take all necessary 
measures to avoid interference with these conservation and protection areas. In the case 
of intervention in protected areas which permit certain types of sustainable use, the 
necessary authorizations will be obtained from the local environmental authorities and 
the procedures undertaken will be evaluated by the EMP.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11). Bank projects that trigger this safeguard include: 
(i) interventions with significant excavation, demolition, movement of land or work in 
flood prone areas; and (ii) interventions located in the vicinity of physical cultural 
resources as recognized by the Bank. Brazil has a well-developed legislative and 
normative framework for management of physical cultural property, which is under the 
oversight of the National Institute for Protection of Historical and Archeological Sites 
(Instituto do Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico, Art√≠stico e Cultural Nacional - IPHAN). In 
accordance with IPHAN and Bank requirements, the State of S√£o Paulo will include 
procedures for screening any known cultural property in the project area and incorporate 
ëchance findí procedures in theevent that culturally significant resources are discovered 
during implementation. Procedures for the identification and protection of physical 
cultural resources will be included in the EMP.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). One of the projectís most important guidelines is 
that there should be no interventions requiring involuntary resettlement. This is a 
criterion of subproject eligibility. However, land acquisition may be required for the 
sewerage pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants, and land acquisition falls 
under the Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard. Thus, in accordance with the resettlement 
policy of the Bank, an Involuntary Resettlement Policy Framework (IRPF) has been 
prepared to guide the resettlement process if this becomes necessary. If this is the case, 
Page  5
SSE will develop a specific resettlement plan following the guidelines of the RPF, and 
will send for Bank approval before the bidding process for corresponding works starts.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Main impacts expected from the project. It is not envisioned that the project will entail 
any significant or irreversible negative impacts on the environment; on the contrary it is 
expected to have a positive environmental impact in the State by: (i) preserving and 
increasing the quantity of water and improving the quality of water in critical watersheds; 
(ii) connecting mostly poor people to existing or new sewage collection and treatment 
systems; and (iii) increasing efficiency in the provision of WSS services. The Call for 
Proposals (CFP) explicitly states that service providers seeking project funds must, as 
part of the screening process, should meet the environmental standards stated in ESF, 
including provisions against the resettlement of populations and against the construction 
of wastewater treatment facilities with the potential to irreversibly threaten the local 
ecosystem. Furthermore, selected investments will only be executed in consolidated 
urban areas, some of which might include improvements to protect river banks located in 
urban areas, and all project financed infrastructure facilities will be small-size 
investments since the size of the loan and the total project cost do not allow building 
larger facilities.  
 
Some other envisioned positive impacts are:  
 
Improvement in the quality of life. The project is expected to have a positive impact on 
the quality of life and the socio-economic indicators of the populations residing around 
these watersheds. As the objective of the project is to increase clean water availability 
and the eligibility criteria favor poor municipalities (as classified by the S√£o Paulo 
Social Vulnerability Index), it is anticipated that the population currently under-served or 
without access to WSS services will greatly benefit from the project in terms of both 
quantity and quality at a reasonable cost. In addition, project interventions increase the 
possibility of attracting further investment and private capital, thus improving the 
competitiveness of these regions.  
 
Improvement in water quality. Inadequate infrastructure means that wastewater is 
regularly discharged directly into the water bodies without any kind of treatment. This 
has led to environmental degradation and has compounded the problem of water scarcity 
in the State. The removal of pollution via sewerage networks with adequate levels of 
treatment and the incentives to reuse this treated wastewater where potable water is not 
needed are crucial elements of a strategy to improve water quality in the five prioritized 
critical watersheds. This approach involves, on the one hand, the reduction in costs from 
the application of chemical products, and on the other hand, the increase in the 
availability of water. The end results will be the improvement in the quality of life for the 
population residing within these watersheds, the environmental recovery of the targeted 
watersheds and the sustainable use of water resources.  
 
Page  6
Improvement in infrastructure. Extending household connections to the sewage 
collection and transport network and the wastewater treatment plants will result not only 
in improved water quality in the targeted watersheds but also in improved coverage levels 
for WSS services, especially in the densely populated regions of the State. Moreover, 
greater access to WSS services will contribute to better health, environmental and urban 
development indicators in the region.  
 
Consolidation of regional sustainable development and watershed protection strategies. 
An improvement in water quality associated with an increase in water availability is 
similar to environmental and water resources policies established by national, state and 
regional guidelines. Moreover, the concept of OBA implies an advancement and 
encouragement of sustainable economic, social, environmental and institutional solutions.  
 
Possible negative environmental impacts foreseen during project implementation. It is 
envisioned that the project will contribute to environmental recovery in the targeted 
watersheds and improved quality of life for the resident population. The project itself is a 
set of interventions designed to reduce pre-existing socio-economic impacts and avoid 
exacerbating the problem in these sensitive environments. Regionally, no significant 
negative environmental impacts were identified during preparation. The main negative 
impacts were found at the local level, principally related to temporary periods of 
infrastructure interventions, and these effects can be mitigated with a set of criteria and 
adequate procedures for the design and construction of these works. The EMP will adopt 
standards for the design and environmental assessment of subprojects and these will be 
incorporated in the Environmental Manual for Construction.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
During project preparation, financial and economic evaluations were carried out. The 
economic analysis explored the benefits of savings in costs of water rationing when 
improvement in reliability of water supply is achieved; savings on economic operating 
costs when efficiencies are attained; and saving on costs of on-site wastewater discharge 
systems, when sewerage service is available. And the net incremental costs and benefits 
where determined by constructing ëwithí and ëwithoutí Program scenarios. The ìwithî 
project scenario considered the proposed project and its associated targets. The ìwithoutî 
project scenario considered that services would continue unchanged.  The evaluations 
concluded that the project is feasible with great benefits to the population.  
 
Once the subprojects are selected, specific environmental and social reports and/or 
environmental screening data sheet will be prepared by each subproject and will include a 
comprehensive evaluation of technical alternatives aiming at avoiding or minimizing any 
adverse impacts during subproject implementation. In the case any unforeseen 
involuntary resettlement is needed, the same procedure will be followed as per the 
resettlement framework (IRPF). The terms of reference for the environmental report, the 
environmental screening data sheet and the IRPF are annexes to the Environmental and 
Social Framework.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and an Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP) were prepared, coordinated by the SSE, even though at this stage the selected 
subprojects and environmental actions have not been identified or designed. In addition, a 
comprehensive environmental analysis was undertaken in accordance with Bank 
safeguard policies and federal, state and municipal legal requirements for the selected 
sample of similar activities. These overarching and more preliminary analyses will be 
complemented by the requisite environmental impact studies that are an obligatory 
requirement for applying for environmental licenses, in compliance with the 
environmental legislation of the State of S√£o Paulo; and by specific environmental 
reports and/or environmental screening data sheets to be approved by the Bank.  
 
In addition, a social analysis was undertaken in conjunction with the environmental 
assessment during project preparation. This included assessments of: (i) the socio-
economic characteristics of the population in the five critical watersheds selected for 
project interventions; (ii) the social diversity and institutional structure of the targeted 
population; (iii) an evaluation of the key decision makers; (iv) the procedures for 
disclosure and public consultation; (v) the anticipated benefits and beneficiaries of the 
project; and (vi) the identification of the projectís main social impacts, risks and 
mitigation measures.  
 
An Involuntary Resettlement Policy Framework (IRPF) was also prepared to guide the 
resettlement process if this becomes necessary. Although during the preparation of the 
project, one of the eligibility criteria for subproject selection was the need to avoid 
involuntary resettlement, there exists the possibility that a case of involuntary 
resettlement could arise during project execution, for example a land expropriation or an 
eventual relocation of a family because of the construction of a water pump station or a 
wastewater treatment plant.  
 
The Borrowersí capacity to handle safeguard issues is generally good. The Stateof S√£o 
Paulo is quite capable in terms of social and environmental safeguard issues, as 
demonstrated by considerable experience gained during the Guarapiranga and 
Mananciais projects. SSEís procedures for ensuring good environmental resultsand its 
extensive experience addressing environmental matters are widely acknowledged, as is 
the appropriateness of the environmental legislation and institutional capacity in place. 
As required by the local law, the project activities will also be submitted for review and 
approval by the State environmental authorities. To ensure that the project complies with 
the Bankís environmental and safeguard policies, the SSE defined a minimum set of 
standards required for any investment activity to be financed by the project. SSE has 
already put in place a screening process that identifies and excludes from project 
financing any activity that involves involuntary resettlement or that could result in 
significant and permanent negative impacts on the environment. In addition, this project 
is under consideration to become a pilot under OP 4.00 for the application of country 
systems in the context of OP 4.01, OP 4.04, and OP 4.11.   
 
Page  8
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Besides the SSE and service providers (state or municipal) directly involved in the 
execution of the Program, the social assessment also identified a number of key 
stakeholders that will participate in the Programís implementation, including the water 
basin committees, the State Environmental Counsel, environmental and social NGOs, 
community and other associations.  
 
During project preparation, a number of consultations and discussions were carried out 
with the main stakeholders, namely the water basin committees of the five targeted 
watersheds and the potential eligible service providers. These committees are composed 
of representatives of state and municipal governments, civil society and academia, 
amongst others. The CFP for the pre-qualification and public selection of proposals for 
financing under the project was published on the website of SSE. In addition, SSE made 
several road show presentations about the project before the water basin committees and 
service providers. The Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), which was 
developed in close cooperation with SSE, was subjected to public consultation under the 
guidance of the State Environmental Counsel (Conselho Estadual de Meio Ambiente ñ 
CONSEMA) and with the participation of water basin committees.  
 
There will be specific procedures for disclosure and public consultation of specific 
subprojects, as well as their respective environmental assessments, and these will depend 
on the size of the subproject and the significance of its environmental impacts. The 
reports for obtaining environmental licenses and the environmental reports produced for 
the Bank will be disclosed in accordance with Brazilian legislation and Bank procedures. 
The procedures for disclosure and public consultation are defined in the Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP).
