2. Project Objectives 
The project development objectives remain unchanged: to increase access to 
infrastructure and basic services for residents of Benin’s primary cities (Cotonou, Porto-
Novo, and Parakou) and selected secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa, and Kandi). 
The additional financing would scale up the project impact in terms of the number of 
people gaining access to roads and being protected from periodic flooding.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed Additional Financing would supplement the second and final phase of a 
two-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The first phase of the APL, the First 
Decentralized City Management Project, included three components aiming at the three 
primary cities of Benin (Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou): (A) Municipal 
Management Strengthening, designed to improve management tools and financial 
resources of Benin’s primary cities to enable them to better provide urban services and 
maintain infrastructure; (B) Rehabilitation and Reconstruction of Basic Urban 
Infrastructure, using labor intensive construction techniques to reduce unemployment; 
(C) Community Participation and Integration to promote initiative from and participation 
of communities living in low-income neighborhoods and enhance municipalities’ 
Page  2
capacity for community outreach. The second and final phase of the APL, the Second 
Decentralized City Management Project, has been expanded to include activities for three 
secondary cities (Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa, and Kandi) under the original components 
and has added a fourth component: (D) Solid Waste Management in Porto-Novo.  
 
Additional Financing for Component B: Basic Infrastructure (cost US$35 million)  
 
The Additional Financing will complement the works being carried out in the cities of 
Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou under Component B of the original project. This 
Component comprises 22 kilometers of road works and 4 kilometers of drainage works in 
the six cities under the original project. The additional program contains an additional 8.5 
kilometers of road works and 9.2 kilometers of drainage works in the three primary cities 
(Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou). The proposed Additional Financing would further 
finance minor cost overruns (US$1 million), mainly related to the depreciation of the 
U.S. dollar. Activities to be financed under the Additional Financing are currently 
expected to be completed by December 31, 2010, six months after the closing date of the 
original project.  
 
Component D (Solid Waste Management in Porto-Novo) is not being supported under 
the Additional Financing. Certain triggers for financing major works are stipulated in the 
Credit Agreement for the original project (pertaining to the institutional arrangements for 
solid waste management and adoption of a reliable financing plan and solid waste 
management plan) and are expected to be met by the mid-term review of the original 
project. Review of these triggers and decisions on financing works under Component D 
are not linked to the Additional Financing, which only provides funding for Component 
B.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Second Decentralized City Management Project exclusively covers urban areas: 
Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou (primary cities); and Abomey-Calavi, Lokossa, and 
Kandi (secondary cities). The Additional Financing would cover the three primary cities: 
Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The types of investments included in the Additional Financing are covered by the 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) prepared and disclosed on May 20, 2005, prior to appraisal of the 
original project. For the Additional Financing, because the project disposes of detailed 
information on the investment types, sub-projects characteristics and their locations,  
 
the Borrower has prepared specific sub-project Environmental Impact Assessments/ 
Environmental Management Plans and Resettlement Action Plans which have been 
reviewed along with the feasibility studies of the proposed civil works, approved and 
disclosed in-country and at the World Bank Infoshop prior to appraisal. 
 
Environmental Assessments have been prepared and presented in three separate 
volumes for road and drainage investment for the cities of Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and 
Parakou. 
 
Resettlement Action Plans have been prepared and presented in three separate volumes 
for road and drainage investment for the cities of Cotonou, Porto-Novo, and Parakou.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project is expected to deliver significant social benefits by improving the living and 
environmental conditions of low-income communities in urban area in the form of better 
health conditions, easier access, reduced flooding, and generally a more pleasant living 
space. No long-term environmental and social impacts are anticipated. Public 
consultations with strong local community participation have been taking place during 
project preparation and will continue to take place during implementation.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Overall project supervision is provided by the Inter-ministerial Coordination Committee, 
which includes the Beninese Environmental Agency, an institution strengthened in its 
function by an earlier Bank project. AGETUR, the implementing agency for Component 
B, has extensive experience implementing Bank-funded projects, and by implication 
addressing safeguards-related issues. 
 
The PGUD-2 is the second Bank-funded urban project in the country, and as such there 
are reasonable capacity and experience within the sector and among the various 
stakeholders involved to attend to project environmental and social issues.  In addition, 
an Environmental Specialist has been appointed in AGETUR, the main implementation 
agency, to oversee the implementation of environmental and social impact mitigation 
measures and ensure that the project is in compliance with national and Bank safeguard 
policies.   
 
To increase efficie
ncy in project’s environmental function, he will work in close 
collaboration with: (i) the National Environmental Agency, known as Agence 
BÃ©ninoise pour l’Environnement (ABE), whose capacity has significantly been 
strengthened by an earlier Bank-funded project; (ii) the Resident Engineer, whose team 
includes both en environmental specialist and a social specialist, whose roles are to make 
sure each construction site is assorted with its share of safeguard measures and that these 
measures are indeed implemented; (iii) project procurement department to ensure that 
contractor bidding documents include environmental clauses, which spell out sub-project 
specific environmental and social mitigation measures; and (iv) and the HIV/AIDS and 
other STDs prevention Unit to ensure that proposed activities in that regard are indeed 
implemented.   
 
Even though the original project has been rated satisfactory in terms of social and 
environmental safeguard compliance, the safeguard instruments for the additional 
financing make ample provisions for further institutional capacity strengthening, along 
with important sensitization campaigns targeted at local communities within or in the 
vicinity of construction sites.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Consultation with stakeholder groups was broad-based and all-inclusive. Key 
stakeholders consulted include: AGETUR, ABE, communal organizations, city hall 
personnel in Cotonou, Porto-Novo and Parakou, project affected people (PAP) in the 
project intervention zones and other key actors, such as: local contractors, likely to 
intervene in envisioned activities. 
 
Because the project disposes of detailed information on the investment types, sub-
projects characteristics and their locations, the Borrower prepare specific sub-project 
Environmental Impact Assessments/Environmental Management Plans and Resettlement 
Action Plans, which have reviewed along with the feasibility studies of the proposed civil 
Page  5
worksand approved by ASPEN safeguard specialist on the team.  The safeguard 
instruments have been disclosed in-country and at the World Bank Infoshop prior to 
appraisal of the Additional Financing.   
 
Prior to disclosure in-country and InfoShop, a workshop was held, before the above 
stakeholder groups, to present the draft safeguard instruments. This was designed not 
only to seek their input in the improving the safeguard documents, but also to foster 
ownership on their part during project implementation and beyond. The final draft of the 
report greatly benefited from stakeholders' comments and suggestions.
