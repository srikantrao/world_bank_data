B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed development objective of the project would be to:  
 
“Increase the capacity of the Government to manage protected areas effectively in CÃ´te 
d’Ivoire ” . The Project Global Objective is that Biodiversity trends are reversed in targeted, 
priority areas.  
 
The expected benefits of the project are to: (a) ensure that staff are adequately equipped and 
trained to manage protected areas; (b)  incorporate and pilot community based approaches to 
protected area management thereby improving the effectiveness of parks management; (c) 
improve the financing mechanisms for parks and reserves management in CÃ´te d’Ivoire.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Financing  
 
Page  2
The project is funded with a US$2.54 million GEF grant.  There is the potential for additional 
cofinancing financing, but the actual figures, which have changed several times in the last few 
months, will be finally decided at the donors meeting in CÃ´te d’Ivoire in early February.  
Currently, much of the parallel financing (6.7 million) is from GTZ which has been financing the 
Tai national park since 2004 but which will also continue to finance the L’OIPR and the 
foundation at least till 2009. The EU is providing 2 million over 2 years to fund component 2 and 
has signed a preliminary agreement with the Government.  Until the figures are clearly 
stipulated, with supporting agreements, the components described above are funded solely by 
GEF financing. Additional financing will not change the concept or institutional framework of 
the project but will allow for more project coverage and a better impact.  
 
The project has four main components:  
 
Component 1 (GEF US$650,000): Institutional Strengthening for Protected Area Management 
and Oversight. This component addresses the need to ensure that adequate individual, 
institutional and systemic capacities are in place to manage protected areas at national and 
regional levels.  The GEF funds will be used to fund training and equipment needs of the office 
of parks and reserves. Training will focus on strengthening (i) the scientific and technical 
knowledge base of staff (ii) financial and administrative management and (iii) information and 
communications technology. The GEF funds will also be used to (iv) develop improved skills in 
monitoring, evaluation and effective biodiversity information management. The component will 
also focus on training staff in the development and implementation of stakeholder consultation 
and participation strategies in PA management.  
 
Component 2 (GEF US$ 1.05 million): Improving Management of Selected Protected Areas. 
This project addresses the issue of biodiversity conservation more directly by financing the 
design and implementation of participatory management plans for the PAs. Given the long 
history of conflict that forced communities to use PAs for their survival, it is now clear that new 
models of PA management must be used in order to ensure that communities, who used these 
protected resources during the conflict years, are not alienated but rather form an integral part of 
park and reserve management.  To this end, GEF funding and co-financing funds will support (i) 
flora and fauna studies for 1-2 pilot areas; (ii) the design and implementation of alternative 
management approaches to biodiversity conservation (participatory management plans) and (iii) 
identify and finance feasible sustainable alternative livelihood options (e.g. mushroom rearing, 
bee-keeping, and small scale wood-lots in the pilot implementation area where communities will 
be asked to forego illegal hunting or cultivation within the PAs etc.). Where possible, the funds 
will be given to reputable NGOs already carrying out socio-economic work in the locality to put 
in place these livelihood ventures. The funds will also (iv) support environmental education, 
public awareness and community consultations.  
 
Component 3: (US$ GEF 590,000) Support to Operationalize the Foundation for Parks and 
Reserves. This component addresses the need to mobilize and retain funds for sustainable 
biodiversity management.  The project focuses on supporting an existing private foundation to 
attract and invest financial resources from donors and private companies, essentially to raise 
adequate capitalization funds and guarantee a continuous stream of financial resources 
specifically for PA management.  All project funds will go through the Foundation to be 
Page  3
channelled to the L’OIPR. This will improve the efficiency of funds flow as well as build 
capacity within the Foundation to manage large sums of financing. GEF funds will (i) provide 
the capital funds which will be channelled to the L’OIPR according to specific procedures and 
guidelines; (ii) support training to Foundation staff in financial management, record-keeping, etc. 
Further, it will (iii) support the design of a fund raising strategy and launch of a fundraising 
campaign, allowing the Foundation and its partners to more effectively raise funds to leverage 
matching funds to complement contributions for PA management.  
 
Component 4: (US$ 250,000) Project Management. This component will ensure (i) effective 
project management and (ii) develop a strong M&E system. It will establish a national, regional 
and local PA  monitoring and evaluation system which relies on inputs from the communities, 
regional OIPR staff and national staff to provide reliable information for tracking results, 
drawing lessons and informing decisions. Specifically, GEF and donor funds will support (i) the 
development of biodiversity monitoring tools; (ii) appoint local biodiversity monitors of flagship 
and other species; (iii) appoint an M&E specialist at the level of the OIPR; (iv) install MIS (v) 
train participants on its use.  
 
Institutional Framework  
 
The project is likely to have 2 implementation units.  The L’OIPR which is located in Abidjan, 
which will manage all fudiciary, procurement and project management functions and a technical 
unit, located in the protected area zone. The technical unit, comprising  2-3 technical experts, 
will be responsible for the planning and implementation of component 2.  The technical experts 
will comprise a planner, a natural resource/environment specialist and a community/outreach 
expert.  The technical unit will work with L’OIPR field staff, as well as NGOs workingin the 
area with communities, who will be responsible for the day to day implementation of the 
management and livelihood plans.  
 
During the preparation mission, the team and the Government will propose a definitive 
institutional framework before the end of March and designate a focal point for the project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will take place in CÃ´te d'Ivoire. The target areas are the nationalprotected areas in 
the country. GEF funds will concentrate  Mont Peko National Park and the Mount Nimba Nature 
Reserve. Around the Mount Nimba people are largely yacouba (4  
 
villages estimated at 3,500 people) and around Mount Peko populations are largely guere (20 
villages estimated at about 30,000 people). Other donors under the overall program will finance 
other projects.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Government has sufficient capacity for ensuring that safeguard policies are effected and that 
monitoring occurs to ensure that these policies remain in place throughout the project.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
An environment and social assessment was completed in 2002 for the old PCGAP project 
and this will be updated during preparation. Little environmental damage is foreseen and any 
negative impact would be related to the rehabilitation of protected area infrastructures.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The project seeks to enhance the protection of natural habitat. Still, the issue of modification 
of park limits in cases of agricultural encroachment triggers OPE.04 on Natural Habitat.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
This is triggered because the PCGAP intends to enforce the park laws which do not permit 
hunting and agriculture.  This, in turn, has the potential to negatively affect the populations who 
have carried out these illegal activities in the past.  In the past, involuntary resettlement was 
carried out more or less successfully in Azagny (Bank projects in the 80s).  While the project 
will make an effort not to resettle anyone but rather to reformulate boundaries in cases of 
excessive encroachment, this may occur and thus at the very least, a resettlement framework will 
be done.

An environment and social assessment analysis which the satisfies OP 4.01 requirement 
was completed in 2002 for the old PCGAP project. This assessment is still valid for the 
restructured project because the activities, although greatly reduced, are not different from 
those in the old project. Instead, the environment and social assessment will be updated in 
March, 2008.  The environment and social assessment was prepared on the basis of TORs 
cleared by the bank with assistance from Bank staff and consultants. A first assessment was 
carried out by two national consultants (a sociologist and an ecologist) supervised by an 
international consultant versed in world bank guidelines. In parallel, communities in the 
periphery of the parks were consulted and social assessments were prepared in several parks 
as part of different ongoing projects.  Finally, another international consultant was recruited 
to consolidate all information and early drafts of the ESA into a final ESA.The ESA includes 
the Environmental Management Plan.  
 
The ESA demonstrates that the PCGAP, by strengthening the conservation and management 
of the country's biodiversity,is likely to have an overall positive environmental impact. It 
would improve the training and education of Ivorian in matters concerning biological 
resource management, thereby increasing the public and Government's awareness of 
environmental problems, as well as in-country capacity to manage biological resources.  
 
The EMP was designed by analysis all activities planned in the detailed project log frame 
and checking whether another activity was likely to moderate its environmental risk.  
 
NATURAL HABITATS OP4.04  
 
The issue of modification of park limits has been mitigated upstream by ensuring that the 
new park law provides that no delimitation work can be carried without an environmental 
impact assessment. In addition, any modification of protected area limits will require the 
gazettement of an ecologically equivalent area. These issues are registered  
 
in the EMP.  
 
RESETTLEMENT OP 4.12  
 
A
Process framework was prepared in accordance to OP4.12 on involuntary resettlement 
and disclosed. However, given the elapsed time since this was done, the process framework 
will also be updated during preparation.  
 
To address this issue of agriculture encroachment on national protected area lands, the 
Government has drafted a strategy for management of infiltrated populations. This strategy 
has been used as the basis of the Process framework to be implemented under PCGAP. In 
Mont Peko the 1996 social assessment identified potential problems with agriculture 
encroachment. This has since then been resolve when it was shown that the legal limits were 
different than thought and excluded agriculture areas. As far as the team knows, there is no 
encroachment currently in Mont Peko and Mont Nimba.  
 
Therefore, the Framework process will be used when necessary; most likely when protected 
areas are delineated and unexpected encroachment is identified. If this occurs, two studies 
Page  6
will be triggered (1) a participatory diagnostic, (2) a survey of families, cultivation, income 
etc. to be registered in a database. Following this, a family-by-family process will  
 
be
undertaken to examine all alternatives before preparing a resettlement plan. It will have 
to be gradual and follow the Strategy for management of infiltrated populations. In particular, 
it will have to demonstrate that the cultivators' family income will be maintained throughout 
the  
 
process. Once completed, it will have to be approved by both the National Office for 
Environmental Assessment and by the Bank and the donor that intends to finance its 
implementation.
