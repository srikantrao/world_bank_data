4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Project sites and components  
 
The project will be implemented in 2 areas: in Abidjan, and in the North-west of the 
country, in 4 of the 5 sectors around the ComoÃ© National Park (see Annex 16).  The 
project is therefore expected to cover an area of more than 1 million hectares (the size of 
the park) and will benefit a total number of 200,000 people residing around the park.  
Most of these people will benefit through exposure to environment-related radio 
programs. Communities that live on the park’s fringes will benefit more directly through 
the livelihood programs and specific training geared to ensure their more active 
participation in park management.

During preparation of the Environment and Social Impact Assessment (EA), a formal 
consultation was carried out in the Comoe National Park. In addition,  the communities 
have had extensive discussions with the protected area management authorities, NGOs 
serving as technical assistant and/or consultant sociologists. The information they 
provided was used to for the creation of the new park law, to design the project, and draft 
the EA. The EA has been finalised to reflect the modified project and was disclosed on 
June 22, 2008 in the Infoshop.  
 
This is an update to the earlier disclosed version and incorporates the changes requested 
after the safeguard's teams' review of the draft board package. No substantial changes 
have been made.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
From an environmental and social safeguards point of view, this project is a Category B 
project. This is because the environmental and social impacts are expected to be minimal, 
site-specific and manageable to an accepted level. There are two World Bank safeguards 
policies applicable to the project: Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) and Involuntary 
Resettlement (OP 4.12).  
 
The impacts of the project are: (a) possible impacts from Component 2, which relates to 
the repair/rehabiliation of park roads. The PNGTER is operating a livelihood scheme in 
our project area. The possible impacts are unknown  ex-ante impacts stemming demand 
driven livelihoods. As a result of this, the PNGTER project has prepared an RPF that will 
cover these aspects. However, the PARC-CI's RPF also refers to this possible impact and 
gives mitigation guidelines just in case the PNGTER closes before their project activities 
Page  5
in the project area end and there are outstanding resettlement issues that have not been 
resolved.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Environmental Safeguards:An Environmental Assessment was done for this project. 
Potential minor negative impacts are associated with the road rehabilitation/repair to be 
undertaken by the project.   Possible adverse effects include dust, noise, soil erosion 
along tracks, especially in case of lack of maintenance or poor drainage, destruction of 
plant species in habitats, destruction of vegetation and increased attacks on wildlife by 
vehicle particularly if not accompanied by increased surveillance.  There are some minor 
possible adverse effects associated with signage- including destruction of habitat and soil 
impaction. Other possible project impacts may include but are not limited to: (i) soil 
erosion; (ii) sedimentation of water bodies due to clearing land for construction; (iii) 
improper waste management; (iv) contamination of soil and water bodies.  
 
Social Safeguards: 
Currently, there are no o
bvious resettlement issues in the project’s 
intervention area and therefore a RAP is not needed at this stage.  In addition, civil works 
(roads rehabilitation) will occur only in the parks where there is no human settlement or 
risk to humans.  A Resettlement Process Framework (RPF) has been prepared because 
Bank guidelines indicate that since the fringe communities were, 40 years ago, living in 
the parks, there may still be some outstanding compensation issues.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The impacts are already minimized- there are no populations in the park and the 
roadworks, which takes place in the parks will have a minimal impact on humans. In 
terms of livelihood activities, every effort will be made to avoid displacement of people 
or property. If this is likely to occur, a RAP will be prepared.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The EA identified the major issues and impacts associated with the implementation of the 
PARC-CI project.There are some possible negative impacts associated with roads works 
but no serious social impacts given that the works are being conducted within the park 
and away from community settlements and community lands.  Mitigation measures are 
therefore enforced through contractor performance monitoring with supervision from the 
Office of Parks and Reserves. In order to ensure that the contractor is fully aware and 
prepared for the management of health, safety and environmental aspects of the contract, 
the Contractor will be required to fill out a management plan (MP) for the specific works 
to be executed under his contract.  This should outline possible negative risks, mitigation 
actions, budget and role/responsibility to ensure that measures and followed up and 
tracked. The management plan should be reviewed and approved by the Office of Parks 
and Reserves Director General before work begins. The review should demonstrate that 
the contractor’s management plan covers all identified impacts, and has defined 
appropriate mitigation measures. It should provide:  
Page  6
•
An overview of the MP and impacts related to construction works  
 
•
Relevant Ivorian legislation and WB standards to which the contractor will 
comply including how he will monitor that compliance specifying:  
 
•
Standards against which the monitoring will be set (national and WB)  
 
•
Which parameters and limits will be monitored  
 
•
Frequency of monitoring  
 
•
Internal organization, management and reporting mechanisms put in place for 
this.  
 
The Office of Parks and Reserves has sufficient capacity in terms of the number of staff 
trained in habitat protection, forestry and environment.  They will have general 
knowledge on environmental management and will be able to undertake regular 
monitoring of Contractors. In addition, in the project there is a social specialist and an 
ecologist who are members of the implementation team at the Comoe level. These two 
specialists are charged with following up on all safeguard related issues.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Throughout preparation, both local and international NGOs were consulted and took part 
in project design and in implementation of other projects. These include: Afrique 
Nature,WWF, SOS Forest (Tai), WWF (Comoe), WCF, LOCODEBRU (Comoe), 
Afrique Nature (Mont Sangbe). This level of involvement from NGOs is expected to 
increase with the PPARC-CI implementation.  
 
During preparation of the Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ES), a formal 
consultation was carried out in the Comoe National Park. In addition, with the social 
assessments prepared by other projects, and as part of drafting management plans, the 
communities have had extensive discussions with the protected area management 
authorities, NGOs serving as technical assistant and/or consultant sociologists. The 
ESMF and RPF were disclosed incountry to Government, NGOs and the project team 
during a day long workshop. Disclosure will continue by Government through 
newspapers and putting the document (readily available) in public areas such as libraries.
