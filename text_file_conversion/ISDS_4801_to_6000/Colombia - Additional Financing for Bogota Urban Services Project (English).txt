2. Project Objectives 
The proposed additional loan of US$30 million request
ed by the District of Bogot√° (the 
District) would help finance the costs associated with the scale up of project activities 
related to the expansion of the Bogot√° Urban Services Project (BUSP), Loan No. CO-
7162 in the following areas: (i) Improved Mobility, through studies for the Secretar√≠a 
de Movilidad (SM) to plan and design the upgrading ofthe Integrated Mass Transit 
System (IMTS) for the city, including the first metro line; and (ii) Institutional 
Strengthening through technical assistance for subcomponents linked to strengthening the 
capacity of the Instituto de Desarrollo Urbano (IDU) with activities related to improving 
the road administration system, and support to the Secretar√≠a de Hacienda (SHD) to 
strengthen its technical, operational, and institutional capacity for improved fiscal 
management and cadastral processes.  
 
The proposed expansion of the BUSP is consistent with the existing project 
development objectives to: (i) improve urban livability by increasing access, coverage, 
quality, reliability, and inter-agency coordination in the provision of water, sanitation, 
transport and related basic services, particularly for residents in low-income areas; and 
(ii) improve system sustainability by strengthening the institutional and administrative 
framework for efficient delivery of transport services throughout the city.

3. Project Description 
The requested Additional Financing would support the implementation of additional 
activities to scale up the project, consistent with the Districtís Development Plan. 
Activities to be supported under the Additional Financing do not require a change in the 
project components, and the disbursements will correspond to the original projectís 
Component A: Improved Mobility and Component C: Institutional Development 
classification. The Additional Financing will not support any activities under Component 
B: Urban Upgrading of the original operation.  
 
Component A: Improved Mobility. (US$16.6 million) Activities financed under 
Component A would focus on the expansion and improvement of Bogot√°ís integrated 
urban public transport network with special emphasis on the development of the first line 
of a proposed metro. Specifically, this component would support the following activities: 
(i) social and environmental analysis and assessment for metro construction; (ii) final 
detailed engineering design studies; (iii) structuring of the financial and legal 
arrangements for metro construction and operation, including all technical, financial, and 
legal activities related to the structuring of a Public Private Partnership arrangement for 
metro operation; and (iv) support for the implementation of the integration of public 
transport. The component would also include technical and analytical work to assess 
policy options that link urban transport investments as a driver of orderly urban growth. 
For instance, issues such as investment in housing and land development, and the fiscal 
impact that is made possible from transport investments (e.g. policies for land valuation 
and zoning regulations adjacent to stations) will be addressed (See Annex 2). An IADB 
loan for US$ 10 million is currently under preparation to support the institutional design 
of a unit that will oversee and manage the integrated mass transport system, including the 
proposed metro project.  
 
Component C: Institutional Strengthening. (US$13.4 million) To complement the 
Districtís ambitious plans to improve urban mobility, the operation would 
financestrengthening of the capacity of the District in areas of fiscal management and 
urban planning. Fiscal issues will take on an even more prominent role in Bogot√°ís 
municipal management given the size and complexity of the capital investments being 
contemplated in the area of urban transport. The District and Bank have identified the 
issue of land tax administration, policy, and cadastre management as particularly critical 
to Bogot√°ís medium-term fiscal wellbeing. As such, in addition to consultant services 
and goods related to the broader issues of fiscal management (debt and asset 
management) the operation would include a special focus on helping the District put in 
place a modern and world class spatially-based management model using geographic 
information and transforming the existing cadastre unit into a key management tool. In 
regards to overall fiscal management, the project would finance capacity building of the 
SHD in areas of tax policy, revenue and expenditure management, debt management, and 
urban finance in general. As regards the cadastre, goods and consultant services would be 
procured to (i) undertake a set of urgent short-term activities to support the 2008 land tax 
valuation exercise, including social outreach, consultancies in valuation methodologies, 
and the implementation of a policy reform package to mitigate social consequences of 
Page  3
property tax increases; and (ii) undertake a more medium-term program of reform, 
capacity building, and technical upgrading, including an overall restructuring of the 
business model and institutional design of the cadastre unit, a business process 
reengineering of the updating processes and the development of a true multi-purpose 
cadastre with interoperability with both the property registry and public service providers, 
a
major upgrading of the unitís IT capacity, a broad program of public outreach and 
communication focused on social impacts, and the necessary legal and technical studies 
to support policy reforms and regulatory improvements (See Annex 3).  
 
Additional Financing would also support technical assistance to IDU to improve the 
management of the Districtís road network and continue their diagnostic and assessment 
to determine overall maintenance and rehabilitation costs for years to come. Specifically 
this includes: (i) an inventory of the condition of the road network system to determine 
maintenance and rehabilitation costs; (ii) scaling up of the inventory and assessment of 
Bogot√°ís pedestrian and vehicle bridges to establish their maintenance costs; (iii) a 
study to determine the operational costs of vehicle use in Bogot√° in order to  develop 
new criteria for determiningroad network investment needs; (iv) a monitoring and 
evaluation system to assess project development and impact: and (v) analytical and 
consulting work in several research areas related to road pavement improvement and 
cost-saving alternatives, including pavement alternatives for low-volume transit and local 
roads, pavement material erosion, etc.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
There will be no direct safeguard issues related to the activities financed by the 
Additional Financing, as only studies and technical assistance (TA) activities are 
foreseen. Nonetheless, proper social and environmental management measures have been 
in place under BUSP for project implementation.  
 
Although the BUSP category is B, a full fledge EIA was carried out to minimize 
potential
 environmental risks arising with works to be carried out under the projectís 
Component B: Improved Mobility. As indicated by the EIA and BUSP PAD documents, 
temporal environmental nuisances and risks associated to the construction phase needed 
to be minimized and mitigated, for which Environmental Management Plans had to be in 
place before the bidding process could take place. To that end, EMP were developed and 
implemented following the Environmental Guidelines existing at IDU. These guidelines, 
developed with help from the Bank, and consistent with the Bankís Environmental and 
Social Safeguard Policies, included, inter-alia, a set of policies, actions, and criteria for 
managing construction camps, water and solid waste, emissions, industrial safety and 
occupational health, traffic detours, access to properties, and relation with the 
community. Monitoring and Evaluation Checklists exist for each set of measures to be 
implemented by the constructors, so that payments could be linked to actual EMP 
execution.  
 
From project effectiveness to date, IDU has advanced with respect to the guidelines for 
environmental management of works. Updated versions now better address the 
environmental risks associated to works, differentiating rural from urban impacts, and 
impacts related to both large scale and mid scale type of works. Lessons have been 
learned with respect to economic incentives or penalties to increase compliance (already 
high at or above 80 percent) from constructors. Currently, all EMP measures are checked 
on a daily basis, discussed at weekly committees (involving constructors, supervisors, 
and IDU staff), and reported monthly. The system, although effective, has left some 
constructors with legal space to correct or adopt recommended measures with delays 
(some times up to 30 days), in order to save resources. Although EMP implementation 
and environmental management has proved satisfactory, a potential next phase of work 
under Bank financed projects would probably be the adoption of daily economic penalties 
to promote prompt correction of EMP measures.  
 
Also, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared and disclosed under BUSP. 
82 percent of resettlement activities in Component A: Urban Upgrading have been 
completed (as of April 1, 2008). The resettlement activities in the Mobility Component 
(Avenida Suba) were completed in December, 2004, although monitoring of specific 
cases is still ongoing. Management of social impacts ñ by the CVP inthe Urban 
Upgrading Component and IDU for the Mobility Component - has been satisfactory. 
Management of social impacts, as a result of the studies and engineering designs under 
Page  5
the Additional Financing, will be fully consistent with the Bankís   social safeguard 
policies.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No long term negative impacts are expected. The Additional Financing will finance the 
social and environmental impact assessment studies related to the design of the integrated 
mass transit system for Bogot√°, including the first metro line. Hence, indirect impacts 
will arise from the implementation (construction of Bogot√°ís first metro line) of the 
studies being financed by this project. However,long term impacts are expected to be 
positive, as accessibility and road safety is improved, urban space is enhanced, and 
emissions and exposure to pollutants are diminished.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N.A.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Safeguard policy issues will not arise from the studies and activities financed by the 
Additional Financing. Nonetheless, the Bank safeguard policies will be reflected in the 
TORs for the environmental and social impact assessment studies related to the 
integration of mass transit system and first metro line in Bogot√°.  
 
The borrowerís capacity and experience is adequate for complying with the Bankís 
environmental and social safeguard policies. As a principle, all Environmental 
Management Plans (EMPs) are implemented by the contractors in charge of the civil 
works and all Social Management Plans (SMPs) ñ for example potential resettlement 
action plans‚
 î will be implemented by the borrowerís social (resettlement) teams. 
Bidding documents will have the No Objection from the Bank.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders in the project include those living, working or moving along the bus 
routes, including residents, shop-owners, informal vendors, other merchants, bus users, 
bus operators, and bus drivers. The project studies will require extensive consultations 
with potentially affected people early on. Stakeholders will include, among others, people 
affected by land acquisition, bus owners, private transport associations, local government, 
and central government officials, and public transport users.
