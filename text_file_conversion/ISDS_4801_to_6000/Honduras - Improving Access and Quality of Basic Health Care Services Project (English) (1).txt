B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objectives for the Improving Access and Quality of Basic Health Care Services 
Project are: (i) to expand coverage of the decentralized and traditional health care models, with 
special attention to maternal-infant care, extending services to approximately an additional 
250,000 individuals in the decentralized models and 200,000 individuals in the traditional 
models; (ii) to improve performance outcomes (quality) of basic health services, achieving at 
least 80 percent of the pre-defined performance indicators in more than 70 percent of the 
agreements between the Ministry of Health and the local health centers; and (iii) to strengthen 
the MOHís capacity to monitor, audit, and supervise annually atleast 60 to 80 percent of the 
basic health service agreements in the traditional and alterative models of health care.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Component 1. The expansion of coverage of the decentralized models of basic health care 
services (US $11 million)  
 
This component will finance the implementation of the decentralized models of basic health 
care service managed by local organizations (mancomunidades, individual municipalities, and 
Page  2
the m
ayorís office). To date, the MOH has successfully implemented these models in 52 
municipalities, offering basic health services to about 711,000 individuals. Even though funds 
were allocated in the national budget for most of these models, there remains a financial gap for 
funding of additional models. Due to the increasing demand for these models, this component 
will finance the implementation of these decentralized models in other parts of the country and 
possibly expand existing models to cover approximately an additional 250,000 individuals, 
bringing coverage for the decentralized models to about 1 million individuals (about 23% of the 
rural population in the country). This component will also support the incorporation of the AIN-
C
model as part of the basic health care services package.  
 
If additional financial resources become available, these resources will be used for scaling up 
existing projects, therefore extending coverage of basic health services beyond 1 million 
individuals.  
 
Given that these models seek to empower community members in the management of basic 
health care services, agreements in the past have been done directly (without a bidding process) 
between the MOH and local organizations (mancomunidades, individual municipalities, and the 
mayorís office). The MOH has used disbursement mechanisms that create incentives for 
providers to achieve better results. Further, it has performance agreements that have been based 
on negotiated per capita or other key outcomes such as the number of institutional deliveries and 
pre-identified health targets. This component seeks to expand these types models based on 
similar agreements. The project will support the local community organization to manage health 
care services and the agreement will be based on performance indicators and a negotiated per 
capita. The performance indicators will be used to determine the proportion of per capita 
payments.  
 
To finance this component, the project proposes the disbursement of capitation payments that 
will be transferred on the basis of performance. This financing mechanism has been used 
extensively and its results-oriented characteristic has proven to be effective. Capitation payments 
transferred on the basis of performance indicators builds incentives into the system; promoting 
improvements on the preventative end of health care provision (while a fee for services 
mechanism has been shown to focus more on the treatment end of health care provision). Under 
the proposed method, transfers would be implemented quarterly, and the funds calculated base 
on the number of individuals covered and the level of achievement of performance indicators.  
Each agreement between the MOH and the providers would include a set of 10 performance 
indicators or more, chosen from a list of 25 standard indicators.  100 percent of the capitation 
payment will be transferred when the providers fulfill at least 80% of the performance indicators 
and less of 100 percent of the capitation payment if 80% of the performance indicators are not 
achieved. (see Annex 1).  
 
This component will be implemented in the departamentos of Col√≥n, Santa B√°rbara, 
Ocotepeque, Yoro, El Para√≠so, Olancho and Gracias a Dios, where the Red Solidaria  already 
exists and where there have been no interventions.  
 
Component 2. Improve the quality of the provision of basic health services in the traditional 
models of health care (US $1.8 million)  
Page  3
This component will support the implementation of a series of pilot models that promote the 
best practices from the decentralized models in the existing traditional models. While 
decentralized models seek to establish basic health care services managed by local organizations, 
these pilots will be implemented in districts where traditional models of service delivery already 
exist.  These traditional models are health centers and clinics with MOH personnel and managed 
by the MOH.  
 
The directors and regional directors of existing models of service will establish agreements with 
the MOH to implement a similar model of management of health services employed in the 
decentralized models. These agreements will be financed based on a negotiated per capita cost of 
the health services. However, given that the majority of the resources of the traditional models 
are already financed, this component will only finance the resources necessary to facilitate the 
implementation of key elements of prevention and promotion inherent to the decentralized 
models such as community health workers, training, communication and operational costs.  The 
MOH is also working on implementing a legal reform to include an element of autonomy in the 
agreements that would facilitate the local management of funds, purchases, and contract of 
human resources/services, a key element of the decentralized models.  
 
At the same time, to generate demand for greater quality of health services, each individual will 
be given an identification card that will identify them as part of the community where the 
services are delivered, and to ensure access to these services. The MOH will also work with 
IHSS to establish financial agreements, where IHSS will finance the per capita cost of 
beneficiaries already in the traditional health systems. The project, however, will not work 
directly with IHSS.  
 
The evaluation of these pilot projects will support future improvements of the traditional 
systems of service delivery.  
 
Component 3. Strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Health to monitor, supervise and 
evaluate the provision of health care services in the decentralized models of health care delivery 
(US $2.2 million)  
 
Sub-component 1 (US $1.17 million): This sub-component will finance consultants, training, 
goods (computer equipment, office supplies, printing, etc.), internet service in some regions, 
operational costs, and the upgrade of the already existing information systems necessary for the 
supervision, monitoring, and evaluation of the health service models in Components 1 and 2 and 
the evaluation of the overall project. Existing units within the Ministry of Health and other 
regional offices will execute these activities. Further, the MOH will integrate a system of 
monitoring and evaluation of these activities in both the traditional and decentralized models. 
Specifically it will support the concurrent audits cited in Box 1.  
 
Sub-component 2 (US $1 million): Strengthening the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
individual units that work with the decentralized models of health service delivery. This sub-
component will finance several small civil works for the rehabilitation of rural health centers or 
Page  4
clinics, and will purchase medical equipment necessary for the delivery of basic health services.  
The project will not build new health centers.  
 
Sub-component 3 (US $30,000): Financing the external audits of the project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will be implemented country wide, with an emphasis in departments of Col√≥n, 
Santa B√°rbara, Ocotepeque, Yoro, El Para√≠so, Olancho and Gracias a Dios.   
 
E. 
 Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
During preparation, the MOH has shown commitment for implementing social safeguards 
(OB/OP 4.10) for the proposed project. The GOH counterparts for the elaboration of an 
Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Plan would be the National Program for Ethnic Health 
(PRONAEH) at the MOH with support of the Modernization Dept. and the Planning Office 
(UPEG) within the MOH.  At the moment, PRONAEH is weak an understaffed, but efforts are 
being made on the part of the MOH to bring on board experienced staff that can work as 
counterparts of the proposed project. Moreover, PRONAEH has institutional support of the 
Department of Ethnic Groups at the Secretar√≠a de Gobernaci√≥n y Justicia.
