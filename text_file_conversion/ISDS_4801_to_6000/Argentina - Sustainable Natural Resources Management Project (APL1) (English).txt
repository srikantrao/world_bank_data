2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective of the proposed Sustainable Natural Resources 
Management Project is to improve the sustainable and efficient management of forest 
resources, conserve biodiversity in protected areas and forest landscapes and integrate 
small producers into forestry development and conservation. This it would do by: (i) 
improving the policy and planning frameworks, (ii) strengthening institutional capacity at 
federal and provincial levels, (iii) upgrading park management capacity, infrastructure 
and sustainable development opportunities in and around parks, (iv) improving and 
promoting private forestry information delivery services (v) assisting small and medium-
scale farmers, land owners and producers to adopt sustainable forms of forestry, 
agriculture and agro forestry, (vi) institutionalizing environmental safeguards and 
incorporating best practices, and (vii) by encouraging more private-sector involvement in 
service provision..  
Page  2
The main project beneficiaries will be: (i) rural poor and indigenous communities whose 
livelihoods depend on the natural resource base; (ii) medium- and small-scale producers 
in the forest sector, with limited access to technology needed for improving productivity; 
and (iv) the total supply-chain involved in Argentina's nature-based tourism. In addition, 
the project would aim to bolster the technical capacity and outreach of federal and 
provincial organizations working in natural resource issues to provide technical, policy 
and regulatory leadership within the field of natural resource management.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project will focus on several important ecosystems, including the Monte, Dry and 
Humid Chaco, Patagonian Steppe and Sub-polar Forests, and Upper Parana Atlantic 
Forest, among others, to carryout the multiple objectives of conservation, sustainable use 
of natural resources, and rural development.  
 
The project will achieve its stated development objective through the following three 
components:  
 
Component 1 - Native Forests and Biodiversity (Executing agency:  Secretariat of 
Environment and Sustainable Development [SAyDS] and provincial cooperators) (Total 
Cost US $3.19 million)  
 
The native forest focal area implemented by SAyDS would include a Technical 
Assistance Component for preparation of a future sector loan with an emphasis on native 
forest issues. The structure and mandate of the Native Forests Directorate of SAyDS will 
be reviewed collaboratively with stakeholders, the aim being to identify an appropriate 
role and structure for the institution. Lines of cooperation and collaboration would also be 
worked out with the provinces for native forest management, in order to ensure a 
cohesive and effective working relationship between SAyDS (as a regulatory agency) and 
those of the provinces (as implementers and enforcers). The policy and regulatory 
environment of the provincial offices responsible for forestry would also be critically 
analyzed and, where necessary, adjustments recommended. The preparation studies will 
establish the groundwork for developing a "national forestry program", including 
economic incentive systems, governance issues, and other tools needed to reduce 
deforestation and bring focus and coherency to the country's native forestry program.  
 
Component 2 - Sustainable Plantation Forestry (Executing agency:  Secretariat of 
Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food [SAGPyA] and provincial cooperators) (Total 
Cost US $33.59 million)  
 
The aim of this component would be to (i) establish institutional and policy frameworks 
conducive to sustainable and shared growth in the sector; (ii) raise forestry sector 
productivity through efficient gains in the generation, analysis and transfer of 
strategically important information; and (iii) support the integration of smallholders and 
small producers into the plantation production cycle. The component will work with the 
Secretariat of Agriculture, with primary responsibility for plantation forests. In particular, 
it mainstream environmental considerations into plantation policy and promotion, 
improve overall policy framework at federal and provincial levels; foster closer links 
Page  3
between the federal and provincial forestry administrations, and between them, the 
private sector and civil society; provide support to demand-driven and competitive 
research programs; support the expansion of accredited, private sector forestry extension 
services; facilitate the entry of small producers into the supply chain; and promote best 
practices among all producers. This component is associated to the recently approved 
Biodiversity Conservation in Productive Forestry Landscapes Project funded by the GEF 
(US$7 million) through the IBRD (see below).  
 
Component 3 - Protected Areas and Conservation Corridors (Executing agency: 
National Parks Administration [APN]) (Total Cost US $30.81 million).  
 
This component would have the twin objectives of strengthening APN's capacity to 
manage existing national protected areas and to set the stage for expanding protection to 
the insufficiently protected and highly-threatened Chaco ecosystem. Specifically, it aims 
to strengthen management capacity of eleven priority protected areas and to upgrade 
APN's capacity in Buenos Aires. Infrastructure, training, equipment and incremental 
costs would be financed in the existing parks, along with the renovation and 
modernization of APN's historic building in Buenos Aires.  
 
The specific Chaco regional focus would bring APN together with national, regional, 
and local stakeholders in a process to establish the basis for a biological-sustainable use 
corridor in the Argentine Chaco with potential to link with core areas in the Paraguayan 
and Bolivian Chaco. Through a process that involves participation by regional 
stakeholders, support would include developing the legal and policy basis for land use 
planning within the corridor (at the local and sub-provincial levels) to secure the 
integrity, viability, and long-term conservation of core areas.  
 
The Associated GEF Project  
 
The Sustainable Plantation Forestry component is to be closely coordinated with a 
recently approved GEF project, Biodiversity Conservation in Productive Forestry 
Landscapes, which would focus on mainstreaming biodiversity conservation concepts 
and strategic environmental planning in the main plantation areas of Argentina.  The GEF 
project would aim to mainstream/integrate environmental work into every day 
management practice and cover incremental costs of measures to achieve agreed global 
environmental benefits in the areas of land degradation and biological diversity. It would 
include an awareness campaign, the preparation of manuals of best practice, training, and 
incentives for the adoption of best practice. These might include biodiversity corridors, 
rehabilitation planting of degraded forest with native species, biodiversity mosaics, 
adjusted forest management practice to encourage biodiversity, habitat creation and tree 
planting for conservation swaps.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The primary target areas for the Sustainable Productive Forestry component would 
include the key forestry provinces of Misiones, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Buenos Aires and 
Santa Fe, as well as the provinces of Neuquen, Rio Negro and Chubut. Other provinces 
that may be included based on the project experience during implementation include the 
Page  4
Cuyo-Mendoza region and the northwest (NOA) region. The Native Forests preparation, 
although national in its overall scope, will focus on the Chaco ecosystem given its 
priority among forest ecosystems presently.  The Protected Areas component will focus 
on the provinces where the eleven protected areas are located including; Jujuy, Salta, 
Formosa, Buenos Aires, Tucuman, La Rioja, San Luis, Chubut, and Tierra del Fuego.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
No large-scale adverse impacts are expected given the focus of all components on 
sustainable management of natural resources and conservation. Impacts are expected to 
be overwhelmingly positive or neutral.  Activities and investments supported in the 
protected areas and their rural/urban surroundings are conducive to improved governance 
regarding the use and conservation of natural resources, and are designed to provide 
incentives so that communities may benefit from protection activities as well as 
mainstream biodiversity into the productive landscapes throughout Argentina.  Following 
are details of the components and expected impacts:  
 
Component 1 - Native Forests and Biodiversity Conservation:  Impacts are expected to 
be positive or neutral given the focus on preparing technical, policy, and legal analyses 
that will provide the platform for improved management and incentives for adoption of 
sustainable forestry at national and provincial levels.  The preparation activities will be 
designed to ensure broad stakeholder participation including local and national NGOs, 
provincial governments, producers, rural and indigenous communities, and the academic 
sector.  
 
Page  5
Component 2 - Sustainable Plantation Forestry: Impacts will be positive or neutral from 
an environmental standpoint.  The component seeks increased productivity in the sector 
and reduced environmental impacts of forest planting, rather than expansion of the 
planted area.  Activities to improve efficiency include dissemination of best management 
practices, improved technology to increase productivity, strategic environmental 
assessments to guide planting away from sensitive areas (socially and environmentally), 
as well as production diversification alternatives for small farmer groups that generate 
positive environmental impacts.  Potential limited negative impacts could result from 
developing poor forestry policy and promotion programs as well as from small-producer 
activities (including pest-management issues). However, the basic design of activities 
includes environmental themes and sustainability along with capacity building programs.  
In addition, the project has prepared an Environmental Management Plan specific to this 
component that addresses the need to screen small-farmer activities and prepare strategic 
Environmental Assessments as a tool to guide planting and promotion.  Finally, SAGPyA 
is implementing a GEF-funded project to mainstream biodiversity in to production 
forestry that will also be closely coordinated with the present project component for 
maximum positive impacts to the environment.  
 
Component 3 - Protected Areas and Corridors:   Impacts are also expected to be positive 
as a result of the investments that provide for: (i) improved protection of core areas, (ii) 
improved governance and community participation through updated/inclusive 
management plans, and (iii) increased income-generating opportunities and greater 
community support for conservation through sustainable development projects around the 
protected areas.  Minor negative impacts could result from poorly designed and executed 
infrastructure within the parks, and indirectly from increased tourism or increased 
resource pressure from sustainable development activities.  To avoid these potential 
impacts, an Environmental Management Plan has been prepared to ensure compliance 
with national legislation and APN policies as well as pertinent Bank safeguards. The 
EMP will be included in the project�s operational manual.  
 
The sections below briefly consider each of the safeguard policies that are triggered by 
the project.  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)  
 
No large-scale adverse impacts are expected given the project�s focus on sustainable 
management of natural resources and conservation; impacts are expected to be 
overwhelmingly positive or neutral.  EAs have been prepared for the Protected Areas and 
Plantation Forestry components, while an environmental review was carried out for the 
Native Forests component. These documents were disclosed prior to appraisal.  
 
The EAs for the Protected Areas and Plantation Forestry components will serve to 
develop appropriate mitigation measures for any negative impacts, and to recommend 
enhancement measures for positive impacts, as needed or required. These mitigation and 
enhancement measures will be summarized in Environmental Management Plans (EMP) 
specific to each component that will include screening criteria and environmental 
procedures. The EAs also evaluate whether other environmental safeguards are triggered, 
Page  6
and develop appropriate procedures, when necessary.  Capacity building at national and 
provincial levels will also be part of the Native Forests and Biodiversity Conservation 
and the Sustainable Plantation Forestry components as well as sustainable forestry policy 
and regulatory activities to strengthen environmental assessment capacities and increase 
enforcement.  Participation by local communities in the Protected Areas and 
Conservation Corridors component is also included in the project design to enhance the 
component conservation objectives and the overall project development objective, 
sustainability, and economic impact.  The National Parks Administration (APN) has its 
own regulatory framework regarding environmental assessment and management as well 
as for protection of cultural resources, that serve to reinforce the Bank safeguards.  
 
The Native Forests component is not subject to a specific EA given that it is a 
preparatory component which will advance the participatory mechanisms and technical 
basis for establishing more sustainable forestry policies for the sector. Activities in this 
component also focus on information dissemination, studies on potential for 
environmental services and capacity building, all tending towards sustainability and 
reducing impact from forestry activities.  
 
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04)  
 
The protection of natural habitats is the primary focus of the Protected Areas and 
Conservation Corridors.  All activities under this component seek to increase the 
conservation capacities of the government level institution while enhancing community 
involvement and benefit-sharing from park improvements, infrastructure and increased 
tourism.  Increased tourism, if not properly designed and complemented by capacity-
building of institutional and community stakeholders, could impact natural habitats 
negatively from uncontrolled use and intrusion, and would increase the use of resources 
from within the park or surroundings for tourism based activities (lodges, handicrafts, 
hunting, fishing, etc).  Potential impacts on natural habitats from increased tourism and 
community-based activities are part of the EA analysis which has been carried out. 
Significant analysis was performed previously by the National Parks Administration for 
the preparation of park management plans.  The National Strategic Plan for Sustainable 
Tourism recently implemented also sets forth guidelines for the management of this 
aspect in regard to the SNAP. Infrastructure works in national parks will incorporate 
Bank standards for EA and EIA for relevant activities. Based on recent project activities 
(P039787 and P040808/LN 4085 AR) APN has shown excellent compliance with Bank 
standards, and has a set of protocols for works in Parks which are comparable.  
 
The project will support environmentally sustainable forestry activities designed to 
increase productivity in the sector while integrating sustainable and best-management 
production practices into national development without adversely impacting natural 
habitats. Institutional strengthening activities will be carried-out by the project at federal 
and provincial levels of government to promote greater governance and enforcement of 
environmental regulations including those that protect and conserve natural habitats.  The 
EA for the project ensures that proposed actions are consistent with the policy and 
specifically address the issue of natural habitats, and be used to guide the final project 
design in the use of best practices. Small-holder forestry activities supported under the 
Page  7
Sustainable Production Forestry component will be subject to an Environmental 
Management Framework in order to ensure compliance with Bank safeguards including 
natural habitats.  
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09)  
 
The EA for the Sustainable Plantation Forestry component examined the potential use of 
pesticides in the context of its activities with small producers, and has developed concrete 
guidelines for pest management, with emphasis placed on integrated pest management 
consistent with the pertinent Bank safeguard requirements in this regard. These 
guidelines form a Pest Management Plan, which has been included as part of each 
components� Environmental Assessment.  Guidelines and specific budgets for 
implementation included in the plan will be incorporated into the Operational Manual. 
Per the requirements of OP 4.09, any pesticides procured under the project would require 
prior review and must be approved by the Bank during project implementation.  
 
Forests (OP 4.36)  
 
The project conforms to this safeguard. Forest plantations will be established only on 
small-holder lands under the Sustainable Plantation Forestry component, with an 
estimated average size of 3.5 hectares. The direct beneficiaries are the rural poor. About 
4000 ha of land are estimated to be forested under this component. No industrial-scale 
commercial planting or harvesting is planned under the project. The EA specifically 
addresses the issue of forests, and ensures that the project is consistent with this concept 
incorporating sub-components that seek increased sustainability in policies, planning, and 
institutional capacities. Buffer-zone and sustainable use activities will be subject to the 
Environmental Management Framework prepared for individual sub-projects under the 
Protected Areas and Conservation Corridors component. This will help insure that there 
are no adverse effects on forests and that there is a focus on the promotion of sustainable 
uses of forest resources. Per the requirements of OP 4.36, forest plantations supported 
under the project would not cause the loss or degradation of critical natural habitats, 
which include protected areas plus other areas of high conservation value.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11)  
 
Several of the 11 parks that are considered for strengthening within the Protected Areas 
and Conservation Corridors component of the project have important cultural property 
protected within and around their boundaries.  The Bosques Petrificados site is important 
for its protection of fossils while Talampaya and others contain archeological sites that 
are included among UNESCO World Heritage sites.  
 
Both the Protected Areas and Conservation Corridors and the Sustainable Plantation 
Forestry components will restore and upgrade historic buildings in downtown Buenos 
Aires. The project is consistent with the safeguard in that it seeks to directly improve 
protection of these cultural properties.  The Environmental Assessment carried-out by 
APN for project preparation identifies relevant issues which have been incorporated into 
the EMP for the component, including the relevant local and national laws and 
regulations in regard to cultural property and restoration.  
 
Page  8
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10)  
 
Four (4) protected areas to be strengthened under the Protected Areas and Conservation 
Corridors component have indigenous groups within and around them (Baritu, Calilegua, 
Sierra de las Quijadas and Pilcomayo).  In order to comply with the Indigenous Peoples 
Policy, APN has prepared a Social Assessment that incorporates an Indigenous Peoples 
Plan.  This IPP has been integrated into the project design and will be included in the 
operational manual. The Sustainable Plantation Forestry Component proposed project 
sites (Mesopotamia and Patagonia) are inhabited by indigenous groups in specific cases, 
and the identified project activities have been evaluated and determined not to have any 
direct impact, positive or negative, on indigenous people.  However, indigenous groups 
might choose to participate in the demand-driven aspects of the project. In order to 
address this possibility, an Indigenous Peoples Development Framework was prepared. 
This framework will guide work with any indigenous group that may wish to participate 
in the project.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12)  
 
Although no involuntary resettlement is planned under any of the components, there is 
potential for activities under the Protected Areas and Conservation Corridors component 
to diminish access to natural resources by surrounding communities.  In order to avoid 
adverse impacts in this regard and in compliance with Involuntary Resettlement Policy, a 
Process Framework was developed to ensure proper consideration before and during 
execution of protected area strengthening activities and forestry management.  All work 
toward establishment of corridors and/or new protected areas will consist only of baseline 
surveys and participatory planning processes with stakeholders - not their actual 
establishment.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Minor negative impacts could indirectly result from increased tourism or increased 
resource pressure from sustainable development activities.  To avoid these potential 
impacts, an Environmental Management Plan has been prepared for use and guidance 
during project implementation to ensure compliance with national, provincial, and 
municipal legislation, and APN policies as well as pertinent Bank safeguards. The EMP 
will be included in the Operational Manual.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
During project preparation, consideration was given to establishing specific areas of 
intervention for pilot projects under the Sustainable Plantation Forestry component.  The 
alternative of generating a demand-driven model to be implemented after capacity 
building within national and provincial level institutions and following participatory 
planning processes was considered the more environmentally beneficial alternative.  An a 
priori analysis of a project area for small-holder activities would not generate or replicate 
the level of input that a long-term participatory process would generate such as is 
presently proposed.  The demand-driven model also ensures that the communities, 
organizations, and local governments are committed to the outcomes of the program 
Page  9
given that they will generate what they consider priority projects within a general 
framework to be established by the project and to foster greater inclusion in the 
productive forestry sector. Levels of co-financing will also be optimized in a demand-
driven model whereas a �supply-side� model may not necessarily generate the same 
level of interest or commitments.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The three implementing institutions - SAyDS, SAGPyA and APN - are familiar with the 
Bank safeguards and have the technical and institutional capacity to implement the 
environmental requirements of the proposed project.  These procedures and activities are 
similar to those of the recently closed Forestry Development Project, Native Forests and 
Protected Areas Project and Biodiversity Conservation Project. The project will utilize to 
the greatest extent possible, the established human capacity, systems, and procedures, 
which will assure high quality administration and management. The technical and 
supervisory capacity of these institution execution units has been evaluated and found to 
be sound. APN has shown excellent compliance with Bank standards, and has a set of 
protocols for works in Parks which are comparable.  
 
Both the National Parks Administration and the Secretariat of Agriculture have 
developed thorough Environmental and Social Assessments for their respective 
components. Additionally, an environmental review has been prepared for the Native 
Forests Preparation component given that the component involves technical studies and 
preparation work with no environmental and social impacts.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The National Parks Administration and the Secretariat of Agriculture as institutions have 
developed a systematic participation and consultation framework since year 2001 and 
continued during project preparation.  The elaboration of management plans for protected 
areas and forests requires strong consultation participation from local communities and 
organizations. The Social Assessment reports on all consultations and public participation 
carried out since 2001 at different levels (national, provincial and within the project 
areas).  
 
Based on the overall analysis of institutional actors, the social assessment includes a 
systematic stakeholder analysis.  This is not limited to beneficiaries or those directly 
affected by the project.  It also includes groups who may influence the outcome of the 
project, directly or indirectly.  Some of the broad categories groups analyzed are (i) 
communities; (ii) cooperatives and organizations; (iii) provincial authorities; (iv) federal 
government; civil society organizations including NGOs and Academic institutions; (v) 
private sector; and (vi) others.
