B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the proposed project is a reduction of the energy intensity of the 
Tunisian economy and an increase of the share of renewables in the primary fuel mix. This will 
be achieved through investment in energy efficiency and in renewable energy technologies.  
 
The key performance indicators will be:  
 
•
energy intensity reduction  
 
•
share of renewables in primary energy  
 
•
investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy projects  
 
A
secondary indicator is the resulting reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Discussions on the proposed project were initiated in July 2006. The conceptual design of the 
project was developed through several consultations with ANME and all stakeholders, using 
results and findings reported in several studies and market assessments funded by grants from 
multilateral and bilateral institutions.  
Page  2
Following the publication of the 4ECP, and its presentation during the NCEM, the ANME has 
sent a formal request to the Ministry of Industry and Energy ( MIEPME) for support from the 
World Bank to finance the following investment:  
 
1.
cogeneration  
 
2.
wind generation by industry ( self-generation)  
 
3.
EPCs with industry (“contrat-programmes”)  
 
4.
thermal solar in industry and services  
 
5.
replacement of old appliances, focusing in a first phase on refrigerators  
 
During project preparation, it will be identified which of those activities are priority, focusing 
as far as possible on providing short-term loans to projects with high rates of return, and should 
be included in the proposed project, depending on the loan amount. Preliminary discussions 
indicate that the project is likely to include activities 1, 2 and 3, with the possible addition of 
activity 5, and this will have to be confirmed during project preparation.  
 
The proposed project intends to provide a Bank loan of an amount of $70-100 million to 
support the 4ECP for: either a credit line to selected domestic commercial banks or an Energy 
Efficiency Fund (EEF) managed by a specialized and professionally staffed unit, or a mixture of 
the two. The purpose is to promote the deployment of specific financing schemes, as lack of 
financial resources or resistance to EE/RE investment because of implicit high discount rates are 
some of the major barriers to scaling-up EE/RE.  
 
The choice of instrument and delivery system will be made during project preparation and will 
depend on the local institutional capabilities and the market segments included in the project. 
Indeed, previous experience with EE/RE projects at the Bank indicates three basic options for 
project delivery: loan financing and partial loan guarantees, ESCOs, DSM or a combination of 
the three. Experience as regards project design is that:  
 
(i) 
careful diagnostic work is needed up front to customize the project to local institutional 
environment  
 
(ii) 
project design must develop in parallel financial mechanism and project development and 
preparation capabilities.  
 
Those principles will be applied to choose the most appropriate instruments depending on what 
the GoT defines as priority activities. However, the team will attempt to unify the choice of 
instrument to avoid making the project unnecessarily complex.  
 
Technical assistance, funded by third party grants, would in all cases provide support to the 
financial intermediaries to develop an EE/RE portfolio and to prepare and evaluate the sub-
projects proposed for financing.Indeed all previous  
 
experience(1)points to the need for on-going technical support to address emerging barriers, 
provide ongoing skill enhancement and counteract behavioral barriers. The rapid deployment of 
the EE/RE market requires not only products and information, but also the availability of 
technical, commercial and financial services.  
 
Page  3
Technical assistance might also be needed for developing “standard products”, for outreach 
campaigns and for setting up the appropriate regulatory and incentive framework particularly for 
RE (especially wind).  
 
Component I: EE/RE support through financial intermediation  
 
I.a: EE/RE Fund  
 
The Bank loan in this case would provide financial resources to an existing or to-be-created 
fund (for instance FNME) to provide loans for eligible EE/RE subprojects. The fund could also 
provide partial loan guarantees. The fund would be managed by a professional financial agency. 
The most appropriate set-up for the Fund will be decided during project preparation. If the Fund 
is to be managed by a commercial bank, the bank will be selected competitively.  
 
The Fund manager will be responsible for (i) setting-up and managing the Fund and (ii) 
evaluating and carrying due diligence activities according to rules and procedures to be 
developed during project preparation and agreed at appraisal. A technical unit, possibly funded 
through a third party financed grant, would assist the fund manager in carrying out the required 
due diligence prior to loan approval. ESCOs can be used to market and develop projects for the 
Fund; in particular small projects with high transaction costs can be packaged by ESCOs. As 
ESCOs  are successfully developing in Tunisia, although slowly, they can play a key role in 
developing and designing EE/RE projects, as well as in monitoring and verification.  
 
Lessons from previous energy efficiency projects at the Bank indicate that considerable time 
and effort is required to establish a Fund and that, as much as possible, selection of a Fund 
manager should take place prior to Board presentation.  
 
I.b EE/RE line of credit  
 
The IBRD loan would be on-lent by the Government of Tunisia to selected commercial banks, 
which would lend to companies for eligible EE/RE subprojects following their lending policies 
and procedures. Eligibility of the projects would be assessed by the banks according to an 
operational manual(2)to be developed during project preparation and agreed at appraisal. The 
domestic commercial banks would be responsible for loan repayment to GoT and assume all 
financial risk.  
 
During project preparation, it will be determined whether a credit line should be preferred over 
a
fund, or even if a mix of the two instruments would be appropriate in case different types of 
projects are better financed through different FI mechanisms ( for instance small projects to the 
services sector might be better handled by commercial banks, whereas the Fund might be more 
appropriate for industrial RE projects). A line of credit was set up in Tunisia in December 2007 
together with a grant for technical assistance, by Agence FranÃ§aise de DÃ©veloppement 
(AFD). Results obtained with this credit line will be monitored during project preparation to 
assess its success. Moreover the AFD loan is only 40 million Euros for both EE/RE and 
Page  4
environmental projects. Therefore a credit line financed by the World Bank could be a good 
complement, as the amount of the AFD credit-line is clearly too low compared to the financing 
needs of 1.3 billion TD (1.12 billion US$) of the 4ECP.  
 
Component II: Direct lending to specific EE/RE projects (optional)  
 
Experience with lines of credit and special purpose funds in most countries, including Tunisia, 
indicates that disbursement may be slow in the early stage. Therefore, the concept under 
discussion with Tunisian counterparts includes the possibility of identifying a number of sizeable 
projects (ANME “gros contrat-programmes”, cogeneration, self-generation with renewables) that 
would benefit from direct lending, if they are eligible for World Bank financing. The projects 
would be appraised according to Bank rules ands procedures during project preparation. 
Preparation will confirm the use of this component, in complement to either component Ia or 
component Ib.  
 
Component III: Technical Assistance  
 
Technical assistance funded through a third party grant(3)would be used to support the start-
up/scale up of the EE/RE business lines of the commercial banks , including for capacity 
building and training. Training would be provided to assess the EE/RE market and to develop the 
necessary skills to market, develop, evaluate and monitor implementation of EE projects. TA to 
commercial banks could also include the development of “standard products”(i.e. waste heat 
recovery, chiller replacement, etc.), outreach campaigns and support for the development of new 
projects; the needs will be identified during project preparation.  
 
Depending on the availability of funds, assistance could also be provided to non-participating 
banks and sub-project owners.  
 
Technical assistance would also be provided to ANME (i) to develop the appropriate incentive 
system and regulatory framework for RE, in particular wind and (ii) to improve the existing 
subsidy system, to transform it into a targeted and performance based system.  
 
The team will explore opportunities for cooperation with other donors to identify funding for 
TA grants  
 
Component IV: Carbon Finance (to be blended with all other components)  
 
The proposed project will contribute to GHG emission reductions through improved energy 
efficiency or the use of zero-carbon energy. The project is a good candidate for the new carbon 
finance facility being set up by the World Bank, the Carbon Partnership Facility (CPF). In 
particular, the project could generate emissions reduction through several programs of activities 
(PoA, as defined by the EB32) attached to Components I and II. Such PoAs could represent good 
candidates for CPF support, which would enter into purchase agreements for a minimum of 10 
years following 2012.  
 
Page  5
The carbon revenues would then be used to improve the financial viability of the project. For 
example, the World Bank loan could be serviced with income derived from selling a share of the 
emission reductions to CPF and other buyers. This approach can be tailored to the needs of the 
Government of Tunisia.  
 
The Government of Tunisia is already active in carbon finance. In particular, the Government 
of Tunisia and the World Bank signed emissions reduction purchase agreements for the two 
CDM projects hosted by Tunisia and registered by the CDM Executive Board of the UNFCCC. 
This project would allow Tunisia to go beyond the project by project mode and to achieve larger 
emissions reductions, over a longer period of time.

explore options to use part of its â‚¬40 million budget support program “Appui Ã  la RÃ©forme 
du Secteur EnergÃ©tique” for the TA.  Other options need tobe explored to secure the required 
TA budget.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
During project preparation the safeguard specialist will evaluate the institutional capacity of the 
selected commercial banks for environmental assessment of the projects and supervision of the 
subloans (implementation of safeguard framework procedures). If this capacity is deficient, 
technical assistance will be used to strengthen the capacity.

X
The project will support investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy through a line 
of credit or an ad-hoc fund (component 1); it would also provide direct lending to finance 
investment in co-generation or self-generation with renewables (component 2).  
 
While in general improved energy efficiency will reduce energy use per unit of output, one 
can not rule out a priori that there may be environmental impacts as well as safety implications 
linked to the construction and operation of the equipment required to improve the energy 
efficiency performance of the targeted industrial sub-sectors and to produce energy from 
renewable sources: (e.g. air or water emissions, noise, vibration, disposal of toxic 
material, etc). 
Page  6
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
A
screening procedure would have to be established and for the sub-projects that would be found 
to require it, environmental and safety impacts would need to be assessed.  
 
The team proposes a double EA rating: "FI" for component 1 (both under the option 1.a and 
option 1.b); for component 2 the proposed rating is "B". This is not standard practice, and we 
perceive that such arrangement would complicate compliance with safeguards and more 
generally project implementation.  
 
As a more practical solution, the team may want to consider rating the project as "B". Under 
such approach, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) would be developed by the borrower 
during preparation. The EMP would contain provisions for a screening system that will be used 
by the Financial Intermediaries for the environmental assessment of sub-projects being financed 
under component 1. Further, the EMP would identify, for activities financed under component 2, 
potential environmental impacts and related mitigating measures, as well as any necessary 
capacity building and institutional strengthening measures, and a monitoring plan for the 
supervision of EMP implementation. As usual, TORs for EMP preparation would be cleared by 
the Bank.  
 
An environmental specialist should be brought on-board during preparation to help the team 
design the right approach and outline the appropriate framework. This person can not coincide 
with the environmental reviewer of the project (Raffaello Cervigni) as currently indicated by the 
ISDS.  
 
Considering the questions remaining to be clarified, the Regional Safeguards group will 
continue to carry the oversight responsibility for this project, at least until QER.
