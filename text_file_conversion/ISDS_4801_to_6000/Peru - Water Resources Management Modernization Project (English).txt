2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen the capacity for participatory, 
integrated, basin-scale water resources management (WRM) at the central level and in 
selected pilot river basins.  The achievement of the PDO will be monitored through the 
following outcome indicators:  
 
ï
Improved national strategies and regulatory and normative framework for WRM  
 
ï
River Basin Organizations are created in selected river basins and have addressed 
successfully critical WRM issues in an integrated manner.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed lending instrument is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$ 10 million 
over a five year period. The overall project cost is estimated at US$ 23.67 million.  It 
would be implemented through the following components:  
 
Component 1.  Strengthening WRM capacity at the national level (total cost US$ 6.30 
million, IBRD loan US$ 2.75 million)  
Page  2
1. 
This component aims at improving the institutional capacity at the central level to 
facilitate/support integrated, participatory WRM at the basin level.  It will include five 
subcomponents:  
 
Sub-component 1.1.  Capacity building of the newly created ANA (total cost US$ 1.99 
million, IBRD loan US$ 0.66 million):  The Project will build the capacity of the newly 
created ANA by supporting a core team, including both administrative and technical 
staff.  The team will provide the foundation for basin-scale, participatory, integrated 
WRM in this institution and will be maintained once the Project closes.  It will also be 
responsible for overall Project implementation.  
 
Sub-component 1.2.  National Strategy for WRM Financing (total cost US$ 0.2 million, 
IBRD loan US$ 0.0 million).  The Project will support the formulation of a strategy for 
financing WRM at the national and river basin levels, considering the user-pays and 
polluter-pays principles.  
 
Sub-component 1.3.  Creation of a national water information system (total cost US$ 
2.09 million, IBRD loan US$ 1.20 million).  The Project will support the design and 
implementation of a national water information system that will integrate into one single 
information system, water-related data and information currently dispersed among 
various institutions.  
 
Sub-component 1.4.  National Water Quality Management Strategy (total cost US$ 0.20 
million, IBRD loan US$ 0.13 million).  The Project will support the formulation of a 
national strategy for water quality management, considering water quality monitoring, 
discharge control and enforcement.  
 
Sub-
component 1.5.  Program to Promote a New ìWater Cultureî (total cost US$ 1.82 
million, IBRD loan US$ 0.76 million).   The Project will support ANA in the design and 
launch of a program aimed at promoting a new ìwater cultureî among decision makers, 
water professionals and the general public.  It will also support the capacity building of 
water professionals and decision-makers in WRM, in particular those directly involved in 
the implementation and/or monitoring of the Project activities at the river basin level 
supported under component 2, including officials from ANA and its local offices (AAA), 
regional governments, SENAMHI and DIGESA.  
 
Component 2.  Improving WRM in selected River Basins (Total cost: US$ 17.35 
million, IBRD loan: US$ 7.22 million)  
 
Sub-component 2.1.  Implementation of participatory, IWRM in three pilot river basins 
(total cost US$ 16.62 million, IBRD loan US$ 6.96 million).  
 
The Project will support, in three river basins , the creation and/or strengthening and 
early operation of: (a) the local ANA offices (AAA), that will constitute the River Basin 
Authority; (b) the River Basin Councils (CCs) and their technical working groups, as the 
entities to ensure stakeholders participation and to line-up political support; (c) regional 
offices of DIGESA, called Direcci√≥n Ejecutivas de la Salud Ambiental (DESAs), 
responsible for water quality management and (d) regional offices of SENAMHI, 
responsible for the generation of hydro-meteorological information.  
 
This will include: (a) the design of the institutional organization, composition and 
functions of AAA and CC in each river basin based on the local context, including the 
Page  3
coordination and accountability mechanisms between these entities and other 
stakeholders; (b) the development of operational management instruments for AAAs ; 
and (c) setting-up and financing a local core team in each of the involved AAA/river 
basins.  
 
A
key activity will also be the definition of the financing mechanisms (in line with the 
strategy developed in sub-component 1.2) detailing how water users and polluters, and 
central, regional and local governments would participate in the financing of WRM in 
each of the six pilot basins.  
 
In addition, the Project would finance the development/strengthening of key WRM 
instruments, including: (a) the formulation of a detailed participatory, integrated WRM 
plans for each of the pilot river basin; (b) bulk water distribution models and decision aid 
tools, including hydrological and hydrogeological models and scenario simulation models 
to be used in developing the IWRM plans and for flood (including alert systems) and 
drought management and adaptation to climate change; (c) plan for the operation and 
maintenance of major hydraulic infrastructure, including dam safety procedures; (d) 
improvements of the hydro-meteorological and hydrological observation networks; (e) 
improvements to water user rights administration through the development of procedures 
and their implementation for the formalization of non-agricultural water rights and 
monitoring of users compliance and enforcing the terms and condition of water rights 
entitlements; (f) design and implementation of surface and groundwater quality 
monitoring and discharge control programs in the Chili pilot basin; (g) training of trainers 
in the ìnew water cultureî to create a critical mass of motivated and competent 
professional staff that would promote, design and implement awareness raising 
campaigns aimed at improving people habits and practices related to water use and 
encouraging their participation in river basin management and (h) financing small high 
priority structural or non structural activities, as defined in the integrated WRM plans that 
may include upper watershed protection to control erosion and river embankment 
protection  
 
Sub-component 2.2.  Sensitization to the creation of river basin organizations in four 
River Basins and validation of preliminary IWRM plans (total cost US$ 0.73 million, 
IBRD loan US$ 0.27 million).  
 
It is expected that the experience gained in the pilot river basins under sub-component 
2.1 will eventually be extended to other basins in the country.  The purpose of this 
component is to prepare the groundwork in 4 river basins for the creation of CCs as a 
locus for participation and consensus building among all stakeholders in the water sector 
through updating and validating preliminary IWRM plan for their river basin.  These 4 
river basins are:  Puyango-Tumbes; Jequetepeque; Chancay-Huaral; and Moqueta-
Tambo.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The WRM capacity building Component 1 will benefit the entire country, which faces 
increasing water shortages (especially in the coastal area) in dry season and frequent 
floods and droughts.  Some 53 rivers, flowing west from the Andes to the coast supply 
the bulk of the water used in the coastal area.  Of these rivers, more than half carry only 
seasonal flow.  The Peruvian piedmont and coastline are prone to devastating floods and 
Page  4
mud-floods mainly due to the high precipitation on degraded upper basins; while the 
Southern part of the country is particularly prone to droughts.  Aside from natural causes, 
such as the El Ni√±o occurring roughly every seven years, the effects of droughts and 
floods have been exacerbated by man-made interventions, including soil erosion 
stemming from poor cropping and grazing practices, deforestation and poor land use 
practices.  Preventive laws and measures (related to zoning, deforestation, etc.) are not 
enforced and there is no reliable early warning system network.  The consequence is 
increasing negative impacts from droughts and floods in the different regions with an 
increasing impact on the Peruvian economy.  In addition, water quality is deteriorating 
due to the release of untreated effluents from mining, industries, municipalities and 
agriculture.  Moreover, water use efficiency is low, particularly in the agricultural sector 
which accounts for about 80 per cent of freshwater withdrawals (efficiency is estimated 
at 35 percent).  
 
Component 2 (Improving WRM in selected River Basins) will primarily work in three 
river basins, where the Project will pilot the implementation of an integrated, 
participatory, water resources management (IWRM) approach.  The three basins 
(Chancay-Lambayeque, Chili, and Ica) have been identified, based on the following 
criteria: (a) important water issues requiring IWRM (such as water conflicts, water 
quality issues, over-exploitation of groundwater), (b) existence of a basic organization for 
IWRM; and (c) water usersí ability to pay water user fees (laretribuci√≥n econ√≥mica).  
In addition, the Project will prepare the groundwork for basin-scale participatory, IWRM 
in four additional basins of the coastal area (Puyango-Tumbes; Jequetepeque; Chancay-
Huaral; and Moqueta-Tambo).  These river basins were selected for their socio-economic 
importance and the intensity of the water conflicts that afflict them.  The four basins are 
located in the Pacific Basin where most socio-economic activities are located and where 
most people live.   
 
As mentioned above, Bank interventions supported under Component 2 will be 
concentrated in three basins of the coastal area of Peru.  These basins major physical 
characteristics and environmental issues are:  
 
The Chancay-Lambayeque River Basin covers a total area of 5,702 km2 and an 
estimated population of 1.2 million inhabitants. Located 740 km north of Lima, this basin 
is shared by two Departments (Lambayeque and Cajamarca).  The lower valley (from see 
level to 500 m) is characterized by a dry arid and semi-arid climate, scrub thorny forests, 
irrigated agriculture lands (mainly for rice and sugarcane) and degraded soils, the latter 
associated to deforestation, poor drainage and salinization.  The middle and upper valleys 
(500 to 3,500 m) are distinguished by semi- and temperate climates, with abundant 
rainfall in the upper valley from January to April (dry from May to September).  The 
Chancay river is regulated by the Tinajones dam.  Vegetation in the higher valleys 
comprises mainly tropical dry forests (middle valley) and Andean puna (mountain 
grasslands including p√°ramo formations), with extensive land clearing, overgrazing and 
agricultural & livestock conversion and associated erosion.  Water scarcity is an issue in 
the basin, with water demand growing and not met by current supply.  Water quality 
issues are mainly associated to domestic and industrial discharges and run-off from 
Page  5
abandoned mining sites.  Contamination with pesticides seems to be an issue, particularly 
in the lower valley, though there is no data to assess the extent of the problem. 
 
The Chili River Basin covers a total area of 14,687 km2 and an estimated population of 
1.1 million inhabitants.  Located around 900 km south of Lima, this basin is shared by the 
Departments of Arequipa (mostly), Cuzco and Puno.  The lower and middle valleys are 
characterized by a dry arid climate (there is practically no rainfall from sea level to 1,400 
m). Main vegetation types in this area include scrub thorny forests and coastal/Sechura 
desert. This desert is one of the few on Earth that receives most of its precipitation in the 
form of fog. The landscape consists of migrating dunes, sub-desert scrublands, riparian 
oases, high plateaus, Andean foothills, extensive coastline, and deep canyons. Vegetation 
is sparse, at best. At the higher valleys (1,400 to 4,500 m), the climate is temperate cold 
with most rainfall (60-80%) occurring from January to March.  The vegetation in the 
higher valley is characterized by puna formations (mountain grasslands including 
p√°ramo formations), which have been altered for agriculture and are degraded in many 
areas through grazing of domestic livestock and collection of firewood.  Moreover, 
riparian vegetation is highly degraded.  Irrigated agriculture (alfalfa, rice, onion and 
maize), livestock, hydropower, industry (agro-processing, leather, clothes, furniture and 
metallurgy) and related commerce are the main economic activities in the basin.  The 
Chili River is highly polluted by domestic and industrial waste.  Soil salinization 
associated with poor irrigation and drainage is significant in the sub-basins of the Vitor, 
Siguas and Quilca rivers.  Significant parts of the basinsí soils is degraded, the latter 
associated to poor drainage and salinization. 
 
The Ica River Basin covers a total area of 7,711 km2 and an estimated population of 
around 300,000 inhabitants.  Located in around 200 km south of Lima, the basin is shared 
by two Departments (Ica and Huancavelica). The lower and pre-mountain valleys (from 
see level to about 2,500 m) are characterized by a dry arid and semi-arid climate 
Precipitation is meager in the desert, at only 150 to 200 mm annually. Main vegetation 
types in this area include coastal/Sechura desert and scrub thorny formations from 1,500 
to 2,500 m. At the higher valleys (2,500 to 4,500 m), the climate is temperate cold, semi-
arid below 3,800 m, and more humid above this elevation. The vegetation in the higher 
valley is characterized by puna formations (montane grasslands or p√°ramo h√∫medo 
sub-alpino). The puna formations have been extensively altered for agriculture and are 
degraded in some portions of the basin. Another is water pollution in the lower valley, 
originated from productive activities (urban and agricultural) and domestic wastes. Main 
crops in the basin are cotton, grapevine, asparagus, potatoes, garlic, onion, tomatoes, lima 
beans and maize. Future trends suggest increase in production of export crops such as 
asparagus, grapes, garlic, onion and avocado and reduction in cotton plantations, which 
implies significant changes/increase in water demands.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:  
 
The Project is expected to have positive environmental and social impacts through 
improve WRM which is essential to promoting social, environmental and economic 
sustainability and contributing to: (a) improved water quality, thereby reducing negative 
impact on peopleís health and on the environment; (b) improved transparency, efficiency 
and sustainability of water resources management, thereby reducing conflicts over water 
resources nationally and in critical basins; and (c) more efficient use of water resources, 
thereby reducing the growth in water demand and preventing the need for costly 
interbasin water transfers (and their irreversible environmental impacts) and reducing 
water over-exploitation.  
 
Hence, improving environmental conditions through improved water resources 
management is an integral element of the project design. However, despite these 
anticipated positive or neutral impacts, some project activities will have potential 
environmental impacts: they are the small-scale physical investments that may be 
implemented in three pilot river basins.  The small-scale physical investments may  
include upper watershed protection to control erosion and river embankment protection 
(component 2.1.).  
 
Given that the specific location and nature of potential small works to be financed under 
Sub-component 2.1 have not yet been determined (these will be decided by stakeholders 
during the process of formulating integrated, basin-scale WRM plans, supported under 
Subcomponent 2.1), specific environmental impacts, location and magnitude cannot be 
ascertained.  However, due to the small size of the works envisaged (total budget for this 
activity is US$400,000 to be shared between three river basins), it is expected that 
possible adverse environmental impacts could possibly include the following localized 
and temporary impacts in the areas where monitoring equipment installation or small-
Page  7
scale physical works will be undertaken: (i) soil erosion; (ii) deforestation of small spots 
of riparian vegetation, when existent; (iii) water pollution (sediments).  
 
No large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are foreseen. Despite this fact, and 
to ensure conformity with Bank and government environmental policies beyond the life 
of project, the Bank requested submission of Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the 
formulation of WRM plans, with environmental and social considerations mainstreamed 
into the plan formulation process.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No indirect or long tem impacts are foreseen. However, small works supported under 
Subcomponent 2.1 would go through a strict screening process to ensure maximum 
socioeconomic and environmental benefits are accrued and any unintended negative 
environmental impacts are avoided or minimized, including those eventually associated 
to secondary or indirect and long term effects (for details on the screening process, see 
section 4 below).   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not relevant at this stage. However, alternatives analysis has been included as a 
requirement in a generic ToRs for the IWRM plans which were prepared by the borrower 
and reviewed by the Bank.  EA procedures and social aspects are mainstreamed in this 
generic ToR (final ToR version should be expected before appraisal).  In terms of 
alternatives analysis, these EA procedures allow that, during the formulation process of 
future WRM plans, (i) to distinguish among alternative strategies and investment 
programs within the water sector, to be discussed under the WRM plan of each river 
basin, and (ii) to review (if applicable) the effects of water sector policy changes in the 
basin and its surroundings.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrowerís institutional capacity to plan and implement safeguard measures is 
considered adequate.  The implementation agency (ANA/MINAG) has a small though 
experienced team capable to implement the Environmental Management Framework 
(EMF) and the Indigenous People Planning Framework (IPPF).  The procedures for 
environmental screening have been incorporated in the EMF and Operational Manual, 
which also include procedures for the evaluation, approval, and monitoring of physical 
investments seeking to be financed under the investment component.  EA training of key 
staff from the implementing agency at all levels (ANA at central, regional and river basin 
levels) as well as key stakeholders is foreseen to support EMF implementation.  Key staff 
members from the implementing agency received training on the Bankís social safeguard 
policies (OP/BP 4.10 and OP/BP 4.12), social assessment, and stakeholder analysis.  
 
The specific measures taken by the Borrower to address each of the safeguard issues are 
described in the following.  
Page  8
O.P. 4.01‚
 îEnvironmental Assessment 
 
The Project is classified as Category B, which is the appropriate classification for a 
project whose potential adverse environmental impacts on human populations or 
environmentally important areas are site-specific, reversible, and can be readily mitigated 
(OP 4.01, paragraph 8).  In accordance with this classification, an environmental 
assessment (EA), including an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) or Marco 
de Gesti√≥n Ambiental, has been prepared by the Borrower and reviewed by the Bank.  
The EA and EMF specify the criteria and procedures‚
 îincluding operating rules‚ îthat 
will be used during Project implementation to avoid or minimize adverse environmental 
impacts.  Some of the key aspects of the draft EA/EMF are described below:  
 
Environmental Management Framework.  Given that the specific location and nature of 
potential small works to be financed under sub-component 2.1. will only be known 
during Project implementation, specific environmental impacts, location and magnitude 
cannot be ascertained.  Therefore, an Environment Management Framework (EMF) has 
been prepared to ensure that small works are subjected to an adequate EA process, that 
they do not create any serious adverse impact on the local environment, and that 
appropriate mitigation measures are included in the designs and cumulative impacts are 
duly taken into account.  Physical investments supported under Subcomponent 2.1 will 
go through a screening process to ensure maximum socioeconomic and environmental 
benefits are accrued and any unintended negative environmental impacts are avoided or 
minimized. Physical investmentsí screening, evaluation, approval, and monitoring 
procedures proposed in the EMF have been incorporated into the project design (i.e. the 
cycle of design and approval of small works), so that mitigation measures proposed are 
cost-effective and not overly burdensome.  These procedures are included in the Projectís 
Operational Manual.  Depending on the nature and magnitude of their potential impacts, 
small works proposals will be classified into a specific category of impact (according to 
the national legislation ñ see para. below), so as to determine related requirements to 
reduce or eliminate potential environmental impacts.  
 
Category of environmental impact of Physical investments. Following the provisions 
made by the Peruvian legislation (EIA Law 27446/2001), proposals would be classified 
(mostly) as Category/Level 1 if no or very low adverse impacts are foreseen and hence no 
mitigation measures are necessary; otherwise, as Category/Level 2 if low to moderate or 
non-significant impacts which can be easily mitigated.  Physical investments classified as 
Level 1 will require a simplified environmental assessment report (Declaraci√≥n de 
Impacto Ambiental ‚àí DIA). Level 2 Small works would require a semi-detailed EIA 
(Semidetallado EIA-sd). Mitigation measures would be incorporated into the small works 
design before submission for approval. The project does not foresee any subproject that 
would fall into Category/Level 3, which would require a detailed or full environmental 
assessment study  (EIA Detallado ‚àí EIA-d).  
 
Responsibility for EA and institutional arrangements.  An Environmental Unit will be 
created within the National Water Agency (ANA). Proposed small works would be 
categorized by ANA staff that would be accountable for recruiting and carrying out the 
Page  9
overall supervision of EA studies (DIA/ Level 1 or EIA-sd/Level2) before submitting 
small works proposals to the concerned EA authority (OGATEIRN).  ANA would also 
inform concerned river basin authority and local and regional environmental authorities, 
that could also monitor the EA preparation process.  Draft EA documents would be 
disclosed in-country (within the river basin and at the national level) and made accessible 
to subproject-affected groups and local NGOs.  Upon EA approval by OGATEIRN and 
adequate budget allocation, ANA would send final EA to concerned local and regional 
governments and issue authorization for civil works start-
up
(autorizaci√≥n para iniciar la 
ejecuci√≥n de las obras).  
 
Environmental and Social Considerations mainstreamed into the Basin-scale, Integrated, 
WRM Plans.  As mentioned above, the Project will support the formulation of 5-year 
integrated, participatory WRM plans for the pilot basins.  While implementation of these 
plans will not be financed by the Project, some of the activities identified in the plans 
could have potential adverse environmental or social impacts once implemented.  To 
ensure conformity with Bank and government environmental policies beyond the life of 
project, the Bank requested submission of Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the formulation 
of WRM plans, with environmental and social considerations mainstreamed into the plan 
formulation process.  
 
More specifically, formulation of the plan will involve:  
 
ï
evaluating and comparing impacts against those of alternative options, i.e. 
distinguishing among alternative strategies and investment programs within the water 
sector, to be discussed under the WRM plan of each river basin, and reviewing (if 
applicable) the effects of water sector policy changes in the basin and its surroundings  
 
ï
assessing legal and institutional aspects relevant to the issues and impacts 
proposed in the draft WRM plan;  
 
ï
recommending broad measures to strengthen environmental management in the 
water sector;  
 
ï
paying particular attention to potential cumulative impacts of multiple activities 
proposed under the WRM plan; and  
 
ï
carrying out an alternative analysis for each of the main investments proposed 
under the WRM Plans (see section 3 above).  
 
Strengthening EA capacity.  In addition to the inclusion of specific responsibilities for 
EA and institutional arrangements, the Project has also included provisions for 
strengthening EA capacity within MINAG/ANA, river basin authorities and establishing 
mechanisms to monitor implementation and measure impacts.  Environmental 
requirements and procedures for Physical investments approved under the WRM Plans 
would also be publicized among the River Basinís target groups and members of the 
basinís deliberative bodies at municipal and departmental/regional levels.  
 
O.P. 4.10‚
 îIndigenous Peoples 
 
Given that the proposed project intends to lay the groundwork for basin-scale 
participatory IWRM throughout Peru and indigenous peoples may be present in the 
project area, the Bankís Operational Policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) has been 
Page  10
triggered. A draft Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) has been prepared and 
will be disclosed in the Infoshop and in-country prior to the appraisal mission. The IPPF 
includes measures to ensure that free, prior, and informed consultation takes place with 
affected indigenous groups at each stage of project preparation and implementation.  
 
The Borrower has prepared a social-institutional assessment which was considered by 
the Bank satisfactory and included the following components:  
 
ï
A
systematic stakeholder analysis covering both those potentially affected bythe 
project and those who may influence project outcomes;  
 
ï
An analysis of the formal and informal institutions in the project setting that may 
affect WRM and use of the resource;  
 
ï
A
systematic consultation and participation process based on the stakeholder 
analysis;  
 
ï
Identification of social risks and conflict in the three pilot basins;  
 
ï
Census data for the three pilot river basins.  
 
O.P. 4.12 ñ Involuntary Resettlement  
 
The proposed project will not support any activity that entails involuntary resettlement 
(either through physical displacement or through loss of means of livelihoods through 
acquisition of lands). In order to ensure that resettlement-related actions are formally 
excluded, the EMF will make explicit that no activities supported by the project, 
including the small emergency works supported under Component 2.1, will cause 
involuntary displacement and resettlement   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Stakeholders would include national and basin-wide beneficiary stakeholders.  At the 
basin level, key stakeholders are the water users from all relevant sectors (agriculture, 
industries, potable water supply, hydropower, etc.), as well as regional and local 
government institutions, and local NGOs. At the national level, Ministries and national 
agencies from the aforementioned sectors, as well as national NGOs.  
 
A
series of consultative workshops and meetings which took place during the 
formulation of the preliminary WRM plans (prepared under PSI-I) were the basis for 
project preparation and involved a wide range of water users from the relevant sectors, 
NGOs, and relevant local, regional and national government organizations.  Three 
consultations for reviewing environmental safeguards and operational procedures took 
place in Chancay-Lambayeque, Chili and Ica River Basins, respectively.  In addition, the 
EA and respective EMF documents have been made available to the public mid-October 
2008 through: (i) ANAís library; (ii) the ANA home page; and (ii) MINAGís central 
documentation unit.  
 
ANA has displayed a commitment to involving different stakeholders in the 
consultation process. ANAís consultation process for the social-institutional assessment 
has included representatives from the national and provincial government, irrigation 
Page  11
district technical administration, River Basin Councils, non-governmental organizations, 
energy companies, mining companies, and river basin community members (both upper 
and lower basin). A workshop was held in Lima in June 2006 with representatives from 
national, regional, and local institutions in order to exchange ideas regarding the general 
problems associated with water resource management at the national level, including 
problems and conflicts related to the legal, administrative, technical, institutional, and 
socioeconomic management of water. This workshop was followed by workshops in each 
pilot river basin. In addition, a consultation with leading practitioners in WRM and other 
representatives from civil society was held on the draft social-institutional assessment in 
INRENA at the end of December.
