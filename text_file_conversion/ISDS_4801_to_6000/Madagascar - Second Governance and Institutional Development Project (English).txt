2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the project is to improve the efficiency and transparency of 
government and selected public services in Madagascar in line with the Madagascar 
Action Plan (MAP).   
 
3. Project Description 
The project (US$40.0 million) would be implemented over a period of four years and 
consists of the following six components:  
 
(a) 
Improvement of Public Expenditure Management (US$14.0 million: The 
objective of this component is to continue to support in a holistic manner the reform of 
the public expenditure management system in Madagascar.  The reference point for the 
reform is the Priority Action Plan (PAP) which is developed by the Ministry of Finance 
on an annual basis and supported by a number of development partners including the 
World Bank.  The PAP consolidates all reform activities under the oversight of the 
Ministry of Finance. The implementation progress of this plan is evaluated regularly 
jointly between the donors and the Ministry of Finance.  
Page  2
Funding under this component will be provided for the further improvement of the 
budget preparation and execution processes, including the further roll-out of the 
integrated fina
ncial management system (Syst√®me Int√©gr√© de Gestion des Finances 
Publiques, SIGFP) to the regional capitals and the strengthening of the operational 
efficiency of the relevant control mechanisms.  The project will continue to support the 
procurement reforms initiated in 2004 through comprehensive training and capacity 
building activities. It will provide assistance to the Government to implement the 
comprehensive reforms of the revenue agencies (customs and tax directorates).  
 
(b) 
Strengthening the Efficiency of Government Operations (US$8.0 million: The 
objective of this component is to support the change management and institutional 
development processes in the context of the implementation of the 
Governmentísdevelopment strategy, the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP).  This will 
include leadership training and development for senior government officials to manage 
and implement far-reaching reforms.  Support will also include an upgrading of local 
training institutions (Ecole Nationale de líAdministration Malgache, ENAM, 
CentreNational de Formation Administrative, CNFA, Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature 
et des Greffes, ENMG), as well as the support for the operation of a Global Development 
Learning Center (GDLN) and of a National Leadership Institute of Madagascar (NLIM).  
In addition, this component will support cross-cutting reforms and activities which are 
considered important for the MAP implementation.  Such reforms include the 
strengthening of the monitoring & evaluation system that underpins the MAP, the support 
for the development of a consistent institutional framework for decentralization, and the 
reform of the public sector pay and incentive system.  
 
(c) 
Rule of Law and Fight Against Corruption (US$2.5 million: The objective of the 
component is to assist Government in promoting transparency, accountability and good 
governance; and in particular, in reducing corruption. Project assistance will build on the 
activities initiated under the first PGDI and mainly focus on improving the operational 
efficiency of the judiciary, on supporting anti-corruption and conflict-of-interest 
activities, and on strengthening oversight by the Auditor General and by Parliament over 
State affairs.  This will also include support to establish an Economic Crimes Unit.  
 
(d) 
Monitoring & evaluation (US$7.0 million)  
 
The component will support Governmentís efforts to strengthen the monitoring & 
evaluation system that underpins the MAP.  This support will focus on the improvement 
of the operational efficiency of the National Statistics Office (INSTAT) and on the 
modernisation of the procedural and institutional framework for monitoring & evaluation 
in Madagascar.  To establish baseline data and reference points for the improvement of 
public services the project will support a new population census which aims at 
consolidating and further deepening existing statistical data which is vital for both public 
and private sector needs.  The last census was conducted in 1993. The total costs for the 
census are presently estimated at well above US$20.0 million (or approximately US$1.40 
per inhabitant) and will be funded by contributions from Government and development 
partners.  
 
(e)    Transparency and Social Accountability (US$4.0 million): The component aims at 
fostering increased implication of civil society in State affairs and at improving ìsocial 
accountabilityî which are key objectives of the MAP.  The supportwill focus on activities 
that are destined to strengthen civil societyís capacity to play a meaningful role in 
Page  3
monitoring and providing feedback on government activities.  This will include activities 
to improve both distribution of and access to information about key activities of the 
Government.  The project will support activities that are aimed at fostering an enabling 
environment for the involvement of civil society by developing processes that could 
eventually be replicated for more systemic use, primarily through pilots and discussions. 
It is also envisaged to set up a grant funding mechanism that would finance innovative 
governance activities by non-state actors that are related to the objectives of the project. 
These Social Accountability Grants will pilot, develop and scale up approaches that are 
focused on supporting civil society to monitor and provide oversight, in particular in key 
areas such as natural resource management, local service delivery, and public financial 
management.  
 
(f) 
Program Coordination (US$2.5 million): The objective of this component is to 
support the management and implementation of the PGDI II.  This will include assistance 
to the Ministry of Finance to set up and manage a basket fund for public expenditure 
management reforms.  Additional assistance will focus on the Bureau de Gestion (BdG) 
of the Reform Program for the Efficiency of the Administration (Programme de 
R√©formes pour líEfficacit√© de líAdministration, PREA) which wasset up by the 
Government in 2005 to coordinate all governance related activities.  
 
(g) US$2.0 million of the project proceeds remain unallocated to ensure that the project 
can respond flexibly to additional demands emerging during the implementation of the 
reform activities.
