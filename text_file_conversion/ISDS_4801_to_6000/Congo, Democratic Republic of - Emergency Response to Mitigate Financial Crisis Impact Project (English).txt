B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]

deterioration of financial situation of basic utility services (water & electricity).   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will finance the following components:  
 
Component 1: Financing of imports of essential goods and commodities.  This will include 
foodstuff, construction materials, telecommunication equipment, and oil products.  
 
Component 2: Financing of primary and secondary school teachers salaries. The component has 
been designed to first reimburse up to 70% of the teachers'salaries under retroactive-financing 
and then release the balance upon conclusive audit of the eligibility of salaries paid by the 
Government.
