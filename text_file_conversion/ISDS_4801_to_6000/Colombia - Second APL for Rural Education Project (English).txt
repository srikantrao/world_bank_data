2. Project Objectives 
The Project will increase rural access to quality education, in participating certified 
territorial entities, from pre-school to upper secondary education; higher retention of 
children and youths in the school system; and improved capacity for delivery relevant to 
rural communities and their school populations.  
 
The Project seeks to contribute to consolidate the rural education policy developed and 
implemented during Phase I of the Rural Education Project (2001-2006).Phase I helped 
to extend coverage of education services to vulnerable populations, particularly in the 
remote areas.  Phase II will contribute to improve rural education quality (at all levels: 
pre-school, primary and secondary); develop education equity mechanisms for vulnerable 
populations (including ethnic groups); and institutionalize rural education delivery 
capacity in departmental and municipal education secretariats of Colombia.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed Project is an APL (Phase II) for an estimated amount of US$50 million  
including the counterpart contribution. A $40 million investment loan is proposed for 
Page  2
Bank financing.  The Project proposed Project will focus at the school level to improve 
access, completion and quality of learning by including the following three components: 
(i) Secretariat of Education Management Capacity for Rural Education Quality; (ii) 
Strengthening rural School Management to reach better and equitable results in terms of 
access, completion and quality of learning; and (iii) Monitoring, Evaluation and Project 
Management. The execution of the Project will be the responsibility of the Ministry of 
Education, the certified Secretariats of Education, and participating schools.  
 
Component 1: Improving Departmental Secretariat of Education and Municipal 
Management Capacity for Rural Education Quality (Total: US$ 3.0 million; Bank 
financing: US$ 3.0 million).  
 
This component will contribute to build the capacity for systemic change of Secretariats 
of Education in Departments and municipalities of Colombia which are certified (by the 
central Ministry of Education) to manage their own education systems. The proposed 
education system strengthening, at the Departmental and municipal levels, seeks to 
provide equitable education services, compensation strategies to close the gap between 
rural and urban areas, and education delivery mechanisms for the most vulnerable and 
remote populations and ethnic groups.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening rural school management to reach better and equitable 
results in terms of access, completion and quality of learning (Total: US$38.98 million; 
Bank financing: US$30.02 million).  
 
This component will assist school principals, teaching staff, and teacher training 
institutions to develop a better understanding of the educational needs in rural contexts 
and corresponding education interventions in rural areas to improve school performance 
and student learning outcomes.  
 
Through five interrelated sub-components (detailed below) each territorial entity 
participating in the project and base on the criteria established in the operational manual 
will prepare a subproject for and with all the rural schools of its territory  to be funded by 
the project and which expected integrated results will include: (i) quality education 
improvements in beneficiary schools, promoting more equitable access and increasing the 
retention of children and youths; (ii) teacher capacity to implement competency-based 
curricula , which include basic, citizen and overall labor market  competencies; (iii) 
improve bilingual (second language ) pedagogical processes among teaching staff and 
students; (iii) improved pedagogical and school management capacity of principals, 
including reformulation or updating of the PEIs and the design and implementation of 
Improvement Plans; and (iv) application of information and communication technology 
(ICTs) pertinent for the rural sector and to close rural-urban gaps.  
 
Component 3: Strengthening Ministry of Education for Project Coordination and 
Monitoring and Evaluation (Total: US$7.61 million; Bank financing: US$6.98 million).  
 
Page  3
This component will include support for overall Project coordination, supervision, and 
evaluation by: (i) Designing and implementing different studies to promote quality 
education in rural areas; (ii) Designing and implementing a Project-related monitoring 
and evaluation strategy; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the Project Coordination 
Team to comply with its responsibilities for managing the Project. The Project 
Coordination Team will be placed within the Vice Ministry, and there will be a special 
effort to facilitate ownership, continuity of program activities, and ensure sustainability.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Social Safeguards: The project will support the Ethno-education Model proposed by 
MEN to respond to the particular cultural and linguistic needs of Indigenous and Afro-
descendant people of Colombia.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project is under category ìCî, therefore it does not require stand-alone 
environmental assessment. No potential indirect impacts are expected, as no new 
construction will be financed under the project. For generic small works, construction 
guidelines will be incorporated into all bidding documents for contractors.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
A
pilot project is being carried out by the Populations Directorate of MEN, under the 
Social Japanese Development Grant, with three ethnic groups (Ette Ennaka, Uíwa and 
Way√É¬∫u) to test a methodology for project preparation and implementation by ethnic 
groups. Ethno-education subprojects submitted for financing will be formulated by the 
ethnic groups themselves with technical assistance of MEN and support of their 
education specialists, teachers, and traditional authorities. The ethno-education projects 
submitted may include: teacher recruitment and training, curriculum development and 
preparation of culturally-appropriate materials (bilingual or monolingual). MEN will 
draw from the lessons learned from the pilot experience, to formulate an Ethno-education 
Model to be implemented in this demand-driven project. The borrower prepared an 
Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) adequate to respond to the vast ethnic 
and linguistic diversity in Colombia (87 Indigenous groups speaking 67 languages, and 3 
Afro-descendant (Afro-Colombian, Raizales and Palenqueros). A demand-driven 
approach will provide more equal opportunities to access the Rural Education Project.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Permanent consultation processes, Mesas de Concertaci√≥n, have been carried out by 
MEN with the national and subnational Indigenous and Afro-descendant Organizations 
such as the Comisi√≥n Pedag√≥gica Nacional (CPN), Autoridades Ind√≠genas de 
Colombia (AICO), Organizaci√≥n de los Pueblos Ind√≠genas de la Amazon√≠a 
Colombiana (OPIAC), Organizaci√≥n Nacional Ind√≠gena de Colombia (ONIC), and 
Cabildo Mayor dela Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, particularly since 2002.  
 
MEN published the IPP for public information in their website 
www:mineducacion.gov.co on December 10, 2007.
