B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The Extended Deployment of the Enterprise Resource Planning for PLN, is proposed for 
additional financing under the existing Java-Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening 
Project.  
 
The Java-Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening Project's objective is to improve 
the reliability and efficiency of the power system in Java-Bali and strengthen PLN and PGN's 
management capabilities.  This is to be achieved by undertaking the following tasks:  
 
-
Investments related to improving the electricity system and strengthening the transmission 
network;  
 
-
Implementation of a pilot and then a deployment of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) 
system in the Java-Bali business units; and  
 
-
Technical assistance to complete feasibility work for a key power plant in; and strengthen 
capacity and assist with the restructuring of PGN, a state-owned gas company.

The proposed project development objective, structure, and results indicators are reflective of a 
first order restructuring of the project that was approved by the Board on June 19, 2008.  The 
total loan amount of the existing project, including the front end fee, is $141 million. The Java-
Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening Project is performing satisfactorily with 65% 
of the loan disbursed and the remaining funds fully committed.  
 
PLN is now proposing the extended deployment of the ERP system so that they can integrate 
the Business Units outside of Java-Bali into one common business systems platform at an 
estimated cost of $38.5 million.  The World Bank is well placed to assist PLN with this effort, 
having been involved with the ERP deployment from its initial pilot stage.   The expansion to 
business units beyond the Java-Bali network would be a replication of already-developed and 
tested modules and practices, using broadly the same implementation team.  The proposed 
additional financing is a natural extension of the modular deployment of the ERP systems, and is 
fully consistent with the development objective of the existing Java-Bali Power Sector 
Restructuring and Strengthening Project.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
PLN is now proposing an expanded deployment of the ERP system to the rest of its business 
units so that they can integrate the Business Units outside of Java-Bali into one common 
business systems platform.  This would complete the deployment of the ERP across the 
company, further optimize the existing system to maximize its benefits, strengthen their capacity 
to support the system on a continuing basis, and explore options for the next stage of technology 
related enhancements to better manage their customer interface.  The deployment of the ERP to 
the remainder of PLN#s operations is expected to strengthen their management capabilities in the 
"outer islands".  This includes a number of business units that cover a vast geographic area 
operating in many rural and underserved regions of the country.  Since the ERP system would 
then cover most of the company, PLN plans to further optimize the system so that the full 
potential of the integrated system can be realized.  As the ERP system expands coverage, there 
will also be significant additional demands placed on the company's IT Shared Services group. 
PLN plans to significantly strengthen the IT Shared Services group's capacity to support users on 
an ongoing basis.  Given the ERP system's significance to its daily operations, PLN also 
proposes to implement a disaster recovery center to ensure business continuity in the event of a 
disaster. PLN would also like to continue with their Strategic Information Systems plan and 
identify opportunities in Customer Care and Billing. A small component of financing will go 
towards undertaking a detailed diagnostic and developing a roadmap for this critical area. The 
total loan amount for the proposed project is US$38.5 million.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The proposed Project for additional financing will support the deployment of the ERP system to 
PLN's business units beyond the Java-Bali network.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
During the implementation of the Java-Bali Power Sector Restructuring and Strengthening 
Project, PLN has managed environmental and social issues satisfactorily in accordance with the 
project Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and safeguards arrangements endorsed by the 
Page  3
World Bank.  The proposed additional financing for Extended Deployment of the Enterprise 
Resource Planning for PLN does not trigger any safeguards policies of the World Bank.
