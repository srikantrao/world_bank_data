II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The key environmental and social impacts and benefits which may results from activities 
financed under the Project include:  
Page  4
-
Environmental benefits from economies of scale by the provision of common 
wastewater and solid waste management facilities; and environmental planning.  
 
-
Socioeconomic benefits derived from higher living standards, the establishment of 
knowledge-based companies, innovation, increased employment and academic 
opportunities, networking of research organizations and private industry, and the 
development of industries like real estate, retail, lifestyle and recreation.  
 
-
Noise and vibration during construction activities may be caused by the operation 
of pile drivers, earth moving and excavation equipment, concrete mixers, cranes and the 
transportation of equipment, materials and people.  
 
-
Soil erosion may be caused by exposure of soil surfaces to rain and wind during 
site clearing, earth moving, and excavation activities. The mobilization and transport of 
soil particles may, in turn, result in sedimentation of surface drainage networks, which 
may result in impacts to the quality of natural water systems and ultimately the biological 
systems that use these waters.  
 
-
Air quality may be impacted during construction by emissions of fugitive dust 
caused by a combination of on-site excavation and movement of earth materials, contact 
of construction machinery with bare soil, and exposure of bare soil and soil piles to wind. 
During operation, emissions may be generated from kitchen stacks; air conditioning and 
central heating systems; fuel storage tanks (if present); and diesel motor vehicles. 
Specific emissions related to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing (in case 
such a plant is built within the IT parks) include greenhouse gases, toxic, reactive, and 
corrosive substances (for example, acid fumes, dopant, cleaning gases, and volatile 
organic compounds [VOCs]), resulting from diffusion, cleaning, and wet-etching 
processes.  
 
-
Non-hazardous solid waste generated at construction sites may include excess fill 
materials from grading and excavation activities, scrap wood and metals, and small 
concrete spills. Other non-hazardous solid waste generated during operation includes 
office, kitchen, and domestic wastes.  
 
-
Hazardous solid waste that may be generated includes spent solvents and oily 
rags; empty paint cans; chemical containers; used lubricating oil; used batteries (such as 
nickel-cadmium or lead acid); and lighting equipment, such as lamps or lamp ballasts. 
Specific facilities, such as semiconductors (i.e. chip) and electronic manufacturing, -that 
might be built in the IT parks- may include special hazardous wastes, such as those 
generated from spent cleaning solutions, sludge from wastewater treatment, spent epoxy 
material (printed circuit board [PCB] and semiconductor manufacturing), spent cyanide 
solutions (electroplating), and soldering fluxes and metals residue (printed circuit board 
assembly [PCBA]).  
 
-
Hazardous materials include the potential for release of petroleum based products, 
such as lubricants, hydraulic fluids, or fuels during their storage, transfer, or use in 
equipment. These materials may be encountered during decommissioning activities in 
building components or industrial process equipment.  
 
-
Wastewater discharges may include sanitary wastewater with effluents from 
domestic sewage, food service, and laundry facilities serving site employees. 
Miscellaneous wastewater from laboratories, medical infirmaries, water softening etc. 
may also be discharged to the sanitary wastewater treatment system. Process wastewater 
from a number of semiconductor and PCBA manufacturing steps (if these are built within 
Page  5
IT parks) may include organic compounds, particularly non-chlorinated solvents (e.g. 
pyrrole-based, aminebased, fluoro / ether-based resists, isopropyl alcohol, and 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide) from cleaning, resist drying, developing, and resist 
stripping; metals and cyanides from metallization and CMP processes; acids and alkalis 
from spent cleaning solutions, process operations such as etching, cleaning, and 
metallization, among others; and suspended solids from film residues and metallic 
particles (derived from photolithography, metallization, backgrinding, and dicing 
processes).  
 
-
Energy consumption in semiconductor manufacturing involves significant energy 
use.  
 
-
Involuntary physical or economic resettlement during land acquisition to develop 
the IT parks that may include: loss of shelter; loss of assets or access toassets; or loss of 
income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected persons must move to 
another location.  
 
-
Indigenous peoples, although unlikely to be encountered in the outskirts of the 
cities, where the subprojects will be developed, should be considered during the EA. 
Impacts to these vulnerable groups include loss of identity, culture, and customary 
livelihoods, as well as exposure to disease. In addition, indigenous populations might 
have limited capacity to defend their interests in and rights to lands, territories, and other 
productive resources, and/or restricts their ability to participate in and benefit from 
development.  
 
-
Archaeological findings may be encountered and potentially damaged during 
excavation activities of construction works. Culturally sensitive areas (i.e. where cultural 
practices or artefacts are evident) may become impacted both by construction and 
operation works, by modifying the religious or cultural value of a certain area.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
See above.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
As part of the EIA process, Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) will need to be 
prepared and implemented. Effective implementation of EMPs will ensure that the 
appropriate mitigation measures have been employed to avoid and/or minimize any 
potential impacts resulting from the proposed activity. The DDE should agree with 
SEMANART and other federal environment agencies on the supervision of the EMP 
within the overall plan for the project. Accordingly, the supervision arrangements for the 
EMP should summarize key areas on which supervision will focusâ
 ”critical risks to 
implementation of the EMP, how such risks will be monitored during implementation 
and agreements reached with the Proponent. If identified as a requirement of the 
subproject through the screening process, a Resettlement Action Plan, Indigenous 
Peoples Plan, and/or a Physical Cultural Resources Management Plan, or a combination 
of these, is prepared alongside or as an integrated part of the EMP.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
A
detailed 2-day training course will be delivered within the first month of appraising the 
Project (see Table 6). The target audience will be the Secretariat of Economy (SoE); 
Direction of Digital Economy (DDE); SEMANART; and Municipalities that will be part 
of the lending process. It will be the responsibility of the DDE to ensure that short 
refresher trainings on a demand basis are provided to staff within the stakeholder groups. 
This could be a 1-day presentation briefly outlining the procedures of the ESMF.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The ESMF has been designed under the assumption that IT industry projects that involve 
IT Parks are to be implemented by the Direction of Digital Economy (DDE) within the 
Secretariat of Economy - as is the case of the specific project that is used as a practical 
application of the Framework. However, the recommendations and guidelines contained 
in this report would apply to any project implementing unit responsible for directly 
implementing the mechanisms and recommendations outlined in the ESMF. Other 
agencies at the federal and state level and municipal level will also play a key role in the 
implementation and monitoring of the ESMF. These institutions include:  
 
-
Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMANART)  
 
-
Labor and Social Prevision Secretariat  
 
-
State Economic Development Agencies  
 
-
Municipal Land-Use Authorities  
 
-
Municipal Construction Authorities  
 
In regards to resettlement issues, the principal agency that overlooks the fair 
compensation (monetary and in kind) of resettled communities is the Secretariat of 
Agrarian Reform (SecretarÃ­a de Reforma Agraria) which administers the communal 
lands (ejidos) that cover close to 50% of the Mexican territory.  
 
The National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples (ComisiÃ³n 
Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos IndÃ­genas - CDI) is the federal institution in 
charge of promoting and overseeing all issues related to indigenous communities. 
However, in many cases communities are not exclusively indigenous and are therefore 
looked after in broader terms by the Social Development Secretariat (SecretarÃ­a de 
Desarrollo Social - SEDESOL). SEDESOL would be at the forefront of the resettlement 
issue in the event that the lands are not communal (ejiditarias, in which case it would be 
the SecretarÃ­a de Reforma Agraria).  
 
In terms of archeological resources, all matters are regulated and administered by the 
National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de AntropologÃ­a e 
Historia). However, it is important to mention that the EIA processdoes not require an 
archeological survey as part of the baseline studies for an EIS and these are still 
voluntary. However, if this agency is aware of or suspects archeological resources in the 
project area, it may stop all development works until the area has been surveyed.
