B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overarching objective of the project is to improve the quality, sustainability and efficiency of 
urban transport systems in selected Argentinean cities. The specific objectives are to: (i) support 
the creation of institutional frameworks and initiatives that enhance the Authorities capabilities 
to improve the decision making, planning, priority setting, and resource allocation in public 
transport; (ii) improve the physical integration of public transport networks and safety conditions 
in the Great Buenos Aires; (iii) improve the quality and operation of existing public transport 
systems in selected cities.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Lending Instrument. The Borrower will be the Government of Argentina (GoA). The project will 
be supported by a two-step Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The possibility of structuring the 
operation as an APL has been discussed and accepted by the GoA. The first phase of the APL 
would finance a set of investments for up to US$ 300 Million and the trigger to the second phase 
would be the execution of a multijurisdictional public transport investment project. The 
Page  2
Metropolitan Transport Agency could eventually be the executing agency for the second tranche.  
The idea of the Metropolitan Area Agency has been discussed since the start of the PTUBA 
project.  The team believes that the use of the trigger might work as the adequate incentive to 
materialize this long sought objective.  
 
Amount. The initial government request has been for an amount of up to US$300 million for 
the APL1 and up to US$100 million for the APL2. At this stage, the team and the GoA have 
identified three main components which could use the combined total under the two-step APL 
structure. Annex 2 features a detailed budget for each of the project components, however, still 
subject to minor changes to be made during appraisal.  
 
Phasing: Conceptually the phasing of the project is based on the idea that the first phase must 
consolidate the frameworks that are being built with previous projects, in other words: (i) 
planning instruments; (ii) project evaluation and priority setting processes; (iii) creation of the 
multijurisdictional coordination institutions; (iv) prepare the work plan based on 
multijurisdictional projects, for the new Agency in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires; (v) 
provide the transport infrastructure investments in the interior cities whose preparation was 
supported continuously with previous loans. The proposed amount for APL phase 1 is US$300 
million.. The second phase is seen a culmination of the first phase; its main objective will be the 
execution of a multijurisdictional project in the Metropolitan Area of Buenos Aires. The 
execution of this project is seen to be very near impossible without the existence of the 
multijurisdictional coordinating entity, i.e. the Metropolitan Transport Agency. The proposed 
Loan amount for APL Phase 2 is US$100 million.  
 
Project Description. The approach was to focus on supporting efforts to create institutional 
frameworks that will bring sustainability to the sector. In particular, building on the PTUBA, 
PTUBA-AF and GEF the project seeks to consolidate the Metropolitan planning effort into a 
working institutional set-up and scale it up with the corresponding multijurisdictional 
coordinating institution, supporting the creation of the building blocks to adjust the existing 
transport subsidy scheme. In terms of choosing which urban areas to support, it was decided to 
focus on the Great Buenos Aires, in order to continue the efforts of the PTUBA and five cities of 
the interior (Mendoza, C√≥rdoba, Rosario, Tucum√°n and Posadas) again, the approach here has 
been to seek sustainability, the Metropolitan areas and cities chosen to be funded are all those 
that have or are creating: (i) a mobility household survey; (ii) a working Transport and Mobility 
Model; (iii) a Comprehensive Urban Transport Plan; and as a result (iv) feasible projects based 
on a sound evaluation and priority setting framework. Finally, the technical focus the project has 
chosen is to concentrate on public transport, discarding options that are usually favored, such as 
the extension of the road network, because in this way the lower-income population is clearly 
benefited.  
 
The proposed project would have three components.  
 
Component 1: Creation of a Metropolitan Transport Agency (MTA) for Buenos Aires  
 
The objective of this component is to strengthen the local capacity for transportation planning at 
the metropolitan level. This component will prepare the legal, technical, financial and 
institutional conditions for the creation of such entity. The creation of a MTA would clearly be a 
Page  3
significant step forward for urban transport in Argentina. The creation of one for the Greater 
Buenos Aires area has been contemplated for at least three decades and is indispensable to 
rationally restructure inter-jurisdictional bus routes, coordinate bus and subway services, 
implement multimodal integration, especially fare integration, smart card compatibility, subsidy 
and tariff policy that are uniform, etc. This component is further divided in five sub-components:  
 
1.1. Agency Structuring: This sub-component will develop the adequate legal and institutional 
frameworks for the new transport Agency. Hired consultants will assist the local team in 
structuring and presenting the project across all transportation stakeholders in the Area 
Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA  
 
1.2. Consolidation of Transportation Planning in Buenos Aires: This subcomponent will 
support necessary technical efforts for transportation planning activities.  Specifically, it will 
update and complement the current databases that are being collected towards the creation of a 
metro-area transportation model. The ultimate outcome of this component is the development of 
a
transportation plan which can provide strategic direction for the development of the AMBA 
and a medium and long term investment framework. Land use plans and regional air quality 
management will be two elements included in the transportation planning activities.  
 
1.3. Urban Transport Observatory: This subcomponent will finance the creation of an 
Observatory placed within the new MTA, which will collect, process and maintain all the urban 
transport and air quality databases. The Observatory will produce general and specific statistics, 
public policy analyses and inform the Agency decision making efforts. A website will be 
developed to publish all produced information and position the Agency as the leading entity in 
transport planning.  
 
1.4. Fare System Consolidation: This subcomponent will facilitate the provision of a single fare 
media payment technology across all transportation modes in AMBA. It would finance the 
acquisition and implementation of all goods, hardware and software necessary for its proper 
functioning. This investment is expected to improve transit service by saving time to users and 
operators and reduce the current levels of fare evasion. It also lays the adequate infrastructure for 
a
future effort to integrate all fares in the system. The implementation of this subcomponent is 
expected to be gradual and start with the urban and regional trains, while holding the buses and 
colectivos for the second phase of the APL.  
 
1.5. Staff and Operational Expenses: This subcomponent will finance the necessary staff, office 
and other operational expenditures of the Agency for the duration of the project. The main source 
for the technical staff is expected to be a group of young professionals that is being trained 
through the PTUBA. This group will finish their training by April 2010, date by which they 
should join the MTA to perform different tasks.  
 
Component 2: Urban Transport Improvements on Argentinaís interior cities:  
 
The objective of this component is to enhance the mobility conditions of Argentinaís interior 
Metropolitan areas and to strengthen their local transportation planning capacity.  Five cities 
have been selected to participate from the program (Mendoza, Posadas, Tucum√°n, C√≥rdoba 
Page  4
and Rosario) based on their current levelsof progress in the design of proposed sub-projects.  For 
each city, the component will finance: (a) one or more priority sub-projects that are in an 
advanced state of planning and have been evaluated from social, environmental an economic 
perspectives and (b) a set of specific feasibility studies and/or final designs for future projects 
that result from currently undergoing  comprehensive transport studies  . It is worth mentioning 
that the work carried out under
 the GEF Regional Project ìSustainable Transport and Air Quality 
Programî (P114008) allowed to start a dialogue with all the cities considered under this proposed 
loan, which set the bases for defining a sensible approach for sustainable, pro-poor, transport 
projects, in the context of which the combination of GEF and World Bank funding will generate 
obvious synergies.  The package that comprises this component is divided as follows:  
 
2.1. City of Mendoza: This subcomponent will finance infrastructure works in Colector 
Papagayo, such a connection that will improve local mobility between the East-West areas of the 
city and regional connectivity with the West of the Mendoza Metro Area. Infrastructure works 
will mainly comprise paving 3.7 km of the existing road and building an interchange with access 
roads.  
 
2.2. City of Posadas:  This subcomponent will finance infrastructure works along Avenida 
Uruguay and traffic reorganization activities in surrounding streets. This intervention is expected 
to improve public transportation service and relieve traffic bottlenecks.  Infrastructure works 
include the construction of 4 km of segregated bus-way and boarding stations for a currently 
operating Bus Rapid Transit system.  
 
2.3. City of Tucum√°n: This subcomponent will finance infrastructure works in the Barrio 11 
de Marzo, a low income neighborhood which currently lacks proper access roads and storm 
water drainage system. This activity is expected to improve local mobility and decrease the 
levels of work and school absenteeism. Infrastructure works comprise paving 10 km of roads and 
constructing its storm water drainage system.  
 
2.4. City of C√≥rdoba: This subcomponent will finance the construction of the Mitre Intermodal 
transport terminal. This activity is expected to improve modal integration between bus, rail and 
non motorized transport.  
 
2.5. City of Rosario: This subcomponent will finance the infrastructure works in the North 
South corridor, one of the main corridors of the city.  It comprises the construction of a 5 km 
high quality transit system which is expected to improve public transportation service in the short 
term and increase transit rider ship in the medium term.  
 
2.6. Technical assistance:  For each of the participating cities, this subcomponent will finance a 
set of feasibility and/or design studies. These studies will examine projects that have been 
previously identified by ongoing comprehensive studies. This subcomponent is expected to 
support and validate the current transportation planning efforts and institutionalize a rational 
methodology for project development.  
 
Component 3: Traffic safety and modal integration in Buenos Aires  
 
Page  5
The objective of this component is to improve current accessibility and safety conditions in the 
AMBA commuter rail system. This component will include infrastructure works on transfer 
centers, train stations and grade-separated crossings. It will also feature operational 
improvements in the current train signaling system. Suburban rail services have been 
deteriorating after the 2001 crisis, taking a heavy toll on train users, mainly low income people 
from the GBA. Fares are kept at very low levels but users complain heavily about a lack of 
reliability, delays, poor accessibility to train stations, rundown trains and stations, long headways 
between trains, cancelled services and insecurity. This component provides an integral strategy 
to improve service quality by acting simultaneously on bus-train physical integration, 
accessibility to stations, rolling stock improvements, rail-road crossings. The combination of 
these actions will improve the quality of suburban train services in the GBA. There are already 
some on-going works of this type on some rail lines, part of it being financed by the PTUBA, 
which will be complemented by the works envisaged under this operation.  
 
The following is the description of the activities planned for this project.  
 
3.1. Transfer centers:  This subcomponent will finance infrastructure works in three critical 
intermodal centers of the AMBA. These works include the construction of terminals and the 
redesign of the access roads and boarding platforms. These interventions are expected to reduce 
transit travel times by having a smoother transfer and decrease accident rates in the surrounding 
areas due to a better physical integration across modes. The transfer centers are expected to spur 
urban redevelopment by investing in the surrounding public space.  
 
3.2. Station Accessibility:  This subcomponent will improve the access conditions of 40 train 
stations in the AMBA. These interventions will bring the existing stations and access roads to a 
state of good repair. These improvements are expected to enhance the attractiveness of public 
transportation and provide more seamless transfers for intermodal trips.  This subcomponent is 
an extension of the PTUBA work program to a new set of rail stations.  
 
3.3. Grade-separated crossings: This subcomponent will build grade-separated crossings in 
critical railroad intersections. These crossings currently represent unsafe spaces due to a poor 
signaling system and the crime levels in surrounding areas. This is a continuation of the 
successful PTUBA program and is expected to improve traffic safety, personal security and relief 
traffic bottlenecks.  
 
3.4. Train signaling system:  This subcomponent will finance operational improvements in the 
train signaling system and infrastructure improvements in critical intersections. The specific 
interventions w
ere recommended by a recent study and include changing the barrierís circuits, 
repairing existing pavement, reorganizing traffic directions and traffic light sequences and 
educational campaigns.  These interventions are expected to optimize the overall traffic flow in 
the intersections of rail and mixed traffic.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Except for part of the technical assistance activities, the project will be implemented in the 
Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA) and in five cities of the interior (Mendoza, 
C√≥rdoba, Rosario, Tucum√°n and Posadas), all these cities involve densely populated urban 
Page  6
areas with low-income citizens. All the target areas share environmental problems of congestion, 
air quality, livability, public safety and land development. Therefore, all project related works 
will take place in consolidated urban areas and no adverse effects are expected on natural 
habitats, natural resources or ecologically fragile zones, which will need to be confirmed through 
the EIA process. Special attention will be given to the potential impacts of construction in highly 
urbanized areas and the potential impacts of the project, especially on surrounding communities.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower would be the GoA and the Executing Agency would be located in the Secretar√≠a 
de Transporte de la Naci√≥n, which would play the same management and coordination role as 
for the ongoing operation, the ìUrban Transport Project forBuenos Airesî - PTUBA (Loan 4363-
AR and AF Loan 7442-AR) and for the GEF Regional Project ìSustainable Transport and Air 
Quality Programî (P114008). In addition, cities will be encouraged to form counterpart teams 
who will lead the local level institutional development efforts as well as form the core technical 
team where appropriate.  
 
As previously mentioned, the World Bank is currently financing the implementation of the 
PTUBA, and more recently the GEF Air Quality Project. Through these operations, the National 
Secretary of Transport, as well as the sub-national counterparts, has been exposed to the Bank's 
safeguard policies and are now familiar with them. The team in the national PIU has hired an 
Environmental Specialist and a Social Specialist who will supervise safeguard related issues. 
Implementing agencies involved with sub-projects will also include relevant expertise both on 
environmental and social issues.  
 
During preparation of the additional financing for PTUBA, the team prepared a Manual for 
Environmental ands Social Management, dated February 12, 2007. This Manual was considered 
as acceptable to the Bank, and it was disclosed at 
http://ptuba.gov.ar/Componentes/Componentes.htm. Given that the nature and scope of proposed 
activities and sub-projects are similar to those financed by the PTUBA project, the proposed 
project has applied the guiding principles of this Manual on those that have been prepared by the 
participating cities for the recently approved GEF project. Therefore, Manuals acceptable to the 
Bank are already available for the following beneficiary cities:  
 
ï
Tucum√°n: http://ptuba.gov.ar/archivos/manual_manejo_ambiental_social_tucuman.pdf  
 
ï
Posadas: http://ptuba.gov.ar/archivos/manual_manejo_ambiental_social_posadas.pdf

Rosario: http://ptuba.gov.ar/archivos/manual_manejo_ambiental_social_rosario.pdf  
 
ï
Cordoba: http://ptuba.gov.ar/archivos/manual_manejo_ambiental_social_cordoba.pdf  
 
These Manuals provide the guidelines to develop Environmental Management Plans for the 
proposed activities. All sub-projects will be screened and soecific EA and EMPs will be prepared 
prior to appraisal.  
 
A
coordination strategy will be developed before appraisal in order to ensure that all 
participating sub-national entities were enabled to use of the Manual. In particular, and as a first 
step, the projectís preparation team will conduct an updated survey to assess institutional 
capacities in participating municipalities from the Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and 
Page  7
from citie
s
of
Mendoza, C√≥rdoba, Rosario, Tucum√°n and Posadas. A template for this survey 
is included inthe above mentioned Manual for PTUBA. Based on the findings of these surveys, 
the project team will determine the strengthening needs in terms of environmental and social 
management in each sub national counterpart and proposed specific activities tailored for each 
city team.  
 
During the preparation of an additional financing operation for the PTUBA project (Loan 7442-
AR), the team conducted an assessment of the experience under the PTUBA, and conducted a 
screening of a sample of the additional works that were proposed (all rail-road crossings and a 
representative subset of accessibility improvements to suburban rail stations). Based on this 
evaluation, the Bank recommended improving the technical procedures for environmental and 
social assessment and public consultation. The above-mentioned Manual was developed to 
document and standardize common procedures.  
 
During supervision phase of the PTUBA project, the Bank detected some inconsistencies in the 
follow-up of Environmental Assessment reports. During October 2008 a group of stakeholders, 
affected by a sub-project in the South of Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area sent a letter to 
the Bank with a complaint about the quality of an Environmental Assessment report disclosed by 
the project. The Bankís team reviewed and verified that some basic environmental assessment 
standards for Category B projects were not being followed by a participating municipality. Based 
on this finding, and before appraisal, the project team will amend the Manual for Environmental 
and Social Manual including an Annex with quality criteria to apply during the revision and 
approval of Environmental Assessment reports. The Bank will also review again the rationale to 
the system to categorize sub-projects (A, B or C).

Before QER the team and SAT will confirm if the proposed project is classified as Category 
A. The team will collect information to verify if it is likely to have significant adverse 
environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. The team will demonstrate, 
if impacts may affect an area broader than the sites or facilities subject to physical works of sub-
projects. If it is the case, the Borrower will examine the projectís potential negative and positive 
environmental impacts, compares them with those of feasible alternatives (including the "without 
project" situation), and recommend any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or 
compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance. EA will examine the 
sub-project's potential negative and positive environmental impacts and recommends any 
measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate, or compensate for adverse impacts and improve 
environmental performance.  
 
In general terms, the project is expected to have positive environmental impact in the long
-

Yes No TBD 
run, since it aims at improving access and quality of public transport and reducing conflicts 
between rail and motorized traffic, which will reduce congestion and emissions, and improve 
traffic safety. The increase in car ownership and the inefficient management of an aging public 
transport fleet, combined with the proliferation of old and polluting micro-buses and deficiencies 
in bus inspection and maintenance have led to increased congestion and high levels of traffic-
generated air pollution. The proposed project, especially where blended with GEF support 
(P114008), will (a) promote the use of low-emission modes such as high-capacity, clean buses, 
suburban trains and non-motorized transport, (b) improve traffic flows through the removal of 
traffic bottlenecks such as rail-road at-
level crossings and (c) improve the local governmentsí 
capacity to monitorair quality and set better emission standards, in a country where air pollution 
data and monitoring equipments are very scarce and where standards are obsolete.  
 
However, a number of civil works will produce short-term and long-term impacts which 
trigger OP 4.01. The civil works in the Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area will include the 
construction of terminals, the redesign of the access roads and boarding platforms, improvements 
in the access conditions of 40 train stations, the construction of separated crossings railroad 
intersections, and other infrastructure improvements. In interior cities, the project will finance a 
connection to improve local mobility (Mendoza) by paving the existing road and building an 
interchange with access roads; the construction of 4 km of segregated bus way and boarding 
stations for a currently operating Bus Rapid Transit system (Posadas); the paving 10 km of roads 
and constructing its storm water drainage system (Tucuman); the construction of an intermodal 
transport terminal; and the construction of a 5 km high quality transit system (Rosario).  
 
The main direct impacts are expected to occur during construction and cause localized 
negative environmental impacts. Such impacts are expected to consist essentially of noise, 
vibration, dust, and traffic disruption. Additional negative impacts during construction will occur 
due to haulage and final disposal of materials. Most of these impacts can be mitigated by proper 
designs and environmental and social management plans that have to be followed. The project 
will incorporate strategies to increase safety and incentives to reduce air pollution. The civil 
works under the project will follow the alignments of existing roads and right-of-ways as well 
the occupation of state owned properties in urbanized areas and alternatives will be sought to 
prevent potential impacts, especially to avoid resettlements.  
 
Component 1 will finance the creation of a Metropolitan Transport Agency (MTA) for 
Buenos Aires. The objective of this component is to strengthen the local capacity for 
transportation planning at the metropolitan level. The scope of this component represents an 
opportunity to mainstream environmental and social issues to provide strategic direction for the 
development of transport in the AMBA.  
 
Environmental Management Manuals will provide the guidelines to develop Environmental 
Management Plans for the proposed activities. All sub-projects will be screened and specific EA 
and EMPs will be prepared prior to appraisal. Before QER, the team will discuss if an 
Envrionmental Assessment for the project as a whole is required to examine the potential 
combined environmental and social impacts. Environmental and social impacts generated by 
changes in institutional arrangements fo
r
planning and management of urban transport will be

also addressed by this process.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 X  
Since all works are expected to be in densely populated urban areas, the project is not 
expected to finance works which will adversely affect critical and other natural habitats as 
defined under the policy. Nevertheless, the sub-project screening process and project specific EA 
undertaken for specific sub-projects will confirm this assumption. At the same time, the team 
will look for potential opportunities to generate positive impacts on urban natural habitats 
through project activities, especially those related to urban planning.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
The project will not affected forests as defined under the policy nor will it promote forest 
management of any type.  No actions are expected under this policy.   
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
The project will not finance the procurement or use of any pesticides.   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
It is possible that the civil works and consequent transport improvements might directly 
and/or indirectly affect cultural property in cities.  These could include known local structures or 
sites of historic or culturally importance. The project screening and EA process will ensure that 
such sites will be identified and appropriate actions taken if necessary.  In addition, all 
construction contracts will include chance find procedures which will define specific measures to 
be taken in the event that PCR as defined under the policy are found during construction. All 
possible impacts on buildings or other sites of historical or archaeological significance will be 
mitigated as necessary.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
No indigenous people are likely to be affected by the project. The proposed action will not 
directly affect or involve indigenous peoples.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
The proposed road and urban transport improvements will take place within existing rights of  
way and alternatives will be assessed to avoid and minimize any land acquisition or physical 
resettlements. Some works might require land acquisition, causing physical displacement or 
economic displacement. Therefore, a Resettlement Policy Framework already prepared will be 
applied for these circumstances. Before QER, the team will provide a review of performance of 
the RPF prepared, any gaps identified, and measures that will be taken to address such gaps, 
including the specifics for resettlement management in the participating sub-national entities. 
Proposed sub-projects will be finalized and reviewed before appraisal in order to analyze the 
environmental and social impacts. For any identified investment, the potential for involuntary 
resettlement will be addressed and Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared and disclosed 
prior to appraisal. Collaboration among implementation agencies in each city will be ensured to 
handle the management of public space and the process of relocating street vendors.   
Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37) 
 X  
No dams will be constructed under this project.   
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP
 
7.50) 
 X  
No sub-projects affecting international waterways will be financed under this project.   
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP 7.60) 
 X  
No sub-project within disputed areas as defined under the policy will be financed.

B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The environmental and social work for this project will include the following:  
 
1. Survey of institutional capacities in sub-national participating entities. Before appraisal, 
and based in the procedures defined in the already existing Manual for Environmental and 
Social  Management (there is a specific guide available), the pro
jectís preparation team will 
identify and update information related to the capacity in participating municipalities to deal 
with the environmental and social management of future sub-projects to be financed under 
the loan. This survey will determine the existing local capacities and will be key to define 
strengthening needs at local level and to propose specific activities for each city.  
 
2. Development of Environmental and Social Assessments of proposed sub-projects will be 
finalized and reviewed before appraisal in order to analyze the environmental and social 
impacts (positive and negative). A Preliminary Screening will be applied in order to collect 
and compile basic environmental and social data to detect impact for each of the proposed 
projectsí alternatives and to confirm the environmental assessment category. The screening 
will identify physical resettlement and economic displacement, vegetation to be affected, 
flood risk, potential effects on land owners, effects on natural or cultural heritage and on 
urban infrastructure and equipment, etc. An already prepared Screening Datasheet will guide 
the procedure. This datasheet will be filled in the field, by sub-national counterparts, with the 
support and overview of the projectís preparation team.After the screening stage, the 
projectís team will request to municipalities toprepare and Expedite Environmental 
Assessment in order to analyze specific environmental and social impacts, identifying the 
need for future additional studies, following the local regulation and Bankís safeguards, such 
as an EnvironmentalImpact Assessment Reports. Already prepared Expedite Environmental 
Assessment Guidelines will support the procedure. These guidelines will be applied in the

Before appraisal, the Bankís team will review these screenings in order to determine if they 
comply with OP4.01 and are aligned with the environmental category assigned to the project 
and the classification procedure. Before appraisal, the Bank will receive other pending 
screening reports from interior cities as well as for works planned in the Greater Buenos 
Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA). The Bank team and the Client will define as soon as 
possible those proposed sub-projects are beyond the requisites of Expedite Environmental 
Assessments and require Environmental Impact Assessment Reports, including the 
corresponding Environmental Management Plans.  
 
3. Public Consultation and Disclosure. Before appraisal, stakeholders involved with 
subprojects will be consulted regarding the characteristics of them and their social and

them. Evidence of public consultation processes will also be received and disclosed by the 
Client and the Bank before appraisal.  
 
4. Update and Institutional Coordination for the application of the Environmental and Social 
Management Manuals. Before appraisal, the Manual at the National level will be updated by

arrangements for the supervision of environmental and social management issues between 
the Borrower (PTUMA) and the participating cities. The Manual will also include a set of 
standards to ensure quality of Category B Environmental Assessment Reports. Before 
appraisal, the projectís team will lead training seminars in Mendoza, C√≥rdoba, Rosario,

updated (if needed) before appraisal in order to reflect specificities for resettlement 
management in the provinces to which the participating interior cities belong to. In particular 
and before QER, the team will provide a performance review of the prepared Resettlement 
Policy Framework, any gaps identified, and measures that will be taken to address such gaps, 
including the specifics for resettlement management in the participating sub-national entities.
