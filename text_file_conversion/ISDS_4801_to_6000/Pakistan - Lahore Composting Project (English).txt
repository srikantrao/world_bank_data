2. Project Objectives: 
 
The overarching development objectives of the proposed Carbon Finance project are to:  
·
Avoid generation of methane emission from biodegradable wastes; and 
·
Improve cultivated land by using compost as a natural soil conditioner 
 
The Carbon Finance project will provide additional support for achieving the following 
objectives and benefits, namely to reduce carbon emission in a financially sustainable way, to 
promote and provide organic conditioner for agriculture; to increase recycling of valuable 
materials; to reduce health hazard by overall reduction of waste disposed off in landfills; and 
reduce the demand for landfill capacity. 
 
3. Project Description: 
 
This carbon finance project will purchase ERs from the composting plant located in Mehmood 
Booti area of Lahore city. The program shall be financed by Lahore Compost Ltd (LCL) through 
both equity and long term owners-loan provided by the Saif Group, the sole owner of LCL. The 
operational cost will be covered and borrowing will be repaid through sales revenues and future 
carbon finance payments.

The present and planned technology is a relatively simple. But, in absolute terms the capital 
investment is high including primarily civil structures and equipment for handling and screening 
the composting material at different stages. Further, the operation and maintenance cost 
including the cost of debt servicing is fairly high as compared to the low market price of 
compost.  Therefore, additional support is necessary to make the urban waste based compost 
plant viable and financially sustainable.  
 
The plant managed by LCL has been operating on a pilot basis since March 31, 2006.  The 
experience has been very positive so far and the quality of the compost is high. The LCL follows 
standard operation procedures for an aerobic windrow type technology; the plant is technically 
sustainable and in compliance with the Pakistan national environmental quality standards. The 
plant is currently operating with a 300 ton per day (TPD) capacity, but plans to expand to 1,000 
TPD by 2009. All these expansions can materialize within the present premises of LCL.   
 
The expansion of the composting capacity will require both civil works and purchasing 
additional equipment. Both local and imported technology will be used for the composting plant. 
Specific equipment e.g. turner, screener, sorters have been and will be imported from a reputable 
producer of composting machinery. The supply company shall provide warranty and after sales 
service to LCL. The non-specific equipment (e.g. loaders, trolleys, trucks) will be purchased 
locally; likewise civil works for expanding the compost pad and sheds for covering the 
equipment will be constructed locally.  
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project is located at Mehmood Booti bund on the eastern bank of the river Ravi in the city of 
Lahore. The city District Government is using this location as a managed open solid waste 
dumping site, a part of which is now given to LCL to operate a composting plant. The 
surrounding area of the composting plant site includes: the landfill, a newly constructed dual 
carriage way that serves the ring-road for the city; a forest and a sewer canal, and the river-bed of 
Ravi River with forests and cultivated land.  Since the enlargement of the composting plant will 
fully remain within the boundary of the Mehmood Booti landfill, neither involuntary 
resettlement nor constraining activities of indigenous people is expected.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project: 
 
The project does not envisage any large scale, significant or irreversible environmental impacts. 
The environmental and social impacts of the project are primarily positive, since composting will 
substantially reduce the waste dumped to the landfill, cut down the green house gas emissions to 
the atmosphere, provide jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers with a better work 
environment than a landfill; and does not require displacing people. LCL has undertaken an 
environmental and social impact assessment in harmony with the Pakistan Environmental 
Protection Act 1997 and World Bank’s Safeguard policies. An Environmental management Plan 
(EMP) prepared under the project Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) will be 
implemented during the project construction/expansion and operation phases to ensure that there 
are no adverse environmental impacts; rather potential environmental benefits are enhanced.  
 
2. Potential indirect and/or long term impacts: 
 
The communities in the project area are likely to benefit from the project with potential skilled 
and unskilled jobs with a better work environment than a landfill and potential health and 
environmental benefits due to reduction in the amount of waste dumped in the existing 
unsanitary landfill. The project will also contribute in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
thereby supporting and contributing to the global efforts towards minimizing climate changes.   
 
3. Project alternatives considered to help avoiding or minimizing adverse impacts: 
 
In the absence of the project, the waste will be dumped in the unsanitary landfill site. The City 
District Government (CDG) Lahore considered incineration as a potential alternative to the 
project but eventually rejected it due to its adverse environmental impacts and non-feasibility 
based on the characteristics of the solid waste. There is enough evidence to suggest that in the 
absence of this project, status quo or other potential alternatives will have adverse environmental 
impacts. Thus, the proposed project due to its far reaching environmental benefits has been 
presented for the purchase of ERs.

4. Measures taken by the LCL to address safeguard policy issues and assessment of 
LCL’s 
capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
LCL has undertaken an environmental and social impact assessment in harmony with the 
Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 and World Bank’s Safeguard policies. EMP 
prepared under the project ESIA will be implemented during the project construction/expansion 
and operation phases. Further, LCL has developed standard operating procedures based on the 
best available practices to ensure that there are no adverse environmental impacts; rather 
potential environmental benefits are enhanced.  
 
5. Key stakeholders and mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies: 
 
The background information and anticipated development projects in the area were discussed 
with the government officials, CDG Lahore authorities and NGOs like WWF. One week of field 
and research work in the village of Mahmood Booti, and surrounding communities, farms and 
government offices were carried out to collect required information. A semi-structured 
questionnaire was formulated in order to collect essential socio-economic data from the 
community and their possible apprehensions regarding the project. Focused interviews were 
conducted for gender and social impact assessment. ESIA of the project concludes that there is 
no significant environmental and social impact to the stakeholders of LCL as the expansion 
would takes place within the existing composting facility at LCL site and within the already 
determined project boundaries.
