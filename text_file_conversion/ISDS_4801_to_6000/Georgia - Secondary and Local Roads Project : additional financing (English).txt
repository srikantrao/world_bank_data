II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is not expected to have significant impact on the environment.  All planned 
physical works are limited to rehabilitation of the existing alignments.  Overall long term 
social and environmental impacts will be positive, while negative impacts will be of 
minor scope and duration, and typical for any road rehabilitation activity.  
 
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) are being prepared for all road rehabilitation 
sub-projects included in the AF. These site-specific EMPs specify environmental risks 
associated with rehabilitation works to be carried out in the respective locations, 
recommend respective mitigation measures, and provide monitoring schemes for tracking 
adherence to the mitigation plans. Implementation of EMPs will be sufficient for keeping 
environmental impacts of the project-supported civil works down at the acceptable 
minimum level.  
 
All civil works will be conducted within the existing right of way.  No acquisition of 
private land, physical relocation of households or closure of businesses is anticipated.  
The OP 4.12 will not be triggered.   
Page  4
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No indirect and long term negative impacts are anticipated due to future activities in the 
project area.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Considering project alternatives was not relevant, as no adverse impacts are anticipated. 
It will improve the existing network of roads critically important for rural livelihood.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower's implementing agency for the AF is the RDMRDI, assisted by the 
Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center (TRRC), acting as a PIU.  These agencies 
are experienced and well performing in the implementation of the World Bank financed 
operations (First and Second East-West Highway Improvement Projects and the original 
Secondary and Local Roads project are currently successfully underway).  RDMRDI has 
received technical assistance aimed at strengthening institutional capacity for better 
handling environmental and social implications of planning, construction, management 
and maintenance of roads. Staff are trained and provided with technical guidebooks. 
Supervision of the implementation of EMPs under the original project has been positive.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
An environmental assessment and protection framework (EF) was prepared for the 
project in 2004 and then updated without major changes in preparation of AF in October 
2008.  The updated version of the EF was re-
disclosed through the RDMRDI’s web page 
on November 26, 2008 and a consultation meeting was held on December 18, 2008.  The 
EF with the attached minutes of the consultation meeting was posted in the Bank’s 
InfoShop on January 30, 2009.  
 
EMPs are already prepared for the majority of road sections to be rehabilitated under the 
AF, and the rest are being prepared under the AF.  A number of EMPs have  already been 
reviewed and cleared by the Bank.  The EMPs will be disclosed through the same media 
as the EF and will then be finalized in consultation with local communities prior to the 
commencement of works.
