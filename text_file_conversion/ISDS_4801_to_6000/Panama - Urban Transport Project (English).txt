B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to strengthen the capacity of the 
GOP for planning, supervising and implementing reforms to the transport sector; (ii) to improve 
public transport service quality by helping the government consolidate ongoing reforms to the 
current public transport system; (iii) to implement where demand justifies it, public mass transit 
facilities to improve service efficiency and throughput; and (iv) to improve accessibility and 
mobility to low-income areas.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Bank engagement in PanamÃ¡ through the analytical work and the PPIAF grant helped the GoP 
consider several alternatives, discard some, and arrive at a feasible solution. One alternative 
discarded by the government for posing a high risk was to concession both infrastructure 
construction and bus service provision in a Design Build Operate Scheme. The GoP has also 
studied the possibility of undertaking a rail transit project, but discarded the idea on cost 
efficiency grounds. The chosen alternative is already under partial implementation by the GoP.

The project is expected to have three main components:  
 
Component 1 -
 Technical support for the government’s implementation of a transition strategy 
from the existing public transport system to a reformed system:  
 
Component 1 seeks to provide technical assistance and to continue institutional strengthening at 
Autoridad de Transito y Transporte Terrestre (ATTT) and Gerencia Metropolitana de Transporte 
(GMT) in order to help the government implement its short term strategy. The strengthening will 
help these institutions to implement the current plans, ensure that quality of service is improved, 
and ensure adequate service planning and monitoring can take place once the concessions start 
operating. Short-term consultants will be hired to aide the government to manage the reforms. 
Consultants in legal, transport engineering, administrative processes, and social communications 
are needed. [Individual consultants will be used to speed up contracting in an attempt to match 
the government’s calendar.] These consultants will also prepare terms of reference for the studies 
proposed in component 2. This component will have a cost of US$ 1.0 million.  
 
Component 2 – Institutional strengthening:  
 
Component 2 seeks to build capacity in the GoP to plan reforms, implement them, and regulate 
public transportation services. Current capacity in these areas is not as strong as it should be 
given the pressing demand. Reforms implemented by the project will require strong management 
capacity in all areas if they are to lead to satisfactory results. This component has two 
subcomponents:  
 
ïƒ˜ 
Subcomponent 2.1 – Training: the project seeks to train professionals in areas such as 
transport engineering and planning, regulation of bus services, among others.  
 
ïƒ˜ 
Subcomponent 2.2 – Development of planning tools, which include:  
 
•
Comprehensive demand modeling exercises, including house-hold surveys, an Origin-
Destination study (trip generation, trip distribution, modal split and assignment), traffic and 
passenger counts, and users’ value of time, among others. The resulting model will be used to 
design bus route restructuring, define fare levels, and study alternatives for mass transit corridors 
(for example using BRT technology), including transfer terminals and feeder routes.  
 
•
Master Mobility Plan for the PCMA to help guide the city’s overall mobility 
improvements in a direction that is sustainable in the long term, and more cost efficient.  
 
•
An environmental evaluation, and a social impact assessment of the proposed project and 
to determine mitigation measures. These studies will be done following Bank safeguard policies 
and will be carried out during project preparation.  
 
•
Engineering design studies for the implementation of the infrastructure elements. These 
studies will apply Bank safeguard policies and will be carried out during project preparation.  
 
•
Communications plan to inform the community about the proposed changes.  
 
Component 2 will have a cost of US$ 7.0 million.  
 
Component 3 – Supporting infrastructure for the improvement of public transportservices and 
urban mobility:  
Page  3
Component 3 includes infrastructure upgrades such as BRT facilities, with segregated lanes for 
buses, stations, and upgrades to pedestrian infrastructure. This project component also considers 
improvements to sidewalks, for example by helping the government plan and implement 
measures to curb parking on sidewalks, among others. Finally, the component has an element 
that seeks to improve access to low income neighborhoods, specifically for feeder routes that 
will take passengers to the trunk lines of the BRT. The BRT will be installed along existing road 
corridors and only minimal widening will be needed at some locations, given the existing street 
right of way. This widening may in some instances require modest land acquisitions from 
neighboring residents and commercial properties at specific points, for example, at high-demand 
stations that will be determined by detailed studies. In case people need to be resettled, a 
resettlement action plan will be prepared and implemented. The same approach will be followed 
for environmental issues. All mitigation measures will comply with Bank safeguard policies. 
This component will have a cost of US$ 92 Million.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Metropolitan Area of Panama City   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Low. The borrower has limited experience in applying safeguard policies and following Bank 
procedures.  However, the project has a capacity building component, where the Bank will 
support local agencies to develop an adequate level of safeguard policy management. Moreover, 
Bank missions will supervise and contribute to efforts that enhance the implementation of 
safeguard policies.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  09/15/2009 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
Studies financed under the loan will assess the environmental and social dimensions so as to 
minimize potential disruptions. The construction of the project may induce social and 
environmental impacts. However, involuntary resettlements should be modest, because the 
BRT line will be mostly implemented on existing road rights of way, which are seemingly 
wide enough for BRT lines. In the downtown area, the corridors could be too narrow. To 
prevent land takings, preliminary engineering designs indicate using either exclusive streets 
for buses and pedestrians and/or having one direction use one street and the opposition 
direction use a parallel street. The BRT line will affect mostly businesses and street vendors 
during construction and it may not be necessary to displace anyone from the right of way. 
Nonetheless, two principal documents will be produced to adequately steer physical works: 
(i) Environmental Management Plan to mitigate risks associated to OP 4.01 (infrastructure 
works) and OP 4.11 (historical monuments and cultural sites).  (ii) Resettlement Action Plan 
to mitigate risks associated to OP 4.12 (involuntary resettlement).
