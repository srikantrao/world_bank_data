B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The primary project development objective for the project is to increase the capacity and 
reliability of electricity supply in Cameroon through the implementation of the Kribi gas to 
power generation project, thereby contributing to growth and poverty reduction in Cameroon.  A 
secondary project development objective is to improve access to private finance for the 
development of Cameroonís electricity sector, including local currency financing   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
of a gas-fired power plant with a capacity of at least 150 MW located in the Mbolongwe village, 
9
km
north of the coastal city of Kribi in the southern province of Cameroon.  A 100 km 225 kv 
dual transmission line will run between Kribi and the existing Mangombe 225/90kV substation 
at Ed√©a in the Littoral Province.  The choice of technology for the power plant (gas engines or 
Page  2
turbines) is being finalized.  Additional investment components include (i) the Sanaga South gas 
field which is being developed by a joint venture between the national oil co
mpany (Societ√© 
Nationale des Hydrocarbures - SNH) and the private company Perenco Cameroun under a 
production sharing agreement and financed by Perenco, and (ii) the CPF site at Bipaga and a gas 
pipeline linking the CPF and the power plant at Mpolongwe, financed by SNH.  Gas supply 
arrangements between SNH and Perenco (GSA 1) and SNH and KPDC (GSA 2) are being 
finalized.  AES Sonel will be the sole off-taker of electricity produced by KPDC under an armsí 
length Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) under negotiation.  KPDC will sign an operations and 
maintenance contract with AES Sonel.  The aluminum smelter, Alucam, Cameroonís single 
largest industrial electricity consumer, will ensure a stable base load for the project by taking up 
to 50 MW.  
 
Depending on the choice of technology, total project cost is estimated in the area of US$300 
mm, of which up to US$225 mm debt financing (75%) and US$75 mm equity (25%).  The 
World Bank will provide a Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) for the Kribi gas power generation 
project for a total amount up to $60 million.  The PRG is expected to cover government 
obligations under the GSA 2, IPP licenses and other project documents as relevant.  The PRG 
will allow local Cameroonian banks to participate in the project financing.   Local currency 
finance will reduce foreign exchange risk, allow local banks to lend to KPDC with a long-term 
maturity and reduce interest rates with positive impacts on consumer tariffs.  Other Development 
Finance Institutions including IFC will provide foreign currency syndicated loan financing for 
the project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project involves the development of the offshore Sanaga South gas field, a pipeline to bring 
the gas onshore for treatment at the CPF at Bipaga 1, a pipeline to transport the treated gas to the 
gas power plant located in the Mbolongwe village, 9 km north of the coastal city of Kribi in the 
southern province of Cameroon, and a 100 km 225 kv dual transmission line between Kribi and 
the existing Mangombe 225/90kV substation at Edea in the Littoral Province.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The main institution with responsibility for the environment is the Ministry of Environment and 
Protection of Nature of the Republic of Cameroon.  The environmental law of 1996 and its 
implementation decrees require that environmental assessments be conducted for all large energy 
and other infrastructure projects which have to be approved by the Ministry of Environment and 
Protection of Nature through a Certificate of Conformity.  The capacity of all governmental 
agencies of implementing environmental regulation in a sustainable way and supervising the 
enforcement of environmental management plans can be strengthened.  For this purpose, the 
World Bank has recently approved a $20 mm Environmental and Social Capacity Building in the 
Energy Sector Project.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
The Kribi gas power project involves construction of a gas-fired power plant and a 100 km 
225kV dual transmission line.  Associated facilities include the development of the offshore 
Sanaga South gas field, an offshore gas pipeline from the gas field to the Central Processing 
Facility (CPF), the construction of the CPF at a separate site from the power plant and an 
onshore gas pipeline between the CPF and the power plant.  Environmental and Social Impact 
Assessments (ESIAs) have been conducted for the power plant, transmission line, gas field and 
CPF site.  These studies have been disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop and in country on 
February 25, 2008.  A Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) has been conducted, public 
hearings were held in country on February 14, 2008 and the draft REA has been disclosed in the 
World Bank Infoshop and in country on February 25, 2008.  The final REA will be available 
before appraisal and include an environmental impact assessment for the onshore gas pipeline 
between the CPF and power plant.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The project area touches on the regionís rich biodiversity, including forests, wetlands, marine 
life (including marine turtles), fisheries and tourism.  The REA has been prepared to assess the 
magnitude of the cumulative development initiatives on the region. An in-depth biodiversity 
study will be conducted within the first 12 months of the project.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
Archeological sites including a diverse human settlement exist in the surface area of the 
Mpolongwe gas power plant site.  An archeological study was conducted for the site and 
disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop and in country on February 25, 2008.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
The project area affects the livelihood of indigenous peoples, including pygmies, 
Bankola/Kola and Bantou communities.  A Community and Indigenous Peoples Plan (CIPP) was 
developed to address and mitigate these impacts.  The CIPP has been disclosed in the World 
Bank Infoshop and in country on February 25, 2008.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The project provides a partial risk guarantee for a gas power plant.  The following documents 
have already been prepared prior for the gas power plant as well as associated facilities 
(offshore gas wells, pipelines, central gas processing plant, transmission line) and have been 
disclosed in the World Bankís InfoShop: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment 
(ESIA), Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Community and Indigenous Peoples Plan (CIPP), 
and Archaeological Survey Report.  A Regional Environmental Assessment (REA) has been 
conducted, public consultations on the draft final report were held on February 14, 2008 and 
the draft REA has been disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop and in country on February 25, 
2008.  The report will be finalized before appraisal and will include the EIA for the gas 
pipeline between the gas power plant and central gas processing plant.These safeguard 
studies will be disclosed in the country and at the World Bank InfoShop prior to appraisal.  A 
more in depth biodiversity study will be completed within 12 months of project start-up.  As 
part of their due diligence on a planned investment in the project, IFC has, amongst other 
studies, conducted a rapid biodiversity study.
