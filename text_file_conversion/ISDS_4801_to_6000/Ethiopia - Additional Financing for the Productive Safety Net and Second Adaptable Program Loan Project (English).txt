2. Project Objectives 
The overall objective of the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) is to contribute to 
reducing household vulnerability and improving resilience to shocks.  This will be 
achieved through reform of the humanitarian emergency system to a development-
oriented program which provides timely, predictable and adequate transfers to 
beneficiary households, thus allowing effective, consumption-smoothing and avoiding 
asset depletion; creates productivity and sustainable community assets; contributes to 
large-scale rehabilitation of severely degraded areas; stimulates local markets through 
demand linkages; and establishes more effective responses to drought shocks to avoid 
increasing destitution among affected households.  
 
The objective of this financing from the European Union Food Crisis Rapid Response 
Facility (EUFCRRF) is to ensure that the Productive Safety Net Program has adequate 
resources to continue to function effectively, thereby mitigating the impact of recent price 
shocks on the poorest and most vulnerable in Ethiopia.  Resources from EUFCRRF 
would allow the PSNP to continue to operate in 2009 as designed, while a rapid response 
would ensure that there are no delays in the distribution of transfers to beneficiaries. 
Page  2
Funds would be channeled as Additional Financing through the existing World Bank 
APL II Project.  
 
The project activities consist of a public works program, the objective of which is to 
contribute to watershed development, environmental transformation, improved farming 
and land-use management systems and community infrastructure, under the community 
watershed development approach of the government.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed instrument is being processed under OP/BP 8.00. Since such instruments 
can make funds available quickly, it is well suited to respond to Ethiopia's short-term 
needs for additional support to the PSNP.  
 
The proposed Project consists of additional financing to fill the PSNP financing gap that 
has emerged as a result of food price inflation. Specifically, financing would be used to 
provide cash and in-kind transfers to food insecure households. Financing would be 
channeled through the existing World Bank APL II project, allowing it to continue to 
meet its development objectives. The funds provided would allow the program to cover 
for one year an estimated 632,556 chronically food insecure beneficiaries.  
 
Around 80% of beneficiaries would participate in labor-intensive public works, building 
productive community assets that are planned within a watershed management 
framework. These community activities will include micro- and small-scale area 
closures/woodlots, agro-forestry, soil and water conservation measures such as hillside 
terracing and soil bunds, mulching of degraded areas, gully control, community roads, 
stream diversions, shallow wells, spring development, small dams, water ponds, drainage 
canals, vegetative fencing, fodder system collection, multi-purpose nurseries, 
construction and repair of classrooms, health posts and latrines, and the construction of 
child care centres.  
 
Around 20% of beneficiaries would be from labor-poor households including elderly, 
chronically sick or otherwise incapacitated households and these would receive transfers 
as Direct Support.  
 
The current World Bank APL II Project is supporting the PSNP with a consortium of 
partners including CIDA, DFID, IrishAID, EC, RNE, SIDA USAID, and WFP, who 
together have committed cash and in-kind resources valued at around US$1.2 billion 
during the current phase of the Program from 2007-2009.  All partners pool resources and 
provide on-going financing to the Program, which has an established track record of 
providing transfers on a timely basis.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project will be country-wide; public works activities under the PSNP will be carried 
out in some 290 woredas in Oromia, Amhara, SNNPR and Tigray Regional States,

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:  
 
One of the key objectives of the PSNP is to address the underlying causes of food 
insecurity, to which land degradation is universally agreed to be a major contributor, 
particularly in highland areas. Thus the design of the PSNP public works program, is 
intended to have environmentally positive impacts. Indeed, these activities, which 
include, for example, soil and water conservation, land reclamation and improvement of 
community infrastructure, have already been shown to constitute a vehicle for significant 
environmental transformation and enhanced productivity.  
 
It is nonetheless common knowledge that past mass-mobilization efforts in 
environmental rehabilitation in Ethiopia have sometimes failed or have been abandoned, 
as a result of which the environment has returned to its degraded state. Furthermore, 
negative impacts may occur if the locations or designs of the community activities do not 
follow good environmental practice, or if they are incompatible with optimum overall 
management of the watershed. Typical negative impacts that might occur from the micro- 
and small-scale community activities include the following:  
 
Community Road Construction and Rehabilitation Impacts  
 
-
Alteration of drainage patterns and increased flooding and soil erosion from road 
construction and materials excavation sites  
 
-
Right of way removal of vegetation and natural habitats  
 
-
Sedimentation of aquatic systems from soil erosion and runoff  
Page  4
-
Impact of increased human use on adjacent habitats and wildlife

To address such issues, the approach to the environmental performance and 
sustainability of the public works program is three-pronged:  
 
(i)  Public works are derived from a community-based approach to integrated watershed 
management, a process which forms the basis of the awareness-creation and training 
program, supported by a budget to provide technical and material inputs. Moreover, the 
PSNP public works are also viewed as contributing to the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI);  
 
(ii) 
Standards to be followed in the design and implementation of the individual 
public works are established in Community-Based Participatory Watershed Development 
Guidelines published by the MOARD. These are made available to concerned woreda 
staff and Development Agents, who are trained in the techniques set out in the 
Guidelines. These Guidelines include detailed provisions for area closure, which are 
based on participatory community planning of all activities. This provides for community 
management of the closed areas to allow farmers and families whose traditional access 
has been voluntarily reduced to have continued access to the closed area for the collection 
of fodder and other forest products, in order to ensure that there is no reduction in 
livelihoods.  
 
(iii) 
The process of selection and screening of public works for possible negative 
environmental impacts, and ensuring that appropriate mitigating measures are 
incorporated in the design as appropriate, is in accordance with Ethiopia's Environmental 
Impact Assessment proclamation. The process is documented in the ESMF produced by 
the Government and disclosed.  
 
To address the possible use of small quantities of pesticides in small-scale irrigation 
schemes, the government Guide for Integrated Pest Management in Small-Scale 
Irrigation Schemes is published and disclosed under APL II, in accordance with the 
ESMF and OP 4.09.  
 
From an environmental and social safeguard standpoint, the proposed operation is a 
Category B project, since impacts of the project, for the most part, will be minimal, site-
specific and manageable to an acceptable level.  
 
In summary, this emergency operation triggers three safeguard policies: The 
Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01); the Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09), 
predicated on the possibility of small quantities of pesticides being employed in small, 
community-level irrigation projects; and the International Waterways Policy (OP 7.50), 
because of small-scale irrigation projects that may be implemented in watersheds of three 
international waterways.  
 
It may be noted that the PSNP public works program does not involve any resettlement 
or involuntary loss of assets or access to assets. Such projects are not permitted under the 
PSNP. Thus the Involuntary Resettlement policy is not triggered.  
 
Previously undertaken assessments have confirmed that the project has well-defined 
targeting instruments to reach the poorest of the poor. In Ethiopia, there are many 
vulnerable groups with various ethnic backgrounds. To date, indigenous peoples, as 
defined by the World Bank, have not been identified in Ethiopia. Vulnerable groups 
Page  7
under the PSNP include chronically food insecure households who are the target 
beneficiaries under PSNP APL1 and the current APL 2.  Given the PSNP's overall 
objective to promote food security among chronically food-insecure households, the 
project does not have any foreseen negative impact on vulnerable groups. However, a 
social assessment will be carried out in project areas to confirm that particularly 
vulnerable or marginalized groups, including any indigenous groups as defined in OP/BP 
4.10, are appropriately treated. Where necessary, the assessment will make 
recommendations as to whether and how such groups, if any, should be given access to 
project benefits on a priority basis. In light of the above, OP/BP 4.10 is not triggered.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Future activities are expected to consist of further watershed development interventions, 
and improved farming and land-use management systems, under the community 
watershed development approach of the government. They are expected to make further 
contributions to environmental regeneration and transformation, which is one of the 
objectives of the PSNP.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The public works are designed to have positive environmental impacts. However, each 
project is screened under the ESMF procedures, and should there be any anticipated 
negative impacts, these are addressed by re-designing the project at planning and design 
stage, or substituting another community project.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
A
series of legal proclamations form the basis for the environmental assessment and 
management framework in Ethiopia:  
 
The Proclamation on the establishment of Environmental Protection Organs (No. 
295/2002); The Proclamation on Environmental Impact Assessment (No. 299/2002); and 
The Proclamation on Environmental Pollution Control (No. 300/2002).  
 
There are two key public institutions that are directly responsible for monitoring 
environmental compliance. These are the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) and 
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MoARD), which have decentralized to 
the regional level. In the case of MoARD, decentralization has gone further to the woreda 
and kebele levels. There exists a critical mass of capacity within the (MoARD) and EPA 
at the federal and decentralized levels to manage environmental and social safeguard 
issues.  
 
The process of selection and screening of public works for possible negative 
environmental impacts, and ensuring that appropriate mitigating measures are 
incorporated in the design as appropriate, is in accordance with Ethiopia's Environmental 
Impact Assessment proclamation. The process is documented in the ESMF produced by 
Page  8
the Government. The ESMF, produced by Government and disclosed under APL II, is 
incorporated in the awareness-creation and training programs. Responsibilities for its 
implementation and monitoring are designated at federal, regional, woreda and kebele 
levels in the ESMF: Implementation Guidelines.  In addition, joint government-donor 6-
monthly public works reviews are conducted, which include monitoring of ESMF 
implementation, followed by corrective measures if required.  
 
These reviews have shown that while the ESMF system is in use, and 6,000 
Development Agents (Agricultural extension staff) have been trained in its 
implementation, there remains room for improvement, due mainly to staff turnover and 
the administrative difficulties in ensuring and documenting screening of some 34,000 
separate activities each year. In order to strengthen government#s capacity to apply the 
ESMF to a higher standard, the PW Coordination Unit (PWCU) has been strengthened, 
as of April 2009, by the addition of five EC- and CIDA-financed Technical Advisors, 
whose mandate includes improving the capacity of the regional PW Focal Units (PWFU) 
to manage the M&E and ESMF screening of the PW activities. This also includes the 
appointment of a TA specializing in Infrastructure and Environment, whose mandate 
includes oversight and streamlining of the ESMF system, and Government-hired Advisor 
on Environment, and a TA specializing in capacity-building, whose mandate includes 
upgrading of the ESMF training packages.  
 
Furthermore three of the five internationally-financed TAs are specialists in M&E, and 
their mandate includes upgrading the PW M&E system. Specific tasks include the 
monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the ESMF system and related 
safeguards instruments.  
 
To address the potential small-scale use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers, the 
government Guide for Integrated Pest Management in Small-Scale Irrigation Schemes is 
published and disclosed, in accordance with the ESMF and OP 4.09. In order to address 
projects that might include the renovation or extension of medical clinics in the public 
works program, the government's Waste Management Guide for Rural Health Clinics is 
published and disclosed, in accordance with OP 4.01.  
 
For APL I, Government and the Bank notified the concerned countries in accordance 
with the International Waterways Policy OP 7.50, covering the 5-year period of APL I 
and APL II. Since (i) the APL II Additional Financing (FY 09) lies within this period, 
and (ii) water abstraction rates are well within notified levels, there is no need for further 
notification for the Additional Financing.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the beneficiary farmers and their families, and those involved in 
the implementation of the program. The provisions of the ESMF are incorporated into the 
training materials used at woreda and kebele levels, which reach over 1 million 
beneficiary households, and are regularly updated according to community and 
government staff feedback. Following consultations in accordance with government and 
Page  9
World Bank policies, the ESMF was disclosed under APL II on 11/10/2006, as were the 
Guidelines on Integrated Pest Management and Medical Waste Management.
