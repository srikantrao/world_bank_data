B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overall objective of the project is to contribute to the achievement of the water and sanitation 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by increasing sustainable access to water and 
sanitation services in urban areas.  This will be pursued by: (a) facilitating access to services 
through subsidized programs for constructing water service connections and public standpipes 
and on-site sanitation facilities; and (b) consolidating the achievements of the reform of the 
urban water supply sub-sector and strengthening capacities to deliver and manage services.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project would comprise three components: (i) urban water supply in four cities; (ii) 
urban sanitation in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso; and (iii) capacity strengthening to 
improve the sub-
sectorís performances and to warrant the efficiency of investments. The three 
components will be implemented by the relevant departments of ONEA.  
 
Component 1 - Urban water (US$50.93 million): includes the following activities.  
 
Ouagadougou (US$12.51 million).  This subcomponent will be implemented by the Ma√Ætrise 
díouvrage de Ziga (MOZ), ONEAís department in charge of Ouagadougou water investments.  It 
Page  2
will help to:  (i) expand the distribution networks by 175 km; and (ii) expand access by installing 
25,000 household connections and 50 standpipes.  
 
Bobo-Dioulasso (US$28.00 million).  This subcomponent will be implemented by the 
Department of Investment Programming (DPI), ONEAís department in charge of water 
investments outside of Ouagadougou.  It will help to (i) expand the water production and storage 
capacity (two new production boreholes, one new treatment unit and two elevated water tanks); 
(ii) expand the distribution system (new pumping stations and 428 km distribution networks); 
and (iii) expand access by installing 30,000 household connections and 120 standpipes.  
 
Koudougou (US$7.90 million).  This subcomponent will be implemented by DPI and will help 
to (i) reinforce the water production and storage capacity (rehabilitation of water intake, new 
electricity supply line and one elevated water tank); (ii) expand the distribution system (80 km of 
distribution networks); and (iii) expand access by installing 2,500 household connections and 10 
standpipes.  
 
D√©dougou (US$2.52 million).  This subcomponent will be implemented by DPI and will help 
to (i) expand the water production and storage capacity (two new production boreholes and one 
elevated water tank); (ii) expand the distribution networks by 40 km; and (iii) expand access by 
installing 200 household connections and 20 standpipes.  
 
Component 2 - Access to sanitation (US$35.78 million): This component will be implemented 
by the Sanitation Department of ONEA (DASS) and includes the following activities.  
 
Ouagadougou (US$17.50 million).  This subcomponent will help to: (i) expand access by 
installing 18,000 household latrines and 27,000 household washing facilities; (ii) provide 
improved water and sanitation in 250 schools by connecting them to the water system and 
installing blocks of latrines; and (iii) provide adequate disposal of effluents by installing two 
sludge treatment plants.  
 
Bobo-Dioulasso (US$10.67 million).  This subcomponent will help to: (i) expand access by 
installing 10,000 household latrines and 15,000 household washing facilities; (ii) provide 
improved water and sanitation in 100 schools; and (iii) provide adequate disposal of effluents by 
installing two sludge treatment plants.  
 
Technical Assistance (US$7.61 million).  This subcomponent will help to: (i) mobilize the 
population, manage contracts and supervise works through NGOs and other private partners; (ii) 
train local masons and contractors; and (iii) support activities with media campaigns, hygiene 
education and training in maintenance of facilities.  
 
Component 3 - Institutional support and capacity building (US$3.43 million): This component 
will be implemented by the Human Resources Department of ONEA (DRH) and includes the 
following activities.  
 
Institutional Support (US$1.25 million). This subcomponent will help to: (i) assess the 
performances and viability of ONEA (technical audits and assistance to the implementation of 
the financial model); (ii) transfer know-how (partnerships with performing utilities); and (iii) 
review the impact and suitability of access options proposed to households (mid-term surveys 
and assessments of pilot programs).  
 
Strengthening of capacities (US$2.17 million).  This subcomponent will help to: (i) improve 
reliability and accountability (strengthening the Internal Audit Department); (ii) improve 
customer management (technical assistance and procurement of advanced technologies (portable 
Page  3
billing stations, remote metering and prepayment)); and (iii) improve staff skills (training in 
project management, procurement and technical management).  
 
The above components are developed through preparatory activities entirely financed by ONEA 
at a cost of US$1.04 million.  The preparation activities are being coordinated by MOZ, which 
carried out the coordinating role under the Ziga Project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
For urban water supply, the project will focus on four cities, namely the capital city 
Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Koudougou and Dedougou.  As regards urban sanitation, the 
project will focus on Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. However, specific areas of intervention 
in the said cities will be determined by technical studies.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower has reasonable capacity implementing project environmental and social safeguard 
measures in virtually all sectors.  In this sector, in particular, the Borrower has successfully 
implemented the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) 
for the Ougagdougou Water Supply Project (OWSP - closed in 2007).  While the same 
institutional framework used for the OWSP will be adopted for the proposed project, any 
capacity strengthening measure deemed necessary to improve the safeguard function in this 
operation will be carried out.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
OP 4.01 is triggered because of the potential environmental impacts resulting from project 
activities.  However, those impacts are expected to be minimal, site-specific and manageable to 
an accepted level, particularly according to the regional experience of building such 
infrastructure. It is expected that the sludge treatment plants would not have significant 
environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented. Due to the difficulty 
inherent in defining what the real environmental impacts of envisioned sub-projects are, and 
determining what mitigation measures to put in place, an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) will be developed.  The ESMF will formulate standard methods and 
procedures, along with institutional arrangements for screening, review, approval and 
implementation and monitoring of subprojectsí specific EMPs, includingthe preparation of 
environmental clauses to be inserted in contractorsí biddingdocuments. In that respect, it will be 
agreed with the Borrower at appraisal that the preparation of sub-projects specific EAs/RAPs is a 
condition of disbursement for each sub-project.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
The water infrastructure sub-projects are not expected to lead to new land acquisition or 
significant restriction of access to sources of livelihood. However, the beneficiary cities will 
potentially request assistance in expanding its distribution network which might lead to some 
restriction and/or land acquisition. Therefore the Borrower through ONEA will prepare a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which will be disclosed prior to appraisal as a free-
standing document along with the ESMF.  During implementation, an assessment will be carried 
out for each sub-project to determine whether land will be acquired and whether a sub-project 
specific Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is required.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  02/03/2009 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) are 
applicable under the project which has been assigned to Category B.  Since specific areas of 
intervention cannot be confirmed prior to appraisal, the Borrower will prepare an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) acceptable to the Bank and they will be disclosed in-country and at the 
Bankís Infoshop prior to project appraisal.   
 
1
Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
