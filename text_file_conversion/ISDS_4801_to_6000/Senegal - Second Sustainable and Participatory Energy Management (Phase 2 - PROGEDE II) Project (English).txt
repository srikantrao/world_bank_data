B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the “Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project 
phase II (PROGEDE II) is to meet the urban demand for household fuels, without the further loss 
of forest cover and the ecosystem’s carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity, as well as to 
generate opportunities for employment and income generation in the participating communities, 
especially for women, youth and most vulnerable groups. This objective would be met through:  
 
(i) 
The participatory implementation and monitoring of about 325,000 hectares of 
environmentally and socially sustainable community-managed forest resource systems in non 
managed zones in the regions of Tambacounda and Kolda;  
 
(ii) 
The participatory restoration of a severely degraded area of about 60,000 ha in the two 
regions of Kaolack and Tambacounda; as well as the biodiversity protection and management in 
about 40,000 ha in the Matam region;  
 
(iii) 
The diversification of modern household energy sources and the promotion of improved 
stoves initiatives, both in rural and urban areas;  
Page  2
(iv) 
The increase in the revenues of the participating local communities from the sale of 
charcoal and other locally based income generating activities;  
 
(v) The strengthening of the major institutions involved in the management of the sector and the 
inclusive participation of civil society organizations (private sector, academic institutions, and 
NGOs community) in the successful operation of the sector.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will have four major components: (i) Institutional Reforms of the Charcoal Value 
Chain; (ii) Sustainable Wood-fuels Supply Management; (iii) Promotion and Diversification of 
Modern Household Energy, and (iv) Institutional Arrangement for Project Management.  
 
Component I: The Institutional Reforms of the Charcoal Value Chain component will try to 
address the political economy and equity issues in the providing regions in particular, and in the 
country as a whole:  
 
(i) Elimination of the charcoal quota system as currently implemented by the government 
regulations; Charcoal production should be based in the forest management plans developed in 
PROGEDE I to take into account woodfuel production capacity of the different forests put under 
sustainable management;  
 
(ii) Redefinition of both the roles and responsibilities of key actors in the sector (ministries, 
local government, traditional authorities, local communities, the National union of charcoal 
exploiters, CBO and NGO, as well as both local and national CSO for environmental and social 
protection;  
 
(iii) The modernization of the charcoal value chain: addressing transport and marketing issues, 
from extraction/production to service delivery, especially the affordability for urban poor 
families living in the suburban areas of Dakar and most of the other key cities of Senegal.  
 
Component II: The Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component will finance 
technical assistance, logistical support and equipment to rural communities 
–
particularly 
charcoal producers - central and decentralized forestry services, local collectivities including 
CBOs and NGOs involved in forest/NRM and environmental-social protection activities; and 
communities to carry out:  
 
(i) The institutionalization of the existing forestry based geographical information system 
(SIEF) at the Direction of  Water and Forestry through the creation and equipment of one central  
bureau and four decentralized regional bureaus in charge of forest mapping, inventories, and 
elaboration of sustainable management plans at the level of all regions of Senegal;  
 
(ii) A woodfuels supply master plan for the principal urban consumption centers, particularly 
Dakar and the two largest religious cities (Touba and Tivaouane).  
 
(iii) Forest inventories and sustainable community based-forest management activities in 
325,000; restoration activities of severely degraded land in 60,000 ha; biodiversity management 
activities in about 40,000 ha; and second generation of inventories in PROGEDE previous 
selected zones.  
 
(iv)  
The implementation of a comprehensive communication strategy;  
Page  3
(v)   
Establishment of a revolving-credit fund easily accessible to all especially women, 
handicapped, youth and most vulnerable groups to further support village development 
committees to invest in sustainable mechanisms (i.e. charcoal conditioning units; transportation 
means; revolving fund) to enable them to better benefit from the charcoal industry.  
 
(vi)  Technical assistance, capacity and skill development, logistical support and knowledge 
sharing workshops, for central government., local collectivities and their various technical bodies 
(ARD-IREF) and research institutes/academia to play their respective role in the sustainable 
management of scared forest resources as clearly stated in both the decentralization law and 
forestry code;  
 
(vii)  Since the project will progressively phase out its presence in the old intervention zones, 
the regional forestry services (IREF) will be better equipped (both technically and logistically) to 
take in charge the technical assistance, monitoring and sustainable management aspects of the 
foreseen project activities.  
 
Component III: The Promotion and Diversification of Modern Household Energy will finance 
the technical assistance, the logistical means and equipments for the Direction of Energy to 
further support:  
 
(i) The promotion of improved stoves initiatives and training of local artisans for both their 
development and improved efficiency;   
 
(ii) The production of charcoal from rice residues (480,000 t are produced each year but 
roughly only 50% are been used for livestock, and the other 50% is wasted) and typha (Salvinia 
molesta, this invasive species is disturbing the existing biological equilibrium and threatening 
human health as well as the overall ecological and economic characteristics of the Senegal River 
Delta);  
 
(iii) The demultiplication and development of Jatropha community 
plantations/production/extraction throughout the country for the sustainable and efficient 
production of biofuel for cooking and household consumption purposes; and for running the 
multiservice vehicles as well as other locally-based informal business which are source of 
income generation for women, youth, handicapped and poor people;  
 
(iv) The establishment of biogas plants at the community level.  
 
(v) Survey to update the national charcoal supply and consumption figures while sustaining the 
awareness raising campaign for rational and effective use of the already scarce natural resources.  
 
Component IV:  The Institutional Arrangement for Project Management component will 
support proper government institutions to play their rightful role in the scaling up of the 
program; and consequently help the PIU to scale back and shift its role in this next phase 
–
from 
a
direct implementation role to a more catalytic, supportive and advisory role. This shift in the 
role of the PIU presents a number of implementation challenges and benefits as well:  
Page  4
(i) Helping the leadership agencies in the two Ministries of Energy and Environment exert the 
right demands and expectations on their respective staffs 
–
to ensure that this becomes a key 
priority, and does not get crowded out by other activities;  
 
(ii) Ensuring that the two concerned Ministries work together in a seamless and participatory 
way in promoting the success of the scale up efforts;  
 
(iii) Ensuring that both the regional and local staffs who will take accountability for this scale-
up have the skills and resources needed to step into their new roles and keep the momentum 
going;  
 
(iv) Ensuring that the PIU staff are equally clear about the expectations from them in their new 
role and responsibilities, and helping them develop the necessary mindset and skills required to 
make this transition both easy and successful. The steps that will be critical for success are:  
 
•
Sharpening the definition of success of the scale-up;  
 
•
Ensuring that the two Ministries and their respective teams have a common view on this;  
 
•
Launching Rapid Results Initiatives (RRI) approach to pave the way for broad scale 
implementation; and,  
 
•
Helping the PIU staff step up to their new roles and responsibilities, respectively.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Participatory Community Forest Management project will be simultaneously implemented 
in the regions of Tambacounda and Kolda; The restoration of degraded land will be implemented 
in the regions of Tambacounda and Kaolack; Biodiversity management will be implemented in 
the region of Matam; and institutional development capacity building will be provided to the 
ministries of environment and Energy at the central, regional, and local levels, and to 
communities and relevant civil society organizations in project cite. Regarding the demand side 
management component, promotion of improved cooking stoves will be across all regions, 
starting with big urban centers; the cultivation of Jatropha Curcas will be mainly piloted in the 
regions of Tambacounda and Kolda; the promotion of alternative energy sources (from rice 
residues and Typha) will be in the region of Saint-Louis, particularly in the Senegal River 
Valley.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Although there are enough capacity on the ground, for participatory community forest, and 
biodiversity management, energy efficiency and social and environmental protection purposes, 
the project plans to enhance the technical capacities on World Bank social and environmental 
safeguard policies in particular, and sustainable social and environmental challenges 
management in general of government institutions at central, regional and local levels as well as 
all key local and regional stakeholders whose role and responsibilities will strongly help the 
project achieve its foreseen development objectives.

Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
The first operation (PROGEDE I) had a tremendous positive impact on natural forest habitats 
in its areas of intervention which led to the increase in the trees and vegetation covers; a 
reduction of conversion of land from natural forest to rainfed agriculture due to improved 
agricultural practices introduced by PROGEDE in the farming systems of beneficiary villages 
(improved seeds, use of manure, high yield crops, etc.) as opposed to extensive agriculture; 
increase in biodiversity in natural habitats; the appearance of large and small mammals in the 
established Biodiversity Community Reserves covering about 56,000 ha.  
 
As was demonstrated during the first phase, The PROGEDE II proposed activities are not 
expected to have negative social and environmental impacts, on the contrary, they will 
strengthen the positive impacts of the project notably by: (i) reducing deforestation and soil 
degradation ; (ii) contributing to reducing the loss of carbon sequestration capacity and of 
biodiversity ; (iii) reducing CO2 emissions; (iv) reducing urban charcoal pollution and 
contamination (soil and water); and (v) reducing indoor air pollution and health risks to women 
through the promotion of improved woodfuel stoves. To this end, and to identify, avoid, and 
mitigate the project potential negative social and environmental impacts, an environment and 
social impact assessment will be conducted and will include necessary safeguards plans and 
frameworks that would need to be implemented.

As stated above, the project is not expected to have negative environmental and social 
impacts. The relocation of production sites to other areas is not likely to happen because there 
are no forest areas of sufficient capacity to support the urban markets and areas which are of 
sufficient size are too far away to be economically viable for forestry exploitation.  
 
The environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01) will address the potential impact of the project 
on forests and/or the rights and welfare of local communities.
