2. Project Objectives 
The project’s overall development objectives are to to (i) provide increased food access 
to primary and pre-school students in targeted areas; and (ii) support farmer’s capacity to 
ensure adequate supply response for medium-term improvement in food security.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project will have three components:  
 
COMPONENT 1 - School feeding programs ($3.25 million) will support school feeding 
to primary level and pre-school students in targeted regions, in the framework of the 
World Food Programme (WFP) “Support to Education for All and Health” project. The 
component will support providing services to 145,000 primary school children and 8,000 
pre-school children in the final year of its program.  The food basket will contain cereals, 
blended food such as corn-soya blend (CSB), pulses, vitamin A-enriched vegetable oil, 
sugar and iodized salt. Two meals will be served in the schools and kindergartens 
benefiting from WFP assistance: porridge in the morning and a hot meal at noon. Apart 
from the nutritional benefits, the program is expected to have significant impact on 
Page  2
school performance and attendance rates of beneficiary students. The program targets six 
prefectures: Ouaka, Basse Kotto, Kemo, Nana-Grebizi, Ouham and Nana-Mambere.  
 
COMPONENT 2 
–
Agricultural supply response ($3.25 million). The component will 
support producer organizations and communities to strengthen the agricultural supply 
response by: providing improved planting material and inputs to farmers; organize 
technical training to improve productivity on a sustainable basis; and provide post-
harvest infrastructure to reduce post-harvest losses or improve quality and marketing 
value. Support to farmers for production will concentrate on maximizing impact on the 
2009 and 2010 planting seasons. These activities will be implemented in collaboration 
with institutions instrumental to the sustainable support of the sector, such as the Ministry 
of Rural Development (MDR), the Rural Development Agency (ACDA), and the 
Agricultural Research Institute (ICRA). This will enable them to assist producers and 
producer organizations, as well as to define a medium-term framework of interventions. 
As such, this component will deliver immediate benefits while simultaneously preparing 
the groundwork for a longer-term support to crucial agriculture-related institutions. 
Twelve out of seventeen prefectures will be eligible for support: Lobaye, Sangha-
Mbaere, Mambere-Kadei, Basse Kotto and Mbomou (in the Forest region); Ombella-
MPoko, Nana-Mambere, Ouham, Ouham-Pende, Kemo, Nana Gribizi and Ouaka (in the 
savannah regions)  
 
COMPONENT 3: Project management, monitoring and evaluation ($0.5 million). The 
component will support the fiduciary and coordination functions of the Comite 
Technique Permanent du Programme d’Ajustement Structurel (CTP/PAS). The 
component will also support the creation and functioning of a technical committee 
responsible for the technical content as well as for overall technical guidance and 
monitoring of project activities under Component 2.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
While the project is not expected to not have significant and/or irreversible impacts, it 
may have small, site-specific, mitigated impacts, such as soil and water pollution, 
pesticide poisoning, and limited soil erosion as a result of future sub-project activities. 
Sub-projects are likely to include the construction/rehabilitation of small storage and 
processing facilities as needed to increase and diversify agricultural production.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project will not incur potential indirect and/or long term impacts, because of its 
small-scall and because appropriate mitigation measures for sub-projects will be 
developed under the project.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
not relevant   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower’s institutional capacity in addressing safeguard issues will be further 
assessed, and the Government team will receive needed guidance from the Bank’s 
safeguards specialists on the project team.  The Government will update andadapt the 
existing Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework (ESSAF) of 
the ongoing LICUS-TF project, prepare a Pest Management Plan (PMP) and an 
Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF) to be applied during the implementation 
of the project. The project will exclude all activities requiring resettlement. These 
documents will be publicly disclosed in CAR and at the World Bank’s InfoShop 120 days  
after effectiveness of the project, as exception to the general Bank policy of disclosure 
before appraisal.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include rural producers in the targeted areas. They will be identified 
and consulted during the preparation of the ESSAF.
