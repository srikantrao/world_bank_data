B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The main objective of the Line 4 (PHASE 2) project is to build and enter in operation five Line-4 
stations not included in Phase 1 of the project.  These stations could not be included in Phase 1 of 
the project due to the debt limits imposed on the State of Sao Paulo by the Federal Ministry of 
Finance at the time Phase 1 was launched. As such, when Phase 1 was approved, it had already 
been decided that a Phase 2 of the project would be needed to complete the remaining stations, as 
soon as the State was able to secure the necessary sovereign guarantees from the Republic of 
Brazil to obtain a loan for the construction of the remaining stations.  
 
This objective will be met by (i) financing the civil works and equipment required to complete 
the existing shells prepared in Phase I for those stations and build a new station at Vila Sonia 
yard and its access tunnel and (ii) financing the project management oversight consultant and 
supervision consultants required to oversee and manage the works.  
 
The stated main objectives of the Line 4 project were : a) to improve the quality and long-term 
sustainability of urban transport in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR) by 
interconnecting the existing subway, commuter rail and bus networks through the construction of 
Page  2
Metro Line 4; b) to improve the accessibility of the low-income population of the areas served by 
Line 4 to employment centers and health and education facilities; c) to seek private sector 
participation in the development of Line 4.  The Project Development Objectives will remain the 
same in the proposed Phase 2 loan.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would comprise two components:  
 
(a) Infrastructure and Equipment  to help complete 4 stations (Sao Paulo-Morumbi, Fradique 
Coutinho, Oscar Freire and Higienopolis-Mackenzie)for Line 4 initiated in Phase 1, build one 
new station (Vila Sonia) and its access tunnel (1.5 kms)and acquire and install  the necessary 
equipment to operationalize these stations. This component represents 97% of the project costs; 
and (b) a Technical Assistance component to help in the project management oversight and 
project supervision of the works of Phase 2 as well as specific studies or assessments required 
during the execution of Phase 2.  This component represents about 3% of the total project cost.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
State of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region, Brazil.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
1. 
The Borrower has had experience, during Phase I with  managing a Category A Project 
that required environmental assessment and involuntary resettlement.  During project 
implementation, an accident occurred in January 2007 that necessitated additional involuntary 
assessment due to damage to some homes and to the need to evacuate other dwellings and 
businesses until their safety could be assured.  Following the accident, the project team followed 
the design and implementation of the resettlement required and found it to be satisfactory.  The 
resettlement and compensation of affected parties is now virtually complete, with only a few 
cases pending where the parties have decided to litigate.  Additionally, the Bank team discussed 
the Borrowerís environmental monitoring system and made several recommendations for 
strengthening the use of monitoring data during implementation.  The Bankís recommendations 
have been followed and the Borrowerís performance was satisfactory.  
 
2. 
The Line 4 (phase 1) project had a full environmental assessment which was approved by 
the Board prior to its appraisal. Subsequently, after the Pinheiros station accident and as a 
prerequisite for the Add. Financing loan, the Bank required a detailed social assessment and 
periodic monitoring of those affected by the accident and also an environmental impact of the 
accident. Both were posted in the Infoshop. For Phase 2, the original Environmental Assessment 
stands but will require an addendum for the 1.5km tunnel and the new Vila Sonia station because 
they were not included in that EA.  Metro has already applied for a ìpreliminary licenseî 
(Licenca Previa) for those two new structures.  The original resettlement plan included 11 
commercial properties which were not expropriated in phase 1 at the request of the judge who 
would only allow their expropriation once phase 2 was officially authorized by the State.  Now 
that the State has already authorized Phase 2, the expropriation process can be launched.  
 
3.  Following the accident, the Bank requested that the Borrower submit a monthly report on the 
accident containing the following information: a) a census survey of the displaced persons and 
Page  3
valuation of assets; b) a description of compensation and other resettlement assistance provided 
to date and yet to be provided; c) a description of initial and ongoing consultation processes with 
displaced people to define acceptable alternatives; d) institutional responsibilities for the 
implementation of the remedial resettlement action plan , including the period after available 
insurance resources are exhausted; e) a description of  existing procedures for grievance redress; 
f)  arrangements for ongoing monitoring (suggested to include monthly reports to the Bank until 
final resolution is has been reached with all affected individuals and households on settlement); 
and g) indication of the timetable for the remaining assistance to be provided, as well as source 
of budget.  The Borrower has been submitting these monthly reports starting June 22, 2007 with 
the above information and will continue to submit them periodically until the process is closed. 
The Borrower has also committed to an independent ex-post-evaluation of livelihood restoration 
actions to be carried out by an entity with no affiliation with the project or the construction 
consortium.  Furthermore, the Consortium has indicated the source of contingency funding to 
carry out the remediation actions for those affected who elected to go to court because they did 
not reach an agreement on the amount of compensation by November 2007.  
 
4.  As of August 30, 2008, nearly all the families affected by the accident had been attended to 
by the Consorcio Via Amarela (CVA) with the financial cooperation of the insurance company 
Unibanco - AIG.  Nearly all families who owned homes and apartments that were not destroyed 
or damaged beyond repair by the accident have been able to return to their homes.  Others, 
primarily renters, have rented apartments elsewhere in Sao Paulo.  All but 8 families (renters and 
owners) have reached financial settlements for their losses with Unibanco - AIG.  Some five 
families have decided to litigate their claims, a decision that is likely to cause significant delays 
in settlement of claims.  In the immediate aftermath of the accident, all the evacuated families 
were accommodated at five-star hotels at the expense of CVA.  Gradually, as settlements were 
reached and civil defense allowed families to return to their homes in the neighborhood, the 
number of families temporarily housed in hotels declined to five as of August 30, 2008.  
Negotiations for settlements included the claimants, CVA, Unibanco - AIG, Metro, the Sao 
Paulo Public Defender and the State Justice Department (Secretaria de Justi√ßa) which ratified 
all decisions.  Settlements included fair market value for lost assets, new appliances to replace 
those damaged during the power cuts, payments for pain and suffering (danos morais), lost 
profits for business owners as, payments for late rent payments as well as significant levels of 
support for temporary housing, food, transportation, medications, and psychological counseling.  
While the monetary payments may not have fully compensated families for the psychological 
trauma and inconvenience they underwent, many families emerged from the crisis with increased 
assets.  Several renter families were able to make down payments on new homes and some 
business persons invested in new or expanded businesses.  
 
5. 
The environmental impacts of the January 12, 2007 accident described above were minor.  
Some minor impacts occurred due to fuel and oil losses of the vehicles involved in the accident, 
but the impacts were not quantified.  Other impacts were due to traffic detours and interruptions 
along Marginal Pinheiros, a major traffic artery, redirection of public transport away from Rua 
Capri, removal of some compromised trees and to enable proper access of rescue squads.  Some 
services were interrupted due to the accident, among others: gas, electric energy, water, 
sanitation and drainage.  The debris and spoils as a result of the accident were transported 
following the usual routes to regular disposal sites.  A total volume of 26,9 thousand m3  of 
Page  4
spoils were removed after the accident and transported to the Lagoa de Carapicuiba landfills.  
Construction debris (772m3) were disposed of at different sites and reusable materials (352 m3) 
were brought to the central construction site of Jaguare e Villa Lobos Park. The project has been 
successful in preventing and mitigating the direct environmental and social impacts of the 
project.  The procedures and supervision given to the project are adequate, but some aspects can 
be improved and are summarized below:  
 
6. 
Metro prepared an addendum to the existing Environmental Management Plan, which 
incorporates and strengthens the following aspects:  
 
-
Data quality control for effluent monitoring: Metro is hiring an independent laboratory to 
implement quality control measures to ensure the accuracy and precision of water quality 
monitoring undertaken by the Consortium. A preliminary plan to maintain quality in all aspects 
of the environmental program, including: proper documentation of all procedures, data 
management and analysis, and frequent independent quality control of collected data was 
prepared and will be refined once the laboratory has been hired.  
 
-
Improved noise management plan: Metro and Consortium Via Amarela evaluated the 
noise management program and presented a new sampling plan that will include more sampling 
times, more sampling points and more detailed description of activities during sampling. In 
parallel, Metro will monitor daytime and nighttime noise levels at the work sites and compare the 
readings with samples taken by the Consortium. The Consortium also agreed to present 
environmental progress reports, the Vibration Reports with allowable levels based on 
Seismographic Reports.  
 
-
Environmental data presentation. Starting with the Environmental Report of August 
2007, all environmental data presented in the reports will be compared to actual environmental 
quality standard and norms, or overall (realistic) benchmarks to allow for qualitative control by 
Metro and environmental agencies and more clearly identify non-compliance.  
 
-
Non-compliance: Metro agreed to strengthen the enforcement systems and ensurethat the 
consortium and other companies involved in project implementation are required to address 
shortcomings raised during inspection. The Environmental Reports will also include a special 
section summarizing n on-compliances in a visual way to increase pressure on the Consortium.  
 
7. 
As requested by the Bank, Metro and the Consortium Via Amarela provided detailed 
information regarding the solid waste generated and disposed at the Jag
uar√©site. The quantity 
(tons) and composition of the waste were reported and all environmental licenses were found to 
be in compliance. Finally, regarding blasting, the Consortium agreed to schedule blasts at times 
when they will be less disruptive.  There should be a curfew on late-night blasting unless there is 
a
demonstrated operational need to do blasting at that time.  In any case, the consortium and 
Metro will continue to provide public information, for each construction site, regarding when 
blasting will take place and over how long a period.  This would allow people to adjust more 
easily to the inconvenience of blasting.
