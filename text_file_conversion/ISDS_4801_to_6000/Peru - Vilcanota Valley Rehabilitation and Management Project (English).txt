2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective 
(PDO) is to support the GoP’s efforts to improve the 
environmental and socio-economic sustainability of historical, cultural and environmental 
assets in the Vilcanota Valley, including the HSMP and the Sacred Valley of the Incas, 
through: (i) consultation with local stakeholders, aimed at developing a shared vision for 
the future of the Valley and ensuring that Project design and implementation reflect broad 
community priorities; (ii) capacity building for municipal government authorities, local 
communities and the private sector in areas such as tourism, municipal financial 
management, urban service provision, disaster prevention and local economic 
development; (iii) technical studies for future small-scale infrastructure and urban 
services investments (including storm water drainage, on-site sanitation and solid waste 
management), and financing of a selected number of actual works (see Annex 1); and (iv) 
capacity building in tourism services and management, and the provision of tourism-
related infrastructure.

3. Project Description 
The Vilcanota Valley Rehabilitation and Management Project (The Project) was 
originally approved by the Board of Directors on November 14, 2004 and became 
effective on May 13, 2005. However, the Project is currently undergoing a Project 
Restructuring (the Restructuring), mainly due to: (i) overall Project implementation 
delays; (ii) processing delays at the central government level; and (iii) the opportunity to 
decentralize and transfer specific Project components from the central government to the 
Cusco Regional Government (GRC), through its executing agency Comision para 
Coordinar y Supervigilar el Plan Turistico y Cultural PERU-UNESCO (COPESCO).  
 
The key changes proposed are: (a) transfer from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Tourism (MINCETUR) to the GRC the execution of several Project components; (b) 
mainstreaming and simplification of Project implementation procedures; (c) reallocation 
of funds among disbursement categories to better reflect modifications to certain Project 
components; (d) extension of the Project closing date by 24 months; (e) strengthening of 
institutional counterpart capacity for managing Project fiduciary and safeguard 
responsibilities, and (f) modification of the Project’s outcome indicators.  
 
Preparation for the Restructuring has involved intensive stock-taking, including: (i) a 
review of the original loan preparation safeguards instruments and financial studies, 
including the Sistema National de Inversion Publica (the Ministryof Economics and 
Finance’s economic analysis tool); (ii) an assessment of COPESCO and MINCETUR’s 
capacity to undertake their proposed fiduciary and safeguards responsibilities; (iii) a 
review of past consultation and development of a plan for future consultation with the 
population; and (iv) restructuring of the institutional relationships and responsibilities to 
conform with Bank Financial Management, Procurement and Safeguards Policies.  
 
The Project was not originally a part of the 2002 – 2006 Country Assistance Strategy 
(CAS). Rather, it was designed in response to a 2004 UNESCO warning to the 
Government of Peru (GoP) that mismanagement of tourism in the Historic Sanctuary of 
Machu Picchu (HSMP) could lead to its removal from the list of World Heritage Sites. At 
the time, the country’s debt ceiling limited the loan to US$ 5 million, which was 
insufficient for the original Project’s scope. To address the risk posed by this lack of 
resources, the Restructuring proposes a dual strategy: 1) investment in strategic studies to 
establish a basis for future investments, and 2) investment in a range of works aimed at 
leveraging other resources from key partners (global institutions, such as UNESCO and 
the National Geographic Society (NGS), municipal and regional authorities and local 
communities. The Restructuring aims to advance these goals by scaling back the range of 
investments originally planned and focusing on the delivery of key results on the ground.  
 
The Restructuring involves the elimination of certain original Project components and 
the consolidation of others, as well as the addition of several feasibility studies for future 
activities. The table in Annex 1 shows the proposed allocation of Project components 
between COPESCO and MINCETUR. The key modifications are:  
 
a) 
Feasibility study and design for a bypass road around Ollantaytambo. [Footnote 1] 
The historic Inca village of Ollantaytambo is currently traversed by heavy motor vehicle 
Page  3
traffic, with adverse environmental health and safety impacts, and risk to archeological 
monuments. The Restructuring will finance new technical studies for the design of a road 
to divert vehicle traffic from the town center, including feasibility studies of proposed 
design alternatives from an environmental and social safeguards perspective. Although 
actual construction of the road will not be financed under the existing Project, the studies 
and designs will be undertaken in accordance with Bank safeguard policies.  
 
b)
Solid waste management. The Project originally included an assessment to 
identify an appropriate strategy and design for a Regional Solid Waste Management 
System, to be followed by related works. However, the budget for the works was 
underestimated and so the Restructuring will only finance pre-feasibility and feasibility 
studies for the Regional Solid Waste Management System’s design, with construction to 
be financed later by the GRC. The study will conform to Bank safeguard policies using 
the Environmental Framework for the Construction of Landfills, already developed under 
the original Project, as a guide and background.   
 
c) 
Urban upgrading and risk mitigation activities in Machu Picchu Pueblo (MPP). 
This subcomponent, originally entitled Programa Municipal para Machu Picchu, initially 
included a plan for the resettlement of 60 families in the town, and another for the 
economic resettlement of 47 families along the Inca Trail. Under the Restructuring, both 
of these plans have been eliminated. Instead, a comprehensive Urban Land Use Plan will 
be developed, based on a detailed risk assessment currently being undertaken by a team 
of experts from the University of Maryland under separate funding from the Global 
Facility for Disaster and Risk Reduction (GFDRR). Some works will then be financed 
with the remaining funds, based on the Plan’s recommendations and a set of budget and 
safeguards screening criteria. For the families along the Inca Trail, a new consultation 
process will be conducted to determine a course of action not involving resettlement.

1.  Currently, 15-ton trucks carrying agricultural produce and building materials to and 
from Quillabamba pass directly through the town’s main square, producing vibrations 
damaging to the only Inca stone dwellings that have been continuously occupied since 
Pre-Columbian times.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project is located in the Vilcanota Valley, in the region of Cusco. The physical 
characteristics relevant to safeguard policies are:  
 
(a)the area’s UNESCO World Heritage status and social sensitivity resulting in the 
upgrading of the Project’s Environmental Screening Category from B to A, with the 
correspondingly higher standards of safeguards monitoring and control;  
 
(b)the possibility that the Project may finance some works (still to be determined, based 
on initial studies), thus triggering OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment;  
 
(c)the fact that the Project area is located in and around protected areas thus triggering 
OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats;  
 
(d)the area’s significance for the indigenous population and largely indigenouscharacter 
of its inhabitants, thus triggering OP 4.10 on Indigenous Peoples;  
Page  4
(e)the Project area is located in and around the Machu Picchu UNESCO World Heritage 
site and some components are focused on restoring or improving archeological 
monuments thus triggering OP 4.11 on Physical Cultural Resources;  
 
(f)the possibility that future works may entail resettlement impacts, thus requiring an 
adequate screening mechanism against such potential impacts; and  
 
(g)risk to the population of MPP from geoharzards requiring an adequate risk 
assessment on which to base future actions in the town.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The restructured Project will support the development of studies and technical plans, with 
very few small works (see Annex 1), and is not expected to involve any large-scale, 
major or irreversible impacts. As a result of the sensitivity of the Project area as a 
UNESCO World Heritage site, the Project has been upgraded from a Category B to a 
Category A.  
 
The policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01) is triggered because some minor 
works will be financed, as well as studies for more major ones. In addition, some of the 
proposed studies and works (such as the storm water drainage and solid waste 
management studies) are aimed at improving the protection of local ecosystems. 
Although the Project will not significantly convert or adversely impact any natural 
habitats, the Project area is located in and around a natural protected area, the HSMP, and 
is near the Abra Malaga Private Conservation Zone, a protected natural area triggering 
the Natural Habitats Policy (OP 4.04). The Environmental Framework for Minor 
Infrastructure Works (OIM) contains screening criteria with regard to the siting of works 
in sensitive or protected areas and corresponding measures to be followed.  
 
Page  5
The policy on Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10) has been triggered because of the area’s 
significance for indigenous people, and the arguably indigenous nature of its population.  
 
The policy on Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) has been triggered because of the 
area’s abundance of archeological sites and the fact that some minor works are directly 
concerned with protecting, preserving, enhancing or restoring some of those sites.  
 
No planned works involve resettlement impacts, and the original Project subcomponents 
that did have been modified to exclude them. Any other potential resettlement impacts 
will be screened out through a mechanism included in the Operational Manual (OM), in 
compliance with the criteria defined in OP 4.12. Such screening has been included as a 
“trigger,” or pre-condition, for approval of any futureworks to be financed under the 
Project.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No potential negative indirect or long-term impacts from Project activities are expected. 
On the contrary, the proposed activities are expected to have positive direct, indirect and 
long-term impacts, for three reasons: (1) the Project objective is to support the GoP’s 
efforts to enhance the environmental and socio-economic sustainability of historical, 
cultural and ecological assets in the Vilcanota Valley including the HSMP and the Sacred 
Valley of the Incas; (2) Component 1 (“Historic Preservation Activities for Pre-Hispanic 
Architectural Structures,Water and Agricultural Infrastructure”) is aimed at improving 
the current condition of these structures; and (3) all studies and plans to be developed 
under the Project whether or not works are actually executed with Bank financing will 
have Bank safeguards built into their designs, including the development of social 
frameworks and guides.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
In general, the alternative of no-project itself carries significant risks, as many of the 
proposed works are likely to be executed in the absence of Bank supportâ
 ”and 
correspondingly, without Bank safeguard standards. This has already occurred in the case 
of the Colpani Bridge, the construction of which was planned under the original Project, 
but due to slow implementation was independently executed by the local municipality. 
Furthermore, the development of all studies and technical plans under the Restructuring 
will consider various alternatives to avoid or minimize adverse impacts. Specifically, 
Project alternatives by Component/Subcomponent include:  
 
.
The Ollantaytambo Bypass Road -- the Terms of Reference for the feasibility 
study and design of the Ollantaytambo Bypass Road specify different alternatives that 
have to be considered to minimize adverse environmental, social and physical cultural 
resource impacts associated with the road design.  
 
.
The MPP resettlement – before the decision was made to proceed with a 
comprehensive risk assessment (the GFDRR-funded study), three alternatives were 
considered:  
Page  6
1. 
Implementing the Planned Resettlement. A subcomponent of Component II of the 
original Project had envisaged the resettlement of 60 families living in conditions of risk. 
However, due to lack of public acceptance, political capacity and will, and space within 
the town for resettlement, th
e
subcomponent’s viability has since been called into 
question. Furthermore, it was not based on a sound technical analysis of the risks 
involved and all possible solutions. Removing some families while leaving others at risk, 
even were it to be feasible, might be interpreted as a legitimation by the Peruvian 
government and the Bank of the safety of the remaining houses.  
 
2.
Creating an ‘Ecological Ring’. The municipality of MPP in conjunction with the 
National Institute of Natural Resources (INRENA) proposed a plan, called the 
‘Ecological Ring’, to leave the existing houses in their current location while creating a 
barrier above them so as to prevent future invasion. However, this largely cosmetic 
proposal would again run the risk of appearing to be an endorsement of the safety of 
those homes below the Ring.  
 
3.
Abandoning the subcomponent. Another proposed solution was to simply discard 
the entire subcomponent as unfeasible. However, having already recognized the risks to 
the local population the Bank would be hard-pressed to justify simple withdrawal.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Institutional arrangements. Several modifications have been made under the 
Restructuring in the Project’s institutional arrangements that have significant safeguards 
implications.  
 
Under the Restructuring, COPESCO has assumed responsibility for safeguards 
compliance in the Project.[Footnote 2]  COPESCO’s tasks will include: reviewing the 
restructuredProject and existing environmental frameworks to determine any gaps and 
propose any necessary additions or revisions;  
 
(a) 
screening of all proposed works to ensure their compliance with the applicable 
Environmental Management Frameworks, the OM and safeguards policies, including 
involuntary resettlement.  
 
(b) 
screening potential works for resettlement and other safeguards compliance 
issues, and supervision responsibilities, as detailed in the environmental frameworks and 
OM;  
 
(c) 
reviewing all studies, technical plans and related ToRs to ensure their compliance 
with applicable Environmental Management Frameworks, Operations Manual and 
safeguards policies;  
 
(d) 
submitting all new or revised environmental frameworks, and environmental 
management plans for individual works (as necessary), to the Bank for no-objection; and  
 
(e) 
ensuring that the above-described standards of OP 4.10, on Indigenous Peoples, 
are properly and reasonably applied; and  
 
(f) 
any other safeguards supervision responsibilities as detailed in the environmental 
frameworks and OM.  
 
In order to fulfill these obligations, COPESCO is currently in the process of hiring two 
safeguards specialists (one for environmental and one for social safeguards), so as to 
Page  7
develop the necessary capacity to execute this and future Bank-financed operations (their 
ToRs are included in the OM). Once hired, these specialists will be provided adequate 
safeguards training and support, beginning with a series of workshops planned for 
December, 2008. Additional training and support activities will be added as necessary.  
 
The Project Steering Committee, consisting of representatives of MEF, MINCETUR 
and COPESCO, will be responsible for providing policy guidance and oversight to 
Project implementation, including the overseeing of safeguards compliance, staffing and 
coordination, and submission of all studies and plans for proposed works to the Bank for 
safeguards analysis and no-objection. Upon completion of initial studies, the Steering 
Committee will select a small number of works to be financed under the Project, based on 
factors including estimated budget and compliance with safeguards screening criteria and 
other eligibility requirements. The Steering Committees powers and responsibilities are 
defined in the OM.[Footnote 3]  
 
A
new mechanism has also been included in the Loan Agreement, consisting of 
“triggers” (gatillos), or disbursement conditions for particular subcomponents. These 
include the following set of “transversal” triggers, listed in the Operational Manual, to be 
applied to all subcomponents involving works:  
 
1)
the screening out of all involuntary resettlement impacts, according to OP 4.12;  
 
2)
the adequacy of free, prior and informed consultation, in accordance with OP 4.10;  
 
3)
revision and disclosure of the PEC, once revised, in compliance with OP 4.10;  
 
4)
prior to the start of works, an updated version of the Project’s Environmental 
Management Framework (as reflected in the OM) for the restructured Project which has 
received Bank approval, must be in effect;  
 
5)
prior disclosure of all relevant documents; and  
 
6)
the existence of adequate capacity for safeguards implementation (e.g., the hiring of 
two safeguards specialists by COPESCO one social and one environmental).  
 
All proposed works will be subject to prior review by the Steering Committee, to ensure 
their compliance with the above-described triggers. The Bank will then review and 
confirm compliance with the triggers before giving no-objection. All Bank-financed 
studies comply with Bank safeguards as appropriate, regardless of whether the actual 
works deriving from such studies would be Bank-financed or not.  
 
Environmental. The following environmental safeguards instruments have been 
prepared under the Project. An updated Environmental Management Framework for 
Minor Infrastructure Works will be completed by the Borrower to the Bank’s satisfaction 
prior to the start of any works. [Footnote 9]  
 
.
An Environmental Framework for Minor Infrastructure Works (OIM) was 
developedto govern all works in the Project except for the Landfill component. It 
includes: (i) a guide for the categorization of works (based on type and level of 
sensitivity, site sensitivity and Bank safeguard policies); (ii) a fieldwork checklist to 
determine the potential social and environmental impacts of infrastructure works; and 
(iii) an environmental manual for infrastructure works that addresses, among other items: 
site selection, specific norms for construction activities for contractors, community 
Page  8
information and outreach, chance-find procedures, and supervision institutional 
responsibilities and arrangements (including monitoring).  
 
.
An Environmental Framework for the Construction of Landfills was also 
developed to guide the design of a Regional Solid Waste Management System. Under the 
Restructuring, this will be used to guide the development of feasibility studies and 
detailed engineering plans, rather than works.  
 
.
An Operational Manual, which includes both of these frameworks, and seeks to 
integrate environmental and social concerns into all phases of the Project.  
 
.
A
specific environmental assessment was also conducted for the Inca Trail 
(“Gestion Ambiental del Camino Inca a Machu Picchu,” December, 2003), including 
proposals addressing such key issues as waste management. This will be complemented 
by a study of the tourism carrying capacity of the Trail under the project.  
 
.
A
regional SEA was conducted on the likely medium- to long-term environmental 
impacts in the Vilcanota Valley and HSMP from tourism, industrial activity, agriculture 
and related demographic and resource-use patterns. It includes: (i) risk prevention and 
mitigation plans; (ii) natural resource management; (iii) economic and cultural activities; 
(iv) sustainable tourism development of the Vilcanota Basin; and (v) a program to resolve 
inter-institutional conflicts in the Basin. It has a subprogram under the sustainable 
tourism development section that specifically addresses the conservation of historical 
structures, arts and other physical or intangible cultural assets (archeological sites, 
historic villages, sacred sites, living culture, museums and other aspects of the Vilcanota 
Valley cultural heritage), updating an inventory of cultural assets in the Valley (to be 
prepared in collaboration with National Institute of Culture), and establishing regional 
and national laws for the protection of tangible and intangible cultural heritage resources. 
This SEA was consulted with stakeholders including NGOs. Specific urban and rural 
land use plans will be developed for the municipalities of Machu Picchu, Ollantaytambo, 
Santa Teresa, Chinchero, Urubamba, Calca and Pisac based on this SEA.  
 
Social. Although the policy OP 4.10, on Indigenous Peoples, was not triggered under 
the original Project, this policy has been activated under the Restructuring. As indigenous 
peoples have been determined to constitute a majority of the affected population, 
however, no stand-alone Indigenous Peoples instrument will be prepared for this Project. 
Rather, the policy’s superior standards of “free, prior and informed consultation,” “social 
assessment,” “culturally appropriate benefits,” and “broad community support” will 
apply to the entire Project in a blanket manner. The Instrumento de Pueblos IndÃ­genas, 
disclosed on InfoShop and in-country, is an explanation of how the Project will comply 
with the Indigenous Peoples Policy. Specifically, the following principles will be taken 
into account in designing and implementation of future Project actions:  
 
1)
Free, prior and informed consultation. Consultation under the original Project was 
extensive [Footnote 4],  and the proposed Restructuring is itself the product of an 
ongoing process of consultation with diverse stakeholders [Footnote 5].  Adequate prior 
consultation, in accordance with OP 4.10, is one of the “triggers” for all subcomponents. 
As consultations under the original Project raised local expectations in ways that 
implementation failed to meet, new consultations will be undertaken with sensitivity, and 
carefully sequenced with the achievement of visible, concrete Project results on the 
ground.  
Page  9
2) 
Social assessment. Social Assessment (SA) activities are currently underway 
[Footnote 6].  
 
3)
Culturally appropriate benefits. Each financed activity will aim to ensure, via 
input from the two above-mentioned processes, that local stakeholders receive justly 
distributed and culturally-appropriate benefits.  
 
4)
Broad community support. This involves mechanisms and processes for the 
gauging of local responses 
–
both positive and negative – to Project actions, and relying 
upon local decision-making and consensus-building means [Footnote 7].  
 
As this is an ongoing project, these existing activities will be progressively strengthened 
under the Restructuring. In reorienting the Project to explicitly respond to the 
requirements of the policy. So far, MINCETUR and COPESCO have undertaken: (a) a 
review of the entire Project consultation process to date; (b) an identification of all gaps 
with regard to the policy; (c) an analysis of existing Project institutions and capacity with 
regard to application of the policy; and (d) the development of a strategy for filling those 
gaps through existing, modified and or/newly created institutional arrangements.  
 
All consultation and social analysis activities related to safeguards compliance will be 
under the responsibility of COPESCO, working in close collaboration with the Strategic 
Communication Plan (“Plan de Comunicacion Estrategica,” or PEC), and with additional 
staff and resources from the Project as necessary [Footnote 8].  To build on existing 
work, and avoid parallel structures and redundant activities, COPESCO’s safeguards 
specialists will develop, together with MINCETUR’s Communications Specialist, a joint 
strategy for strengthening and complementing the PEC’s existing activities, with 
additional activities, and determining anyadditional Project staff and financial resources 
that these modifications may require. Revision and disclosure of the PEC, including this 
strategy and all other modifications related to OP 4.10, are among the “triggers” for all 
subcomponents.  
 
No subcomponents under the Restructuring will involve any involuntary resettlement, 
and the “triggers” for authorization of future works by the Steering Committee include 
the screening out of any potential resettlement impacts. Under the original Project, a 
Resettlement Action Plan had been prepared for 60 at-risk households in MPP. The plan 
has been abandoned, based on consultations and site visits, due to lack of broad 
community support and doubts as to its effectiveness in terms of landslide risk mitigation. 
Instead, a comprehensive Urban Land Use Plan for the town will be developed, taking 
into account the results of the risk management study currently being undertaken by a 
team of specialists from the University of Maryland, with support from GFDRR. A 
Process Framework had also been prepared but never implemented for 47 families 
residing and/or engaging in subsistence agriculture and cattle-raising along the Inca Trail, 
including training and assistance in seeking income generation alternatives. Under the 
Restructuring, new consultation with this population, in keeping with the Bank policy on 
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10), and aimed at avoiding or mitigating any future 
resettlement, will be undertaken.

2.   Founded as a joint initiative between UNESCO and the GoP for the preservation and 
restoration of the historical, cultural and ecological assets of the Vilcanota Valley, 
COPESCO has 30 years’ experience in project planning and implementation in the Cusco 
region.  
 
3.
They include: (a) provision of institutional support and a coordination framework for 
Project implementation; (b) establishment of strategic guidelines for the Project 
implementation, including review of annual operational plans, (c) review of overall 
progress in Project implementation by MINCETUR and COPESCO (including a review 
of audits), and (d) evaluation of Project activities and oversight of compliance with 
Project norms, feasibility studies and objectives (including analysis and consideration of 
which Project activities might require pre-feasibility studies).  
 
4.
This process included consultations with key stakeholders on the Project’s 
environmental aspects, it was also unsystematic, unevenly documented, and limited to 
certain activities (such as the Geotourism Map and the Ferias de Desarrollo LED small 
grants program). This process has been documented and a summary disclosed according 
to the Bank’s standards.  
 
5.
This process, beginning in January, 2007, included consultation of the SEA in 
November and December of 2007, via conversations, interviews and participatory 
workshops in Sicuani, Urubamba, Quillabamba and Cusco, with mayors, other city 
officials, NGOs and local residents (the results of these workshops are recorded in the 
final SEA report). The TORs for the Ollantaytambo Bypass Road study were subject to 
public consultations in March 2008, along with multi-stakeholder discussions of the 
various safeguards aspects of the Project. This process has also been documented and a 
summary disclosed according to the Bank’s standards.  
 
6.
These include a public opinion poll, to establish baseline information on local 
stakeholders (e.g., a demographic profile, communication needs and barriers), and a 
Stakeholder Engagement Plan, to identify key stakeholder groups and build a regular, 
constructive dialogue with local communities and institutions.  
 
7.
These aspects are treated at greater length in the Indigenous Peoples Instrument 
disclosed by COPESCO, MINCETUR and the Bank, as well as in the revised PEC, to be 
completed and disclosed as a “trigger” to the initiation of any future works in the Project.  
 
8.
Funded through an initial US$ 90,000 grant from the Italian Culture and Sustainable 
Development Trust Fund, the PEC is currently engaged in data collection activities.  
 
9.
It was agreed with the Regional Environment Unit, the LCR Safeguards Advisory 
Team, that this will be updated and they will approve it before works are initiated.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Stakeholders include: national, regional and local government, the residents of the 
Valley, civil society, and people who earn income from tourism and related activities in 
the Valley. Consultation under the original Project was extensive, and the Restructuring 
is itself the product of a multi-stakeholder consultation process.  
 
In terms of disclosure, the environmental frameworks have been available on the Bank’s 
website since 2003 and 2004. The Instrumento de Pueblos IndÃ­genas, disclosed on 
Page  11
InfoShop and in-country, is an explanation of how the Project will comply with the 
Indigenous Peoples Policy. MINCETUR has made the SEA available to the public on its 
website in October, 2008. The revised environmental frameworks will also be made 
available online through both the Bank and the implementing agencies’ websites. 
Spanish-language copies of the necessary safeguards documents will be made available 
by the Borrower as soon as available for local public review at convenient locations in-
country.
