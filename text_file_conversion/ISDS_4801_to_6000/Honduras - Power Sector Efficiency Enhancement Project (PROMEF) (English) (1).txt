2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to improve ENEEís (the Government-owned 
Honduran electricity company Empresa Nacional de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica) operational 
and financial performance, thus contributing to the sustainability of the power sector in 
Honduras. High technical and non-technical losses and poor bill collection have limited 
ENEE's revenue and, together with insufficient tariffs and badly targeted subsidies, are 
the main shortcomings in the power sector.  
 
The underperformance of ENEE has the potential for two major negative consequences: 
(a) the company has posted balance sheet losses for the last years, with a deficit above 
2% of GDP, which threatens the stability of the macroeconomic framework and the 
prospects for poverty reduction; and (b) the availability of adequate power production is 
seriously compromised as already evident by the current rolling blackouts and could 
undermine the performance of the economy as a whole. Furthermore, private generation 
companies have cumulated large arrears with ENEE, which are seriously threatening the 
stability of the domestic financial market given the large exposure of the commercial 
banks. For these reasons, the resolution of ENEE problems is at the core of the policy 
dialogue of IDA with the Government under the Poverty Reduction Support Credit 
Page  2
(PRSC) which includes a number of actions oriented towards improving the performance 
of the power sector.  
 
In consistence with these concerns, the Bank financed a power subsector study which 
provides a comprehensive power sector diagnostic and outlines a number of options to 
address the short and medium term issues. As highlighted in the study, the main issues 
underlying ENEE's problems include (a) institutional instability associated with frequent 
management changes as well as a weak governance framework, (b) inadequate revenue 
generation due to large non-technical (commercial) losses and poor bill collections, (c) a 
tight supply/demand balance and (d) power tariffs which are below cost, together with 
untargeted subsidies.  
 
Proposed project development objectives:  
 
The main Project Development Objective is to improve ENEEís operational and 
financial performance, thus contributing to the sustainability of the power sector in 
Honduras. Proposed performance indicators for the project would include:  
 
*
Independence and accountability of ENEEís distribution unit;  
 
*
Increase in the cash recovery index (CRI);  
 
*
Improvement in quality of power supply nationwide  
 
*
Improvement in customer services by ENEE   
 
3. Project Description 
Preliminary project description  
 
The project would respond to the difficulty in improving billing and collection due to (a) 
the lack of an organization and a distribution management model oriented towards an 
integrated administration of clients, and (b) the poor quality of ENEE's information 
systems regarding commercial management and responding to client complaints. The 
proposed approach differs from ENEE's current loss-reduction measures, which are based 
upon detection and penalization of fraud; while these measures may yield some short run 
benefits, they are neither efficient nor sustainable. The project would emphasize a 
strategy based upon remote metering for all large clients which has proved successful 
elsewhere and has been successfully applied to a limited extent in the San Pedro Sula 
region in Honduras.  
 
During project preparation, a governance assessment has been carried out for ENEE 
with the view of identifying governance reforms to improve transparency and 
accountability of the utility and reduce the political interference in its administration. 
Project implementation arrangements will also reflect these elements.  
 
Project Scope.  
 
The proposed project would support the following components:  
 
Component 1: Improvement of ENEE¬¥s commercial and corporate resource 
management 
Page  3
The objective of this component is to improve the commercial performance of ENEE in 
a
sustainable manner by providing the company with the information tools for a modern 
and efficient management of its customers and of the services it provides. The project 
will finance: a) installation of automated meter reading equipment, b) installation of a 
new automated commercial management system (CMS), c) implementation of an 
incident recording and management system (IRMS), d) development of a corporate 
resources management information system (CRMIS) for ENEE, and e) a permanent 
office space for ENEE to house these systems and related employees.  
 
Component 2: Rehabilitation of distribution networks  
 
This component aims to impr
ove the reliability and reduce technical losses in ENEE¬¥s 
distribution systems by strengthening the distribution grid, substations,and distribution 
equipment for supervisory control, voltage control and switching. A recent national 
survey of Persistent Organic Pollutants, POPs, as defined by the Stockholm Convention, 
identified the electric sector in Honduras as having the largest stock of PCB contaminated 
equipment. The total number of contaminated units (with PCB concentrations above 50 
ppm) is estimated to be above 500. The Project will support ENEEís action plan for the 
removal of all PCB contaminatedunits in the electric system.  
 
This component is composed of investment plans in three regions: (i) Center-South, (ii) 
North-West and (iii) Atlantic Coast. Each Plan is in turn divided into two categories: (i) 
replacement of transformers and disposal of PCBs, and (ii) maintenance equipment, 
mainly heavy vehicles. Given the limited IDA resources, this project will primarily focus 
on replacement of transformers and identification and replacement of PCB-containing 
equipment. The rest of the investments will be carried out in parallel when more 
resources become available. Since most of the investments are for operation and 
maintenance purposes, this phased approach is feasible  
 
Component 3: Strengthening of ENEE¬¥s institutional capacity  
 
This component will support: (i) strengthening power sector governance, (ii) analyzing 
financial sustainability of ENEE, including tariff structure and subsidies and development 
of a strategy for commercial operations, (iii) implementing a communication, outreach 
and participation program, and (iv) project management, monitoring and evaluation.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project coverage is national. The only component with physical characteristics 
relevant to the safeguard analysis is component 2. Actions to strengthen the distribution 
grid in the three sub-regions of the country  have been prioritized based on their urgency 
and contribution to ENEE revenues stream.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environmental Category "B"  
 
The project is expected to be largely beneficial to the environment, as improvements on 
continuity and reliability of service will reduce the need for individual energy sources, 
which are often a major source of air and noise pollution. The project has national 
coverage in urban areas. The project is not expected to produce major or irreversible 
environmental impacts. Electric distribution projects do not represent a threat to the 
environment, and that is the case here.  
 
The project will support the identification, replacement and disposal of equipment with 
PCBs, activity that requires special environmental controls. It is estimated that the public 
electric distribution system in Honduras may have more than 500 units have PCBs with 
concentrations above 50 ppm and thus require special environmental handling. ENEE has 
elaborated a ìPlan for Replacement and Handlingof PCBsî, which is included in the 
ìEnvironmental Guidelines for Distribution Projectsî that will be adopted by the 
company for all its distribution projects. (Document available in IRIS and InfoShop)  
 
ENEEís Plan for PCBs will adopt the international environmental guidelines 
(TheStockholm Convention) for PCB disposal, which will also be included in 
HonduraísìNational Plan for PCBsî, currently under development by SERNA (Ministry 
of Environment). ENEEís ìPlan for Replacement and Handling of PCBsî includes the 
following activities: (i) completion of the inventory of PCB containing equipment, (ii) 
identification of sites contaminated with PCBs, (iii) purchase of sampling equipment, (iv) 
provision of information, capacity building and training for ENEEís employees, (v) 
verification that temporary storage of PCB containing equipment is made following 
appropriate safety procedures, (vi) final disposal of PCB containing equipment according 
to international guidelines. A special Commission will be created to oversee all the 
Page  5
activities related to PCB management and disposal. This Commission will be composed 
of representatives of ENEE, SERNA, the Health Secretariat, the Firefighters, and private 
sector and/or professional associationsí representatives.  
 
Other safeguard issues (forests, involuntary resettlement, safety of dams, pest 
management, natural habitats, project in disputed areas, physical cultural resources and 
project in international waterways) would not be triggered by the proposed project.  
 
Social safeguards  
 
The project will not trigger any of the social safeguards as corroborated by the 
environmental assessment. Indigenous peoples communities, located mainly in the rural 
areas, might benefit from the rehabilitation of distribution networks Center-South and at 
the Atlantic Coast. Adjusted tariff will not have an impact since electricity consumption 
of these communities in the rural areas is below 100 kWh/month, therefore, they will 
continue receiving a subsidy. Proposed rehabilitation works under the project will not 
cause any physical impact causing resettlement or affecting cultural assets.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The electric sector, in general, has developed a set of well defined and environment 
friendly procedures for handling and destroying PCB contaminated equipment. The 
national removal of all PCB contaminated units from the sector is a crucial first step 
towards a country free of PCB potential contamination. It should be highlighted the 
importance of supporting the GOH in its effort to eventually remove all PCB 
contaminated units in its electric system.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Ministry of Environment (SERNA), with support from UNDP, has produced a 
national PCB inventory. Building upon this inventory, SERNA is elaborating a National 
Action Plan to manage equipment containing or likely to contain PCBs as part of a more 
comprehensive set of regulations for hazardous chemical waste management that is being 
prepared by SERNA with the support of USAID.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Elaboration of the overall National Action Plan for POPs and in particular for PCBs is led 
by CESCCO, the Center for Study and Control Pollutants (Centro de Estudios y Control 
de Contaminantes) at SERNA. The National Hydrological Resources Directorate, the 
Environmental Control and Evaluation Directorate, the Environmental Management 
Page  6
Directorate and the Biodiversity Directorate, all of them within SERNA, are also 
involved in the elaboration of the National Plan.  
 
Consultations and participation through the process of elaboration of the National Plan 
have included the following institutions: ENEE (National Electricity Utility 
ñ
Empresa 
Nacional de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica), SOPTRAVI (Public Works, Transport and Housing 
Secretariat - Secretar√≠a de Obras P√∫blicas, Transporte y Vivienda), Health Secretariat, 
DEI (Executive Imports Directorate ñ Direcci√≥n Ejecutiva de Ingresos), Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs (Canciller√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica), Foregin Affairs Secretariat 
(Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores), SENASA (National Service for Agricultural 
Health ñ Secretar√≠a Nacional de Salud Agropecuaria), UNAH (National University ñ 
Universidad Nacional de Honduras), UNICAH (Catholic University ñ Universidad 
Cat√≥lica), National Center for a Cleaner Production (Centro Nacional de Producci√≥n 
M√°s Limpia), ANDI (National Association of Industrialists ñ Asociaci√≥n Nacional de 
Industriales), COHEP (Honduran Corporation of Private Companies ñ Corporaci√≥n 
Hondure√±a de la Empresa Privada), C√°ritas de Honduras (NGO), Fundaci√≥n Vida 
(NGO). The consultation process is expected to conclude December 15, 2008.
