B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project development objective of the proposed Madagascar SHSDP II is to contribute to the 
strengthening of the health system and enhance the institutional capacity of the Ministry of 
Health to improve access and utilization of health services, especially in rural and remote areas.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
SHSDP II will support the following four components:  
 
i) Component 1: Strengthening of the Pharmaceutical Logistical Supply Chain and 
Management of Drugs: Given the bottlenecks identified in the 2007 Drug Chain Survey, this 
component seeks to strengthen the pharmaceutical logistics supply chain in order to ensure 
timely delivery of drugs and medical supplies and improve management of medical products at 
all levels of health care delivery. Activities under this component would consist mainly of 
institutional strengthening support complementing the activities of other partners in this area, 
including AfDB, JICA, UNICEF and WHO.  The component would also draw on experience 
with performance-based mechanisms, including those being implemented in the family planning 
program and through the Bank-financed STI/HIV/AIDS Project.

ii) Component 2: Management of Human Resources in the Health Sector: The objective of this 
component is to improve human resource management in the health sector, with particular 
emphasis on rural areas, and strengthen capacity of the Human Resource Department of the 
MOH, including at hospital level. To this end, this component will finance the development of a 
Health Sector Human Resource Development Plan as well as career plans for medical personnel. 
In addition, innovative and performance-based mechanisms will be implemented to provide 
incentives to rural-based personnel and promote enhanced performance of such personnel. Some 
such mechanisms have been developed and are being piloted under SHSDP I. Lessons from the 
pilot will be incorporated into the scaling up and implementation phase of these mechanisms. 
This component will also support selective training of health personnel on priority areas of health 
service delivery, and in management for results.  
 
iii) Component 3: Improving Demand and Utilization of Health Services: Utilization of health 
services is especially low among the poor, implying inequity in utilization of care, with huge 
variations in service use across regions and significantly lower rates of utilization in the remoter 
areas of the country. This component will endeavor to stimulate demand for quality health 
services through the implementation of results-based financing (RBF) mechanisms and 
performance-based contracting models to increase utilization of health services for mother and 
child, including family planning, maternal and reproductive health services, childhood illnesses 
and other critical public health domains, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. With less 
than 10 years to reach the MDGs to reduce maternal and child mortality by three-fourths and 
two-thirds respectively, efforts have to be accelerated in implementing key high-impact 
interventions in regions with the worse indicators. Some RBF mechanisms have been developed 
and are being piloted under SHSDP I. Lessons from the pilot will be incorporated into the 
scaling up and implementation phase of these mechanisms while other performance-based 
contracting mechanisms will be piloted. Given that financial barriers to access represent the main 
cause of low utilization of health services, this component will also seek to strengthening 
hospital financing in order to increase utilization of hospital services among the poor through the 
development and selective implementation of exemption mechanisms to ensure that the poor 
access to health care, and the strengthening of the equity funds, put in place after the 2001 crisis, 
to allow free access to drugs for the poor.  
 
iv) Component 4: Institutional Strengthening: This component will continue to support a 
number of system development and institutional strengthening activities at the central and 
decentralized levels, including (i) support to the central level in areas such as public expenditure 
management and governance, procurement, financial management, internal auditing, and 
program oversight, which will complement and increase efficiency of the continuing support 
provided through PGDI; (ii) strengthening the regional and districts levels, including better 
defining roles and responsibilities and strengthening capacities in planning, programming and 
budgeting; (iii) strengthening the MOH and its decentralized levels on medical waste 
management; and (iv) consolidating the progress in operationnalizing the integrated health M&E 
system for the whole sector (public and private providers and all sources of funds) as well as 
improving capacity in data collection, management, dissemination and use of data for decision-
making at all levels of the system.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Project activities will take place throughout Madagascar.

 Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The National Policy on the Medical Waste Management was adopted in September 2005 by an 
interdepartmental decree No 2006-680 of the September 12, 2006 and approved by the Ministry 
of the Environment. The analysis of this policy shows that there is an ownership by the health 
sector of the problems and management of medical waste. The National Policy has developed the 
medical waste management protocol standard which must be adapted for each health care center 
depending on location. Moreover, the Ministry of Health has demonstrated clear ownership of 
the problems related to management of medical waste.  
 
In fact, the health sector has put in place three departments to implement the policy: Service 
d’assainissment et de Genie Sanitaire (SAGS), Service des Vaccination (SV) et le Sous 
Programme PrÃ©caution Universelle (SPPU). The SPPU is in charge of the characterization of 
the sorting and collection system of the medical waste in care service following the medical 
waste management typical in appendix 1 of the National Policy. The SAGS is in charge of 
designing and implementing the elimination equipment for each care center. This service has 
already set up removable incinerators (Montfort) and simple incinerators since January 2007. 
The Service d’Appui aux GÃ©nies Sanitaires (SAGS) has been an integral player in the 
development of the policy as well as information, education and communication activities and 
training conducted at various levels. However, much more work needs to be done on ensuring 
that the norms outlined in the policy are applied to each type of health center. The most recent 
supervision mission developed an action plan in collaboration with the SAGS to prepare a 
detailed plan and timetable to reinforce the implementation of technical medical waste norms for 
different types of health facilities, along with performance indicators and budget. This plan will 
be completed by end of July 2008 and will serve as input into the project appraisal document.

The proposed Specific Investment Loan will support four components which will contribute 
to the strengthening of the health system and enhance the institutional capacity of the Ministry of 
Health to improve access and utilization of health services. No negative environmental impacts 
will be provided by the proposed project. But the improvement of access and utilzation of health 
services, could increase the medical waste production in the different types of health facilities 
which could adversely affect the environment and infect the local population if not managed and 
eliminated appropriately.

The National Policy on Medical Waste Management was adopted in September 2005. This 
policy primarily relates to solid waste with a summary description on the liquid waste, and 
contains the following elements: (i) global and specific objectives as regards management of 
medical waste; (ii) the legal framework and law; (iii) waste characteristics with the 
prescribed elimination modes; (iv) norms, safety standards and measures to be adopted as 
well as critical equipment; and (v) a description of the monitoring system and an action plan 
with impact and results indicators.  The National Policy on Medical Waste Management 
(March 2007) along with the action plan (July 2008) will be disclosed in Madagascar and at 
the Bank's Infoshop prior to appraisal.  Since the project will not finance any new 
construction, OP 4.12 is not triggered and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) is not 
required. The SMU has agreed to accept transfer of the safeguard responsibilities.

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
