B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
1. 
The specific objectives of the project will be to:  
 
-
Help the Government to protect expenditures on core income transfer programs, at a time 
of increasing fiscal pressures;  
 
-
Support the Government’s program to include new beneficiaries in its “Employment and 
Training Insurance” (Seguro) program, aimed at providing temporary income transfer, training, 
and job placement services to unemployed and informal workers.  
 
-
Support the Government strategy to reform the “Family Allowances” program that 
provides income transfers to families of lower income formal sector workers, increasing 
transparency and accountability, and setting the operational pre-conditions for a possible 
expansion of coverage in the near future if required.  
 
-
Support the Government to enhance its capacity to monitor social protection, by 
providing technical assistance in the design and implementation of a national “Social Protection 
Survey” and the improvement of analytical capacity at the relevant institutions   
 
2. 
Based on these specific project objectives, a set of indicators will be selected to monitor 
the advances in the program. These indicators will reflect advances in the implementation of 
Page  2
improvement strategies in Seguro and Family Allowances. In that sense, the team expects to 
include the number of beneficiaries in Seguro, the number of operational Employment agencies, 
the proportion of family allowances beneficiaries receiving their benefits through the direct 
payment scheme, and other similar variables as the main indicators. Among these indicators, a 
subset will be selected as disbursement indicators, to be used to trigger disbursements. The 
baseline for those indicators will be set at appraisal and progress will be monitored throughout 
implementation of the program.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
1. 
The proposed project would be a US$ 495 million dollar SWAp, to support 
implementation of the Government program during one year. The project proposes to finance 
transfer expenses associated with social protection policies, focusing on two programs that are 
considered core to the social protection strategy: the “Employment and Training Insurance” 
program and the “Family Allowances” program. While the overall social protection policy 
includes many other programs, the focus on these two is justified by the need to concentrate 
efforts in activities that (i) have an efficient, transparent and accountable system to transfer 
resources to beneficiaries; (ii) have a scale large enough to be able to have an impact on the 
population’s welfare; (iii) meet basic conditions in terms of design and operation to be scalable if 
an emergency situation arise; and (iv) offer adequate financial management procedures to be 
included in a SWAp operation. These two programs perform better than others in these four 
dimensions.  
 
2.
While other loan instruments could be adopted, a Specific Investment Loan with SWAp 
approach is preferred for several reasons. First, the Government has a defined social protection 
policy that should be supported as a sector, since it provides protection against a wide set of risks 
or lifetime vulnerabilities. Argentina’s Social Protection system has programs offering protection 
against most social risks, but the main challenge of this system is to include all vulnerable 
population in these programs, as in many cases the most vulnerable groups are excluded. Since a 
SWAp allows for a combined sector support with focus on specific programs, the model is the 
most adequate for Argentina’s current situation. Secondly, Bank support would be fully owned 
by and integrated within the National Government, as it would represent a contribution to 
finance the improvement of existing programs, by pooling Bank and Government resources. 
Finally, Argentina has strong financial management systems that can be relied upon by the Bank, 
allowing for transparent, robust disbursement processes. By adopting this approach, World 
Bank’s disbursements would be heavily concentrated in two income transfer programs, to 
accelerate program implementation.  
 
3.
The operation will focus on two themes: (i) enhancing the effectiveness of social 
protection policies; and (ii) creating conditions to expand their coverage. Within the first theme, 
the operation will support improvement in key social protection programs, which should result in 
better management, higher impact, and less leakage of resources . The second theme implies that 
programs will become more flexible and able to include new beneficiaries if and when economic 
and social conditions require it.  
 
4.
The project will have three components. These will respectively support improvements in 
the Employment and Training Insurance program, the Family Allowances program and a 
Technical Assistance component.  
 
(i) 
Employment and Training Insurance Program. (Estimated amount US$ 95 million).  
Page  3
5. 
This component will support the scaling up of Seguro de CapacitaciÃ³n y Empleo 
(Seguro), the non-contributory unemployment insurance program which is one of the successor 
programs to Jefes. Seguro is administered by the MTESS through local labor offices and 
combines a cash benefit with training and job placement services.  
 
6.
Seguro provides beneficiaries with a monthly benefit for up to two years, ranging from 
AR$ 200-275 pesos (close to 20% of minimum wage). In addition, participants receive job 
search support through municipal employment offices and the network of employment services, 
including: labor intermediation services for public and private sector employment, basic and 
professional training, participation in training course, and technical assistance for starting small 
businesses.  
 
7.
Income transfer expenditures within Seguro in 2008 reached approximately AR$200 
million (US$60 million), with close to 80,000 beneficiaries by the end of the year. The program 
is managed through 176 municipal employment offices, which also offer labor market 
intermediation and other services, while benefits are paid directly by the MTESS. Since Seguro’s 
benefits last a maximum of two years andthe program was implemented in early 2006, nearly 
17,000 beneficiaries have already completed their term and other 12,000 have left the program 
for other reasons (such as retirement or because they found a regular, formal job).  
 
8.
Authorities plan to expand and improve Seguro through several actions in 2009 and later. 
These include:  
 
-
Increasing coverage, by transferring approximately 6,000 Jefes beneficiaries to Seguro 
per month, or 70,000 per year. As some beneficiaries will leave the program, this estimate 
implies that the total number of beneficiaries by the end of 2009 should reach 130,000; and 
160,000 by the end of 2010.  
 
-
Increasing the number of employment offices across the country: Authorities plan to open 
new employment offices, reaching a total of 250 by the end of 2009, 300 by the end of 2010 and 
350 by the end of 2011.  
 
-
Improving income transfers, through an incentive scheme: Authorities are planning to 
offer additional benefits to participants who complete their education, complete on-the-job 
trainings, and increase benefits for some specific groups of older workers  
 
9. 
Implementation of these actions should result in additional spending on income transfers 
by approximately AR$ 250 million in 2009, for a total of AR$450 or US$ 130 million. The Bank 
is currently supporting the transition process to switch beneficiaries from Jefes to Seguro, and 
plans to provide, through its “JefesTransition” loan, approximately US$ 15-20 million in 2009. 
The new SWAp loan would finance the remaining benefits, up to a total of US$95 million. Thus, 
including retroactive payments, the Bank would finance benefits corresponding to approximately 
1
year.  
 
(ii) 
Family allowances (Estimated amount US$ 395 million).  
 
10.
This component will support the expansion of the “direct payment” scheme ofFamily 
Allowances, a program that, among other benefits, provides a monthly payment for children of 
low income salaried workers. ANSES, the Social Security agency in charge of managing and 
paying these benefits, aims at progressively expanding the scheme until most benefits are paid 
directly by ANSES instead of using deductions from contributions by firms.  
 
11.
Child allowances provide a monthly transfer of AR$ 135 to children of formal workers 
earning less than AR$4800 per month . This transfer is part of the contributory social security 
system, financed by employer’s contributions. Approximately 74 percent of all benefits are paid 
Page  4
through the “Sistema Unico de Asignaciones Familiares” – SUAF, a program that allows 
ANSES to make monthly payments directly to beneficiaries, while others are paid through a 
compensatory system (where employers make the payments and reduce their social security 
taxes accordingly) or directly by their employers (as in the case of civil servants). ANSES has 
been working in recent years to transfer all benefits from the compensatory scheme to SUAF, as 
this scheme is considered to be more reliable, better protected from fraud or manipulation, and 
provides the administration with a system that can be used to pay other benefits as well. 
Unemployment insurance beneficiaries and retirees can also receive family allowances, which 
are paid directly by ANSES.  
 
12.
The expansion of SUAF to include all family allowances is a major contribution to 
improve effectiveness and governance of the program. Under the traditional compensation 
scheme, ANSES had no direct information on who were the beneficiaries, and had to rely on 
employers to control fraud or mistakes. In many cases there were duplication of benefits (as both 
father and mother received them), incorrect payments and, in some cases, there have been claims 
about employers withholding the payments. The SUAF scheme allows for a direct link between 
the managing agency (ANSES) and beneficiaries, who receive their monthly benefit directly 
through a bank account or cash payment. This not only increases transparency, but offers 
ANSES access to more information about the beneficiaries and their household.  
 
13.
SUAF could be used to expand coverage beyond the current universe. Family allowances 
are currently restricted to wage earners receiving monthly wages below AR$ 4800.  In recent 
years there has been a growing debate on whether these or other social protection benefits should 
be also offered to independent, informal and unemployed workers . Neighboring countries, such 
as Uruguay, has recently decided to use its family allowances program to offer a near-universal 
income transfer scheme to support poor families, regardless of their labor market situation, and 
some provinces within Argentina are also exploring this. If this path were to be taken by the 
national authorities, SUAF would provide an efficient, operationally proven system to implement 
it.  
 
14.
SUAF paid nearly 2.4 million child allowances each month by the end of 2008. This 
spending represents approximately AR$3.9 billion, or US$1.1 billion a year. This program has 
grown rapidly in recent years, as the number of benefits paid was below 300 thousand in 2002. 
Since mid 2008, all newly registered firms are required to join the SUAF system, and ANSES is 
slowly switching existing firms to the new model. SUAF presents clear advantages in terms of 
transparency and security, but it is also a key tool that could be used to implement new policy 
reforms in the future. Since payments are made directly by ANSES without intervention of 
employers, the system could be easily expanded to include other beneficiaries regardless of their 
position in the labor market, such as self employed, informal workers, unemployed workers or 
even inactive families. While authorities have not made any explicit statement indicating that 
they could introduce a reform in this direction in the near future, different analysts have agreed 
that it could represent an important advance in the design of the social protection system in 
Argentina.  
 
15.
The Bank support would contribute to finance approximately 850,000 benefits per month, 
at a per capita value of AR $135, for a total of AR $ 115 million /month or AR$ 1380 million a 
year, equivalent to US 395 million. Thus, including retroactive payments, the Bank would 
finance benefits corresponding to approximately 1 year.  
 
(iii) 
TA for the Social Protection System. (Estimated amount US$ 5 million).  
Page  5
16. 
The technical assistance component will support capacity building within the MTESS, 
particularly in the area of monitoring and evaluation of social protection policies. While the 
Ministry has strengthened its institutional capacity in recent years as result of the experience 
implementing some of the most important social policies in Argentina, there is a remaining 
challenge to improve its capability in the area of policy monitoring and evaluation. To improve 
this area, one percent of the loan proceeds would be used to support the Ministry’s team in: 
 
•
Developing information systems to provide internal and public updated information on 
the trends and impacts of social protection programs  
 
•
Collect detailed information through surveys and qualitative studies at the national level, 
to build a reliable baseline for the monitoring and evaluation systems  
 
•
Build analytical capacity within the Ministry and promote technical debates with 
academics and experts, to improve the policy making process and promote a more active 
participation of civil society.

Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Based on similar projects, Borrower's institutional capacity for safeguard poicies is adequate. 
The implementation agency has large experience in managing employment and training 
programs with good performance in operations and results. The management information and 
monitoring systems are strong. Moreover, the program has identified efforts to improve the 
functioning of the program in indigenous communities. Building on its experience through the 
Lifelong Learning project and existing capacity, the Indigenous Peoples Plan prepared for the 
project comprises institutional strengthening to implement, monitor and manage the plan, 
including the training of staff at field offices (training of lcoal agents to register participants in 
these communities) and of community promoters (training for tutors to work with the 
participants from these communities)

The proposed project will target for participants currently in the Seguro de CapacitaciÃ³n 
Empleo Program.  As of now it is estimated that about 17,000 Seguro’sparticipants belong to the 
25 municipalities where the OP 4.10 triggered.  There is not sufficient information to know the 
extent to which indigenous communities participating in the Seguro would be present in these 
areas.  The IPPs will incorporate specific strategies of promotion and communication adequate 
for In
digenous communities in order to guarantee their full understanding of the project.In
