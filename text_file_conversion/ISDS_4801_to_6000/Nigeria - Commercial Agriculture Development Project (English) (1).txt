2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective is to strengthen agricultural production systems and 
facilitate access to markets among participating small and medium-scale commercial 
farmers in the targeted states. The project has two components, namely, (i) Agricultural 
Production and Commercialization; and (ii) Rural Infrastructure. The project will also 
finance Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation and Studies.   
 
3. Project Description 
1. 
The total project cost is US$ 135.00 million over the period of four years.The 
proposed lending instrument is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) in the amount of US$ 
100.00 million of Bank’s financing payable in 40 years with a grace period of 10 years. 
The Federal Government, State Government and Beneficiaries will provide US$ 2.00M, 
US$ 28.00M and US$ 5.00M, respectively. A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) is 
proposed for this operation because of its flexibility to support a broad range of project 
activities in the participating states.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Project will abide by the covenants of the three triggered policies of Environmental 
Assessment, Involuntary Resettlement and Pest Management. The three safeguards 
instruments of ESMF, RPF and PMP have been prepared by the client and reviewed and 
cleared by the Bank.  The safeguard instruments were disclosed in-country and the 
Bank's InfoShop on January 21, 2008.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
This Project falls into Environmental category B, no adverse long-term impacts are 
anticipated.  No long-term adverse impacts were identified in the prepared safeguards 
instruments:  Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF); Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF); and Pest Management Plan (PMP).  This Project will not fund 
activities that would cause an adverse effect on the environment or any form of land 
acquisition or restriction of access to sources of livelihoods   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
No long-term adverse impacts are anticipated.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The ESMF and RPF carried out during project preparation have provided mechanisms to 
identify impacts beyond the generic ones for which standard mitigation measures are 
built and to be applied during the implementation phase.  The safeguards impacts 
identified are not expected to have any long-term or cumulative impacts.  Environmental 
protection clauses will be included in the contract documents for small-scale 
infrastructure like rehabilitation and/or construction of feeder/access roads, culverts and 
bridges. The PIU at the various participating states will recruit an environmental and 
social specialist who will be responsible for following up safeguards issues as and when 
they arise during project implementation   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

-
National Food Reserve Agency (formerly PCU)
