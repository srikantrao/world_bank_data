2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to improve the quality of life of small-holder 
farming community and indigenous communities in the project areas in San Pedro and 
Caaguazu departments in a sustainable manner, by supporting actions that will: (a) 
strengthen community organization and self-governance; (b) improve natural resources 
management; and (c) enhance the socio-economic condition of the target population.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is designed to operationalize a microcatchment area-based project strategy to 
address rural poverty and natural resource degradation in the Departments of Caaguaz√∫ 
and San Pedro, Paraguay.  It uses a highly participatory and decentralized demand-driven 
approach to poverty amelioration and natural resources management, and a production 
support process for rehabilitating and attaining sustainability of degraded and low 
Page  2
productive farming systems.  The project has four main components: (a) Community 
Organization Development and Capacity Building; (b) Rural Extension and Adaptive 
Research; (c) Sustainable Rural Development Fund; and (d) Project Management, and 
M&E  
 
This six-year project will be implemented through the following components and 
subcomponent:  
 
Component 1: Community Organization Development and Capacity Building (US$1.93 
million, 4.1% of total project cost).  The objectives of this component are to: (a) organize 
beneficiaries to participate actively in local decision-making structures both within and 
outside of the project; and (b) prepare project staff for the implementation of the project 
technical strategy aimed at adopting sustainable agriculture and rural development 
activities in microcatchments.  It has three sub-components: Training, and Community 
Organization Development, and Environmental Education.  
 
The first sub-component, Training, includes activities to build awareness and capacity 
relating to project strategy and approach in project technical staff (including extension 
agents, extension agents for indigenous communities and social organization 
technicians), as well as for small-holder farmers, indigenous communities and others.  
 
The second sub-component, Community Organization Development, includes applying 
the targeting criteria to micro-catchments and communities for their selection and 
participation in the project, establishing and strengthening Microcatchment Development 
Committees (MDC), Indigenous Associations (IA) and Municipal Steering Committees 
(MSC), as well as related training and institutional strengthening activities.  
 
The third sub-component, Environmental Education, supports education efforts focused 
on environmental problems to increase stakeholder awareness in dealing with these issues 
to improve their livelihoods.  
 
Main outcomes: Beneficiary (municipal, microcatchment and community) organizations 
institutionally strengthened for sustainable rural development management; Project staff 
trained to execute project actions.  
 
Component 2: Rural Extension and Adaptive Research (US$8.07 million, 17.3% of total 
project cost).  The objective of this component is to assist small-holder farmers, 
community groups and indigenous communities to overcome specific technical, socio-
economic and environmental constraints to allow them to shift from existing non-
sustainable agricultural practices to sustainable livelihood strategies which enhance 
natural resources management and reduce rural poverty.  It has two sub-components: 
Rural Extension, and Adaptive Research and Studies.  
 
The first sub-component, Rural Extension, supports: (a) beneficiaries to prepare 
Microcatchment Development Plans (MDP) and Farm Investment Proposals (FIP); (b) 
participatory identification of community demands for social, technical and financial 
Page  3
support arising from those plans; (c) implementation at the community level; and (d) 
training indigenous community and microcatchment-level community promoters to 
facilitate the process of knowledge management for adopting the project strategy at their 
respective community levels.  
 
A
second set of activities focuses on providing project beneficiaries specific technical 
assistance relating to agricultural and environmental practices, including: (a) sustainable 
land management; (b) product intensification and diversification; (c) processing and 
marketing; (d) environmental protection; and (e) management skills.  
 
The second sub-component, Adaptive Research, will finance practical technology 
validation and information needs to better address production and marketing issues of the 
projectís primary target beneficiaries (small-holder farmers and indigenous 
communities), as well as policy studies of special interest to decentralized local 
(departmental and municipal) and national sectoral institutions.  This would be attempted 
through public-private partnerships following a competitive grants approach.  
 
Main outcomes: Small-holder producers, indigenous communities and the rest of the 
microcatchment population trained in planning and implementing development plans and 
investment proposals for sustainable microcatchment management, supported by rural 
extension and relevant research initiatives.  
 
Component 3: Sustainable Rural Development Fund (US$24.88 million, 53.4% of total 
project cost).  The objective of this component is to finance demand-driven investments 
identified in the context of the Microcatchment Development Plans (MDP) and the 
Indigenous Community Development Plans (ICDP) which are based on a participatory 
local-level diagnostic and planning process supported under the Rural Extension sub-
component.  
 
The sub-projects are grouped into four categories: (a) household or individual farm 
level; (b) small-holders or indigenous community level; (c) municipal level; and (d) 
titling support for small farmers or indigenous communities.  Examples of eligible 
activities at the farm-level will include home improvements, sanitation and production 
diversification; at the community level, forest and water conservation and value-added 
schemes; and at the municipal level, fruit nurseries and erosion control along rural roads.  
 
The proposals for sub-projects are to be prepared by eligible project beneficiaries with 
support from project extension agents, screened first by Microcatchment Development 
Committees (MDC) or in the case of indigenous people by Indigenous Associations (IA). 
Applications will then be evaluated by the PMU.  Once awarded, grant funds will be 
transferred to beneficiaries for implementation through their legal associations.  
Beneficiary representatives and regional and national project staff will be responsible for 
sub-project monitoring.  
 
In most cases, the grant will finance a maximum of 85% of investment cost, with the 
grantees contributing the 15% in-kind contribution. The average on-farm investments are 
Page  4
expected to amount to a maximum of about US$1,500 for small-holder farmers 
(including both individual and group proposals) and about US$950 per family in 
indigenous communities; the cost of small-holder community and municipal investment 
activities are expected to vary.  
 
Main outcomes: Farm Investment Proposals (FIPs), Community Investment Proposals 
(CIPs), Indigenous Community Development Plans (ICDPs) and Municipal Investment 
Proposals (MIPs) financed, and outputs created.  
 
Component 4: Animal Health Improvement (US$5.83 million, 12.5% of total project 
cost).  The objectives of this component are to assist Paraguay to initiate animal health 
improvement measures and to contribute to the regional strategy for animal health 
management.  It has two main sub-components: (a) Strengthening the nodal 
implementing agency for this component - SENACSA; and (b) Strengthening the Vice 
Ministry of Animal Husbandry(VMG).  
 
Under the first sub-component, the project would finance software and information 
systems, lab and office equipment, communication services, small works, consulting and 
training to increase the capacity of SENACSA to implement animal health improvement 
measures in the country, with emphasis in the areas along Paraguay's borders with 
neighboring countries (Argentina, Brazil and Bolivia) and consistent with the actions 
comprising the Regional Strategy for Eradication of Transboundary Diseases in 
Mercosur.  
 
The second sub-component would strengthen the VMG with office and clinic 
equipment, small works, consulting and training to monitor and manage the project 
animal health initiatives effectively.  
 
Main outcomes: Improved Animal Tracking and Information systems, laboratory 
facilities and field operations established and managed effectively by SENACSA and the 
VMG to ensure high national standards of animal health.  
 
Component 5: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$5.88 million,  
12.6% of total project cost).  The objectives of this component are to strengthen the 
animal health strategy of the GOPy and put in place a functional and effective project 
management team.  It has four sub-components: (a) Strengthening of the National Service 
for Animal Quality and Health (SENACSA), (b) Project Management; (c) Monitoring 
and Evaluation; and (d) Communication and Information Dissemination.  
 
The first sub-component, Strenghtening of SENACSA, finances software and 
information systems, lab and office equipment, communication services, small works, 
consulting and training to improve the performance of SENACSA to implement an 
effective animal health strategy for Paraguay.  
 
The second sub-component, Project Management and Capacity Building for MAG, 
finances management services, office equipment, and all administrative and operational 
Page  5
expenditures to improve MAGís organizational skills-mix to effectively manage the 
project.  
 
The third sub-component, Monitoring and Evaluation, finances the design and 
implementation of a M&E system to support project management.  Specific objectives of 
the system include: (i) monitoring project implementation in relation to overall 
objectives, baseline situation, inputs and outputs; (ii) providing and receiving feedback 
from stakeholders; and (iii) generating inputs for dissemination of project results and 
lessons learned.  
 
The fourth sub-component, Communication and Dissemination, supports the 
dissemination of project information to provide project stakeholders with systematized 
knowledge for the management of natural resources and rural poverty reduction 
throughout the countryís Eastern Region.  
 
Main outcomes:  Information systems, labs and field operations created and managed 
effectively by SENACSA to ensure high national standards of animal health,  project 
management structure, including the Project Management Unit (PMU) at the central level 
and four Zone Coordination Units (ZCU), and relevant units of the MAG: Established, 
and functioning effectively, executing and monitoring project activities, and integrating 
them with the activities of other sustainable rural development programs.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project area will cover the 39 municipalities in the two poorest departments of the 
countryís Eastern Region, Caaguaz√∫ and San Pedro.  Project interventions will be 
concentrated in 84 microcatchments (about 10% of all microcatchments in the two 
departments) within those 39 municipalities.  Direct project beneficiaries will be small-
holder farming families (with fewer than 20 hectares of land), indigenous communities 
and rural workers in the two target departments who will benefit from extension services, 
capacity building and investment funding.  
 
It is estimated that the project will reach 16,800 small-holder farming families in an 
estimated 600 communities, and 2,030 indigenous families in 73 indigenous 
communities.  In addition, larger-scale farmers in the selected microcatchments, rural 
school teachers and students, technical staff and managers from municipal governments 
and MAG, and producer and civil society organizations will benefit from training and 
environmental education services.  
 
The departments of San Pedro and Caaguaz√∫ cover areas of Upper Parana Atlantic 
Forest, Cerrado savannah, and Humid Chaco ecosystems. Few protected areas exist 
within the departments and remaining forests are fragmented and highly degraded at 
present.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
No large scale, significant and/or irreversible negative impacts are foreseen. Positive 
environmental impacts are a basic objective of the project, especially relating to the 
improved management and conservation of natural resources and the reversal and control 
of land degradation processes (i.e. through improved soil and water conservation, 
adoption of agro-forestry techniques, restoration of riparian forests, water source 
protection and domestic sanitation).  The monitoring and evaluation system will 
incorporate specific means to measure impacts.  Some of the expected direct positive 
impacts in the project area include: (i) improved soil fertility; (ii) improved water quality 
(both surface and ground water); and (iii) greater biodiversity within riparian zones.  In 
addition, project-supported activities for environmental education and improved inter-
institutional coordination are expected to generate substantial environmental benefits for 
the project area.  
 
Environmental Assessment. The project is classified as a Category B.  It was designed 
to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Bank umbrella policy on 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01).  Positive environmental impacts are a basic 
objective of the project.  Some project activities will have potential environmental 
impacts and will mostly be those financed by the FDRS to support the adoption of 
improved land use practices, community and municipal sub-projects and works.  In 
conformity with Bank policy and GOP legislation on Environmental Assessment, an 
Environmental Assessment (EA) was conducted, and an Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) was prepared.  
 
A
negative list of activities that are not elegible for funding will also be incorporated 
into the EMP and the Operational Manual in regard to sub-projects funded through the 
FDRS.  
 
Page  7
The draft EA and respective EMP were submitted to the Bank in December 2005. The 
final EA will be sent to the Infoshop before Appraisal. In addition the EA will be posted 
on the MAG website.  Consultations, including stakeholder meetings, preparation 
workshops   presentation events, and interviews were held during the preparation period.  
 
For the environmental monitoring and impact evaluation, a number of output and impact 
indicators will be measured and supported under the M&E subcomponent which will 
include a systematic socio-environmental monitoring of 10 pilot microcatchments (for 
details, see Annex 3).  Training has also been incorporated into the EMP and the program 
for project management, field personnel, and stakeholders include several environmental 
thematic areas including: Environmental assessment and management, land-use planning 
and watershed management, and other thematic areas that may result from local needs 
during project implementation.  Study tours and exchanges also are included to improve 
understanding and mainstreaming of environmental and micro-catchment management.  
 
Pest Management. The project activities seek to reduce use and dependence on harmful 
agricultural chemicals and will not significantly increase use of pesticides or promote 
their use to any important level; therefore a pest management plan has not been prepared.  
Small amounts of veterinary antiparasitic chemicals and vaccinations will be procured for 
the activities related to strengthening animal health.  In those cases, the Bank will provide 
its no-objection based on the request for procurement.  These substances will conform to 
Bank OP 4.09 standards in this regard, specifically only class III and IV substances as 
classified by the WHO can be procured.  
 
In addition, it should be noted that small amounts of pesticides will probably continue to 
be used by a small portion of microcatchment farmers for which disposal of containers 
may be requested by communities to reduce health and environmental risks associated 
with pesticide use.  This disposal will follow the guidelines set forth under OP 4.09 Bank 
guidelines, in particular FAO Guidelines for Packaging and Storage of Pesticides (Rome, 
1985), Guidelines on Good Labeling Practice for Pesticides (Rome, 1985), and 
Guidelines for the Disposal of Waste Pesticide and Pesticide Containers on the Farm 
(Rome, 1985).  In addition, pertinent national laws and regulations in this regard will also 
be followed.  
 
The project will support technical assistance for the adoption of proven, economically 
and environmentally sustainable Integrated Pest Management practices (IPM), an 
approach designed to increase farmer productivity (yields) while reducing input costs, 
human health risk and adverse environmental impacts through the virtual elimination of 
pesticide use.  The IPM approach further increases sustainability of agro-ecosystems by 
focusing on improving the knowledge and skills of farmers to enable better management 
of resources.  Finally, IPM programs are economically sustainable as they reduce 
farmersí dependence on procured inputs.  
 
Indigenous Peoples. The proposed project will specifically target indigenous peoples in 
the project area.  Thus, during project preparation, consultations were held with 
Indigenous Associations to determine their priorities and needs.  Project activities will be 
Page  8
implemented with the full participation of the communities and will be carried out in a 
manner respectful of their cultural characteristics.  To ensure this, extension agents and 
technical assistance personnel working with indigenous populations will have prior 
training and experience working with indigenous communities.  In addition, an 
anthropologist will be employed by the project to consult on indigenous and other social 
issues.  Moreover, an Indigenous Peoples Plan has been prepared to orient the projectís 
interaction with indigenous communities and can be found in the project files.  See 
Annex 14 for more information.  
 
Forestry. The proposed project will primarily support environmentally protective 
activities and those which are supportive of small farmers (i.e., farm and community 
forestry).  No logging activities, charcoal or fuelwood production will be supported 
through project funding although these activities take place within the project region and 
microcatchments.  The project will finance investments focused on reforestation or 
regeneration of natural forests to protect water sources and waterways, and reforestation 
for productive purposes in beneficiary small holdings to reduce impacts to native forests.  
No large scale reforestation activities with exotic species will be carried out and the total 
area of plantation or enrichment activities is estimated under 5000 hectares.  
 
Natural Habitats.  The project, as well as the semi-blended GEF project, seeks to 
increase sustainability, maintain and enhance habitat for biodiversity conservation, and 
provide environmental goods and services for rural communities.  No significant 
conversion or degradation of natural habitat is expected from the project investments.  
Improvements in natural resource use and management should provide an important for 
the maintenance of connectivity in the landscape.  Critical natural habitats and protected 
areas have been identified within the project area and precautions will be taken through 
the EMP which provides for an environmental review framework to ensure that natural 
habitats are not adversely affected and positive effects are maximized.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No indirect or long term negative impacts are foreseen as a result of anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  Long term impacts are expected to be positive given the 
focus on sustainability, social inclusion and community strengthening.  Activities in 
micro-catchments planning and management, sustainable production, erosion control and 
restoration of degraded forest should provide the platform for long-term sustainability.  
Training and education activities are also expected to strengthen this focus.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The project has incorporated environmental sustainability as a key element for rural 
development rather than focus on rural poverty solely from a monetary, market, or 
infrastructure point of view.  A greater range of issues critical to small-farmer and 
indigenous communities have been incorporated into the project including erosion 
control, forest restoration, landscape planning, and water quality have been added in 
addition to the land-titling and productive activities also supported.  The close association 
Page  9
of the future GEF-funded Paraguay Biodiversity project also will provide a platform for 
sharing experiences with the Bank financed project in land management that fosters 
greater protection and mainstreaming of biodiversity issues in the productive landscape 
and the provision of environmental goods and services.  
 
Community strengthening and organization is also a key element incorporated into the 
project.  This aspect permits greater local involvement and a lead role by the main 
stakeholders in their development; an important issue in a highly centralized country with 
a
long tradition of government-driven models of rural development.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Strict environmental evaluation procedures and environmental licensing mechanisms, as 
well as proposing mitigation measures, are built into the EMP and the Operational 
Manuals of the project. Three levels or categories of projects have been established based 
on their environmental risk or potential for impacts and a framework for review, 
approval, supervision, and monitoring has been established within the EMP.  A guide for 
mitigation measures has been included in the EA based on FAO guidelines in this regard. 
The project also has been formally licensed by the Secretary of the Environment as set 
forth under national law and regulations in regard to environmental impact assessment.  
The license was issued in January 2006 and is renewed every two years.  
 
Project management will incorporate a person charged with environmental supervision 
and monitoring.  Field personnel, including technical specialists and extension agents will 
also facilitate project environmental measures and mainstreaming of sustainability 
concepts.  Training packages have been incorporated into the project program of 
activities in order to ensure adequate understanding of environmental screening 
procedures, impact mitigation, and environmental management.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Stakeholders include small-scale farmers, local community organizations, indigenous 
communities and Indigenous Associations (IAs), rural labors, rural school teachers and 
students, technical staff and managers from local governments, main government 
agencies implementing projects related to poverty reduction, natural resources 
management and sustainable rural development, producer and civil society associations, 
and staff from MAGís Directorate of Rural Extension (DEAG) and other directorates.  
 
During project preparation, consultation workshops were held with project stakeholders 
to identify and prioritize problems to be addressed by the project as well as resources and 
constraints to bear in mind during project preparation and implementation.  In addition, 
PARN extension agents were consulted to learn from their direct, on-the-ground 
experience and to determine areas in which PARN succeeded and failed, especially in 
regard to targeting, extension and delivery of services so as to strengthen the design of 
the proposed project.  
 
Page  10
Stakeholders will play a key role in project implementation and decision-making 
through the Community Development Groups (CDGs) and project steering committees.  
Some of their roles will include: participation in the elaboration of Microcatchment 
Development Plans (MDPs) and Indigenous Community Development Plans (ICDPs) 
and annual operation plans, as well as in assuring social control. Indigenous groups and 
Indigenous Associations will play a determining role in the implementation of project 
activities in their communities ranging from elaboration to approval and implementation 
of the indigenous community investment proposals.  
 
The EA was disseminated among the executing agencies, and printed and electronic 
copies were made available for public disclosure.
