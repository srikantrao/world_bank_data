2. Project Objectives 
The primary development objective is to support investments in peaking power supply 
capability in Bangladesh such that unmet demand for energy is reduced by 1-billion kWh 
per year. A secondary development objective is to build capacity in the implementing 
agencies:  GTCL, PGCB, and EGCB.  Through the project, the companies will 
implement best practice in procurement and implementation (supported by Owner�s 
Engineers, and, in EGCB�s case, an O&M contractor); environmental andsocial impact 
assessment and mitigation; and governance (through specific accountability reporting 
and, in the case of GTCL and EGCB, investment in corporate management information 
systems).   
 
3. Project Description 
The Project will have five components:  i) a 60 km natural gas pipeline from the gas 
processing center at Bakhrabad to the power generation site at Siddhirganj, in South 
Dhaka; ii) a 300 MW peaking power plant at Siddhirganj, composed of two simple-cycle 
gas turbines of 150 MW each; iii) an 11 km, 230 kV transmission line from Siddhirganj 
to the Maniknagar grid substation in South Dhaka, plus associated switchgear; iv) 
Page  2
technical assistance to support an O&M contractor for the power plant, and owner�s 
engineers for the GTCL and PGCB components; and v) core management information 
systems for GTCL and EGCB.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project area will be a transmission corridor in central-eastern Bangladesh, and a 
power plant location southeast of Dhaka.  A 60 km, 30-inch pipeline will be built linking 
the gas processing facility at Bakhrabad to existing power generation sites at 
Meghnaghat, Haripur, and Siddhirganj.  At Siddhirganj, gas will feed a new 300 MW 
peaking facility, composed of two 150 MW turbines.  Power from the 300 MW peaking 
plant will be evacuated via a new 230 kV line to Maniknagar, but transfer capability 
between a new substation to be financed in the project, and the existing substation at 
Siddhirganj, will also allow for evacuation into the main Dhaka transmission ring.  At 
Maniknagar, the project will finance gas insulated switchgear (GIS) at an existing 
substation.  
 
While the transmission line will use much of an existing Right of Way over flat terrian, 
the gas pipeline will cross five major rivers. The laying of the pipeline will need to take 
into account the possible ecological impacts on acquatic flora and fauna. There may also 
be some loss of trees, which may require statutory clearances. As for the generation 
subproject, there is a wooden board making factory adjacent to it which is known for its 
high emission of fine particles; on the south is a derelict jute mill that is being converted 
to a Special Economic Zone; and on the north is a steel re-rolling mill, and then a couple 
of brick kilns.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
xx households will need to be re-settled, mainly in the urban areas close to Siddhirganj 
and Haripur.  Otherwise there are no significant social safeguards issues.  The 
transmission corridors for both gas and power have already been developed.  Laying the 
gas pipeline will lead to a small, permanent loss of arable land, for which compensation 
will be made.  The power plant will be built in an existing power generation site.  
 
The key environmental safeguard issues relate to cumulative impacts of the project 
activity at the generation site. As per the EA, air (including thermals effects) and noise 
pollution are the likely major environmental impacts, primarily because of the fact that 
the generation subproject is located in a populated area with a number of polluting 
industries around it. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared to 
address these issues to the extent possible.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
It is possible that additional power generation capacity will be added at Siddhirganj at a 
later date.  This will also be gas-fired, so will have only a marginally negative impact on 
local air quality. However, the project is likely to lead to further induced industrial 
developments in the area, which may lead to long term adverse impacts. Though the 
project cannot do anything about it, an area based development approach is 
recommended to prevent worsening of cumulative environmental impacts in the area.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
In case of the transmission corridors for power evacuation and gas supply, alternative 
routes were analysed, and the one with least environmental and social (resettlement) 
impacts were chosen. The analysis of alternatives is documented in the EA documents.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The implementing agencies have prepared environmental management plans and, in the 
case of the transmission components, resettlement action plans.  The Bank project is 
helping the implementing agencies move to a higher performance standard than has been 
customary in Bangladesh on these issues, on-going assistance and supervision will be 
necessary to help ensure timely and effective implementation of mitigation measures. 
 
An Environment Management Unit (EMU) is to be set up at EGCB under the project. It 
is proposed to be led by a Senior Environmental Engineer who will oversee 
Environmental Managers responsible for individual generating units. The GTCL has an 
existing Environment and Safety Management System (ESMS), while the PGCB has an 
Environment Health and Safety (EHS) system. Both of these will be customized and 
activated for each subproject.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholder populations are households in the transmission corridors that will be 
impacted by construction and operation of the facilities.  Some of these households will 
need to be permanently resettled. Consultations and disclosures are on-going. 
Consultations were also held as part of the EA preparation, and are documented in the 
reports along with the key issues raised.
