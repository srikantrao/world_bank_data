2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to improve the access and efficiency of electricity 
services in Bamako and in targeted  areas outside of Bamako. This financing mainly for 
the extension and reinforcement of EDM SA transmission and distribution networks is 
crucial to enable Mali to fully capitalize on the additional thermal capacity under 
construction and expected gas generated power from C√¥tedíIvoire. The project will 
advance the GOMís agenda of access expansion as electricity services will be provided to 
areas that currently receive inadequate or non-existent grid supply. The ultimate objective 
is to support the countryís shared-growth agenda enabling it to achieve its millennium 
development goals.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project includes the following three components:  
 
Component 1: Transmission and distribution reinforcement and extension (US$107.0 
million). Assessment of the Mali power systems have revealed that the current medium 
voltage feeders in the Bamako area are inadequate to serve the rapidly growing urban 
population and distribution networks in many areas are already overloaded.  This 
prevents the country from fully benefiting from the additional power supply expected by 
Page  2
2010 from increased thermal generation capacity and from regional interconnections 
thereafter. This component is mainly intended to   finance (i) the rehabilitation of the 150 
kV transmission line between Segou and Bamako to allow a reliable transit of high 
voltage power to Bamako; (ii) the construction of a 150 kV loop  around Bamako to 
improve reliability of electricity supply to the Bamako area; (iii) the rehabilitation and 
extension of the distribution networks in Bamako to provide electricity access to growing 
quarters of the city; (iv) the expansion of grid access in main  secondary towns (Kayes, 
Sikasso, Koutiala, Kati, and Mopti) and in the Niger River Irrigation Office area 
particulary in the localities of Siribala, Dougabougou, Sansanding, Molodo and Dioro;  
(v) the connection to the main grid of the localities of  Oul√©ss√©bougou and Kangaba 
currently supplied by isolated diesel units  
 
Component 2: Energy efficiency and demand side management (US$5.0 million) : The 
key objectives of this component is to address the countryís energy security needs 
through the implementation of energy efficiency measures across various supply and 
demand side sector, including preparing a demand side management (DSM) program 
based on large scale deployment of energy efficiency lighting measures in the short-term. 
The implementation of this initiative is expected to  reduce energy consumption and peak 
load demand thereby bringing direct benefits to households and  other consumers 
(through lowered electricity bills) and the government (through deferred investment in 
electricity generation for new capacity and enhanced energy security). Furthermore, 
actions implemented under this initiative will help reduce local pollution and global GHG 
emissions.  The component has four sub-components: (i) Energy Efficiency Residential 
and Public Buildings Lighting (distribution of about 1,000,000 CFLs); (ii) Efficient Street 
Lighting Program (installation of about 15,000 efficient lamps); and (iii)  Technical 
Assistance to support the energy efficiency program.  
 
Component 3: Capacity and institutional strengthening of key sector institutions (US 
$8.0 million). The energy sector reform experience over the last five years indicates that 
more work is needed to strengthen the institutional, legal and regulatory environment and 
governance to foster an open business environment attractive to private investors and 
operators. This component is intended mainly to help GOM in its restructuring efforts of 
EDM SA by setting a minimum platform of technical  and financial performance targets 
with monitoring indicators. In addition key sector institutions (DNE, CREE, MEME) will 
also be strengthened to improve sector planning, regulation, governance, fiduciary 
oversight, knowledge dissemination, monitoring and impact assessment.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
To date, it is known that the project activities will be mainly in urban areas of Bamako 
and selected isolated centers currently serviced by EDM SA with isolated thermal diesel 
units. However the precise locations of project sites and specific activities will only be 
confirmed during project implementation.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues  
 
Overall, the project is expected to have positive environmental benefits.  However 
potential impacts may include : soil erosion and degradation, habitat loss, habitats 
fragmentations or disturbance, noise pollution due to  operating machinery, degradation 
of neighborhoods, avian hazards from transmission lines and towers, land acquisition, 
loss of livelihood and economic activities on the part of project affected people (PAPs).  
 
World Bankís environmental and social safeguards will be complied with by EDM SA 
and other operators involved in electricity services delivery and demand-side energy 
management initiatives, using provisions of the ESMF and RPF.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
It is anticipated that there will be no cumulative adverse impacts.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement 
Policy Framework were prepared and disclosed on November 14, 2008 in country on 
November 12, 2008 and at InfoShop on November 14, 2008. These documents were 
revised during appraisal and re-disclosed in country on April 24, 2009 and at the 
Infoshop on 29 April 2009.  These two documents include measures for compliance with 
Page  4
OP 4.01 and OP 4.12.  An environmental safeguard assessment was conducted. 
Discussions with the borrower revealed that there is no structure to ensure environmental 
and social monitoring of the ESP activities. It was recommended the establishment in 
EDM SA of a sustainable Environmental and Social Unit (UES) by project effectiveness 
to provide EDM SA with more efficient coordination mechanisms for environmental and 
social activities. Environmental Focal Points will be established in the Planning 
Department and Central Electricity Department of EDM SA, as well as within the DNE.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include: EDM SA, DNE, DNACPN and local communities.  The 
ESMF and RPF were reviewed and cleared by the Bank and then disclosed in-country on 
November 12, 2008 and in the InfoShop on November 14, 2008.  During implementation, 
these two safeguard instruments will serve as basis to screen all sub-projects. Based on 
the results of the screening, the Borrower will prepare sub-projects specific EIAs/EMPs, 
or apply mitigation measures provided in the checklist, whichever scenario is deemed 
appropriate.  Similarly, in view of the potential land acquisition and/or loss of economic 
activities, the government will prepare the appropriate Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) 
following the guidelines of the Resettlement Policy Framework guidelines.  Once 
completed, subproject-specific safeguard instruments will be reviewed, approved and 
disclosed prior to investment.
