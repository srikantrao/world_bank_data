B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The projectís PDO is to improve producersí capacity to increase the production and to ensure 
year-round availability of cereals and livestock products in rural areas.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Project activities will be organized around the following components and sub-components.  
 
Component 1. Improvement in food production and accessibility. This component will finance 
the adoption of high performing technological packages, including: (i) for food crop production, 
the focus will be on improved seeds, fertilizer, manure and sustainable soil management 
technologies. An additional option will be animal traction and post-harvest technologies; (ii) for 
livestock, the focus will be on milk production and short cycle livestock products: genetic 
improvement (local and exotic breeds), access to veterinary advises and medicinal products 
(including, vaccination, and animal feed; and (iii) for the zones adjacent to protected areas in 
which agricultural production has been curtailed or prohibited by law: technologies for 
valorization of non-forestry products. This component will also promote agriculture and 
livestock integration technologies to raise productivity (fodder production, manure etc..)  
Page  2
Financial assistance to acquire the technology packages will be provided in the form of 
matching grants to qualified households, producer groups and communities. A minimum cash 
contribution will be required.  Those household with limited purchasing power who cannot 
provide their contribution in cash will be given the opportunity to pa
rticipate in ìvoucher for 
workî programs.  They will be compensated with vouchers that can be redeemed as payment of 
their cash contribution. The project will collaborate with the World Food Program for the 
implementation of the ìvoucher for workî program.  
 
Component 2. Post-harvest loss reduction and agricultural market coordination  
 
(a) Sub-Component 2.1: Post-harvest loss reduction and processing. This sub-component aims 
to: (i) ensure dissemination of improved storage technologies for reducing post-harvest losses, 
including improved granaries and double-bagging), and (ii) finance equipment, reinforce 
capacities, and support the expansion of small scale improved cereals and milk processing units 
managed principally by women groups in rural areas.  
 
(b) Sub-Component 2.2: Agricultural market coordination. The sub-component will finance: (i) 
the improvement of agricultural market information systems to enable producers to make better 
production and marketing decisions; (ii) the development of bulking and warrant age activities in 
surplus areas; (iii) the restructuring of cereal banks into marketing cooperatives to supply grain 
to consumers in deficit areas; (iv) the set up of a pilot warehousing facility in south western 
Burkina Faso, and (v) the strengthening of the capacity of the National Agency for Management 
of Emergency Stocks (Soci√©t√© Nationale de Gestion des Stocks de S√©curit√© ñ 
SONAGESS) particularly with regard to market information.  
 
Component 3. Institutional development and capacity building.  
 
The component aims at reinforcing institutions and building staff capacities for effective 
delivery of services and technologies. The component will finance activities in the following 
three areas.  
 
(a) Sub-Component 3.1: Building capacities of service providers.  This sub component will 
focus on: (i) building capacities of private service providers, including technical advisory 
providers to support technology transfer to farmers, accounting and management advisers for 
farmer based organizations, and (ii) strengthening the capacities of core public services to deliver 
proper support to project implementation in their field of competence  
 
(b) Sub-Component 3.2: Strengthening agricultural input supply delivery systems.  This 
subcomponent will provide:  (i) training, equipment and technical assistance to support the scale 
up of the input delivery systems for seeds and other agricultural inputs through: (i) 
Dissemination and implementation of the new Seed Production Law (Lois sur les Semences et 
les Intrants Agricoles); (ii) strengthening and expanding of existing input supply networks 
(AGRODIA and COCIMA in particular); and (iii) strengthening of the animal feed production 
supply system.  
 
(c) Sub-Component 3.3: Strengthening capacities of producer organizations. Under this sub-
component the project would provide sufficient organizational, management, and advocacy 
capacities to enable producer organizations to play an active role in the transfer of technologies, 
the marketing of agricultural products, and the promotion of the sectorís interests. In particular 
the Chambers of Agriculture (Chambres R√©gionales de líAgriculture).will be provided with 
additional technical staffing, technical assistance and training to contract service providers for 
the transfer of technologies. This sub-component will also finance training modules for grassroot 
Page  3
producers based organizations, on-farm demonstrations, farm technology days, study tours and 
producer-to-producer exchange visits, Communication and information activities (e.g., 
communication campaigns, technology workshops, etc.)  
 
(d) Sub-Component 3.4.  Management and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) of project 
activities. Financing will be provided for the equipments, technical assistance and training 
required for project execution by existing operational units in the three ministries in charge 
(Agriculture, Livestock, and Environment). Statistics and Planning divisions of theses ministries 
will be reinforced to carry out M&E activities.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Project will be implemented nationwide.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Through Phase 1 of PNGT-1 and PNGT-2 and during the preparation and implementation of the 
PAFASP, the Government of Burkina Faso has trained environmental and social specialists to 
address safeguards requirements. The Ministry of Agriculture PSCU will work in close 
collaboration with the Burkina Faso Environmental Management Agency to ensure that the 
project meets Bank and national safeguard requirements.  Furthermore, the environmental 
management capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture, the line Ministry of the project, will be 
assessed and then strengthened during the preparation and implementation phases of the project.  
The specific measures, including coordination and operational linkages with Ministry of 
Environment and other key partners, will be spelled out and costed in the ESMF.  In addition, 
provisions of the ESMF and RPF will be summarized in the PIM, PAD and Financing 
Agreement of the project. As the project preparation advances, the training needs of key project 
partners in the area of social and environmental safeguards will also be assessed and a training 
program developed.  
 
To strengthen environmental stewardship activities under PASAPA, operational linkages will 
be expanded with the Ministry of Environment, which will be in charge of the implementation of 
an entire component of the project.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
Due to the difficulty inherent in defining what the real environmental impacts of envisioned 
sub-projects are, and determining what mitigation measures to put in place, an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will be developed.  The ESMF will formulate 
standard methods and procedures, along with institutional arrangements for screening, review, 
approval and implementation and monitoring of subprojectsí specific EMPs.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The project will not intervene directly in protected areas, but around these areas. The ESMF 
will discuss potential environmental issues and impacts related to project activities.

Yes No TBD 
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
X
Dissemination of improved technologies to increase staple food crop production may well 
involve increased use of pesticides.  The project will adapt and/or update and re-disclose the 
existing Pest management Plan (PMP) prepared under the PAFASP.   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
The project will focus on increasing production through intensification and not 
extensification. Therefore the project will not finance land acquisition. In some exceptional 
cases, community land management activities may require land acquisition and resettlement.  A 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared as due diligence and RAPs will be 
prepared during the implementation if needed. The RPF will be disclosed in-country and at the 
InfoShop prior to the appraisal.
