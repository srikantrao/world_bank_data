E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The Bank has financed various projects in the Education Sector in Argentina over the past two
decades. These projects have been implemented at the national as well as at the provincial level.
This experience has resulted in close knowledge of the Bank's safeguard policies. Besides, the
country's own systems regarding the triggered safeguard policies are in active and effective use.
