2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the Dakar Diamniadio Toll Highway (DDTH) is to provide significant 
improvement t
o
the Dakar metropolitan area as the economic driver of Senegalís 
development. It intends to give this densely populated area the infrastructure necessary 
for its expansion to the benefit of the Dakar population, its businesses as well as the 
whole Senegalese economy, while building a resettlement city for displaced people. It 
also intends to support the restructuring of one of the poorest and flood prone area in 
Dakar, Pikine Irr√©gulier Sud, (PIS) and to contribute to the mitigation of one of the 
largest pollution source in Dakar, the Mbeubeuss uncontrolled solid waste deposit.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project will be financed through a Sector Investment Loan (SIL), which has been 
selected as the most appropriate instrument. The project will comprise four components:  
Page  2
Component A: Road infrastructure (IDA participation: US$0 million, AfDB: US$70 
million, AFD: US$ 12 million, Concessionaire: US$117.5 million, GoS: US$ 116 
million)  
 
Even though IDA is not financing this component, the Bank has facilitated the process 
leading to the recruitment of a private concessionaire for this project. The GoS has been 
keen to attract private sector involvement in the project via a PPP arrangement as a way 
of: (i) mobilizing private sector investment in the road sector and (ii) ensuring that the 
project would be built and maintained to the largest extent possible by the private sector. 
In view of the size and costs of the motorway and of the timetable required to implement 
a
PPP, it would have been over ambitious to tender the entire project as a PPP. As a 
result, the GoS decided and has already fully financed the development and construction 
of the first two sections. It also decided to allow for a mix of public and private funding 
for the whole highway, under a PPP scheme which would involve the construction of the 
third and fourth sections and the operation of the toll on the second and third and fourth 
sections.  
 
Feasibility and traffic studies carried out showed that, although the construction of the 
highway will bring huge tangible economic benefits to the area, revenue generation 
opportunities will be limited and will therefore constrain the ability of a concessionaire to 
generate sufficient profit to repay debt and generate return on equity over the life of the 
concession. A mix of public and private funding was therefore warranted and a capital 
grant will thus be provided from the GoS budget, with the support of other donors 
(mainly AfDB, AFD), to fund part of the construction costs of the concessionaire.  
 
Component B: Right of way clearing and urban development of Tivaouane Peulh 
Resettlement Site Preparation (IDA participation: US$48 million)  
 
As it has been designed to pass through densely-populated areas, the construction of the 
new toll highway between Pikine and Diamniadio will affect around 30,000 persons, 
most of who are likely to choose to be resettled (the other part choosing to be financially 
compensated). In accordance with IDA policy, the GoS has secured a 165 ha resettlement 
site, located in Tivaouane Peulh, to resettle the displaced population affected by phase 4 
and the restructuring of Pikine Irr√©gulier Sud (PIS) of the project. The proposed 
settlement site will need considerable preparation and construction, both in terms of 
infrastructure and equipment, to be able to accommodate the resettled population.  
 
1. 
The resettlement site of Tivaouane Peulh is located near Keur Massar (8-9 
kilometers out of the city), Its limits are Malika on the South-West side, Keur Massar on 
the southern side, Niaga on the eastern side, and the Atlantic Ocean on the northern side, 
and is one of the few remaining uninhabited lands in the Dakar metro area. The 
resettlement site of Tivaouane Peulh was selected after careful consideration of 
environmental and social parameters, the constraint of a tight real estate market, and the 
availability of unoccupied land in the Dakar metro area.  An earlier proposal at Keur 
Massar for the relocation of displaced households was found inappropriate by the 
environmental impact assessment of Keur Massar resettlement site (disclosed at InfoShop 
on March 01, 2006). The assessment cited among other reasons for the decision: (i) its 
close proximity to Mbeubeuss, (ii) bad odors from the dumpsite and the direction of main 
winds; (iii) the area being prone to flooding and vector diseases and (iv) the area having 
Page  3
contaminated ground water and possibly contaminated soils.  An alternative resettlement 
site was identified in the nearby city of Sangalkam at Tivaouane Peulh, located about 2 
km (1.3 miles) away from the existing dump site, with the dominant winds blowing 
North-North West/North East, and hence, parallel to the location of the dumpsite (North 
East-South West).  The detailed environmental study of the alternative resettlement site 
(disclosed at InfoShop on November 01, 2006) and its soil analysis (disclosed at 
InfoShop on September 01, 2008) indicated that the site was acceptable. However, the 
closing of the landfill -- scheduled for November 2010-- thus became a necessary 
condition for the acceptability of the resettlement site; the recommended environmental 
measures will be conducted under a sub-component of Project component B.  Closing the 
waste disposal site will also eliminate one of the major sources of pollution in the Dakar 
area. A replacement landfill has been identified, development of which should be 
completed by May 2010 thus allowing the beginning of its operation. All the relevant 
EAs  and study (soil analysis) are identified by their names and disclosure dates are 
above.  
 
Component C: Urban restructuring of Pikine Irr√©gulier Sud (IDA participation:US$17 
million)  
 
1.
Since the motorway will be built through the Pikine area, the project will take this 
opportunity to provide extensive urban restructuring of the densely populated Pikine 
Irr√©gulier Sud area, which is facing a severe lack of basic socioeconomic infrastructure 
and services, leading to numerous social and environmental issues especially flooding, 
inadequate sanitation, and poorly constructed road networks.  
 
2.
The main objectives of this component will thus be to: (i) secure land ownership 
titles for current residents; (ii) improve the living environment of PIS residents; (iii) 
support access to basic social services such as water, sanitation, electricity, health care 
and education; and (iv) provide better access to the area, in order to support urban 
integration and accessibility to local, regional, and national infrastructure and facilities.  
 
Component D: Program implementation (IDA participation: US$15 million)  
 
This component will include all activities related to the coordination and supervision of 
the program activities as performed by the Agency for Investment Promotion and Major 
Projects (APIX), including the monitoring and evaluation.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Dakar Diamniadio Toll Highway is located in the Dakar area. The highway consists 
of the rehabilitation of the existing highway until Patte díOie. The part of the highway 
from Patte díOie until Diamniadio will use a new route. The most contentious part of the 
new route will pass through Pikine, a low income neighborhood located in a flood prone 
zone.  The analysis of alternative routes including social, environmental, and technical 
criteria had determined this routing to be the only viable option, although it will require 
considerable resettlement.  But in order to enhance the social benefits of the toll highway 
to a broader population segment outside the right of way, an urban upgrading touching 
parts of that very specific neighborhood has been included in the project design.  
 
Page  4
The highway also passes through the Mbao Forest, which has a very low biodiversity 
even as it is the largest green zone in greater Dakar.  The analysis of alternative routes 
indicated the selected route to be the only viable option, after possible routing further to 
the north or to the south has been deemed to incur more social and environmental costs.  
On the basis of a protocol agreement between APIX and the Directorate of Water and 
Forest in charge of the Mbao Forest, mitigation measures consistent with the Mbao Forest 
Management Plan will be implemented during project execution. To further ensure its 
sustainability, neighboring communities will be involved using a community forest 
management approach.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
In terms of environmental and social safeguards, the Senegal Diamniadio Toll road 
project is complex and as such classified as a category A project. The major social and 
environmental risks will be the resettlement of affected households in Tivaouane Peulh 
close to the existing Mbeubeuss open landfill (2 kilometers away). This waste belt has 
been in operation since 1968 and has widely polluted the surrounding area through open 
burning of municipal waste. In the context of the project, the Mbeubeuss landfill will be 
closed under environmentally acceptable standards. A study is being completed to 
prepare details of the closure plan, and an advanced resettlement policy framework to 
mitigate adverse socioeconomic impacts on waste pickers has been already been 
developed and disclosed.  A more specific action plan will be elaborated as the detailed 
closure plan and its impacts become available.  An alternative sanitary landfill site will 
replace the current uncontrolled Mbeubeuss dumpsite.  
Page  5
The water table is known to be polluted, and cannot be used safely for drinking water or 
agricultural production. A piped drinking water system will be installed in the 
resettlement area. A detailed study to determine the level of soil pollution with dioxins, 
furans and PCBs in the proposed resettlement area was completed in September 2008 and 
indicated that there was no soil pollution in the proposed resettlement site. All the 
measured parameters were below the dangerous levels and do not pose a public health 
risk. The soil can be used without restriction for human settlement and agricultural 
production.  
 
The new toll road passes through the Mbao protected forest. Despite the fact that it has 
an extremely low biodiversity, the Mbao Forest is among the last forested areas in the 
Dakar region.  The toll highway passes through the Mbao Forest because further to the 
north, the route would have passed through a very densely populated area over a distance 
of about 12 km.  Further south, the highway would have led to the displacement of public 
utilities networks located along the RN1 (electricity, telephone, water and gas) and of the 
railway.  In this context, the only feasible technical alternative left for the toll highway 
was to go through the Mbao Forest.  The Toll Highway will impact only sixty hectares or 
10% of the forest area which is basically comprised of old and unproductive cashew nut 
trees and therefore very poor un terms of biodiversity.  The introduction of this specie has 
had negative impacts in the endogenous ecosystem biodiversity. Moreover, strong 
urbanization in the Dakar area has increased pressure on the forest such that the toll 
highway is the only opportunity to preserve the forest and reverse its degradation by 
implementing a sustainable management plan.  
 
Consequently, the Directorate of Water and Forest provides its authorization for this 
routing, and in order to preserve this green zone, an Mbao Forest Management Plan was 
adopted in December 2008 by the Regional council of Dakar in collaboration with the 
Directorate of Water and Forestry. The main objective of this plan is to manage the forest 
in a sustainable way and to enable the surrounding communities to benefit from the Mbao 
Forest and serve as a leisure and recreation area to the public and for other sustainable 
natural resource uses for the remaining 640 hectares which are bound to be declassified 
for housing development purposes. Furthermore, the toll highway is a unique opportunity 
for instituting a transparent management system of the Mbao Forest resource use for the 
benefit of local surrounding communities.  
 
On the basis of a draft protocol agreement between APIX and the Directorate of Water 
and Forest, the Private entity in charge of the toll road operation will be in charge of 
reintroducing more endogenous tree species in the in the forest under the oversight of the 
Directorate of Water and Forest; APIX will finance the compensation for trees destroyed 
within the Right Of Way; and will further finance part of the Mbao Forest Management 
Plan with active and continuous involvement of surrounding local communities.  
 
The other potential environmental impacts are:  
 
-
increased pollution of the Thiaroye groundwater aquifer used as a source for 
drinking water for Dakar and local inhabitants; As groundwater pollution is very local 
Page  6
and does not affect an international aquifer, .it will not affect any neighboring states, 
thereby OP 7.50 (International Waterways) is not triggered;  
 
-
three health posts will be constructed in the new resettlement site and as such, 
health waste will be produced. In this case, since the construction of health facilities is 
such a tiny aspect of the EMP, the preparation of a Health Waste Management Plan is 
part of the implementation of the EMP. Furthermore, health waste management is 
integrated in the ESMF for the restructuring of the Pikine area;  
 
The major social risk is the resettlement of over 3,000 (about 30,000 persons) 
households from the right-of-way of the highway in the Pikine area (road segment 
between Pikine and Keur Massar) with related impacts on livelihoods, loss of shelter 
(titled land and unauthorized dwelling in slum).  Other social impacts include the 
disruption of social capital and livelihoods of communities and social groups as the right 
of way is currently occupied by structures for housing, religious, horticulture or economic 
and commercial uses. The Mbeubeuss dump site is a source of income for extremely 
vulnerable groups including street children.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Air quality in the Dakar area is becoming problematic. The new highway will have a 
positive impact on air quality, since traffic jams will be reduced.   A long term 
environmental and social impact of improved infrastructure in the Dakar area, without 
similar investments outside Dakar, will be increased rural exodus.  The construction of 
DDTH also falls within the context of the GoS' efforts at decongestion and 
decentralization of Dakar with the development of a new socioeconomic pole in 
Diamniadio (Diamniadio Integrated Special Economic Zone or DISEZ).Finally, the 
relocation of over 3,000 households to Keur Massar will speed the urbanization of this 
peri-urban area, which is already undergoing rapid population growth, with the 
concomitant needs for urban planning, regulation and provision of manageable public and 
basic social services.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
A
comprehensive participatory study of alternative routes was undertaken by the Client 
during Project preparation. The proposed route is the most viable option from a technical, 
social, economic, and environmental point of view. Alternative routes also involved 
significant resettlement, which is comparable to the present level of resettlement for the 
selected route and with more complex ecological and social effects involving destruction 
of livelihoods.  
 
Alternative relocation sites could not be found closer to Dakar.  A site closer to the 
Mbeubeuss landfill was rejected and the present relocation zone is the best alternative 
location available.  A soils pollution analysis study was conducted and finalized in 
September 2008 and disclosed before project appraisal. A health baseline study will be 
undertaken before resettlement, and future soils analysis and epidemiological monitoring 
and evaluation will be part of the environmental and social monitoring and evaluation 
Page  7
plans, in line with international practices.  Piped water systems will be established and 
participatory public consultation and participation (sensitization campaigns) will be 
conducted on serious health related risks of domestic and agricultural use of polluted 
ground water.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Client has prepared: (i) an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the entire Right Of 
Way of the new highway route; (ii) an EA for the Keur Massar Resettlement site; (iii) a 
detailed EA regarding the pollution caused by the Mbeubeuss landfill; and (iv) an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework for the Pikine neighborhood. These 
studies have been disclosed in-country (March 1, 2006) and in the Infoshop (October 16, 
2006). The detailed EAs for Pikine-Diamniadio and for the resettlement site have been 
approved by the Bank. Furthermore the Client has prepared a soils pollution analysis 
study regarding the pollution status of the resettlement area, which indicated that the soils 
can be used without restrictions (September 2008).  
 
For social safeguards, APIX has developed (i) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
that covers the entire project (disclosed on January 7, 2007 and re-disclosed on March 19, 
2008);  subsequently, (ii) a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the stretch Pikine-Keur 
Massar (disclosed in-country on June 23, 2008 and in the Infoshop on January 8, 2008); 
(iii) a RAP for the Keur Massar-Diamniadio stretch (disclosed in-country on August 28, 
2007 and in the Infoshop on June 1, 2007); and (iv) a RAP addendum for the resettlement 
zone at Tivaouane Peulh has been prepared (disclosed in-country on November 14, 2008 
and in the Infoshop on December 2, 2008); an addendum to The RAP Keur Massar-
Diamniadio covering the junction at Diamniadio has also been prepared (disclose in-
country on November 14, 2008 and in Infoshop on December 2, 2008).  The Client has 
also prepared a RAP for the Pikine Irr√©gulier Sud restructuring component (disclose 
in-country on November14, 2008 and in Infoshop on December 1, 2008).  A 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address the socioeconomic impacts of the 
closure of the uncontrolled landfill on waste pickers was prepared (September 2008) and 
disclosed in-country on November 14, 2008 and in the Infoshop on September 1, 2008.  
For the moment, the exact number of those affected and the nature of the impacts are not 
known.Once determined a stand alone, comprehensive RAP consistent with the approved 
RPF and the provisions of World Bank OP/BP 4.12 will be prepared and disclosed along 
with the technical study for landfill closing.  
 
The Borrower is familiar with World Bank safeguard policies as it has implemented two 
RAPs on Government-funded road segments: Malik Sy-Patte díOie segment (disclosed 
on December 25, 2005) and the Patte díOie-Pikine segment (disclosed onMay 19, 2008). 
These two RAPs were prepared by an international Technical Assistance Consultant 
familiar with World Bank OP 4.12, and reviewed and approved by ASPEN.  The Bank 
team provided further support during the implementation of these RAPs. One of the main 
outcomes of the Bank technical support for these resettlement activities was APIXís 
decision to recruit an NGO to facilitate the RAP implementation in the Patte díOie-Pikine 
segment with a particular focus on those being physically displaced.  This NGO has 
Page  8
successfully facilitated the resettlement of over 630 households with no major 
complaints.  The lessons learned from this experience convinced APIX of the importance 
of having additional NGOs involved in the implementation and monitoring of future 
RAPs. Three NGOs will thus be recruited after project effectiveness and the resources 
available to the project to facilitate the implementat
ion of the projectís resettlement 
program.  Performance evaluation of these NGOs will be conducted regularly to improve 
implementation, provide follow-up technical assistance or extend the scope of their work 
as required by the situation on the ground.  
 
APIX has also developed a communication strategy towards the affected communities 
along with the publication of a Guide du d√©plac√©, a brochure explaining thecontents 
and principles of the RAP in lay terms. A revised and updated brochure will be published 
and disseminated during project implementation, as part of APIXís social communication 
strategy.  
 
In sum, community and NGO participation in the resettlement activities, combined with 
an effective communication strategy were considered key factors in preventing major 
social tensions and complaints during the two previous RAP implementations.  Although 
there are invariably unforeseen difficulties in RAP implementation, APIX adequately 
dealt with the situations as they arose and has adapted its approach to resettlement 
planning, implementation and M&E for the future operations.  To implement the 
safeguards instruments prepared under this investment, the following institutional 
arrangement is envisioned by APIX:  
 
1. 
A field office will be established after project effectiveness in the project zone, 
staffed with 6 people including a sociologist, an urbanist, an M/E specialist, a 
communication specialist, a database manager, and a team assistant.  
 
2.
Three NGOs will be recruited after project effectiveness to facilitate the social 
mobilization process.  
 
3.
Five Local Liaison Committees comprising 3 to 5 persons each will be established 
at the commune level to liaise with the PAPs and ensure that their rights (complaints 
and/or dissatisfaction) are understood, taken into account and handled in a time-bound 
manner.  
 
4.
Ten Urban Reinstallation Committees representing affected local residents will be 
established at the quarterís level.  
 
5.
One coordination unit.  The overall coordination of the implementation of 
safeguards instruments will be done by the Environmental and Social Unit at the 
Direction du project Autoroute in charge of the toll highway project.  This Unit is staffed 
by an urbanist and a sociologist, and will work closely with the environmental and social 
unit of the Direction des Grands Travaux in charge of the physical clearing of right of 
way. These units will be unified during project implementation.  
 
6.
An expert panel including members of NGOs, civil society, research institute will 
be established and will participate in the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation 
of safeguards instruments.  
 
Page  9
APIX will further prepare and submit to the Bank by March 2009 a draft road map 
outlining how it intends to effectively carry out the resettlement program.  
 
The technical capacity of the staff involved in project implementation will be reinforced 
as needed.  The supervision plan will include adequate environmental and social support, 
with technical assistance for APIX and regular supervision (at least twice per year) by 
Bank safeguards staff.  Additionally, a resettlement specialist consultant is being 
recruited and will be based in the Dakar office to ensure adequate and regular supervision 
of the project's resettlement program.  Furthermore, an Environmental and Social 
Advisory Panel (ESAP), as required for such complex projects will be established after 
Project effectiveness, comprising at a minimum an environmental management and a 
resettlement advisor.  
 
In the new site, it will be set hand-over certificates listing names and ID numbers of 
eligible PAPs with the amount and date of their payment 
ñ
which will be signed by the 
responsible field officers and the civil works contractor - so cases of fraud can be 
detected in future audits.  
 
An audit of the resettlement in segments 1 & 2 has been carried out. The draft audit has 
not been disclosed because it is currently under review by APIX. The ISDS, which 
incorporates its main conclusions, will be disclosed. The following lessons were drawn 
from the review of the resettlement program carried out under the Government-funded 
road segments from Malick Sy to Pikine. They will be incorporated in the 
implementation of the resettlement program under the proposed Bank-sponsored 
operation: (i) recruitment right after project effectiveness of the first of the three 
facilitating NGOs to assist the PAPs during the compensation process (recruitment 
process is on-going); (ii) elaboration of a social communication strategy so as to give 
more voice to the PAPs and put in place a more rapid and time-bound response 
mechanism to their queries; (iii) development and dissemination the internal grievance 
resolution mechanism in manners accessible to PAPs, most of whom are illiterate; and 
(iv) strengthening of the M/E monitoring system with a special emphasis on monitoring 
compensation payments, livelihood restoration and complaints resolution. An action plan 
that is included in the AM of the mission and these plans will be implemented after 
project effectiveness, when the resources are made available to the Project. Regarding 
PAPs from Segments 1 and 2 (from Malik Sy to Pikine, the government-funded 
segments) that have not yet received payment, USD 16 millions will be deposited in an 
escrow account by the Government of Senegal as a condition of project effectiveness.  
The PAPs concerned will be contacted by APIX and the Groupement Operationnel (the 
Government partners that carried out the census survey)using all available means of 
communication likely to reach them (mail, radio, printing press, community leaders, etc) 
to present themselves to received their compensation.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
APIX has prepared an outline of future consultations to be held during Project 
implementation and monitoring.  The key stakeholders are the people who will be 
directly affected, either because they will have to move or because their businesses will 
Page  10
be impacted in one way or another. APIX, has taken several actions to ensure that these 
stakeholders are fully informed and are meaningfully consulted about the project and its 
impact.  First, APIX has created an Environmental and Social Unit (ESU) within its 
Department of Highway Project in order to give special attention to these safeguards 
issues.  Second, the APIX ESU will open a field office, staffed with a social and a 
communication expert.  Third, APIX will engage three NGOs or other agencies which 
will have their own staff to work directly and daily with the people affected by the 
project.  Fourth, these contracted agencies will also open offices in the project area, first 
in Pikine South then also, once the resettlement operation is underway, in Keur Massar.  
Fifth, the APIX ESU, in consultation with the contracted NGOs, will formulate and 
implement an effective communications strategy as part of the overall project 
implementation.  Sixth, a panel of experts from a wide horizon will implement a 
monitoring program to assess the safeguards mitigation activities, in the short term and in 
the longer term. Finally    a mechanism to ensure that all entitle PAPs are compensated 
and fully relocated before the start of any physical infrastructures is put in place by 
APIX.  For example, a site hand-over certificates listing names and ID numbers of 
eligible PAPs with the amount and date of their payment - should be signed by the 
responsible field officers and the civil works contractor - so cases of fraud can be 
detected in future audits.  
 
Administrative officials in both the project area and in the receiving area (Keur Massar) 
are other key stakeholders. To ensure that these officials are kept up-to-date on project 
programming and to solicit their advice and assistance, the Client has constituted in each 
administrative area project liaison committees; and at the neighborhood level, urban 
reinstallation committees. These local level committees will involve administrative 
officials and people affected by the project, as well as project representatives and NGOs. 
In addition, APIX and NGO field staff will keep in close contact with local officials so 
that everyone is fully informed about project actions, the responsibilities of all parties for 
each action, and their timing. Timely progress reports will be produced quarterly to show 
transparency.  
 
In the broadest perspective, everyone in the capital region is interested in and concerned 
about the progress of the Dakar Diamniadio Toll Highway program.  The Client has 
developed an elaborated social and institutional communication strategy for various 
aspects of the Project with a special focus on addressing resettlement and toll issues.
