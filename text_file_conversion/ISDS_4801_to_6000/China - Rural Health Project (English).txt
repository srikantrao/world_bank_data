B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overall development objective of the project would be to assist the Government in 
implementing policies to improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities by increasing the 
accessibility of poor rural households to quality public and personal health services.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would build upon findings of the AAA and the principles contained in the 
Government’s October 2002 document, “Decision on Further Strengthening Rural Health” as 
well as a 2005 Government “Project Framework Paper” outlining proposed foci for the project.  
The latter document sets out four such foci:  1) promote the development of the rural health 
insurance scheme by expanding coverage, promoting fairness and building capacity for 
management of the NCMS and MA; 2) improve health service delivery by improving the quality, 
cost-effectiveness and efficiency of services; 3) strengthen public health services by exploring 
new mechanisms for improving access to core public health services; and 4) strengthen sector 
coordination by developing mechanisms for evaluation and replication of rural health reforms 
promoted by the project.
