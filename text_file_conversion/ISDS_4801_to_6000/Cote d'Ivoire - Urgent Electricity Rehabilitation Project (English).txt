3. Project Description 
3.1 
The total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$54 million, of which 
IDA will finance US$50 million (including PPF refinancing and physical and price 
contingencies, but excluding duties and taxes), GoCI $1million and CIE the remaining 
US$3 million. The project consists of three main components:  
 
Component 1:  Distribution Network Rehabilitation and Expansion (US$ 44 million)  
 
3.2 
This component includes rehabilitation and upgrading of medium and low voltage 
distribution equipment and facilities mainly in the greater Abidjan area, by: (i) expanding 
distribution substations and feeders to connect awaiting customers and those customers 
with ‘unofficial’ connections; (ii) replacing existing run-down, overloaded and over-aged 
medium and low voltage equipment; (iii) replacing overloaded HV/MV transformers to 
improve security of supply; and (d) installing compensation devices in substations to 
comply with operating voltage standards and reduce losses.  The specific sub-projects 
have already been selected by the operator (CIE) based primarily on their impact in terms 
of security of supply, potential for connecting new customers and reduction of losses.  
About 60,000 additional consumers are expected to be connected to the grid as a result of 
investments made under the project.  To enhance SOPIE’s project supervision capability, 
ten project vehicles will also be purchased under this component.  
 
Component 2:  Preparatory activities for the future transmission network investments 
(US$ 4 million)  
 
3.3 
The project will provide resources to finance the consulting expertise required to 
carry out feasibility and Environmental Impact Assessment studies as well as bidding 
documents for the projects needed to restructure and upgrade the HV network, as well as 
contribute to greater exchanges of electricity with neighboring countries via the WAPP.  
These studies will enable GoCI to fast track the second generation of transmission 
projects urgently needed to deal with the acceleration of electricity demand growth since 
the end of the civil conflict.  
 
Component 3:  Project oversight and institutional support (US$ 6 million)  
 
Page  3
3.4 
This component will provide the Government with a diverse range of technical 
assistance and training needed to: (i) implement and supervise the project,  (ii) carry out 
legal, institutional and financial studies for the implementation of the policy reforms spelt 
out in the LSDP,  (iii) upgrade SOPIE’s system planning skills, (iv)  build capacity in the 
three sector entities as well as MME to ensure smooth management succession in the 
medium-term, and (v) design programs for energy efficiency improvements such as 
demand side management and the dissemination of low-energy bulbs. In addition, a 
financing mechanism with a revolving fund of US$3m will be set up to facilitate 
household connections for low-income families.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
4.1 
It is expected that in the project, the civil works will predominantly take place in 
the greater Abidjan area. In addition, some parts of Yamoussoukro and SoubrÃ© will 
also be covered. The studies will be confined to the district of Abidjan and in some 
regions in the interior of the country including Bondoukou, Agnibilekro, Sebebou, Tai, 
Tabou and Zagne.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Social:  
 
1.1
The project will have some positive impacts by addressing the urgent household 
electricity connection needs of the population living in badly or unserved areas, and 
enhance their access to public street lighting and thereby greater security.  It is also 
expected that some of the civil works would be a source of employment, as a majority of 
the workers will be locally recruited.  It will thus contribute to improved economic and 
social development in poor neighborhoods.  
Page  4
1.2 
The negative social aspects of the project are expected to be minor.  The project 
will not undertake disruptive civil works requiring land acquisition, demolition of 
structures, damage to crops, etc. Given that the physical activities under the project will 
deal with distribution network rehabilitation, upgrading of existing substations and 
preparatory studies for the future transmission network, potential adverse impacts are 
considered unlikely.  The vast majority of project-funded works will replace or upgrade 
existing distribution lines in urban areas.  While it is not expected that there will be land 
acquisition or restriction of access to sources of livelihood, as an additional precaution a 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared and disclosed in-country and at the 
Infoshop on 7 and 9 February, 2009 respectively.  
 
1.3 
The project will develop a communications strategy to promote beneficiary 
empowerment and the active involvement of local communities during project 
implementation.  Thus, a communication committee constituted by SOPIE, CIE, 
UVICOCI (Union des villes et Communes de Cote d’Ivoire), ADDCI (Association du 
District etDepartement de Cote d’Ivoire) and local NGOs; will be set up to promote 
specificinformation mechanisms and tools that reinforce stakeholders’ participation inthe 
project.  A local NGO will be used to play a facilitation role between the project and the 
beneficiaries.  
 
Environment:  
 
1.4
The project is rated as a category B project.  The minor civil works associated 
with upgrading and expansion/restructuring of CIE’s distribution networks will lead to 
some site-specific environmental impacts, but these are expected to be small and thus 
easily remediable.  Since the sites of the future sub-projects are not known and project 
preparation is evolving, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 
will be the appropriate safeguards instrument and this will (i) establish the mechanisms to 
determine and assess future potential environmental and social impacts; and (ii) put in 
place mitigation measures to be taken into account in the design, construction and 
operation of the sub-projects to reduce, offset or eliminate adverse environmental and 
social consequences of the sub-projects.  
 
1.5 
To address the site-specific environmental impacts of minor civil works 
associated with upgrading and expansion/restructuring of CIE’s distribution networks, an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) was prepared by 
SOPIE/CIE.  The ESMF was disclosed in-country and at the Bank’s Infoshop on 7 and 9 
February 2009 respectively.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
Page  5
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
4.1 
The Bank’s safeguard policies applicable to this project are: (i) Environmental 
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and (ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12).  The project 
has been assigned an environmental risk Category B, because the planned activities might 
have some minor environmental and social impacts that will be site-specific and thus 
easily remediable.  
 
4.2 
The ESMF and RFP instruments will also be used for screening subprojects.  The 
screening process will ensure that the project does not finance any activities that require 
relocating people or limiting their access to public amenities.However, if at screening 
stage, the proposed subprojects show adverse effects depending on the type, location, 
nature and magnitude of their potential environmental and social impacts, an EIA or a 
RAP will be developed along with the necessary mitigation measures.  SOPIE will 
upgrade the capacity of its environment unit during implementation (with IDA support 
under the project) in order to address environmental and social issues safeguard issues.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
5.1 
SOPIE (Societe d’Operation Ivoirienne d’Electricite), CIE (Compagnie Ivoirienne 
d’Electricite), ANDE (Agence Nationale de l’Environnement) and Ministry of Energy. In 
preparing the ESMF and RPF, the consultant had broad-based consultation with key 
stakeholders and potential project- affected persons.
