2. Project Objectives 
The current project's development objectives are: 
ì(i) Reducing GHG emission growth 
rate through the promotion of long term increase in patronage of less energy intensive 
transport modes in cities; and (ii) Inducing policy changes in favor of sustainable 
transport projects.î   
 
3. Project Description 
Four metropolitan areas have been pre-identified, Tucum√°n, Rosario, C√≥rdoba 
andPosadas, to participate in the Argentina GEF Sub-Program, on the basis of the 
following characteristics: (i) they are economic and governmental centers at the national 
or regional level, (ii) the municipal governments are committed to addressing 
environmental and sustainable transport issues, and (iii) they comply with the federal 
regulation and are entitled to prepare projects for the World Bank.

Projects in the selected cities would not be identical in design, to allow for tailoring to 
local priorities and conditions, but just as in the Regional Program, they would share 
common content in order to ensure optimal knowledge-sharing and the generation of a 
critical mass of lessons and results that would be useful for learning and policy 
development. The proposed Argentina GEF sub-program would be the first of three 
programs presented to the Board in this series.  
 
Project components are pilot investments, technical assistance, and capacity building 
activities in selected cities which are divided by windows of opportunity briefly described 
below. The specific project component for the Argentina Sub-program consists of pilot 
investments and technical assistance in 4 selected cities to remove barriers for sustainable 
transport. This sub-program and city-projects will co-fund measures in three thematic 
ìWindowsî (out of the five identified in the Regional Program), following the World 
Bankís priorities and GEF priorities for climate change mitigation in the urban transport 
sector :  
 
Window 2: Better coordination and integration of transport and land-use planning and 
environmental management: technical assistance and measures to foster more integrated 
transport and land use planning to reduce the use of private motor vehicles, reduce trip 
lengths, and increase the accessibility to public and non-motorized transport for 
Tucum√°n  
 
Window 3: Modal Interconnection, and Effectiveness and Efficiency of Public 
Transport: Pilot investments and technical assistance to facilitate the improvement of 
public transport systems and/or improve the effectiveness and interconnectivity of those 
systems with other modes of transport and induce mode switching away from the use of 
private cars.  
 
Window 4: Non-motorized transport: pilot investments and technical assistance to better 
integrate walking and biking into the culture and planning processes of cities, and to 
create incentives for their use.  
 
More specifically the project components description is as follows:  
 
Works  
 
The only works that have been identified during the project preparation are the 
following:  
 
(i) 
Rosario: Construction of 4.8 km of bikeways in  
 
(ii) 
Posadas: 3km of BRT corridor in the AV, Uruguay  
 
(iii) 
 C√≥rdoba: Construction, enhancement and upgrading of segregated busways and 
bikeways

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Works will take place on the selected cities, Tucum√°n, Rosario, C√≥rdoba, and Posadas. 
The technical assistance component, as well as the capacity building will also be 
implemented at the national level in the Greater Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area 
(AMBA). Therefore, all project related works will take place in consolidated urban areas 
and no effects are expected on natural habitats, resources or fragile zones. Special 
attention will be given to the potential impacts of construction in highly urbanized areas 
and the potential impacts of the project, especially on surrounding communities.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is expected to have positive environmental impact in the long-run, since it 
aims at improving the quality of public transport and non-motorized transport systems 
and improve traffic safety. The project is designed to have a positive long-term impact 
due to the reduction of global and local emissions, as CO2, Particles, NOx, SOx and 
other contaminants currently present in selected cities. The reduction will be directly 
linked to improved vehicle operation, reduced trip lengths, use of more efficient modes of 
transport and improved technologies.  
 
However, a number of short-term and long-term induced impacts trigger OP 4.01.A 
detailed screening 
ñ
using standard forms ñ of the different sub-project sites will confirm 
that none are close to natural habitats or environmentally sensitive areas, nor do they 
require major works that will result in irreversible long-term impact or displacement of 
people.  
 
The main direct impacts are expected to occur during construction and cause localized 
negative environmental impacts. Such impacts are expected to consist essentially of 
noise, vibration, dust, and traffic disruption. Additional negative impacts during 
construction will occur due to haulage and final disposal of materials. Most of these 
impacts can be mitigated by proper implementation of the environmental and social 
manuals that have been prepared for this project.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area:

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
