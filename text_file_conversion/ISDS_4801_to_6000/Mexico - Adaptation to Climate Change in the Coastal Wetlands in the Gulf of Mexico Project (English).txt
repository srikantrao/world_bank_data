B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective of the project is to reduce the vulnerability to the anticipated impacts of climate 
change focusing on the integrity and stability of coastal wetlands and associated inland basins of 
the Gulf of Mexico. The project will support the implementation of pilot adaptation measures in 
four wetlands of the Gulf of Mexico selected based on their vulnerability to CC impacts and on 
their biological importance.  In addition, the project seeks to identify national policies to address 
the impacts of climate change on water resources at the national level (global overlay).   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Component 1. Detailed design of key selected adaptation measures: the objective of this 
component is to complete the design of strategic adaptation measures in four pilot sites to be 
implemented under the project.  The objective will be achieved through: a) Technical, 
engineering design of adaptation pilots; (b) drafting of management plans; (c) M&E system 
Page  2
design to measure the impacts of adopted measures; and (d) assessment of the cost of CC in 
wetlands and the services it provides as well as of the cost and benefits of adaptation measures.  
 
Component 2. Implementation of pilot adaptation measures in four selected wetlands highly 
vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Most of the projectís funding will go into 
investments in specific adaptation measures addressing the most pressing vulnerabilities in each 
pilot site in the face of climate change impacts, on a pilot basis. The component will support the 
following activities:  
 
Sub-component 2.1: Wetlands-Panuco-Altamira   (Tamaulipas).  The  adaptation pilots will 
focus on: (i) expanding  the area under conservation around the Lagoon La Escondida, essential 
to maintain  surface  hydrology balance on the land side of the city of Tamaulipas;  
 
this  would  include  the strengthening of land barriers and  other conservation measures,  (ii) 
implementation of a coastal zoning regulation that takes into account anticipated climate 
impacts.  The implementation of adaptation activities will be led by the State Environmental 
Agency.  
 
Sub-component 2.2: Wetlands of the Papaloapan Rivershed, Alvarado Lagoon (Veracruz).  
 
The  project will support the: (i) integration of climate concerns in the conservation and 
management strategy of the Alvarado Lagoon; (ii)  adoption  and  effective  enforcement  of a 
buffer zone around the lagoon; (iii)  support  for  the construction of a pilot stabilization barrier 
to buffer extreme weather events and future sea level rise. The implementation of project 
activities will be lead by INECOL, the State Environmental Agency in cooperation with local 
NGOs.  
 
Sub-component 2.3: Wetlands of Carmen-Pajonal- Machona (Tabasco).  The project will 
support:  (i) reforestation with native species to create biological corridors, to enhance 
biodiversity conservation while supporting state and local reforestation efforts, (ii) pilot actions 
to reduce coastal erosion threatening the sandbars that separate the coastal lagoons from the sea. 
The State of Tabasco has created the State Climate Change Committee, SCCC, with wide 
representation of national, state and local stakeholders. In the meetings held with key 
stakeholders and community leaders the project was directed to coordinate all action through this 
SCCC.  
 
Sub-component 2.4: The Siam Kaían nature conservancy site (Punta Allen, Quintana Roo).  
 
This site is characterized by a low level of anthropogenic impacts and by a high degree of 
protection and conservation efforts. These characteristics make this site very adequate for 
monitoring efforts and baseline purposes. The key interventions contemplated for this area are: 
(i) Strengthening the protected area monitoring system to include climate change parameters of 
interest. (ii) support  the  development and enactment of land use  plans  and  (iii) pilot 
repopulation of coastal  reefs  to  maintain  their buffering  capability and protection of the 
coastal wetland. The reserve is under the tutelage of CONANP, with a well trained and highly 
respected staff. It has attracted research institutes from all over the world whom are attracted by 
nature and socio-cultural setting.

Component 3: Internalization of climate change considerations on water resources planning at a 
national level (global overlay). This component will complement efforts 
ñsupported by the Bank 
and other IFI- to assess current and feasible policy options and measures that could be adopted at 
a
national level to incorporate the anticipated impacts of climate change on water resource 
planning (global overlay).  Based on projected impacts of climate change on water resources, the 
component will update the diagnosis of current impacts and produce an analysis of 
recommended policy measures.  The component will be carried out by SEMARNAT-INE and 
IMTA. The companion grant CCIG will generate data on the impacts of CC on the countryís 
national water resources focusing on high priority watersheds.  
 
Component 4: Project management: This component will support the overall technical 
coordination of Project Activities (including the implementation of a technical monitoring 
system) as well as the administrative and financial management of the Project. It will include 
goods; consultancy services; travel; and operating costs undertaken by the Project Management. 
Specifically this component will finance the project coordinator, the procurement specialist, 
other required personnel for the project management, and the project external audits. Incremental 
GEF co-financing will be used for goods; consultancy services; travel; and operating costs.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The component on the identification of national policies to address the impacts of climate change 
on water resources will be carried out at the national level. The components on the 
implementation of pilot adaptation measures will be located in the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot 
measures will be implemented in the wetlands of:

E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The project will be implemented by INE which is the technical environmental institute of the 
ministry of environment. As such its mission is to generate, integrate and disseminate knowledge 
and information through applied research and the strengthening of capacities, in order to support 
the formulation of environmental policies and decision making that promote sustainable 
development. INEís vision is to be an institute that leads scientifically and technically the 
sustainable development agenda of the country.  
 
INE-SEMARNAT will coordinate all technical activities through a task force, led by a climate 
specialist.  The field activities will be coordinated and implemented in each state by local 
agencies.  CONAGUA through the IMTA will implement the assessment of options to address 
Page  4
climate issues in water policies. BANOBRAS will be in charge of fiduciary responsibilities, 
including financial management, procurement of goods and services and the application of  
 
environmental and social safeguards. Oversight of the project will be responsibility of a steering 
committee that will ensure coordination with other ongoing and related activities. This 
committee will include representatives from the state and local municipalities where the specific 
pilots are likely to be located and key agencies including: Semarnat. INE, CONAGUA, 
CONANP; CONABIO; CONAFOR; CICY; IMTA, and Sedesol. CONAGUA has confirmed that 
this project constitutes a priority and has indicated that the office of the Director General and the 
Director of IMTA will be directly involved in the project.  CONAGUA and IMTA have pledged 
technical and financial resources to the project activities.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
No major adverse environmental impacts are anticipated. Minor environmental impacts may 
be expected from some on-the-ground investments. The project is designed to be entirely 
positive from an environmental point of view, particularly by protecting vulnerable ecosystems 
from the impact of GCC. Some expected direct positive impacts include: (i) reduced 
vulnerability of coastal ecosystems in the pilot sites; (ii) reduced uncertainty of impacts of GCC 
and improved planning of stressed water resources and ecosystem conservation; (iii) mitigation 
of impacts of unsustainable land uses; (iv) reduced vulnerability of and planning and 
management of water supply in selected areas; and (v) increased public awareness of adaptation 
needs and increased social and institutional capacity to manage the ecosystems. (vi) strengthened 
resilience of environmental services in the face of climate change impacts. An Environmental 
Assessment will be performed as part of the design of the adaptation measures.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
Under the natural habitats policy, Bank supported projects must not damage Critical Natural 
Habitats; and should seek to avoid or minimize damage to other natural habitats.  If such damage 
is necessary and justified, it must be adequately mitigated, typically through compensatory 
protected areas under the same project.  
 
The proposed project is aimed at protecting, maintaining and rehabilitating natural habitats 
and their functions, specifically at conserving the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems, some of 
these being located in protected areas.  The proposed adaptation pilots are focused on 
strengthening the resilience of ecosystems and the services they provide in the face of climate 
change impacts by strengthening the protected area status of wetlands, by strengthening their 
buffer zones, and by creating corridors between protected areas. The supported reforestation 
measures will take place with native species on areas that were naturally forested before and 
underwent deforestation and degradation processes. However, during the design stage provisions 
will be taken in the context of the EA to maximize the environmental benefits for the functioning 
of wetlands. The supported monitoring tool (ALOS) will help detect any changes.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
X
As the project will re

Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
reforestation efforts, the Forests policy is triggered. The policy applies to projects that will 
impact the health and quality of forests and those that bring about changes in management, 
protection or utilization. It is envisaged that overall impacts of the project will be positive. The 
provisions of the policy will be addressed during the EA and activities.   
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
The project will benefit farmers and rural communities through the implementation of 
interventions such as reforestation, forestation, water resource management, etc. Rural 
communities will benefit from project interventions and will be actively involved in the 
implementation and management of these adaptation measures. A consultation process has been 
undertaken at the four project sites. At each site, meetings and forums were held with local 
authorities (municipalities), communitiesí grass-root organizations such as fishermen 
cooperatives, farmer cooperatives, and local and regional NGOs and university development 
institutions as well as the participating institutions (SEMARNAT, CONAMP, CONAFOR and 
CONABIO).A list of participants at each site has been filed in the project files. The consultation 
process has resulted in a confirmation of the measures that will be undertaken at each site.  
 
The project is not expected to trigger the social safeguard policies. There are no Indigenous 
Peoples in the four pilot sites selected for project implementation. The conservation efforts and 
creation of buffer zones will not restrict access to natural resource use in the case of the Alvarado 
site. The other adaptation measures are not relevant to the social safeguard policies.
