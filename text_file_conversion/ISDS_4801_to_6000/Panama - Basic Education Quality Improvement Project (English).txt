2. Project Objectives 
The Project
ís objective of increasing Panamaís human capital base by further improving 
the equity and quality of education at the pre-school, primary and lower-secondary (basic 
education) levels as well as its cultural relevance to rural and indigenous population is 
consistent with the GoPís development pillars statedin their ìStrategic Vision of 
Economic and Employment Development Towards 2009î. 
 
The Project addresses Pillar III (human development investment) through interventions 
targeting the quality of education and the equity in access to educational opportunities to 
disadvantaged populations, particularly in remote and indigenous areas. Attention to 
Pillar V (strengthened institutional and technical capacity) is reflected by activities 
aiming to improve MEDUCAís capacity and performance, through the development of 
policy-relevant information systems. The overall scope of the program addresses Pillar I 
(poverty reduction and improved income distribution) through investments that promote 
human capital development and a more equitable distribution of education as these 
measures have been widely documented in literature to contribute to the reduction of 
long-term poverty and inequality (Thomas et al, 2000; Barro, 1995; Benhabib and 
Spiegel, 1994).

3. Project Description 
The lending instrument proposed is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) for an estimated 
amount of USD 35 million to be disbursed over a period of five years. The SIL option is 
an appropriate lending instrument to support sector-specific operations in the current 
transition period in the Bank-GoP collaboration, as reflected in the Panama Country 
Partnership Strategy. Moreover, because this Project will not rely on a Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) but will mainstream project management into MEDUCA, 
alre
ady familiar with the Bankís financial and procurement procedures from previous SIL 
experiences will help lessen the administrative burden resulting from this transition.  
Project activities will unfold along three project components:  
 
Component 1: Improvement of the Quality of Education (Total estimated cost: USD 
16.34 million. Bank financing: USD 13.95 million, GoP financing: USD 2.39 million).  
This component aims to improve education quality in the system through a series of 
interventions focusing on classroom practice, curricular relevance, provision of 
information technology instruction and equipment, and improved technical capacity, in 
order to better measure and analyze student learning outcomes.  
 
Component 2: Increase enrollment levels and successful completion in early-childhood 
and basic educational programs. (Total estimated cost: USD 17.10 million. Bank 
financing: USD 15.86 million, GoP financing: USD 1.24 million). This component will 
seek to expand non-formal early-childhood and primary education programs, as well as to 
increase the internal efficiency of the system from pre-school to junior secondary levels.  
 
Component 3: Strengthen the institutional capacity and performance of the Ministry of 
Education. (Total estimated cost: USD 6.55 million. Bank financing: USD 5.19 million, 
GoP financing: USD 1.37 million). This component will aim to support strategic 
investments to MEDUCAís institutional and technical capacity to improve the 
administrative, management, monitoring and evaluation performance of the educational 
system. To this end, Component 3 will put in place interventions aimed at instituting 
strategic planning and results-based management procedures to the Ministryís functional 
structure.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
There are approximately 327,000 indigenous peoples in Panama. They include 7 groups: 
Ng√§be (59.3%), Kuna (21.6%), Ember√° (7.9%), Bugl√© (6.2%), Wounaan (2.4%), 
Naso-Teribe, and Bri-bri-Bokota account for the remaining 2.4%. In 2007, 11 provincial 
and 4 comarcal consultations (Ember√°, Kuna-Yala, Ng√§be-Bugl√©w, Wounaan) took 
place as part of the Social Commitment for Education Forum. Consultations with the 
Naso and Teribe peoples were carried out in 2008, as part of project preparation. Based 
on the above consultations and in agreement with the respective Indigenous Congress 
authorities, an Indigenous Peoples Plan was prepared, as described below.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The support provided to intercultural bilingual education through the Indigenous Peoples 
Plan is of utmost importance for the development of IBE in Panama. The latter seeks to 
insure access of all indigenous school-age children and youths to a bilingual education 
program in Spanish and their own native language. The IBE program financed by the 
proposed project will begin by mapping supply and demand of education resources, the 
adaptation of the national curriculum to address the cultural needs of the different groups, 
teacher training in IBE, design/production of bilingual materials developed from the 
adapted curriculum, standard testing, monitoring of the IBE system, and evaluation of 
students and teachers.

The Indigenous Peoples Plan was prepared by the Directorate of Intercultural Bilingual 
Education (DNEIB) in consultation and agreement with the Indigenous Congresses and 
their education specialists.  
 
The IPP will also provide some funding for institutional strengthening and capacity 
building of DNEIB staff. Project implementation will
 be
carried out by MEDUCAís 
departments in coordination with DNEIB.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Besides the MEDUCA units implementing the project as a whole, some key stakeholders 
are: The Directorate of Intercultural Bilingual Education (DNEIB) at MEDUCA, the IBE 
Regional delegates, the Indigenous Congresses and their education specialists.  
 
As requested by SAT, an agency has been sought by DNEIB for mediating purposes. 
The Pastoral Social CARITAS of Panama has agreed to mediate in case of any claim by 
beneficiaries.
