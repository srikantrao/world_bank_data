2. Project Objectives 
To mitigate the impact of the continued socio-economic crisis on a subset of the poorest 
and most vulnerable households.  An additional objective would be to strengthen 
MOSA’s institutional capacity to manage cash transfer programs.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed additional financing grant gives the PA the opportunity to demonstrate its 
commitment to the poorest and most vulnerable population groups in the West Bank and 
Gaza.  It would help finance costs associated with the scaling up of the SSNRP and its 
transformation into a cash assistance program administered by the Palestinian authority 
capitalizing on the Ministry of Social Affairs’ poverty targeting database.  The proposed 
grant would leverage additional funds and technical assistance from donors such as the 
European Union, who also are keen to see the PA take the lead in administering cash 
assistance programs. Conditionalities linked to cash assistance will be introduced during 
the latter period of the program.
