B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overall development objective of the program is to improve public service delivery through 
the financing of basic infrastructure and the provision of capacity building at local level.  
 
The program seeks to enhance the capacity of local authorities to utilize participatory and 
transparent planning, budgeting, implementation, and monitoring systems and to strengthen the 
capacity of service providers (prestataires de services). It will also assist in improving local 
revenues and transfers to CTs and STDs. Finally, an important objective of this program is to 
harmonize existing donor-support in the area of local development (see above) and provide a 
vehicle for future local development initiatives, including mining areas.  
 
Page  2
To reach this objective, the program will support the Government in the elaboration of its 
decentralization and deconcentration strategy, and in its implementation. The program will 
provide financial and capacity development support to the coll
ectivit√©s territoriales 
(communes and possibly regions), and will seek to strengthen the services techniques 
d√©concentr√©s so that they can better support communes and regions.  
 
Principal output indicators may include: (i) overall resources (central capital and recurrent 
transfers, own revenues) and staff available to collectivit√©s territoriales, (ii) overall resources 
and staff available to services techniques d√©concentr√©s, (iii) number of collectivit√©s 
territoriales who are able to prepare development plans and budgets through adequate process, 
(iv) number of collectivit√©s territoriales who receive LDF grants, (v) number of collectivit√©s 
territoriales with annual audit records, (vi) number of local projects operated and maintained 
satisfactorily, (vii) increase in number of people satisfied by LDF activities.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The program is expected to have 4 components:  
 
Component 1: Support to the decentralization process. In coordination with other Bank 
activities such as the Governance and Institutional Development Program (PGDI), the PRSCs 
and the health SWAp, this component consists of activities to (i) support the formulation and 
implementation of the decentralization and deconcentration strategy, and alignment with sectoral 
strategies, (ii) strengthen central-local fiscal framework to support local revenue mobilization, 
ensure adequate transfers to STDs and CTs including for O&M of basic infrastructure, (iii) 
strengthen STDs to respond to incremental demands for their services,  
 
Component 2: Capacity building. This component will support the development of a national 
capacity building strategy for CTs, provide capacity building grants to CTs, and provide capacity 
building to service providers (prestataires de service).  
 
Component 3: Infrastructure grants to Collectivit√©s Territoriales. This component will 
finance local infrastructure investments through a central-local intergovernmental transfer. For 
the duration of this project, grant funds are expected to be channeled through the recently created 
public agency Fonds de Developpement Local (FDL).  
 
Component 4: Support to program implementation, and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). 
This component will support, project management, monitoring, evaluation and audits of the 
account of the program and accounts of all grant beneficiaries. It will also finance activities to 
ensure transparency and accountability and engage beneficiaries in the process of verifying 
outcomes.

E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The environmental classification of the project is Category B.  
 
Page  3
The project is expected to fund sub-projects (such as market places, schools, community clinics, 
public offices, roads, etc.) of a similar nature and scope as those under the projects of the Bank 
supported FID (Fonds díInterventions de Developpement). Therefore ñ similar to FIDís 
subprojects ñ it is expected that the environmental impacts of the sub-projects of the Local 
Development Fund (LDF) will be minor and can be well mitigated and minimized. The project 
will allow the local population to improve their access to basic public service and will result in 
improved living conditions.  
 
In Madagascar, the Ministry of the Environment, Water, and Forests has an Environmental 
Impact Assessment Policy and a National Environmental Management Authority, the National 
Office of Environment (NOE). It ensures the evaluation of the environmental impact of projects. 
It conducts the review of environmental impact studies and validates environmental management 
plans.  The Ministry is represented at the regional and district levels.

The project has a category B rating. The investments under this project will focus on the 
improvement of the delivery of basic services and are expected to result in improved living 
conditions. The investments under the project will be sectorally varied, given that they will be 
determined by local level priorities which will differ from one local government to another and 
cannot be determined a priori. The types of investments are common community development 
projects whose potential environmental and social effects are well understood, unlikely to be 
significant, and readily manageable. The main potential environmental issues associated with the 
project include soil erosion (construction and during road use), health effects to construction 
workers during construction, land disturbance (construction), waste management for schools, 
markets place, and community clinics, and noise (primarily during construction). Following the 
National law on the Protected areas, it is not possible to build infrastructures within protected 
areas in Madagascar. Therefore, there will be no direct impacts on protected areas.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)

Land acquisition, compensation and resettlement of people may be inevitable for certain 
categories of sub-projects. This is a social issue of critical concern to the Government and the 
World Bank, as its impact on poverty if left unmitigated, is negative, immediate and can be wide 
spread. The infrastructure projects developed in several localities by the ìcollectivit√©s 
territorialesî could resultin involuntary resettlement and lands acquisition. These could occur in 
the case of the widening of roads, the construction of markets, schools, community clinics, etc.  
While the Ministry of Decentralization could apply the National Law on Land Acquisition, this

is not considered to be sufficient according to the Bank Policy on the Involuntary Resettlement 
OP 4.12. Therefore, it is proposed to prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework for the Local 
Development Fund (LDF) project.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  12/17/2007 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF): the sub-projects of the future 
LDF are demand driven and can only be known once the target group/beneficiaries know 
their budget envelope and have set their priorities. Hence, at the time of the preparation of the 
project now in the offing, these sub-projects have not yet been identified. The Environmental 
Law in Environment and the Environmental Assessment Operational Policy 4.01 of the Bank 
require the Government of Madagascar (represented technically by the Ministry of 
Decentralization) to prepare an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF). 
An ESMF will be developed and will establish a mechanism that will determine and assess 
future potential environmental and social impact of the sub-projects under the proposed 
Local Development Fund (LDF). It further helps to establish mitigation, monitoring and 
institutional measures to be taken during the planning, budgeting, implementation and 
operation of the sub-projects. This will help to eliminate or minimize adverse environmental 
and social impact to acceptable levels.  
 
The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF): A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will 
be  prepared by the Government and approved by the Bank in compliance with the Bankís 
safeguard policies, related to the Involuntary Resettlement Operational Policy 4.12. This 
framework sets the guidelines for the resettlement plans that would have to be prepared for 
any sub-project that triggers this policy. This policy will be triggered  when a sub-project 
causes the involuntary taking of land and other assets resulting in relocation or loss of 
shelter; loss of assets or access to assets; and loss of income sources or means of livelihood,

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
 
Page  5
whether or not the affected persons must move to another location. The RPF sets out the 
guidelines for the resettlement plans that would have to be prepared for any sub-project that 
triggers this policy. The resettlement plans will have to be submitted to the Ministry of 
Decentralization for approval but would also have to be approved by the Bank before the 
sub-projects are financed.  
 
The Ministry of Decentralization is required to disclose both documents (RPF and ESFM) 
in-country as a separate and stand alone document so that it is accessible by the general 
public, local communities, project-affected groups, NGOs and other stakeholders. It will also 
be shared at the infoshop of the World Bank. The revised ESMF and the RPF will be 
disclosed before the appraisal date of the project.  
 
The SMU has agreed to accept transfer of the safeguard responsibilities.
