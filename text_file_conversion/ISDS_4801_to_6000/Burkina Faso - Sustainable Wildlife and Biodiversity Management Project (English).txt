B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed objective of the Sustainable Wildlife and Biodiversity Management Project 
(SWBMP) is to generate improved revenue streams for the populations living around protected 
areas and for Burkina more broadly, from better natural resource management and ecosystem 
services.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The SWMBP will be implemented over a five year period from 2009-2013.  The project will 
focus on:  
 
(i) Developing the infrastructure (water holes, salt licks, wells , barriers) needed to sustainably 
increase and protect wildlife populations in the original intervention zones of the PAGEN 
(ComoÃ© LÃ©raba, Boulon –Koflande, Mares aux Hippos, Nazinga, PNTK), including their 
buffer zones, as well as priority areas identified in the PNGFAP and private initiatives.  
Page  2
Experience under the PAGEN has demonstrated that these improvements are low-cost 
investments with relatively quick positive improvements of wildlife populations.  The impact of 
these improvements on the wider ecosystem will be closely monitored as experience in some 
countries has shown that water holes and salt licks may improve some wildlife at the expense of 
other parts of the ecosystem.  
 
(ii) Building capacity of communities, rural municipalities and private operators, awareness and 
stimulate investment to develop and promote ranching and ecotourism facilities (hotels, camp 
grounds for safari) in or around selected protected areas.  This component would also include a 
small investment fund to provide matching grants for these activities that are either not eligible 
under PNGT3 or not given sufficient priority because of conflicting development priorities.  
 
(iii) Strengthening the institutional and regulatory framework for sustainable development of 
wildlife and biodiversity, including the set up of a trust fund mechanism for sustainable 
financing of biodiversity protection.  The results for the ongoing review by IUCN of existing 
trust funds for biodiversity protection will be used as input into the design of this component.  
 
The principal partners in the implementation of the project are: the state with its technical 
services responsible for wildlife protection, tourism, finance, agriculture and livestock, rural 
municipalities, local communities, local professional or socio-cultural organizations, private 
operators active in wildlife, ecotourism, hunting and commercial breeding of wildlife.  The 
project will continue to support the transfer of management responsibilities to 
associations/NGOs/private sector initiatives.  This approach was successfully used under the 
PAGEN, with greater benefits accruing at the local communities and reduced government 
operating costs.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The geographic intervention zone will be expanded from the areas supported under the PAGEN, 
to include surrounding areas that form part of the ecosystem and focus also on key areas where 
insufficient donor support is available, or where ongoing donor funded support is unlikely to be 
extended.  Linkages with IDA supported operations in other countries will also be pursued.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower's Ministry of Environment (MoE) will be supported through the project to ensure 
that sufficient capacity exists for the supervision of the implementation of the ESMF and the 
resettlement policy and process frameworks. MoE satisfactorily supervised the implementation 
of the ESMF under the predecessor project.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
An environment assessment will be carried out as part of pro
ject preparation, building on the

Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
experience of the PAGEN.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The project is not expected to have any negative impacts on natural habitats.  The policies 
developed during the PAGEN will be assessed as part of project preparation and updated where 
needed. No activities will be supported in protected forests.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
As part of project preparation, a screening process of the potential for impacting on Tuareg 
groups or communities will be carried out to evaluate whether BP 4.10 applies.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
Individual farmers and pastoral groups may lose access to protected areas as happened during 
the PAGEN.  During the implementation of the PAGEN, an involuntary resettlement framework 
was developed and field-tested.  This framework will be updated as part of project preparation.  
In addition, a complementary resettlement process framework will be developed, which was not 
required under the predecessor project.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  05/22/2008 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The safeguard related studies (Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, Environmental 
Mitigation Plan, Resettlement Policy and Process Frameworks, as well as the assessment of 
the applicability of OP 4.10) will be launched in March, following the approval of the PPF, 
to ensure they are available and published in-country, as well as at the World Bank Infoshop, 
prior to appraisal.   
 
1
Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
