B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The main objective of the proposed Justice Services Improvement Project II (the “Project”) is to 
support a coordinated introduction of oral proceedings in justice administration among 5 
agencies (i.e. Judiciary, Ministry of Justice, AGO, Judicial Council and Judicial Academy) and 
expand the activities under the first Justice Services Improvement project which were limited to 
only 10 judicial districts. The Project will focus on modern judicial service delivery and human 
resources management, as well as increased access to justice to include the remaining 19 judicial 
districts of Peru.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Project’s design will build on ESW and other Bank diagnostic work, lessons from 
previously approved projects, including on-going JSDF and IDF grants relating to the justice 
sector and the country’s broader governance structures. This includes the JSDF with the Catholic 
University on legal education and the IDF with the Peruvian Congress on monitoring and 
evaluating the quality of the budget preparation and execution. The Project also reflects 
collaboration with other donors, including the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), GTZ, 
European Union, and civil society organizations.  Certainly the Project will not be able to 
Page  2
address all of the sector’s deficiencies, but rather seeks to define and narrow its scope to those 
areas where there is greatest need for Bank assistance and where we can expand on already 
achieved impacts, such as improved inter-institutional coordination, decentralized service 
delivery and support for legal services to poor communities.  
 
The following is a preliminary description of the Project’s components:  
 
(1)  
Improvement of Justice Service Delivery component: Based on performance assessments 
of model systems piloted in various cities under the first project, the Project will assist the 
participating agencies in implementing the new oral procedures, including modern court 
management systems. This will enable optimal court productivity while protecting due process 
guarantees. A major contribution of integrated management systems will include the creation and 
maintenance of statistical information generated by judicial districts and specific justice sector 
offices. This information will then be used to inform institutional decision-making, including 
budget preparation, as well as contribute to joint decisions on the sector’s development. This 
component will also include the design of other management tools to improve performance 
based on demand and enhance transparency and knowledge about the justice system.  
 
The first Justice Services Improvement Project also included the design and implementation of 
a
judicial management course (gestiÃ³n judicial) which is now required for judges and 
administrative staff alike. The staffs of the 4 agencies participating in the first project (Judiciary, 
Ministry of Justice, Judicial Council, and Judicial Academy) have also jointly undergone training 
sessions and now prepare work plans for their specific institutions on how best to meet user 
demands, often sharing information about a particular problem or a specific geographic area with 
the others.  
 
(2)  
Human Resource Professional Development component: The Project will assist the 
Judicial Council, Judiciary, Judicial Academy and AGO to recruit and retain quality personnel 
and provide them with appropriate professional development. This will include the use of 
modern concepts of human resources planning and performance, such as the use of performance 
based management. It will also help the justice sector to enhance its capacity in the areas of 
budget preparation and expenditure management. This component will also continue to support 
for the Judicial Academy to be able to develop a focus different from traditional judicial 
education programs and which will include making modern training techniques a part of 
sustainable reform. Local realities and the preferences of judges, prosecutors and court staff will 
be taken into account through participatory consultations, and economic and social issues such as 
the new oral process will be given preference  
 
The first Justice Services Project provided the necessary support to design a methodology 
which now permits the Judicial Council to evaluate judicial decisions, based on a consensus of 
quality standards with the Judiciary.  And, all 4 agencies worked together to seek passage of the 
‘judicial career’ bill to professionalize standards at various levels of judicial administration (from 
justices of the peace to members of the Supreme Court).  
 
(3) 
Enhanced Access to Justice: This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of 
the Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary and the AGO as well as the practicing Bar to conduct cases 
Page  3
under the new CPC and introduce oral proceedings more broadly.  Due to varying levels of 
preparedness in terms of experience with prior reforms and priorities of local judicial staff and 
users in diverse communities, this component will be structured as a “menu” of potential 
activities, including scaling up the services of ALEGRAs (Asistencia Legal Gratuita or legal aid 
centers administered by the Ministry of Justice in conjunction with municipalities) as begun 
under the first Justice Services project.  The Project will use annual work programs to determine 
the amount and sequencing of such activities, including minor infrastructure (rehabilitation of 
common physical service areas), equipment and training to connect relevant agencies and 
maintain common data for indicators to identify areas in need of attention. This component will 
also scale up the activities in support of the ODIGMAs, the decentralized offices of the OCMA 
(Judiciary’s internal anticorruption office) and expand outreach effortsto the media, general 
public and users about the functioning of Peru’s justicesystem.  
 
4)  Project Management component: This component seeks to continue and strengthen the 
project coordination, financial management and procurement, as well as monitoring and 
evaluation capacities within the Judiciary to jointly implement the Project on behalf of the 5 
participating agencies.  The first project’s Operations Manual will be updated to make 
adjustments from lessons learned (e.g. having participating agencies transfer individual agency 
budgets or funds to the PCU so that providers need only need receive one payment, rather than 
an 80/20 split) and to include the particularities of the AGO as the additional agency.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
As per the above, the Project will focus on the judicial districts not covered by the first Justice 
Services Modernization Project (which was limited to 10 judicial districts), i.e. the remaining 19 
judicial districts of Peru.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Task Team is already working with the Government to specifically include the views, needs 
and rights needs of indigenous peoples and women. Although the first project did not trigger the 
safeguards policy, and it is not envisioned to do so in the repeater project, given the make-up of 
Peru’s population, the teak team sought guidance from the ESSD specialist.  If the safeguard is 
deemed to be triggered, the Borrower does have the necessary capacity through the Ministry of 
Justice (a project counterpart) to ensure that the assessment is carried out in accordance with the 
Bank’s norms and procedures.
