2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to improve financial sector stability. Financial 
sector restructuring will lead to more efficient resource allocation towards poverty 
reducing and growth inducing sectors. More specifically, the project will provide 
technical assistance to various stakeholders to support the financial sector reform 
program of the Government of Togo.  
 
Key expected results include (i) completion of the financial and institutional 
restructuring of BTCI, UTB and BIA, (ii) strengthened internal and external supervision 
of microfinance institutions, (iii) development and implementation of a strategy to reduce 
the pension deficits of the social security institutions (CRT and CNSS), and (iv) increased 
capacity of the Government to steer reforms in the financial and private sectors.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is comprised of four technical components:  (a) banking sector restructuring; 
(b) strengthening of the microfinance sector; (c) pension sector reform, (d) support to the 
implementation of reforms in the financial and private sectors.

Component 1: Banking sector restructuring (US$4.40 million equivalent)  
 
-
Institutional strengthening of banks under restructuring  
 
The project will provide technical assistance to banks under restructuring (i.e. BTCI, 
UTB, BIA and BPEC ) to improve governance (through, strengthening internal controls, 
developing procedure manuals to establish or strengthen loan assessment, granting and 
monitoring procedures) and find a private banking reference partners. With regards to 
BTCI, the project will provide technical assistance to: (i) develop an operational 
procedures manual and (ii) identify a strategic banking partner. With regards to BIA, the 
project will provide technical assistance to identify a strategic banking partner. With 
regards to UTB, the project will provide technical assistance to (i) revise and update the 
procedures manual, and (ii) identify a strategic banking partner. With regards to BPEC, 
the project will provide technical assistance to: (i) develop an operational procedures 
manual, and (ii) undertake an organizational diagnostic and implement its 
recommendations. The project will also provide support to BTD (which is not under 
restructuring) to identify a strategic banking partner.  
 
-
Capacity strengthening of commercial banks personnel  
 
The project will finance the development of a training program for all commercial banks 
active in Togo to upgrade staff skills. The training program will be offered on a cost 
sharing basis to all interested banks. An analysis of the training needs of commercial 
banks, as well as of the delivery mechanisms of the training program, will be undertaken 
in the context of the Project Preparation Advance (PPA). Special attention will be given 
to ensure the sustainability of the proposed training program (i.e. training of trainers, 
strengthening capacity of local training institutions).  
 
-
Setting up an agency specializing in loan recovery and secondary market for securities  
 
The recovery of non-performing loans is an important aspect of the banking 
restructuring process. The project will therefore support the creation of a low cost and 
flexible structure in charge of loan recovery. This agency would also be in charge of 
developing a secondary market for the securities issued from the bank restructuring 
process. A feasibility study for this agency will be financed under the PPA.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening of microfinance sector (US$3.20 million equivalent)  
 
Contrary to the banking sector, the microfinance sector is relatively healthy in Togo and 
plays an important role in providing access to financial services.  There is however a need 
to strengthen the internal and external supervision of this sector to prevent crises.  
 
-
Strengthening of the microfinance supervision capacity of the Ministry of Economy 
and Finance  
 
Technical assistance and equipment will be provided to the Microfinance Supervision 
Unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (CAS-IMEC). Support will be provided to 
(i) disseminate and undertake training on the new microfinance law elaborated by 
BCEAO, (ii) improve capacity of the Ministry of Economy and Finance to undertake 
field supervision by providing equipment (vehicles and laptops), (iii) develop a database 
Page  3
for off-site microfinance supervision, (iv) finance, on a declining basis, inspectors under 
fixed term contracts , (v) develop and implement a training plan for supervisors and (vi) 
fund inspection missions on a declining basis.  
 
-
Strengthening of internal controls within microfinance institutions  
 
There is a need to review the microfinance supervision approach in Togo, bringing it to 
rely increasingly on networks apex institution to supervise their members (i.e. credit and 
savings cooperatives). Under this approach, the supervisory authority should focus on 
supervising the apex institution, while the apex institution should be responsible for 
controlling its members.  
 
As a result, there is a need to strengthen internal control mechanisms within 
microfinance institutions (MFIs). This will involve the following activities: (i) 
development and dissemination of an internal control and inspection manual, (ii) training 
for internal inspectors and external auditors, (iii) technical assistance to selected MFIs to 
improve their internal control procedures and their Management Information Systems 
(MIS), (iv) development of externalized inspection services (for small structures), (v) 
support to sector rationalization (i.e. encouraging independent savings and credit 
cooperatives to join networks), (vi) partial funding of external audits. These activities will 
be coordinated by the National Committee for Microfinance, the microfinance 
coordination platform.  
 
-
Improving financial information transparency  
 
The availability of reliable financial information plays an important role in the 
development of a sound microfinance sector. This component will also support (i) the co-
financing of ratings with the condition that the rating will be publicly available and (ii) 
the development of regional rating firms to increase availability and affordability of 
rating services in the region.  
 
Component 3: Pension sector reform (US$1.00 million equivalent)  
 
The pension system for civil servants (CRT) is facing a deep financial deficit, which 
requires important government subsidies (CFAF 7 to 8 billion annually) to ensure timely 
payment of pensions. The pension branch of CNSS will also face a deficit in the coming 
years. Technical assistance is therefore proposed to help reform the pension arms of these 
two institutions.  
 
With regards to CRT, support will be provided to (i) update its employer, employee and 
beneficiary rosters, which will include a physical control of beneficiaries, (ii) undertake 
an actuarial study, (iii) undertake a financial and organizational audit, (iv) develop an 
information and technology master plan, (v) improve information systems by purchasing 
equipment, (vi) develop and implement a human resources training plan to improve staff 
capacities. With regards to CNSS, support will be provided to (i) undertake an actuarial 
study, (ii) conduct a financial and organizational audit, (iii) analyze CNSS investment 
options with a view of diversification, (iv) analyze the possibility of adding a 
Page  4
supplementary fully funded scheme, (v) develop and implement a human resources 
training plan to improve staff capacities.  
 
Component 4: Support to the implementation of reforms in the financial and private 
sectors (US$1.00 million equivalent)  
 
Support will be provided to (i) increase the capacity of the Government to lead reforms 
in the financial and private sectors through the Reform Secretariat and the Direction de 
l’Economie within the Ministry of Economy and Finance and (ii)improve dialogue 
between the public and private sectors.  
 
-
Strengthening of the Reform Secretariat and Directorate of Economy within the 
Ministry of Economy and Finance  
 
Technical assistance, training and equipment will be provided to strengthen the capacity 
of these two structures so that they can support the Ministry of Economy and Finance in 
formulating policies in the financial and private sectors.  Technical assistance will be 
provided to the Government to provide support to the on-going financial sector reforms 
and to analyze and address legal and judicial constraints to financial and private sectors 
development (based on the Doing Business report and other diagnostic reports).  
 
-
Support to public private dialogue  
 
Support will be provided to improve public private dialogue. A dialogue platform was 
established in 2003, however it appears that there is a need to re-energize this structure. 
This component will support the organization of exchanges between the public and 
private sectors within this framework.
