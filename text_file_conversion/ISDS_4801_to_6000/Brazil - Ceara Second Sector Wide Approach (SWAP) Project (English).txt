2. Project Objectives 
The higher-level objective of the Ceara SWAp II project is to contribute to expand and 
consolidate the social advances and institutional modernization of the State of Ceara. The 
project will achieve this by supporting nine key government investment programs in five 
sectors, selected to optimize development impact. A series of disbursement-linked 
indicators (14) are mapped to the five sectors -- public sector management, education, 
health, WRM/WSS, and business environment & innovation -- to strengthen the 
incentives to achieve results.  
 
Specifically, the project development objectives are to:  
 
ï
help the Government of Ceara to improve its fiscal situation;  
 
ï
strengthen the stateís system of results-based management;  
 
ï
promote better service quality in education (particularly childhood literacy)and health;  
Page  2
ï
improve access to WSS, increase cost recovery in the water sector, and improve the 
efficiency of the two government autarchies with responsibility for water supply and 
management; and  
 
ï
reduce barriers to business investment.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project is a US$240 million Investment Loan using the SWAP modality to 
support implementation of the Government's program. This is the second SWAp loan of 
an APL. The SWAp I closed in December 2007, fully disbursing the $150 million loan 
amount. Most of the triggers for APL 2 were met in full or in part, and the overall results 
achieved were substantial. These accomplishments have laid an excellent foundation for 
continued progress, and provide confidence to continue the partnership between the State 
of Ceara and the World Bank. Consequently, the Bank is satisfied that the Government of 
Ceara has met the requirements for undertaking a second APL operation.  
 
The SWAp II is comprised of a $235.7m SWAp component and a $3.7m TA 
Component. The SWAp component supports the Governmentís development program 
expenditures in: a) public sector management; b) education; c) health; d) water resources 
management & water supply and sanitation; and d) business environment and innovation. 
The TA component provides analysis and institutional strengthening to support reforms 
in these sectors in furtherance of the development objectives.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Ninety-three percent of Ceara's territory is semi-arid, with irregular rainfall and 
prolonged droughts. The area around the capital city, Fortaleza, is the one with highest 
rainfall averages. Because of the dry conditions, most of the population is concentrated in 
two regions: the coast (besides Fortaleza the other major city is Sobral) and the southeast 
(around Juazeiro do Norte and Crato).  
 
Urbanization reached 76% in 2006 and is increasing rapidly. The other characteristic of 
the stateís urban network is dispersion: 117 out of 184 municipalities in the state have a 
total population below 30,000, with an urbanization ratio under 50%.  
 
The central area of Ceara is flat, with low altitudes; near the Atlantic Ocean in the north 
the terrain consists of mountain chains and Chapadas. More than 90% of Ceara was once 
covered by caatingas, the kind of vegetation associated with this semi-arid climate. The 
caataingas have been adversely affected by human interventions.  
 
The most important river in Ceara is the Jaguaribe; nearly all the rivers in Cear√° are 
intermittent (dry during periods of drought). Artificial lakes are builtall around the State 
to trap water from rivers.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Ceara SWAp II will support broad state programs to strengthen public sector policies 
and improve service quality in education, healthcare, WRM/WSS, and business 
environment.  
 
The potential safeguard impacts associated with this project are linked to hospital 
certification (hospital waste disposal) and investments in WSS connections. Overall, the 
project is expected to have a positive environmental impact given the improvements in 
basic sanitation and Health Waste Management, especially the final disposal of hazardous 
medical waste. In addition, the SWAp II will assist in developing better environmental 
management and licensing systems, working with SEMACE and other state 
environmental agencies. Some specific investments for WSS may result in site-specific, 
reversible impacts that will be mitigated. Involuntary resettlements, if any, associated 
with these programs will be localized. They will not interfere with indigenous peoples 
territories.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated due to the 
activities of the project. As described above the works related to water and sanitation will 
be localized and site-specific.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The measures taken by the Borrower to address safeguard policy issues include: (1) an 
involuntary resettlement framework was prepared; (2) an indigenous peoples framework 
was prepared; and (3) an overall EIA was prepared for the "Projeto Sanear II".  
 
The Prosanear Project already has an ESMF that was recently reviewed and found 
adequate to address potential issues. The ESMF for Prosanear includes: (i) criteria and 
procedures for environmental assessment for regional and urban infrastructure 
subprojects (environmental assessment framework); (ii) resettlement policy framework; 
(iii) environmental construction manual; (iv) mitigating actions for the envisioned 
impacts; and (v) strengthening of environmental management by the Government of 
Ceara.  
 
The Prosanear Operational Manual includes environmental screening procedures, 
assessment requirements and procedures for different types of basic infrastructure 
investments. For a project with no or only minor impacts, the actual environmental 
screening form will be used. For projects with moderate impacts a simplified 
environmental report will be prepared; and for projects with significant impacts, an EIA 
will be required. The procedures for preparing the environmental reports and EIAs are 
presented in the Operational Manual, which includes Terms of Reference for 
compensation of affected populations and resettlement of families. The Operational 
Manual describes public consultation requirements and how issues discussed are being 
addressed or incorporated in project.  
 
The aforementioned assessments and frameworks were reviewed and were considered 
acceptable to the Bank. These documents include provisions for institutional 
strengthening the social and environmental risk management. The Borrower's capacity to 
address safeguards policy is considered satisfactory, and the project is considered an 
opportunity to improve the quality of service provision to the poor and most vulnerable.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The sectors and programs supported by the SWAp II have been prioritized by the State 
through a consultative process, including consultations and formal discussions with civil 
society, organized by the GoC for issuing the Plurianual Plan. The GoC has carried out 
specific consultations for the elaboration of  the State Plan for Health (by FUNASA). In 
accordance with the Bank's Information Disclosure Policy (BP 17.50) the Health Waste 
Management Strategy was disclosed during a meeting with key stakeholders in early 
December 2007. The project will continue to organize Public Consultations to address 
specific impacts with key stakeholders and affected communities.  
 
Additionally, the Indigenous Peoples Plan and Resettlement Plan will be consulted in a 
participatory manner following the Principles and Guidelines elaborated by the Borrower. 
The consultations procedures are part of the Operations Manual, ensuring budget sources 
Page  5
from the project. All safeguard-related documents will be disclosed in accordance to 
Bank policy principles.
