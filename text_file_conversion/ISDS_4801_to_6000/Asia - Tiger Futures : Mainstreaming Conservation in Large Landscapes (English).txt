 B. Project Objectives:
 This project proposes to mainstream conservation in large landscapes through enhanced protection of
 tigers and their habitats across their range states.This will be achieved through dialogue, analytical work
 and capacity building to address one specificthreat, illegal trade in tigers and other wildlife, at key
 markets.

 C. Project Description:
 This global project will addressthe major threatsto tiger conservation,and the large natural landscapes
 on which they depend, through three interlinked components that focus on building commitment for tiger
 conservation in tiger range states,exploring existingand new financial mechanisms for fundingtiger
 conservation,and supportingtraining to improve regional capacity to counter the illegal wildlifetrade.
 The project will not finance any activities in protected areas nor any other site-specific protection
 activities,but will rather focus on promoting international consensusand collaborationto strengthen tiger
 conservation, including addressing illegal trade.

The project will contribute to a framework for collaborative efforts between the range states in which the
tiger lives (and the national and international NGOs working within them) and complement national
efforts targeted to conservation at individual sites. With parallel funding from the World Bank-led Global
Tiger Initiative, the Bank will organize Country Dialogue Workshops in each of the range states as well
as offer to host a Year of the Tiger Summit in 2010 to build political commitment and transboundary
cooperation for tiger conservation. Relevant stakeholders, including local community and Indigenous
Peoples representatives, will be invited to these events as appropriate. These workshops will contribute to
development of common and agreed strategies and monitoring frameworks so that the range states can
report progress on tiger conservation at regional meetings such as ASEAN and the 2010 Tiger Summit.
The project will also perform comprehensive analyses of financing for tiger conservation across the range
states, examining the current expenditures, the needs and how to cover the gaps. This analytical work will
provide guidance and input to efforts to mobilize new sources of funding (not financed by this project).
The governance and criteria for proposed future financing mechanisms would need to be agreed but are
expected to take social as well as conservation factors into account.

Since the trade in tiger parts is so serious and requires immediate action, the project will specifically
                     - .
target capacity building within key national agencies, including customs, market inspectors and law
enforcement agencies, to better address international illegal trafficking of wildlife at the market end of the
chain. This capacity building will complement other tiger conservation efforts by helping to address a key
threat to the survival of viable tiger populations -the illegal wildlife trade.

D. Project location and salient physical characteristicsrelevant to the safeguard analysis (if
known):
The project will not support any protected area or other site-specific protection activities that would
restrict local access to resources or have any potential livelihood impacts on the poor or indigenous
peoples. Instead it will focus on fostering international collaboration to improve tiger conservation,
including addressing the illegal trade in poached tigers and other wildlife. The project will support in-
country meetings, analyzing information and capacity building.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies:
The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) already has experience with implementing Bank projects and
has knowledge of, and capacity to implement, the Bank's relevant safeguard policies.

  The project is primarily a capacity building project. The project is therefore given an environmental
  assessment category of C.

  Although the project itself will not finance any follow-on field-based activities, it is recognized that some
  future conservation activities identified as a result of discussions in the country dialogue workshops could
  be site-focused and lead to indirect social impacts. Any Bank-supported follow-up for site-based
  conservation will be subject to normal Bank safeguards procedures. At the moment it is impossible to
  know what the full future suite of national government, donor and NGO activities for tiger conservation
  will be in the countries concerned  - oreven to claim that more than a small part of those activities might
  be influenced by, or linked to, this MSP. Nevertheless every effort will be made to ensure that
  international best practice as represented by Bank Safeguards Policies are promoted during the dialogues
  and training activities.
