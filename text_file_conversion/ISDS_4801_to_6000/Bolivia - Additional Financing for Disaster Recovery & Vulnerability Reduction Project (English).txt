2. Project Objectives 
The additional financing will scale up activities in the Emergency Recovery and Disaster 
Management Project (ERDMP), to support the implementation of the proposed works in 
the National Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Plan (PNRR) to recover from the La 
Ni√±a floods in order to restore access to basic infrastructure and rehabilitation of 
productive sector for a portion of the affected population in the nine departments.   
 
3. Project Description 
The original project has a specific section to mitigate future damage from the La Nina 
event that was developing at the time of project preparation.  Component1 of the original 
project, stated that a contingency plan, including a list of small mitigation works relating 
to the effects of La Nina will be identified as needed and will be implemented under this 
component, following the same screening, selection, and implementation arrangements.  
 
The additional financing would scale up Component 2 of the original project ñ 
(particularly Sub-components 2.1 Execution of Rehabilitation Activities and 
Reconstruction Works and 2.3 Execution of Small Mitigation and Rehabilitation 
Works).Activities will be carried out in the same geographical area as proposed under the 
Page  2
original project and no changes are necessary for the Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP) and the Environmental Assessment (EA).  
 
A
series of rehabilitation activities and reconstruction works will be undertaken in an 
effort to restore damaged infrastructure and recover productivity capacity.  These works 
will be financed in specific areas determined to have been particularly affected by La 
Nina.  The average cost of the proposed works is estimated to be less than US$100,000, 
with a large quantity of the identified works costing less than US$20,000.  The 
rehabilitation activities will include a positive list of goods for the recovery of the 
agriculture sector.  
 
These works include, inter alia, rehabilitation of water and sewage systems; repairs to 
basic infrastructure in small schools, housing, and small health centers; bridge and road 
repairs; and investments in water intakes, small earthen irrigation structures, riverbank 
protection, filtration galleries, and related activities.  
 
Physical works under this component have been identified by local communities and 
submitted by municipalities, prefectures, and related sectoral agencies. To ensure full 
compliance with environmental guidelines and ensure the quality of the work, the project 
will also finance the Accompanying Technical Supervision for the Execution of the 
Works.  
 
Financing of positive list of goods will include the low-sulfur diesel fuel and gasoline 
necessary for electricity generation and transportation needed to maintain economic 
activity, as well as other critical goods for rehabilitation. Other goods covered include 
construction materials and equipment in addition to medical supplies and equipment; 
seeds, equipments for the overall reconstruction effort and recovery of the agriculture 
sector.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Disaster recovery and vulnerability reduction works will be implemented throughout 
Bolivia, with particular emphasis on those areas most affected by events caused by the 
recent El Nino event.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Involuntary Resettlement  
 
No involuntary resettlement is planned under this project and no such plan exists within 
any of the relevant ministries of the Government of Bolivia.  During implementation, the 
project will explore the possibility of helping the government develop a resettlement 
framework for population in non-mitigable risk areas as a project activity within the 
subcomponent on territorial planning.  
 
Environmental Category:  B - Partial Assessment  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)  
 
Numerous small works will be executed under the project.  Individual works will be 
implemented in locations throughout the country. During the preparation of the project, 
individual works will be identified and evaluated for potential environmental impacts.  It 
is expected that most if not all small works activities will likely be classified as Category 
C
for environmental purposes, because they will entail the repair or reconstruction of 
existing infrastructure damaged or rendered useless as a result of the disaster events.  In 
this case, an environmental compliance program will be developed and included in the 
Project Operational Manual, including the use and enforcement of environmental 
protection contract clauses to be executed during the construction of the works. As the 
project is evaluated, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) will be developed and submitted in accordance with Bank policies in 
conjunction with the project preparation process.  Should additional environmental 
requirements be identified, these will be addressed in the EA and included in the EMP.  
 
As part of a long-term risk-reduction strategy, an institutional analysis will be conducted 
to identify where linkages exist between risk reduction and national planning.  During the 
institutional analysis, the concept of population relocation will be explored as a risk- 
Page  4
reduction strategy with the various entities identified, and assistance will be given toward 
the development of this concept.  
 
Anticipated Environmental Impacts  
 
Physical works under this component have been identified by local communities and 
submitted by municipalities, prefectures, and related sectoral agencies.  The FPS has 
provided a preliminary list of pre-identified works from the PRRES and now the PNRR 
execution plan.  Based on initial review, all projects proposed appear to be Category C 
under the Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01).  
 
The works contemplated under this project are of small scale or fall under the category 
of technical assistance.  Specifically:  
 
ï
Works will not occur in protected areas.  
 
ï
Works will not include any new construction or amplification of infrastructure 
such as treatment plants, water intake, or transportation facilities.  
 
ï
Works are designed to rehabilitate and strengthen damaged infrastructure or 
agricultural production facilities.  
 
ï
Works will occur only in existing areas of production.  
 
ï
No relocations will occur as a result of the project and none are planned in the 
project areas by any competent Bolivian Government Ministry.  
 
Environmental Assessment Process for Small Works  
 
Under this project, an EA will be conducted jointly by the Bank, the FPS, and the 
Ministry of Planning.  Each works project will be reviewed as final works descriptions 
are prepared, and as necessary, site visits will be conducted to verify conditions.  Given 
the emergency nature of the project, Bank supervision will be more intensive than typical 
Bank projects and the project team will participate jointly with the Ministry of Planning 
in insuring Bank requirements are met.  
 
Screening  
 
An initial screening has been conducted for the projects currently identified and all 
appear to be well within the threshold of Category C.  As more detailed works 
descriptions are completed, the supervision team will conduct a mission to verify the 
scope and impact of works.  Site visits will be conducted as necessary to verify local 
conditions and scope of works.  Because there are three basic categories of works, the 
team will prepare an environmental review of the works proposed, by category, and 
determine environmental contract requirements as presented in the Project Operational 
Manual.  
 
In the highly unlikely event that exceptions are identified that might promote an activity 
to Category B, a separate EA will be prepared for the works identified.  An EA will be 
conducted to comply with Bank policy and Bolivian national law to determine the type 
and nature of impacts anticipated.  This will include an Environmental Management Plan 
for the specific activity, together with required public consultation processes.  Given the 
requirements of the EA process and the urgent nature of the works, the decision will be 
Page  5
left to the Bolivian government as to whether to pursue the process or remove works 
from further consideration.  
 
If during the life of the project, works meeting Category A criteria are proposed, they 
will be rejected and not included in the program.  
 
Bolivian Law  
 
Under the Ley Ambiental (Environmental Law) 1333, a ficha ambiental (environmental 
report card) may be required for the works included in the program.  In addition to Bank 
screening and oversight, the Ministry of Planning will be responsible for processing 
works under this process and obtaining the ficha ambiental (if required).  Apart from 
fulfilling the requirements of national law, this process adds an additional layer of 
oversight to the environmental compliance process.  No works will proceed without 
compliance with this process.  
 
Environmental Supervision and Vigilance  
 
The Bank project management team and the Government of Bolivia will conduct 
environmental supervision.  The Bank supervision team will work closely with the 
Ministry of Planning and the FPS during the works identification, engineering, and 
design phases of the work cycle.  During these phases, environmental classifications will 
be determined and contract requirements will be identified. The Bank team will ensure 
that appropriate environmental control measures are applied to the specific works prior to 
the issuing of contracts.  
 
During the execution of works, the environmental officer of the prefecture together with 
the Ministry of Planning will conduct environmental inspections and oversight to ensure 
contract compliance.  The bank supervision team will make spot inspections as needed to 
ensure the process is being enforced.  Acceptance of completed works will be managed 
by the Ministry of Planning with the municipalities.  This will be forwarded to the Bank 
in the form of an acceptance report together with a Certification of Environmental 
Compliance for Bank review.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10)  
 
Due to the large percentage of the general population that can be classified as 
indigenous (67 percent), the entire project will be considered an Indigenous Peoples 
project. While a separate Indigenous People Plan (IPP) is not required, the elements of an 
IPP will be included in the overall project design. The project will ensure that indigenous 
peoples affected by the project receive culturally appropriate social and economic 
benefits and if any potential adverse effects on Indigenous Peoples are identified, those 
adverse effects are avoided, minimized, mitigated or compensated for. In order to comply 
with the requirements of OP 4.10, the Borrower will undertake a Social Assessment of 
potential indigenous beneficiaries which will include a process of free, prior, and 
informed consultation.  
 
Because the works program is focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction, no new 
infrastructure or significant expansion of existing infrastructure will be undertaken.  As 
Page  6
part of the screening process for individual projects, specific construction activities will 
be reviewed to assure that apart from restoration of service and risk-reduction design, no 
other changes from the original function will be included in specific works.  Where 
works are to occur on lands designated as indigenous, meetings will be held with the 
relevant indigenous authorities to assure that specific works proposed comply with the 
desires of the affected community.  
 
In the unlikely event that works identified result in a significant change in function or in 
significant social impacts, a separate Social Assessment will be prepared in accordance 
with Bank requirements and will be submitted to SAT for review.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources  
 
The project is not expected to have any negative impact on movable or immovable 
objects, sites, structures, groups of structures, natural features, or landscapes with 
archeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or other 
cultural significance.  It would be very unlikely that any project activity will have any 
negative impact on physical cultural resources. The EA will include procedures for 
screening for any known cultural property in the project area and will incorporate formal 
ìchance findî procedures in the event that culturally significant reosuces are discovered.   
If during the execution of the activities, any material is discovered onsite that might be 
considered of historical or cultural interest, such as evidence of prior settlements, native 
or historical activities, or evidence of any existence on a site that might be of cultural 
significance, all work shall stop and the supervising contracting officer shall be notified 
immediately, as will the National Anthropology Directorate in the Vice-Ministry for 
Culture (Direcci√≥n Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, Viceministerio de Cultura).  The area in 
which the material was discovered shall be marked and the evidence preserved for 
examination.  No work shall resume until after evaluation by these entities.  
 
Safeguard Preparation Plan  
 
During the pre-appraisal mission, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was 
developed in collaboration with the Government.  While the environmental impacts are 
expected to be limited to the site and duration of the small works contemplated under 
Component 2, the final set of works has yet to be agreed upon.  Once the EA is 
completed, a set of contract clauses will be selected for inclusion in the Project 
Operational Manual to be attached to small works contracts where environmental impacts 
are identified as category C.  In the unlikely event that works include activities with 
environmental classifications of Category B, an individual EA for that project element 
will be conducted and an EMP will be prepared.Other provisions relating to appropriate 
safeguards will be included as needed.  
 
The Social Assessment has been designed to be carried out in two phases.  The first 
phase was completed during the pre-appraisal mission prior to Board approval in order to 
develop a benefit-sharing strategy reflecting stakeholder interests and participation, risk 
analysis, and communication strategy‚
 îthough
 without primary or secondary data 
collection.  Given that no small works should lead to substantial negative social impacts, 
the second phase will be undertaken by the Government as an activity under Component 
Page  7
2
of
the project.  As part of a long-term risk-reduction strategy, an institutional analysis 
will be conducted to identify where linkages exist between risk reduction and national 
planning.  During the institutional analysis, the concept of population relocation will be 
explored as a risk-reduction strategy with the various entities identified, and assistance 
will be given toward the development of this concept.  A Social Assessment involving 
data collection and analysis and consultations with key stakeholders will provide the 
Vice-Ministry of Territorial Planning and the Environment with the tools necessary to 
begin to study long-term land-use policy, including the resettlement of communities 
highly vulnerable to adverse natural events.  
 
The policy for emergency response, OP 8.00, provides that emergency operations are 
subject to accelerated, consolidated, and simplified procedures and streamlined ex ante 
requirements.  As such, the supervision process regarding procedures such as safeguards 
is strengthened.  The social and environmental specialists currently working with the 
team will be closely monitoring these procedures and evaluating these processes during 
supervision.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The works program is focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction; no new infrastructure 
or significant expansion of existing infrastructure will be undertaken   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
n/a   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
In addition to addressing reconstruction and recovery needs, a key objective of the 
Emergency Recovery and Disaster Management Project (ERDMP) is to strengthen the 
capacity of national and local risk-management institutions and structures to reduce 
disaster vulnerability, and to increase their ability to respond to, rehabilitate, and 
reconstruct in response to emergencies through more timely responses and through better 
planning of reconstruction efforts.  Several institutional weaknesses have been identified 
regarding the capacity within the central and local governments to implement recovery 
projects and ensure their sustainability with regular maintenance.  Strengthening these 
institutions is at the core of the ERDMP.   Government capacity to supervise and 
implement the necessary safeguard policies will be evaluated during the supervision 
process and will be strengthened if required in order to meet Bank standards.  FPS, the 
implementing agency for the small mitigation works, has been implementing Bank 
projects for over five years and has substantial experience with the Bankís procedures.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
As described above, communities and social organizations submitted their project 
proposals to their respective municipalities and local governments, which in turn 
Page  8
submitted them to the FPS and the Ministry of Planning and Development for inclusion 
in the PRRES and PNRR.  In its evaluation, FPS is screening the proposals to ensure that 
they have undergone proper consultation process.  The Plan is the result of a 
comprehensive, community-based assessment that could take place only after flood water 
in most areas had receded and efforts shifted from relief to recovery and rehabilitation
