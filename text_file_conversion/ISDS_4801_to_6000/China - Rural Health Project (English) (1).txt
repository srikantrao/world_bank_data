                               services, improved financial protection, and better management of public health threats in
                               pilot provinces and counties, with lessons to support reforms in non-project areas.

Public Disclosure Authorized




                               The primary activity of the project is to support innovations that can contribute to
                               furthering the government's on-going health reform agenda. In selected provinces and
                               counties, the project will pilot and then evaluate innovations in health reform that can
                               contribute to the project's overall goals. Toward this end, the project will test
                               innovations under the following two components.

                                COMPONENT ONE: Health Reform Innovations Supported via Block Grants.
                                Counties will pilot innovations in three reform areas.

                                Reform Area One: Improving Rural Health Financing
 This component will pilot ways to strengthen and make more effective on-going
government programs to provide financial protection for rural households against the
escalating costs of health care.

 Reform Area Two: Improving Quality, Efficiency and Cost Control in Service Delivery
 The component will support innovations that can: (i) lead to effective control of health
care costs; (ii) improve the technical quality of care; (iii) increase internal efficiency in
service delivery; and (iv) result in an increased focus on prevention and health promotion.

  Reform Area Three: Strengthening the Financing and Organization of Core Public
Health Functions
  Through piloting different approaches to the strengthening of public health system
financing and organization, this component aims to improve the quality, efficiency and
equity of core public health services as well as preparedness for new public health
challenges in rural China.

 COMPONENT TWO: Project Coordination, Policy Development and Lesson Learning
 This component will aim to guide project implementation and identify replicable models
for rural health reform.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will operate in selected counties in the provinces of Chongqing, Gansu,
Heilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. With the exception of
Jiangsu, these province are located in central and western China and are generally
provinces with the low per capita incomes and are regarded as some of the poorest areas
in China. Some provinces, such as Gansu and Qinghai also have significant ethnic
minority populations.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Social
 Some counties may contain ethnic minority populations. Efforts are therefore required
to ensure that the project design adequately reflects their views and perspectives and to
ensure they have the same opportunities for full involvement in project activities as does
the general population.

  The project is rated as Category B in terms of environmental effects. The project is not
a standard health project. Its focus is on testing the viability of certain institutional
innovations--cost control measures, improved insurance mechanisms, new ways of
organizing public health services, etc. Unlike most health projects, it will not fund the
delivery of a broad spectrum of clinical health services although it is, of course, hoped
that such services may be indirectly affected for the better by the innovations tested.
Nonetheless, the project's support for village clinics necessitates that steps are taken for
the proper disposal of medical wastes they produce even though this will be relatively
limited in quantity. Also, it is necessary to ensure that the building of new village clinics
(it is expected this will be the rare exception) does not lead to any involuntary
resettlement.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No such detrimental impacts are anticipated.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
As noted above, it is anticipated that the construction of new clinics will be the rare
exception as most will simply be renovated. Where new clinics must be constructed,
every effort will be made to choose sites that do not involve land acquistion.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
To address the matter of ethnic minority issues in the project, Social Assessment
Guidelines have been developed that counties will follow to examine how people or
groups will be affected directly (whether positively or negatively) by the project and
whether people who should benefit are at risk of being excluded. One dimension of the
assessment is to ask whether ethnic minority populations are found in the county who are
culturally and in other ways differentiated from other populations in the county. In the
event that is the case, the assessment Guidelines will be employed by which counties will
be asked to indicate the measures they will take to address ethnic minority concerns as
part of the county proposals they will submit to be included in the project (use of
indigenous language in outreach activities, etc.). An Indigenous Peoples Planning
Framework is in place and will guide the formulation of an Indigenous Peoples Plan,
where applicable, for any counties that join the project in the future and have ethnic
minority populations.

  The government's request for support for village clinics raises issues of medical waste
disposal, albeit quite limited quantities at this level. Existing national guidelines are in
place to govern proper medical waste disposal (Management Rules on Medical Waste
issued by the State Council). In addition, the Operations Manual will contain a "Medical
Wastes Management Plan" providing technical instructions on medical waste disposal at
village clinics.

 Most support for village clinics will involve renovation, not new construction. Where
new structures are to be built, this will normally take place on public land adjacent to
existing community centers. In the event that suitable public land is unavailable,
however, land acquisition may be necessary. The borrower has agreed to apply World
Bank policy procedures and standards if land acquisition is required. A Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) will apply in such cases. The RPF establishes principles and
guidelines to be used in subsequent resettlement preparation and implementation if land
acquisition should occur under any of the project components.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
An extensive social assessment exercise was undertaken during preparation. This
included a detailed stakeholder analysis and consultation process in each county that is
described in the proposals from the "first batch" of counties to begin implementation
upon project effectiveness. The results were very helpful in informing the formulation of
county proposals. A similar process will be undertaken in each county that will apply to
join the project in the future. This process of consultation with key stakeholders and
other groups that may be affected by the project, such as ethnic minorities, will be used to
influence the design of county proposals that will be submitted for future appraisal.
