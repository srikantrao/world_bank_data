2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective (PDO) is to contribute to strengthen Government’s 
capacity to (i) enhance efficiency and transparency in the use of public resources; (ii) 
manage the development of its petroleum in an environmentally and socially sound and 
sustainable manner; and (3) foster governance and efficiency in the cocoa sector.  
 
The proposed project includes four components: (i) strengthening public financial 
management, including public procurement; (ii) strengthening capacity to manage the 
upstream petroleum sector; (iii) setting up of an adequate institutional and regulatory 
framework for the cocoa sector; and (iv) project management and communication.   
 
3. Project Description 
Component 1: Strengthening public financial management (US$4.5 million)  
 
This component aims to improve the efficiency and transparency of public resource 
management through: enhanced procedures for budget planning, execution and control, 
and development of capacity for the management of these functions; harmonization of the 
PFM legal and regulatory framework with the WEAMU and international norms; and 
improvement in the generation and dissemination of economic and financial information.  
Page  2
Specifically, this component will:  
 
•
Improve capacity for budget preparation, including by enhancing public 
investment planning, setting up of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and 
improving macro-economic modeling.  
 
•
Improve budget classification and nomenclature, by reviewing the current budget 
nomenclature in accordance with the WAEMU and international standard.  This will also 
enable identifying poverty related spending in the context of the HIPC process.  
 
•
Improve budget execution, including through the preparation of an institutional 
audit and development of a manpower plan for strengthening capacity of the MEF.  
 
•
Development of an interface between the budget execution system (SIGFIP); 
procurement system (SIGMAP), treasury accounting (ASTER) and payroll (SIGFAE) 
systems; the pursuit of the deconcentration of the budget execution (SIGFIP) system to 
the remaining 23 “dÃ©partements” in the country.  
 
•
Improvement in the MEF’s production and dissemination of economic and 
financial information including the design and implementation of quarterly budget 
execution reports.  
 
•
Strengthen audit and control functions, by reviewing the de-concentrated control 
procedures for budget execution and producing a manual for this function; streamlining 
and harmonizing the expenditure control procedures; and designing and implementing a 
monitoring and evaluation system in the MEF.  
 
•
Enhance transparency and efficiency of public procurement, by (i) improving the 
existing regulatory and institutional framework; (ii) developing capacity of the public and 
private sectors in public procurement and management; and (iii) strengthening the public 
procurement control systems. Specific actions include the setting up of a public 
procurement regulatory entity; preparation of a procurement manual and standard 
contracts, and of a code of ethics; development of a national strategy to strengthen public 
procurement capacity and training of participants in the central and decentralized 
administration and private operators; and the design and dissemination through the 
internet of public procurement information and statistics generated by the existing 
SIGMAP system.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening capacity to manage the upstream petroleum sector  
 
(US$2.9 million)  
 
This component’s main objectives are to strengthen the Government’s capacity 
tomanage the development of its oil resources in a socially and environmentally sound 
and sustainable manner.  It focuses on specific measures aimed at creating the conditions 
for the design and implementation of the long-term institutional and policy reform 
outlined in the Evaluation Report on the Performance of the Energy Sector of December 
2007.  Specifically, the component is designed to strengthen the Government of CÃ´te 
d’Ivoire’s capacity to: (i) improve the transparencyof petroleum revenue and maximize 
its generation over time, including by attracting new investors; and (ii) develop policy 
and operational responses to support its institutional and technical capacity to manage the 
Page  3
social and environmental aspects that are likely to arise from increased petroleum 
exploration and production activities.  
 
This component will support the following actions:  
 
•
Improve the transparency and the generation of petroleum revenues over time. 
This will include: (i) the review and update of the existing legal, contractual and fiscal 
framework for upstream petroleum activities; (ii) the development of financial model and 
related operating procedures to support the Government’s capacity to forecast and back-
cast petroleum revenue; (iii) the establishment of attractive and transparent procedures to 
enhance the promotion of the country’s sedimentary basin; (iv) the establishment of 
measures to improve the Government’s capacity to negotiate and supervise petroleum 
contracts; and (v) the support to the implementation of the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative (EITI).  
 
•
Strengthen the social and environmental aspects of petroleum operations by: (i) 
reviewing environmental regulations and standards; (ii) establishing a system for 
monitoring the implementation of the environmental management plans; and (iii) 
building capacity for and performing a social and environmental assessment.  
 
Component 3:  Setting up of an adequate institutional and regulatory framework for the 
cocoa sector (US$2.0 million)  
 
This component is designed to foster governance and efficiency in the cocoa sector by 
helping the Government: (i) establish an adequate policy and regulatory framework; and 
(ii) increase the accountability of the entities entrusted with the management and 
regulation of the sector. This component will cover support for: the design and 
implementation of a strategy to reform the cocoa sector, with a key focus on its 
governance structure and accountability mechanisms; an audit of the census of cocoa 
growers; and an institutional, technical and financial audit of the entities overseeing the 
cocoa sector.  
 
Component 4:  Project management and communication (US$2.5 million)  
 
This component will support the project coordination unit and the project technical 
committee with resources to coordinate the activities of the three implementing 
ministries; monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project activities; and finance 
project audits.  
 
This component will also finance a communication outreach focused on the reforms and 
activities supported by the proposed grant to better inform the public and help build 
demand for governance and transparency reforms.  Specifically, this sub-component will 
help improve access to economic information and transparency and strengthen the 
capacity of involved public institutions to communicate effectively.  This will include the 
development of a communication strategy based on an analysis of the mechanisms of 
production, processing and dissemination of economic and financial information and an 
action plan to implement communication activities and consultations with stakeholders.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Because of the nature of the project, which primarily entails the provision of technical 
assistance, the project will not finance any activities that will trigger safeguard policies.  
However, because it involves policy development in the upstream petroleum sector, this 
development will, in turn, have environmental implications.  For this reason, the project 
is classified as category B for the purpose of OP 4.01. The project will finance under the 
upstream petroleum component a strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) 
aimed to identify regulatory, procedural and institutional improvements for the 
prevention and management of the potential social and environmental impact of 
petroleum operation, with particular emphasis on offshore petroleum developments. Draft 
TORs for the SEA have been discussed and agreed upon with the Government.  The SEA 
will be prepared, reviewed, approved and disclosed within 12 months of project 
effectiveness.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Project is classified as environmental category B for the purpose of OP 4.01 because 
no activity funded under the Project is expected to have any direct environmental or 
social impact.  However, the Petroleum Sector Component is designed with the 
development of the country’s oil and gas reserves in mind. This development, in turn, 
will have environmental implications. For this reason, the Project will finance under the 
Petroleum Sector Component a Social and Environmental Assessment (SEA) aimed to 
highlight legal, regulatory, and procedural improvements that will form the basis for 
institutional and regulatory reforms.  The Environmental and Social Screening 
Assessment Framework (ESSAF) is presented in Annex.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The SEA will evaluate impacts on marine and onshore areas that may be affected by oil 
exploration and exploitation permits and licenses. Also, fisheries may be impacted and 
although unlikely fishermen communities may be impacted. A SEA will be financed 
under Component 2 of the project and its recommendations including environmental 
management plan, marine biodiversity conservation measures, oil spill response plan and 
resettlement policy framework will be developed for any future petroleum development 
in CÃ´te d’Ivoire.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Ministry of Mining and Energy (MME), in close cooperation with the Ministry of 
Environment, Water and Forestry (MEWF) will be responsible for administering the 
preparation of the SEA for the Petroleum Sector. To be useful and effective, the SEA 
Page  6
needs to be developed in consultation with all stakeholders including the oil industry 
involved in CÃ´te d’Ivoire, NGOs working on environmental protection and social 
development, government agencies and local government.  The SEA will be prepared, 
reviewed, approved and disclosed within 12 months after project effectiveness. The 
conclusions contained in the SEA will provide data and information needed for the 
definition of an appropriate legal, regulatory and institutional framework for the 
management of the environmental and social impacts of the petroleum sector and its 
sustainable development.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Fishermen groups for offshore petroleum development, petroleum companies interested 
in investments in petroleum sector, Civil Society’s Organizations (CSOs) involved in 
environmental and social development, local NGOs and groups in areas to be potentially 
impacted by future petroleum research, exploration and or exploitation and academia.  
 
Consultation shall be done through public meetings organized by the JTC to discuss the 
ToRs for the SEA, draft and final reports prepared by consultants.  
 
The SEA will be prepared under project implementation.  The ESSAF has been 
prepared and disclosed in-country and at the Infoshop.
