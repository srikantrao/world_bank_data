2. Project Objectives 
The proposed project is consistent with the objective of the CAS (dated October 12, 
2006), which is to help the Government realize successfully Mauritius’ transition to a 
more competitive and sophisticated economy that requires the removal of infrastructure 
bottlenecks.  
 
It will aim at meeting the following specific objective: To contribute to improved 
national infrastructure through playing a key role in the definition and implementation of 
a
high-quality Public Sector Investment Program. More specifically, the project will 
contribute to: (i) improve the condition of the road network through road upgrading, 
periodic maintenance and pilot performance-based routine maintenance contracts, (ii) 
prepare investments in the urban transport sector to alleviate congestion between 
Curepipe and Port-Louis and in the road sector to keep upgrading the existing network, 
(iii) help the Government in defining a ten-year Public Sector Investment Program, (iv) 
assist in establishing a framework for economically viable clean energy development, and 
thereby increase the proportion of renewable energy in the energy mix, (iv) identify and 
prepare key investments in the water and wastewater sectors so as to increase water 
Page  2
production in a sustainable way and to augment the connection to public sewerage 
networks from 25% of households as of now to 50% by 2012 and (v) provide technical 
assistance and training to the line Ministries and agencies.   
 
3. Project Description 
Investment components are summarized below:  
 
(A)Wooton 
–
Belle Rive - Quartier Militaire Road, a 5.5-to-6.5 meter road, the main 
link between the East and the West of Mauritius, will be fully or partially rehabilitated 
and widened to up to 7.5 meters under the proposed project, to alleviate congestion and 
above all to improve road safety on this axis, largely used by trucks and buses. The scope 
of works for the upgrading of Quartier Militaire Road (B6) consists of two main 
components: (a) Upgrading of the existing alignment from Belle Rive junction to 
Quartier Militaire and (b) Construction of bypasses to inhabited areas at Valetta and 
Quartier Militaire.  
 
(a) The upgrading works include:  
 
•
Partial realignment, strengthening and improvement of the longitudinal profile of 
the existing road over a length of about 7 km with a 7.4 meter wide carriageway from 
Belle Rive junction to Quartier Militaire  
 
•
Construction of footpaths and drains, provision of street lighting and resurfacing 
of the existing road through the inhabited areas of Valetta and Quartier Militaire over a 
length of about 2.25 km.  
 
(b) The Bypasses include:  
 
•
Construction of a new 7.4 m wide road to bypass the village of Valetta over 
alength of 1.5km inclusive of two round-abouts, drainage and street lighting.(Valetta 
Bypass)  
 
•
Construction of a new 7.4 m wide road to bypass the village of Quartier Militaire 
over a length of 2.5km inclusive of three round-abouts, one underpass at Bonne Veine 
Road, drainage and street lighting.(Quartier Militaire Bypass).  
 
(B)Roadworks activities will include the periodic maintenance of three highway 
sections, which will complement the ongoing works on the Terre Rouge – Pamplemousse 
section on M2 (approx. 10 km of dual carriageway): (i) Terre Rouge – Quay D on M2 (5 
km of dual carriageway), (ii) Nouvelle France – Vigie on M1 (8 km of single 
carriageway) and (iii) parts of Pamplemousse-Grand Baie on M2 (4 km of double 
carriageway). Each of these three sections would be then maintained through one of the 
pilot performance-based routine maintenance contracts.  
 
The Road Development Authority (RDA) is the Executing Agency for both these 
investment components of the Project.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is not expected to have adverse environmental impacts on human populations 
or environmentally important areas.  
 
A.  The Quartier Militaire project will improve the quality of life of the general 
population, through reducing travel time and increasing safety of transit between the East 
and West of the island.  The improvement in traffic flow will increase productive person 
hours and leisure time, as less time will be spent in transit between work and home.  
 
The population living alongside the road or in the vicinity will particularly benefit as 
works will include the construction of pedestrian pavements, guardrails, speed breaks and 
pedestrian crossings, all of which will enhance safety and enable ease of transit for 
pedestrians traversing the route.  
 
Street lighting will be provided along the new alignment and at all roundabouts to 
increase visibility for drivers, and reduce the risk of accidents. Bus shelters will be 
constructed, providing additional comfort and security to commuters.  
 
Page  4
The construction of an adequate drainage system channeling runoff to natural drainage 
courses will ensure that flooding, particularly at the Couacaud Bridge, and at other flood-
prone areas along the alignment, will be reduced.  This will reduce damage to cars, 
houses and structures, and will also enhance safety along the route.  
 
The main social issue arising from project implementation is the need to extend the 
width of the road by up to 2 meters on either side in lightly populated areas. It will 
therefore be necessary in such areas, to ensure that Project Affected Persons (PAPs) 
(owners of this privately owned land - used for residential and commercial purposes, and 
in some cases for sugarcane cultivation) are adequately compensated through 
Government of Mauritius (GoM) legally mandated land acquisition procedures. An 
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared and will be diclosed by the 
borrower and in the InfoShop prior to appraisal.  
 
The two bypasses will reduce through traffic in heavily populated areas, thereby 
reducing localised pollution and enhancing safety, in addition to easing traffic flow.  
These two bypasses will traverse uninhabited sugar-cane fields.  A preliminary census 
and notification of land acquisition procedures and compensation of PAPS in the bypass 
areas will take place before appraisal, and findings will be added to the RAP.  
 
Any potential negative environmental impacts of the works (including the bypasses) on 
the Quartier Militaire Road have been identified in the EIA “Upgrading ofQuartier 
Militaire Road (B6)" dated July 2002.  The EIA was reviewed by the Ministry of 
Environment and National Development Unit on 28 August 2008, who determined that 
no EIA license would be required.  
 
The EIA is for the most part still current and relevant (though it is possible the number 
of trees along the route may have increased or decreased since 2002, but this will be 
assessed by the Conservator of Forests and the National Parks and Conservation 
Services).  Four trees will be planted for every tree felled, the current estimate being that 
1300 trees will be planted.  The exact number, location and types of trees to be planted 
will be determined in consultation with the Conservator of Forests.  
 
In the construction phase, adverse effects on the environment will include increased 
noise, vibration, and pollution levels due to construction and equipment, traffic 
restrictions due to lane closings, possible public utility interruptions in built-up areas, and 
to a lesser extent, slopes erosion, water flows obstruction, impairment of non-critical 
natural habitat, and minimal water pollution due to construction-related activities.  No 
major contamination of soil or surface water is envisaged.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
A. With the widening of the Quartier Militaire road, road traffic flow will improve, and 
road accidents will be reduced.  Since the route is the main artery between the East and 
West of the island, traffic will not increase beyond the present high load. The 
construction of pedestrian pavements, guardrails, speed breaks and pedestrian crossings, 
Page  5
will enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety. The bypasses will reduce localized pollution 
in populated areas, and will further enhance safety.  Since the bypasses traverse 
agricultural land, there will be no impact on critical natural habitats.  
 
Sound engineering practice will be followed to ensure any impacts occasioned by 
construction - damage to walls, foundation and structures- will be kept to a minimum.  In 
the case such damage occurs, the usual procedure is for the RDA to repair such damage, 
and this is the preferred option historically.  Alternately, the PAP may opt for cash 
compensation (as assessed by the RDA) to undertake repairs themselves.  
 
B.   The resurfacing of existing roads would not significantly increase development in 
the North of the island and therefore, long term impacts would be minimal.  Air quality 
and noise in the areas should improve since there should be less traffic congestion once 
the roads are better maintained. Smoother traffic flow will reduce stop-start driving 
patterns, which lead to increased emissions of greenhouse gases.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The possibility NOT to build bypasses that will detour around settled areas was 
considered, but eventually dropped following consultations with the PAPs and after a 
detailed socio-economic analysis was carried out, which showed that the magnitude of 
the benefits expected from these bypasses compensates for the extra costs (The project 
WITH the bypasses still yields an Economic Rate of Return of 51%).   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
In keeping with the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies, the Road Development Authority 
(RDA) prepared an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Upgrade of Quartier 
Militaire Road  in 2002, and is preparing an Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP)based on questions submitted by the Ministry of Environment and National 
Development Unit on 28 August 2008. The Ministry determined that no EIA license 
would be required.  
 
A
Resettlement Action Plan has also been prepared for Quarttier Militaire and will be 
finalised when the exact area of land acquisition is ascertained (at which point valuation 
and compensation will be undertaken). A preliminary census and notification of land 
acquistion procedures and compensation of PAPS in the bypass areas will take place 
before appraisal, and findings will be added to the RAP.  
 
Any activity such as demolition and reconstruction of boundary walls and gates will be 
carried out under the project, in accordance with an established calendar which will 
involve liaison with PAPs.  
 
The RDA also prepared an EMP for the roadworks on the Terre Rouge – Pamplemousse 
section on M2. The EMP specifies the mitigation measures to be implemented by the 
Page  6
contractor. In addition, all Contractors are required to obtain and abide by relevant GoM 
licenses for extraction of material from quarries and borrow sites, as well as licenses for 
the use of disposal sites, crusher and asphalt plant site, etc.  The Project Management 
Unit and supervision consultants are required to monitor compliance of license conditions 
and the implementation of the EMP very rigorously.  
 
In support of this, the project will provide for training for appropriate RDA staff in 
environmental and social management of the road sector.  
 
The Government of Mauritius’ institutional capacity for safeguard policies is high.  
Tourism and fishing are key sectors of the Mauritian economy and both depend on sound 
environmental management for long-run sustainability.  
 
Mauritius’ environmental agencies have more than adequate capacity and experience in 
commissioning and following through on environmental impact assessments and for 
monitoring compliance with the country’s environmental and social protection laws.  The 
government is responsive to the desires of the public, and has many times in the past 
postponed or altered public projects that faced strong opposition from those who would 
be negatively affected and/or NGOs (the Southeastern Highway is an example).  
 
For environmental issues, the Road Development Authority under the Ministry of Public 
Infrastructure, works closely with the Department of Environment within the Ministry of 
Environment and National Development to validate EIAs, and in the case of particularly 
sensitive projects, a staff member from the Ministry of Environment is assigned to the 
supervision of the works from an environmental perspective. The Department of 
Environment’s staff is adequately trained and experienced.  
 
The Valuation Department of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development will 
undertake the assets valuation work, and has a very thorough valuation process which 
follows international accounting and valuation methods, and determines value based on 
market pricing.  
 
The Ministry of Housing and Lands (MHL)is responsible for advertising the land 
acquisition process and making compensation, using funds earmarked by the Ministry of 
Finance and Economic Development. The MHL has comprehensive and wide-ranging 
experience in land acquisition for infrastructure projects.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders for this project are primarily the residents, and owners of small 
businesses and agricultural plots along the Quartier Militaire Road. Others include 
transporters, road users, students, local NGOs, institutional stakeholders (local 
governments, RDA, Public Utility departments).  
 
The RDA is working closely with the Citizens Advice Bureau and the local MP and 
community leaders, for public consultation and public information dissemination. 
Page  7
Consultations and public participation have already been and will continue to be  carried 
out as an ongoing process throughout project planning, design and implementation 
stages. Preparation of appropriate documents and planning and implementation for the 
acquisition of land and other assets will be carried out in consultation with the PAPs and 
the PAPs will receive prior information of the compensation, relocation and other 
assistance available to them including:  
 
•
The relevant details of the project;  
 
•
The land acquisition plan and various degrees of project impact;  
 
•
Details of entitlements under the land acquisition plan and what is required of 
PAPs in order to claim their entitlements;  
 
•
Compensation process and compensation rates;  
 
•
Implementation schedule with a timetable for the delivery of entitlements.  
 
•
Information concerning grievance procedures and how to use them.  
 
All Compensation issues will be followed up by the Ministry of Land and Housing.  
 
Grievances can be voiced to the local Citizens Advice Bureau, who will hold periodic 
meetings on the project, and can also be voiced to the Contractor Engineer as well as 
directly to the RDA, which will ensure that necessary corrective measures are taken 
under the contract.  
 
The road maintenance along the M2 will have negligible effects on residents and 
businesses.  Any dust or noise pollution will be mitigated under measures prescribed in 
the EMP.
