B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overall objective of the project is to expand and consolidate the social advances and 
institutional modernization of the State of Cear√° through support forinvestment programs 
(included in the PPA 2008/2011) that are critical to the State's development agenda.  The specific 
project development objectives are to:  
 
ï
strengthen results-based management, including sector strategy development, budget 
formulation, monitoring & evaluation, and accountability for program execution  
 
ï
improve early childhood literacy and the quality of data detailing student learning from 
primary through secondary school  
 
ï
improve the quality of community-based primary healthcare teams, and the quality and 
efficiency of health services provided in state hospitals  
 
ï
expand access to sewerage services, and improve water quality as well as the efficiency 
of the government autarchies charged with these responsibilities  
Page  2
ï
support infrastructure investment for state-wide internet access and public sector 
management reforms to stimulate private sector productive investments, especially outside the 
Fortaleza.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
This operation combines the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) with an Adaptable Program Loan 
(APL). It is the second SWAp loan of an APL. The first will close in December 2007, fully 
disbursing the $150 million loan amount. The operation described here does not adhere fully to 
the simplified protocols governing second APL loans, owing to certain design changes and an 
increase in the anticipated loan amount from $90m to $240m.  
 
The SWAp II is comprised of a $237m SWAp component and a $3m TA Component. The 
SWAp component supports the governmentís development program expenditures in a) public 
sector management, b) education, c) health, d) water resources and sanitation, and d) business 
environment and innovation. The TA component provides analysis and institutional 
strengthening to support reforms in these sectors in furtherance of the development program 
objectives.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Cear√° is mostly located a semi-arid region, with irregular rainfall and prolonged droughts. The 
area around the capital city, Fortaleza, is the one with highest rainfall averages. Because of the 
dry conditions, most of the population is concentrated in two regions: the shoreline (besides 
Fortaleza, the other major city is Sobral) and the southeast (around Juazeiro do Norte and Crato).  
 
The central area of Cear√° is plane, with low altitudes; in the perimeter of theState, besides the 
Atlantic Ocean in the north, is composed by mountain chains and Chapadas.  
 
More than 90% of Cear√° was once covered by caatingas, the kind of vegetation associated 
with the semi-arid climate; the caataingas have been affected by human interventions.  
 
The most important river in Cear√° is Jaguaribe; nearly all the rivers in Cear√° are intermitent 
(dry out during the periods of drought). Artificial lakes, called a√ßudes, are built all around the 
State, to trap water from rives; the largest a√ßudes are Or√≥s (the biggest in Brazil) and 
Banabuiu   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The borrower has a proven track record of institutional capacity as shown during the first SWAp 
loan (P082142). The second SWAp loan will continue to support programs and provide technical 
assistance to improve state-wide environmental policies. The project will provide technical 
support to improve the social inclusion of health and education components.

Most project related investments are focused on strengthening public sector policies and 
improve quality of primary education, healthcare and sewerage services. Most, these investments 
will not cause any direct or irreversible impact on society or environment.  
 
A
major environmental problem related to this project is the improper handling, collection 
and disposal of hazardous waste produced by hospitals and public health care units. A state-wide 
strategy for Health Care Waste Management is being prepared that will specify the necessary 
investments for proper waste treatment and management, as well a strategy to build the capacity 
of technical and management teams to develop and implement specific waste management plans. 
These programs will be closely linked to the hospital certification programs financed by the loan. 
Furthermore, the project will continue supporting the ìProjecto Sanear IIî to increase 
number of water and sewerage connections in the state. These investments in basic infrastructure 
will have a positive environmental impact, but might results in some localized reversible 
impacts. The ìProjecto Sanear IIî is also supported by the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IADB) and already has an environmental framework that was analyzed by the World Bank in 
December 2006, and found satisfactory in addressing Bankís environmental and social safeguard 
issues. Theframework will continue to be applied under the second SWAp loan.

Since the project aims to have a state-wide coverage there will be indigenous people in the 
project domain and it is expected that such communities benefit from the project. Regarding the 
projectís investments they will not contribute to indirect or cumulative impacts on indigenous 
peoples. The Borrowerís standards onindigenous peoples ensure cultural appropriated benefits, 
avoidance of harmful impacts, and prior consultations. Nevertheless the project will assist the 
Borrower to develop an indigenous people development framework for the health and education 
components, focused on quality improvement.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
Basic infrastructure investments on water and sanitation to expand the access may trigger 
involuntary resettlement.  The investment sites are not yet known but the project will  continue to 
rely preliminary on the Resettlement Framework  already developed by the Inter-American Bank 
(IADB)  and applied by the first SAWp, which was found satisfactory by the Bank.
