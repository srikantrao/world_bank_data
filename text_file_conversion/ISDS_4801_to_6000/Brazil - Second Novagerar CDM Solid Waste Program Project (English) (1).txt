2. Project Objectives 
 
1.
 
The main objective of the Novagerar Landfil
l Gas Project is to mitigate greenhouse 
gas emissions and reduce environmental and 
social impacts of solid waste disposal. 
This would be accomplished by improving final 
treatment and disposal of solid waste 
and capturing landfill gases. 
The project includes the in
stallation of landfill gas 
capturing and flaring systems at old dumpsites, new sanitary landfills, and the 
exploration of alternative 
waste treatment options, such as composting, to reduce 
carbon emissions. Depending upon the quality/quantity of gas collected, some 
projects might generate electric
ity from the landfill gas captured. 
 
 
3. Project Description 
 
2.
 
The Novagerar Carbon Finance and Solid Wa
ste Management Proj
ect II intends to 
extend the successful business model devel
oped for the first Novagerar project in 
Nova Iguaçu, and to develop an umbrella 
of Landfill Gas Capture projects in Brazil. 
The project comprises several distinct 
subprojects aimed at capturing landfill gas 
from new sanitary landfills and old dumpsite
s. Given project feasibility and sufficient 
landfill gas volume, a gas-to-energy pl
ant could be included among these sub-
Page  2

projects. A pilot composting site is also being considered at one of the landfill sites. 
The captured methane would then be either flar
ed or used to genera
te electricity, to be 
sold to the grid if the potential is d
eemed significant. An LOI encompassing the 
whole umbrella was signed with Novagerar on February 14, 2007, and each sub-
project would have its own 
individual PIN, PID and 
ISDS. The proposed project 
comprises of individual sub-pr
ojects at different stages of
 preparation. A preliminary 
assessment has identified 5 initial sub-projects, from which carbon emission 
reductions would be purchased, with more 
to be added as they are identified: 
 
3.
 
Sub-project 1
: Operation of the existing landfill of
 São Gonçalo (850 tons/day), a.k.a 
Itaoca. The landfill has already been contracted
 in the form of a municipal concession 
and will be closed in 2008. 
About 200 waste-pickers are liv
ing on the proj
ect site and 
have been organized into a cooperative
 since the beginning of São Gonçalo’s 
rehabilitation process from dumpsite into proper landfill. 
 
4.
 
Sub-project 2: 
Novagerar is developing an entirely privately operated landfill in 
Muribeca, part of the Munici
pality of Jaboatao dos Guarar
apes, close to the city of 
Recife, a.k.a CTR Candeias. The site is 
already operating and waiting for nearby 
municipalities to begin bringi
ng their solid wastes. It currently recieves an estimated 
900 tons/day of municipal waste, and the a
ddition of Recife woul
d bring its potential 
up to 2,700 tons/day.
 
 
5.
 
Sub-project 3: 
As part of the concession for the re
habilitation and cl
osing of the old 
São Gonçalo dumpsite, the contract with th
e municipality also 
includes the opening 
of a new sanitary landfill in the municipa
lity, with an estimated disposal of around 
900 tons/day. A study of alternatives for 
the new site identif
ication has been 
completed and Novagerar has submitted th
e findings to the municipality and public 
attorney for review and approval.
 
 
6.
 
Sub-project 4: 
Novagerar has identified a site for a new landfill in the southern part 
of the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro (S
anta Rosa), and is currently seeking the 
requisite environmental license
. The potential amount of solid waste to be disposed is 
high (between 3 to 5,000 tons/d
ay), and there are also plan
s to use an existing railway 
link to transport the waste between the city of Rio de Janeiro and the landfill, thereby 
providing additional benefits. This sub-proj
ect is likely to be ready by next year. 
 
7.
 
Sub-project 5
: Novagerar is currently operating a landfill, but is planning 
construction of a composting plant in Petr
olina, Bahia, which could receive waste 
from neighboring cities, including Juazeiro. 
The organic content of the waste is high, 
but no detailed studies have yet been unde
rtaken to assess th
e project’s emission 
reduction potential.

4. Project siting and salient physical charac
teristics relevant to 
safeguards analysis 
 
The sub-projects are all located within or near major urban areas. The identification of 
new landfill sites ensures that 
none would be located within fr
agile habitats or adjacent to 
densely populated areas. A
ny doubts concern the existing 
dumpsite in São Gonçalo, 
which has already been partially rehabilitate
d by Novagerar, but is sitting in a mangrove 
area next to Guanabara Bay. There is an urgency to definitively close the dumpsite, 
finalize the rehabilitation process, and m
onitor impacts on the surrounding environment. 
Field visits and documentation provided by 
Novagerar show that the company has 
already made good progress and will continue
 to work on minimizing the landfill’s 
impacts

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impact
s associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large 
scale, significant a
nd/or irreversible 
impacts: 
 
The project triggers and addresses 
the following Bank safeguard policies: 
 
OP 4.01 – Environmental Assessment 
 
As mentioned, the project is focused on the 
implementation of gas 
capture and treatment 
systems on existing dumpsites and new landfills. These investments impose no 
significant impacts and actually offer a number 
of benefits, in terms of emissions and 
explosion risk reductions, as well as additi
onal resources for environmental monitoring 
Page  4

4
and social activities in and around the landfills. The project has thus been rated a 
Category B. 
 
As discrete investments are part of larger 
investments in the opening of new landfills and 
closing of existing dumpsites, the team has reviewed the overall environmental and social 
assessments and management plans prepared by Novagerar at the various sub-project 
sites, including specific investments in
 gas capture and treatment systems. 
 
To ensure that the project identifies a
nd mitigates all major environmental risks, 
Novagerar has prepared two social and e
nvironmental management frameworks; one 
specific to existing dumpsites, and the other for 
new sites, to be applied to individual sub-
projects, depending on their oper
ating status. The frameworks 
include procedures for the 
closing of open dumpsites, the construction and operation of new landfills, and mitigation 
measures for the economic displacement of waste pickers, as well as landfill-to-gas 
facilities. As each subproject is identified, 
the appropriate framework would be applied 
and a Social and Environmental Assessment a
nd Management Plan (SEMP) prepared and 
shared with the Bank for no objection prior 
to the signing of any agreement for the 
purchase of ERs of sub-projects. 
 
Environmental Assessments have been conducted for the New Landfill of Candeias, 
Pernambuco State, and the Proposed Landfil
l of Santa Rosa, Rio de Janeiro. An 
Environmental and Social Management Plan
 (ESMP), based on the Environmental and 
Social Framework, has been prepared for the Itaoca Dumpsite in São Gonçalo, Rio de 
Janeiro. Based on these assessments, detaile
d management plans are being developed, 
including. among other things: 
(i) Social Consultation a
nd Outreach Plans; (ii) 
Environmental Monitoring Plans; (iii) Waste 
Picker Social Integration Plans; (iv) 
Environmental Monitoring Program for Landf
ill Gas Recovery and Flaring; and (v) 
Environmental Monito
ring of the Project.
 
 
 
4.04 – Natural Habitats 
 
Procedures for the siting of new landfills 
include criteria to avoid environmentally 
sensitive areas, wetlands, 
and significant protected ar
eas and natural habitats. 
Unfortunately, existing dumpsites often are lo
cated in river valleys, swamps and natural 
habitats: for example, the exis
ting Itaoca Landfill is located 
in a sensitive mangrove area. 
In this case, the team has worked to ensu
re that Novagerar im
plements appropriate 
measures to reduce and minimize impacts, that carbon finance revenues are provided to 
fund dumpsites closings, that appropriate reme
diation measures are implemented and that 
adequate environmental monitoring is done in
 and around the landfill to ensure impacts 
are controlled and minimized.

OP 4.12 – Involuntary Resettlement 
 
The closing of the dumpsites and installation of landfill gas recovery systems would 
require the relocation of waste-pickers work
ing on the existing dumps
ite at Itaoca. In 
order to mitigate any adverse effects to th
e current livelih
oods of the affected waste 
pickers, Novagerar and local governments,
 would implement a comprehensive waste 
picker integration strategy including: (i) a ce
nsus and registration of waste pickers and 
their families; (ii) creation of a safer and 
cleaner working environment for recycling and 
support in the wholesaling of materials; (iii
) the offering of viable income generation 
alternatives at the new landfill site or the municipality; and (iv) the providing of 
improved access to health care and education,
 especially for children. Some of these 
measures are already being implemented by N
ovagerar at some sites, and the Bank would 
support their further implementation. 
 
The ESMF already developed includes a co
mprehensive framework for addressing these 
issues, and each new sub-project in which 
waste pickers are invol
ved would develop a 
specific plan, based upon that framework (the
 Itaoca ESMP has already been written and 
applied). In Itaoca, a social analysis, cons
ultation and accompaniment process has already 
resulted in the formation of a waste pickers’
 recycling cooperative, the construction of a 
covered sorting facility, a
nd other measures to improve
 the livelihoods and working 
conditions of waste pickers. 
 
In addition, Novagerar is implementing public
 consultation and outreach programs in all 
of its sub-project areas to improve public
 understanding of the need for a landfills and 
their basic principles of operation. This pr
ocess also allow neighboring communities to 
express their concerns and promote commun
ity supported measures to compensate for 
impacts generated by the landfill and to incr
eased traffic in the immediate vicinity. 
Novagerar has extensive experience in the de
sign and implementation of such plans in 
other landfills and has alrea
dy demonstrated great
 effectiveness in involving local 
communities. 
 
Furthermore, the linking of this project w
ith a series of other initiatives aimed at 
strengthening social inclusion in solid waste management in Brazil (specifically, the 
Integrated Solid Waste Management and 
Carbon Finance Project, the PPIAF-supported 
Private Participation in M
unicipal SWM Projects in Brazil, and the JSDF-supported 
Waste Picker Inclusion Initiative), would allow 
it to benefit from the advances of those 
other projects, as well as extra support. 
 
2. Describe any potential i
ndirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated 
future activities in the project area: 
 
Positive Impacts 
 
The proposed project is expected to have hi
ghly positive environmen
tal impacts, as it 
would enable environmental improvements in 
solid waste practices and the landfill gas 
recovery system would reduce both global em
issions and local air pollution. The closing 
Page  6
 
 
6
6
and rehabilitation of existing dumpsites woul
d greatly reduce direct
 impacts of improper 
waste disposal on the surrounding environm
ent and communities. ER revenues would 
assist the financing of these strategies
 and long-term environmental monitoring. 
 
Negative impacts 
 
The proposed project is focused on the 
implementation of landfill gas capture and 
recovery systems, which have limited local e
nvironmental impacts, mostly related to the 
construction phase. Overall final disposal 
operations have the following impacts that 
must be properly addressed by Novagerar to 
avoid posing environmen
tal or public health 
risks: 
(i)
 
Air
: emissions of methane (CH4
), air pollutants (CO, SO
2
, NO
x
, NMVOC, CO
2
, 
N
2
O), heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, 
As), dust, dioxins and odors; 
(ii)
 
Water:
 leaching of salts, heavy metals, and biode
gradable and persistent organics to 
surface water and groundwater; 
(iii)
 
Soil
: accumulation of hazardous substances in the soil; 
(iv)
 
Landscape
: visual intrusion, restri
ction for other users; 
(v)
 
Ecosystem
: contamination and accumulation of t
oxic substances in the food chain; 
and 
(vi)
 
Human health
: exposure to hazardous substances, spread of vector diseases, 
nuisance from odors, and increased traffic in surrounding communities. 
 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (i
f relevant) considered to help avoid or 
minimize adverse impacts. 
 
All sub-projects will improve overall conditions
 of waste disposal and reduce impacts on 
communities and environment. In the specific 
case of the Itaoca dumpsite, the alternative 
of not having the project would almost certa
inly worsen the situation and result in 
increasing impacts of the existing dumpsite
 on surrounding communities, deteriorating 
working conditions for the waste-pickers a
nd growing pollution of Guanabara Bay and  
the very sensitive and scarce mangrove areas in the metropolitan region. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borro
wer to address safeguard policy issues. 
Provide an assessment of borrower capacity
 to plan and implement the measures 
described. 
 
The Novagerar Eco Energia Ltda has an exce
llent track-record in developing sanitary 
landfills and addressing environmental impact
s from waste disposal sites. The company 
has a team of highly qualified consultants to
 address environmental impacts from solid 
waste operations and a team of
 social assistants to supervise and implement social 
programs in and around the landfill. Previous
 projects have demonstrated Novagerar’s 
commitment to environmental and social
 causes, and have led to substantial 
improvements in local environment and quality of life. The project team has worked 
closely with Novagerar in pr
oject preparation to develop 
a comprehensive environmental 
Page  7
 
 
7
7
and social framework to prevent, minimize, mitigate and/or compensate any 
environmental and social impacts of i
nvestments, through the use carbon revenues. 
 
In the specific case 
of Itaoca, carbon revenues w
ould support the pr
eparation and 
implementation of a social development plan 
addressing waste-pickers formerly living on 
the dumpsite. The project would strengthen the 
segregation process, 
and the stocking and 
selling of recycled materials in a coopera
tive form, through support for cooperatives, the 
providing of social assistance, and the 
providing of training, and improvements in 
infrastructure and equipment in order to 
improve waste pickers’ quality of life and 
increase their average income. The project w
ould also help build municipal capacity to 
address environmental and social issues (w
hich might possibly be financed from carbon 
revenues as well). 
 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and descri
be the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an 
emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include:

In accordance with the Bank Information Disclosure Policy (BP 17.50), a process of 
disclosure and public consulta
tion was completed for Itaoca, Candeias and Santa Rosa, as 
part of the Environmental Assessment. Nova
gerar has also agreed to a consultation 
process that would continue under th
e implementation of the project.
