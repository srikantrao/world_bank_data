B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objectives of the proposed project are to: (a) reduce potential economic and 
health damages associated with a closed uranium milling site in Malargue, Mendoza; and (b) 
st
rengthen GoAís capacity to assess and mitigate environmental risks associated with closed 
uranium mines, processing sites, and related mining sector investments, in accordance with 
international good practice.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will finance investments to remediate the closed uranium processing site in 
Malarg√ºe, Mendoza, and will provide technical assistance in three areas: (a) to develop 
CNEA's environmental management capacity to plan and carry out sustainable and technically 
sound remediation interventions throughout the uranium sector; (b) to support technically, 
environmentally, and socially responsible planning of the remediation needs of the other seven 
priority sites across the country; and (c) to introduce concepts of environmental risk management 
more broadly in the mining sector, including the Secretariat of Environment and Secretariat of 
Mining.

The proposed project includes three components.  
 
Component 1. Remediation of the Malarg√ºe Site  
 
ï
Remediation of the Malarg√ºe site. The site, which was donated by the Provinceof 
Mendoza to CNEA, is located at the northern limit of the city of Malarg√ºe (about 270 km 
south of Mendoza city). The project will fund remediation works, including the safe disposal of 
710,000 tons of tailings and soils, structures to prevent groundwater contamination and dust, and 
measures to abate radiation and radon emissions. Given the delays in processing this loan (see 
Section B.1, above), contracting has been done in conformance with World Bank procedures and 
civil works have already begun (as of March, 2008, the required investment is about 30% 
complete). Independent construction supervision conducted by a Bank-hired technical expert has 
reviewed the design and certified the quality of construction to date.  An EIA following the 
requirements of applicable national laws and provincial law No. 5961, and detailed engineering 
plans for this site have been prepared and approved by the provincial and national (Nuclear 
Regulatory Authority, or ARN) authorities.  
 
Component 2. Mine Restoration Planning and Institutional Strengthening  
 
ï
Develop remediation options for other sites. In addition to Malarg√ºe, seven other 
closed uranium sites have been inventoried (see listing and map in Section A-1 above). The 
project will provide technical assistance to study and design remediation options to clean up the 
additional sites, and support the environmental and social consultation processes required as per 
international best practice. The project would also fund an international advisory panel to advise 
on the approaches being suggested for each site. Members of the international panel might 
typically come from Australia, Canada, Europe (Germany, Spain) and the USA (UMTRA 
program).  
 
ï
Strengthen the CNEA Environmental Management Unit (UGA). The UGA is CNEAís 
relatively new Environmental and Waste Management Department. This component will:  
 
ï
support its organization, staffing, financial resources, work methodology, providing 
training as needed in any of these areas;  
 
ï
develop and implement an Environmental Management and Information System (SIGA) 
including a Geographic Information (GIS) and site-specific monitoring; and  
 
ï
develop and implement improved and systematized public consultation and information 
processes, under the responsibility of the newly created Community Relations Unit.  
 
ï
Strengthen environmental management in the mining sector. This subcomponent will 
fund the promotion of good environmental practices more broadly in the mining sector by 
strengthening the environmental entities in the two key agencies involved in the sector, i.e., 
Secretariat of Mining and the Secretariat of Environment. The specific activities under this 
component would cover a range of technical assistance topics related to environmental risk and 
risk management, such as:  
 
ï
Good practice for closings of both uranium mines and other minerals, in such areas as: 
tailings dumps and tailings dam restoration, land reclamation, and processing waste (both liquid 
and solid) remediation. This subcomponent could include study tours and a best practice manual 
based on the Malarg√ºe experience.  
 
ï
Completion of baseline surveys (in general) and site-specific baseline data requirements 
for on-going monitoring and compliance.  
Page  3
ï
Handling and treatment of mine tailings and effluents for operating mines.  
 
ï
Design of monitoring and control mechanisms.  
 
ï
Early-warning impact evaluation methodologies and more detailed impact evaluations as 
part of site-specific risk analysis.  
 
ï
Public awareness and communication strategies concerning sustainable mining practices, 
such as land use management, risk management, community consultation, and public disclosure 
of data from site remediation monitoring.  
 
Component 3. Project Management: the project implementation unit of the UGA will be 
responsible for project implementation, reporting, project monitoring, and impact evaluation of 
key interventions.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Malarg√ºe site in the province of Mendoza is one of eight sites of abandoned/inactive 
uranium mines and milling sites that have been inventoried by CNEA to date. It was the site of 
uranium milling, active between 1954 and 1986. Component 1 of the proposed SIL will finance 
remediation investments at the site.  
 
The site occupies an area of 42 hectares and is located at the north east edge of the city of 
Malarg√ºe, a city with a population of about 20,000 inhabitants, in the province of Mendoza. 
Within a radius of 500m from the plantís boundary, one encounters an industrial zone and a 
railroad right of way; agricultural (potato seedlings) farms and cattle pastures; and a 9-ha 
bioremediation experimentation site leased by CNEA. SW of the site, located at least 250 meters 
away, there are 19 run-down residences with 112 inhabitants, including 54 minors. There are two 
provincial protected areas within the limits of Malarg√ºe County, the Fauna Reserve of Laguna 
Llancanelo (40km away) and the Total Reserve El Pay√©n (230km away).  
 
Malarg√ºeís climate is cold sub-arid, with average annual temperature of 11.7 0Cand relative 
humidity of 59%. There are two predominant wind directions: mild (10-12 km/hour on average), 
northern to northeasterly winds, blowing from the site towards the city, and stronger (19-22 km/h 
on average but with gusts up to 174 km/hour) western to southwesterly winds, blowing away 
from the city. Only the latter winds are capable of causing significant particulate dispersion from 
the tailings.  
 
The site is underlain to a depth of 23m by a substratum of young alluvial and aeolian deposits 
consisting of gravel, sand and finer sediments. These highly permeable sediments host the 
phreatic aquifer. An impermeable, 3m-thick clay layer underlies this aquifer. Another layer of 
sand and gravel underneath the clay hosts a pressurized, confined aquifer. The waters of the 
phreatic and confined aquifers flow away from the city and toward the NE at a gradient of 0.6% 
and at a flow rate of 500m/year.  
 
Drinking water, supplied by Obras Sanitarias Mendoza S.A., is extracted from two sources 
located up-basin from the site. The primary source - the Malarg√ºe River, is supplemented by a 
160 m-deep well, located about 4 km SW from the site. Site activities pose no contamination 
risks to drinking water supplies, as both sources are located far upstream.

E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Executing agency. The National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) will be responsible for the 
implementation of the project, including of all TA activities benefiting other agencies. CNEA is 
the government agency with legal obligation to remediate the sites of closed or closed mines or 
milling sites.  According to the Federal Decree-Law No. 22.498, CNEA is an autarchic entity 
under the jurisdiction of the Nationís Secretariat of Energy, which is part of the Ministry of 
Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services. Therefore, a Subsidiary Agreement between 
the Argentine Republic (the Borrower) and CNEA (the Executing Agency) will have to be 
signed.  
 
Project administration. CNEA will maintain the already established coordinating unit that has 
been responsible for the preparation of the project and management of two Project Preparation 
Facilities (PPFs). This unit is fully integrated within CNEAís Environmental Management Unit 
(UGA), and has already established working relationships with the Secretariats of Environment 
and Mining, two other institutional partners in the project. The UGA is designed as follows:  
 
(i) the Project Coordinator and the Deputy Coordinator responsible for the overall management 
of project activities. The Project Coordinator will report quarterly to the National Steering 
Committee on project implementation;  
 
(ii) the Technical Management Unit, responsible for preparation of TOR (studies) and technical 
specifications (works) and for supervision of the studies (mainly EIAs and engineering) and 
works; local technical teams are already located in Malarg√ºe, C√≥rdoba and Salta, and will be 
established at other sites as needed;  
 
(iii) the Community Relationships Unit, responsible for: the identification and characterization 
(social analysis) of stakeholders; the set up and follow up of the consultation processes at the 
different sites; and the set up and implementation of a communication strategy, including 
information and communication with affected communities;  
 
(iv) the Quality and Monitoring Unit, responsible for follow-up of project activities and 
objectives and compliance with Safeguard Policies. Activities of this unit will include 
environmental monitoring and ensuring compliance with the projectís environmental 
management plan; and  
 
(v) the Administrative Management Unit (which would close at the end of the project) will be  
responsible for the administration of the project, including budget preparation and follow-up, 
financial management, and procurement.  
 
29.
Project Sustainability and the Project Implementation Unit (ìPIUî). Presently, 21 of the 
28 members of the Project unit are CNEA staff. It is expected that this ratio of staff to non-staff 
will be maintained throughout project implementation. The unit currently comprises three civil 
engineers, three geologists, two chemical engineers, one mining engineer, two chemists and six 
technicians. The unit is formally integrated into CNEAís Environmental Management Unit 
(UGA), which is the specific object of Component 2. The UGA/PIU will therefore be in charge 
of the consultation, communication, design, and supervision functions related to the remediation 
program. After project closure, while the administrative functions specifically linked to the 
management of the loan will be eliminated, the information and management‚
 îand
personnel‚
 î functions will be maint
ained to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

For the Malarg√ºe works, an early draft EIA was published in Spanish on the CNEAwebsite 
in August 2001 (http://www.cnea.gov.ar/). Review of this process and of the outputs confirmed 
that the EIA was consultative (extensive open discussions locally and at the provincial level), 
that a range of realistic alternatives was evaluated, and that the final design takes into account all 
the environmental issues identified.

A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  05/27/2008 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The extent of the consultations held has been documented in the EIA, and their 
comprehensiveness was confirmed through independent additional surveys (December 2001 
and July 2005) as well as at meetings and workshops involving local authorities and 
community members with participation of Bank staff (November 2005, August 2006 and 
February 2007). A Project Information Center has been built and was formally open in 
November 2005 at the Malarg√ºe site. In May 2007, the Malarg√ºe site EIA was finalized 
by CNEA and re-posted, and a revised Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) was finalized 
in March 2008 (and is posted both on the CNEA website and in the Infoshop).
