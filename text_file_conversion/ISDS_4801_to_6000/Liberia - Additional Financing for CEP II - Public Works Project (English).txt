2. Project Objectives: 
 
The PDO of the Community Empowerment Project (II) will be revised as follows: 
As part of the 
Government response to the social and economic emergency of Liberia, the Project will improve 
poor rural communities’ access to basic infrastructure and provide economic opportunities for 
vulnerable households in urban and rural areas
.
Hence, the Project is undergoing a limited 
restructuring in its PDO as compared to the original PDO, to include urban activities. 
 
The specific goal of the expanded activities will be to provide income support to vulnerable 
households in rural and urban areas. 
 
3. Project Description: 
 
The existing Liberian Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE), which receives Bank 
support under the Community Empowerment Project (CEP), delivers demand-led community 
infrastructure. Under this additional financing, a new module would be developed to use local 
labor for basic community tasks such as street sweeping and drainage clearance and the like. It is 
Page  2
expected that 75% of component costs will be labor costs, thereby maximizing the impact on 
beneficiaries.  
 
Building on LACE’s experience with direct procurement for civil works and goods, it is 
envisioned that under the cash for work program, LACE will directly contract existing NGOs, 
small private firms, or larger community based organization (CBOs) to undertaken labor-
intensive small sub-projects in urban and rural areas. Targeting of specific areas will take into 
account both needs (i.e. rice surplus or rice deficit area, presence of unemployed people) and the 
geographical coverage of existing interventions. To this end, LACE will work closely with the 
various city corporations, the Ministry of Public Works, and other national and international 
agencies. Works will most likely consist of basic rural road maintenance (side-brushing, possibly 
ditch-digging) and urban sweeping and waste collection/ disposal. Liberia has a number of 
organizations with experience working with international organizations and bilateral donors 
executing exactly these types of works. The advantage of tapping this experience is two-fold:  
first, it will allow the program to roll-out rapidly; and second, it will further contribute to the 
capacity-building of these small organizations, which will be increasingly useful partners in 
future endeavors.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
Page  3
The safeguard issues associated with the proposed activities are likely to be minimal; the only 
reason that they trigger the Environmental Assessment policy is that waste clean-up will involve 
the disposal of waste, side-brushing of roads will involve the cutting down and disposal of 
roadside brush, or may involve air pollution in the form of dust and debris generated by the 
activities. Unlike with CEP II, involuntary resettlement will not be triggered, as there will be no 
construction or land acquisition. 
 
In fact, it is anticipated that the proposed activities will have a positive impact on social and 
environmental conditions in Liberia, both by improving the physical environment, and by 
contributing to the alleviation of the food price crisis.  
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area: 
 
None. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts: 
 
None were considered. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
Under the auspices of CEP II, LACE prepared a package of two safeguard documents, of which 
the first one is relevant to this component: the ESMF and the RPF. The objective of the 
frameworks is to ensure that project activities do not have negative impact on the environment 
and distort social relations and structure. The Government of Liberia through the LACE has 
therefore taken measures to examine the environmental and social impact of the Project and map 
out possible mitigation measures to address even the mildest anticipated environmental and 
social effect. To the extent needed, these documents will govern the management of safeguards 
issues under the proposed activities.  
 
LACE has demonstrated its commitment to environmental and social safeguards issues.  
Consultations with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other allied environmental 
institutions in Liberia, local government institutions will be a main feature of implementation. To 
ensure further commitment and measurable targets, LACE is being encouraged to ensure that 
monitoring and evaluation indicators reflect the environmental and social issues identified. In 
addition to this commitment, a capacity building through training has also been identified as an 
additional means to support implementation at the community level. Whilst this proposal is 
targeted at community members, it is proposed that the project supports LACE and local 
government staff to undertake some training on environmental and social impact assessments, 
mitigation and management plans. 
 
Page  4
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people: 
 
The preparation and presentation of the ESMF and the RPF were undertaken after consultations 
with project affected community members and other stakeholders from both government and 
non-governmental agencies. Other development partners have been involved in the processes as 
well. The final report reflected the views of some of these stakeholders. In preparation of the 
EIA, a team of consultants supported by LACE visited 20 sub-project sites in Bong, Bomi, 
Nimba, Lofa and Montserrado counties, representing the geographical areas of central, western, 
northern and southern Liberia. The consulting team visited and held meetings with local 
authorities and the cross section of stakeholders such as local leaders, health authorities, NGOs, 
CBOs, Project facilitators, Contractors, PMCs and other community members. It is estimated 
that more than 1,000 people have been reached. The LACE will continue with consultations 
during implementation.
