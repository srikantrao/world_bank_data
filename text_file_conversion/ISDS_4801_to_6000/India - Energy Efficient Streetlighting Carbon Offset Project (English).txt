2.  Project Objectives: 
The proposed development objectives of the Carbon Offset Project are: 
·
Contribute to sustainable development by improving energy efficiency of street lighting 
applications at participating municipalities 
·
Reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide.  
 
The objectives of this World Bank Carbon Offset Project are therefore consistent with the 
developmental and poverty reduction objectives of the Government of India. 
 
3.  Project Description: 
 
The project consists of sale of the first 123,696
1
Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) resulting 
from improvements in the energy efficiency of street lighting at eight municipalities in India, 
(Latur, Akola, Pune, Ajmer MC, Bikaner, Alwar UIT, Alwar MC, and Indore) to the World 
Bank-managed Community Development Carbon Fund.  These projects will be implemented on 
a
build own operate transfer (BOOT) basis through an ESCO shared savings approach.  Project

financing will be provided by the ESCO.  The Municipal Corporations will make regular 
payments to the ESCO that are proportional to the achieved reductions in energy consumption 
for street lighting as specified in the energy saving contract. 
 
The project will produce greenhouse gas reductions through the reduction in fossil fuel-powered 
grid electricity consumption.  Electricity consumption from street lighting applications at 
participating cities will be reduced through the replacement of T12 fluorescent and mercury/ 
sodium vapor fixtures with energy efficient T5 and high pressure sodium lamps with electronic 
ballast and the installation of load management systems for dimming, power factor correction 
and the automatic switch on/off of the switching points.  This will cut consumption by up to 60 
percent with additional financial benefit from reductions in nightly peak demand. 
 
Carbon revenues are crucial for the success of these projects as the financial inflows from sale of 
carbon credits will provide much needed additional financial comfort to the ESCO, as there is 
high repayment risk for these types of projects in India. The revenues from carbon credits will 
ultimately be shared between the ESCO and the municipality, as specified in each individual 
agreement. 
 
Monitoring and evaluation will be undertaken through the specific plan for Verification of 
Emissions Reductions as presented in the clean development mechanism (CDM) Project Design 
Document. AEL will be accountable for overall reporting on implementation progress, 
preparation of financial monitoring reports, and preparation of audited project accounts.    
 
4.  Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The locations for all the sub-projects in this bundle of projects are identified cities 
–
medium to 
large, specifically Latur, Akola, Pune, Ajmer MC, Bikaner, Alwar UIT, Alwar MC, and Indore. 
In addition to safe installation of lamps on high masts, there are safeguard issues related to the 
appropriate collection and disposal of replaced bulbs from street lighting systems, which are 
adequately addressed in each of the cities environmental management manuals.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The proposed project would have an overall positive impact on the environment as is evident 
from the reduction of greenhouse gases. This avoidance would also simultaneously reduce 
generation of local pollutants such as SPM, SOx and NOx to the extent that the provided grid-
power is produced from coal. 
 
The project is expected to have very few adverse impacts on 
the cities’ environment. The key 
environmental issue from this project is ensuring the appropriate disposal of the scrapped light 
bulbs since the old mercury vapor lamps contain potentially hazardous material which needs to 
be properly disposed of. Temporary (limited to the duration of installation and maintenance) 
impacts would require ensuring safety of workers and other road users.  
 
The additional funds that the CDCF will provide shall pay for implementation of a Community 
Benefits Plan which will provide computers, books and electricity-inverters to poor urban 
primary schools in slum areas in the eight cities.  The Plan, with a budget of approximately 
US$30,000 per annum, will be implemented by AEL, and no significant environment and social 
impacts or any land acquisition result from implementation. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area: 
 
The Project will create direct and indirect positive impacts on the local environment and local 
communities owing to the reduction of greenhouse gases and local pollutants such as SPM, SOx 
and NOx.  No potential indirect and/or long term negative impacts are anticipated. 
 
Page  4
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts: 
 
The project supports the use of a more efficient technology that will allow the same level of 
illumination while reducing the consumption of electricity and related emissions of GHG and 
other local pollutants. Alternatively, cities could have continued to replace and expand their 
lighting services with the technology currently in use.  
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
The project sponsor has been proactive in managing the minimal potential adverse short-term 
and long-term impacts by preparing and agreeing a concise environmental management manual 
for the operation with each city where the project is to be implemented. The environmental 
management manual covers the occupational safety of workers, safety and access during the 
operation for other road users, and also provides guidance for handling chance finds in the very 
few cases where additional poles may have to be erected. The manual prescribes temporary 
storage of lamps that have been removed and replaced by CFL as well as CFL lamps that have 
bee damaged or have completed their useful life. This has been done to avoid indiscriminate 
disposal since that could lead to contamination of land/water by residual metal coating. This 
arrangement would be continued until the regulation currently being discussed between the 
Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, and Bureau of Energy Efficiency, 
Government of India is finalizing and will eventually promulgate for CFL lamps being 
introduced all over the country. Provisions of the regulations will thereafter govern handling and 
disposal. The sponsor has designated their own site in-charges to ensure safe installation and 
maintenance operations. AEL have agreed with the respective city’s officials on the storage of 
the old lamps. For lamps that are damaged, and /or out-of-use lamps during the O&M period, the 
company has made the Service in-charge for each city, responsible for the storage until the GoI 
regulations are in place.  
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people: 
 
The key stakeholders are officials, staff involved in the installation, and the general public using 
the streets/roads in the participating cities. The environmental manual prepared by AEL has been 
translated into the local language, discussed with the stakeholders including municipal officials 
in each city, and disclosed in each of the cities as well as on the project sponsor’s website.
