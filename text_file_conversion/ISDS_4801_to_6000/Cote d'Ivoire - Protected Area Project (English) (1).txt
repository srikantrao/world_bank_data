B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective and design of the proposed project is based on gaps and needs identified to ensure 
that CÃ´te d’Ivoire has an efficient and sustainable managementframework for the conservation 
and rational use of priority national PAs that will enable the preservation of biodiversity and 
ecological processes and halt the trend of biodiversity losses. The project will directly contribute 
towards the governments national priorities.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Component 1: “Institutional Strengthening for Protected Area Management and Oversight” 
addresses the need to ensure that adequate individual, institutional andsystemic capacities are in 
place to manage protected areas at national and regional levels. Currently, the OIPR has only 150 
staff, with most of them in need of training. Additional staff recruitments will be required. GEF 
funds will be used for the urgent capacity building (equipment, training) needs. Training will 
include strengthening the scientific and technical knowledge base, financial and administrative 
management, information and communications technology, developing improved tools for 
monitoring & an effective biodiversity information management system, etc. The component 
Page  2
will also focus on training staff in the development and implementation of stakeholder 
consultation and participation strategies in PA management.  
 
Component 2: “Improving Management of Selected Protected Areas” addresses the issue of 
biodiversity conservation more directly by financing the design and implementation of 
participatory management plans for the PAs.  Given the long history of conflict that forced 
communities to use PAs for their survival, it is now clear that new models of PA management 
must be used in order to ensure that communities, who used these protected resources during the 
conflict years, are not alienated but rather form an integral part of park and reserve management.  
To this end, GEF funding and co-financing funds will support the development and 
implementation of alternative management approaches to biodiversity conservation 
(participatory management plans), identify feasible sustainable economic subprojects or 
livelihood options (e.g. mushroom rearing, bee-keeping, snail raising and small scale wood-lots 
in the pilot implementation areas where communities will be asked to forego illegal hunting or 
cultivation within the PAs etc.), and raise environmental awareness through communication 
campaigns.  
 
Component 3: “Support to Operationalize the Foundation for Parks and Reserves” addresses the 
problem of mobilizing and retaining funds for sustainable biodiversity management.  The project 
focuses on supporting an existing private foundation which needs to be revitalized for enhancing 
its credibility and effectiveness on the ground. Its role will be to attract and invest financial 
resources from donors and private companies, essentially to raise adequate capitalization funds 
and guarantee a continuous stream of financial resources specifically for PA management.  To 
start this process, all project funds will go through the Foundation to be channelled to the 
L’OIPR. GEF will support activities for the revitalization of the Foundation including a review 
of its current status and its needs. It will also provided training to Foundation staff in financial 
management, record-keeping, etc. Further, it will support the design of a fund raising strategy 
and launch of a fundraising campaign, allowing the Foundation and its partners to more 
effectively raise funds to leverage matching funds to complement contributions for PA 
management.  
 
Component 4: “Project Management”. This component will ensure (i) effective project 
management and (ii) develop a strong M&E system. It will establish a national, regional and 
local PA  monitoring and evaluation system which relies on inputs from the communities, 
regional OIPR staff and national staff to provide reliable information for tracking results, 
drawing lessons and informing decisions. Specifically, GEF and donor funds will support the 
development of biodiversity monitoring tools; (ii) appoint local biodiversity monitors of flagship 
and other species; (iii) appoint an M&E specialist at the level of the OIPR; (iv) install MIS (v) 
train participants on its use.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Ivory Coast- north east and in Abidjan   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Good capacity to do and understand EA work if it is not unduly complicated. The OIPR is 
comprised largely of foresters and so that capacity exists. In terms of Social assessment work- 
Page  3
the community aspects will be managed by WWF and they will employ a full time social 
specialist.

There will be roads rehabiliation/repair to be undertaken. Possible adverse effects include 
dust,noise, soil erosion along tracts, especially in case of lack of maintenance or poor drainage, 
destruction of plant species in habitats, destruction of vegetation and increased attacks on 
wildlife by vehicle particularly if not accompanied by increased surveillance.  There are some 
minor possible adverse effects associated with signage-including destruction of habitat and soil 
impaction.
