B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The broad objectives of the National Social Protection Strategy are to reduce poverty and 
inequality and promote human capital investments among poor families through the provision of 
direct monetary transfers and incentives for investing in human capital. World Bank assistance 
under the proposed project would aim to contribute to these ultimate objectives of poverty 
reduction and human capital development among poor families.  
 
Within that broader context, the objective of the proposed APL is to strengthen the ability of the 
FSP and CSP programs to 
play an effective role in the countryï¿½s strategy to reduce poverty 
and inequality and to foster investments in humancapital, as well as to assist the GoP in the 
development of a minimum package of social care services for the poor structured around these 
programs .  
 
Specifically, phase 1 of the APL would support the effective strengthening and implementation 
of the FSP and CSP programs and of a minimum package of social care services.  
ï¿½Effectivenessï¿½ would be assessed in terms of: (i) the targeting, coverage, and adequacy of 
the benefits/services; (ii) efficacy of the CSP conditionalities (co-responsibilities) to foster 
Page  2
investment by beneficiary families in human capital; and (iii) the capacities of involved 
institutions (including ministries, program staff, service providers, and beneficiary groups) to 
manage these programs efficiently, to monitor results, and to (begin to) evaluate impacts.  
 
Phase 2 of the APL would consolidate and deepen the reforms, further perfecting the design of 
the 
programs based on experience under phase 1. Such ï¿½second generation reformsï¿½ might 
include measures to enable scaling up/down depending on country conditions, further 
strengthening of M&E, additional administrative efficiency gains, possible development of 
complementary social protection instruments/services for poor people who are highly vulnerable 
but do not have children (and thus are not eligible for the co-responsibility requirements of the 
CSP); and development of mechanisms to enhance prospects for self-sufficiency 
(ï¿½graduationï¿½) of poor families.  
 
Triggers. Triggers for moving to the second phase of the APL would include attainment of a 
number of targets:  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of coverage (e.g., TBD% of extreme poor families/vulnerable individuals 
reached).  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of the strengthening of the system for targeting (e.g., TBD% of beneficiaries 
having been certified under new targeting tool and meeting eligibility conditions.)  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of strengthened institutional framework and capacities (e.g., MIS operational 
and generating adequate reports, first phase of impact evaluation completed.)  
 
Indicators. To assess whether the project has achieved its objective of transforming the FSP and 
CSP into effective (C)CT programs (as defined above), the following indicators would be 
monitored:  
 
ï¿½ 
Coverage (TBD% of extreme poor families receiving cash transfers).  
 
ï¿½ 
Targeting (TBD% of transfers going to poorest 20 percent of population).  
 
ï¿½ 
Improvements in enrollment/attendance rates among primary age school childrenin 
extremely poor beneficiary families.  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of quality of service.  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of beneficiary satisfaction.  
 
Similarly to assess whether the project has achieved the objective of developing and effectively 
implementing a minimum package of social care services, the following indicators would be 
monitored:  
 
ï¿½ 
Coverage (TBD% of poor vulnerable individuals receiving social care services).  
 
ï¿½ 
Targeting (TBD% of service users in poorest 20 percent of population).  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of quality of service.  
 
ï¿½ 
Measures of beneficiary satisfaction.  
 
Achievement of these goalsï¿½and the ability to monitor them adequatelyï¿½will be evidence 
of improvement in the institutional framework and capacities for the program.  
 
Progress towards the ultimate objectives of poverty reduction and human capital accumulation 
will be difficult to assess and to attribute to the program during the project lifespan with 
statistical rigor. Nonetheless, the project will include both baseline and follow-up work to 
Page  3
evaluate program impact on educational performance, in addition to building upon the results of 
the first phase of the impact evaluation of the CSP pilot.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
To achieve the objective described above, the project will include activities aimed at reaching the 
very poor (i.e., the poorest 10-15 percent of the population), designing and implementing a 
minimum assistance package for this group, and, more generally, strengthening the overall 
capacity of the government for the effective provision and implementation of social protection. 
In particular the project will be structured around three components:  
 
A
Design and implementation of an effective targeting mechanism for social protection 
interventions. The project will provide technical and financial support for the development of a 
targeting instrument for the FSP and CSP programs, as well as other social programs. Activities 
under this component will include:  
 
(i) 
Technical assistance to the design of targeting tool;  
 
(ii) 
Technical validation, including discussions with government representatives and others 
as well as piloting of new instrument;  
 
(iii) Implementation. 
 
 
B
Design and implementation of a minimum assistance package for the very poor, with a 
focus on cash transfers and social care services. With respect to cash transfers, the project will 
support ongoing reform efforts within PBM, including the strengthening of the FSP and the 
implementation of the CSP. With respect to social care services, the project will support 
innovations in delivery models in order to increase effectiveness and impact and to promote 
complementarities between such services and cash transfers. Activities under this component 
will include:  
 
(iv) 
Development of effective mechanisms in PBM for program management, including, 
entry (enrollment) and exit, monitoring of conditionalities under CSP, and benefit payment;  
 
(v) 
Design and implementation of innovation fund or similar mechanism for the delivery of 
social services to poor households;  
 
(vi) 
Development of a communications and social accountability strategy to improve 
beneficiariesï¿½ understanding about rights and responsibilities under variousprograms, and 
their capacities to hold service institutions accountable.  
 
C
Institutional capacity building. The project will support activities aimed at strengthening 
supervision and implementation capacity at the federal, provincial and district levels, as well as 
at articulating policy making across these three levels of government around the National Social 
Protection Strategy. Particular emphasis will be put on the development of effective monitoring 
and evaluation systems, including Management Information Systems. Activities under this 
component will include:  
 
(vii) 
Assessment of existing capacity and technical assistance needs;  
 
(viii)  Strengthening of the institutional and legal architecture of the MoSWSE and PBM in 
order to reflect their responsibilities and goals and to clarify relationships with, among others, the 
financial institution(s) in charge of benefit payment, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of 
Education, and the provincial ministries;  
 
(ix) 
Strengthening of MoSWSE and PBM staffï¿½s technical capacity, including training 
needs assessment and provision, and establishment of performance evaluation system;  
Page  4
(x) 
Strengthening of inter-
sectoral coordination, including for monitoring/enforcing ï¿½co-
responsibilitiesï¿½ in education, as well as coordination across the federal, provincial and local 
level actors;  
 
(xi) 
Design and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system, including:  (a) 
strengthening the PBMï¿½s management information system (MIS) so that it can provide up-to-
date information on program inputs, activities, and outputs; (b) a strategy for comprehensive and 
periodic evaluations to measure the impact of FSP and CSP on development outcomes, including 
targeting and efficacy of co-responsibilities, as well as less proximate outcomes such as 
improvements in education and other social indicators; and (c) a strategy for comprehensive and 
periodic evaluations to measure the impact of the minimum social care service package.  
 
The team is currently considering the potential inclusion of a fourth component that would 
directly finance both cash transfers and social care services on a performance-based manner. The 
team would like to receive management guidance on this issue, however, prior to any discussions 
with the GoP. The main rationale for the inclusion of such component would be to strengthen the 
alignment of incentives between the Ministry of Finance and the MoSWSE regarding project and 
program implementation.
