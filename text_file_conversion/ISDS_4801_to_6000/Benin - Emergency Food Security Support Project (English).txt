2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is to increase domestic production of maize and rice, in order to 
mitigate the short-term impact of increasing prices on households and to expand food 
crop farmers’ access to agricultural inputs in the medium- and long-terms.   
 
3. Project Description 
Component 1: Provision of fertilizer to enhance domestic food production in the short-
term (US$8.2 million) This component aims to stimulate the crop supply response within 
the next two years. It will finance procurement, transport, and storage services for the 
delivery of 8,500 tons of fertilizer  to about 50,000 producers of rice (1,250 tons) and 
maize (7,250 tons), in 2009. This support will cover about 54,000 hectares of cereal crops 
(5,660 hectares of rice and 48,340 hectares of maize), and generate an additional 
production of about 60,000 tons of cereals (6,000 tons of rice and 54,000 tons of maize). 
A
total amount of US$8.2 million will be utilized in this operation. About 60 percent of 
this amount (US$4.8 million) should be recovered by the Government, and could be used 
in 2010, for the provision of 5,100 tons of fertilizers to about 30,000 producers. This 
activity could generate an additional 36,000 tons of cereals from 32,400 hectares.

Component 2: Support to Project Management Unit (PMU) and design of new 
institutional mechanisms for the delivery of inputs to food crop farmers (US$0.5 million) 
Under this component, the project aims to strengthen the management and operational 
capacity of the TWG, which has been established by the GOB to coordinate its response 
to the food price emergency. The Grant will finance consultant services, training, 
acquisition of equipment and office supplies, and other costs to provide institutional 
support to the TWG and transform it into an effective PMU for this Grant . This will 
include: (i) strengthening monitoring activities and (ii) building capacity for procurement 
and financial management.  
 
This component will also help the country design the innovative institutional (market-
based) mechanisms required to ensure the delivery of fertilizer, certified seeds, and other 
agricultural goods and services to producers. This will include (i) a review of the current 
emergency delivery mechanism, including the management of the fertilizer recovery 
funds and (ii) examples of good practices in the region.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Priority will be given to producers in the valleys of the main rivers (Oueme, Mono, 
Kouffo, Niger) that would ensure increased production through better irrigation.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
From an environmental and social safeguard standpoint, EFSSP is a Category B project.  
This suggests that environmental and social impacts of the project, for the most part, will 
be minimal, site-specific and manageable to an acceptable level. This emergency 
operation triggers two safeguard policies: The Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 
4.01) and the Pest Management Policy (OP 4.09), predicated on program objectives to 
Page  3
increase agricultural production and productivity with the provision of large quantities of 
fertilizer to rice and maize producers.  
 
To ensure that the project is environmentally sustainable and that any possible negative 
environmental or social impact is minimized and mitigated, an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) is being prepared to be used by PMU after approval by 
ASPEN. The ESMF will provide guidelines and procedures for environmental and social 
screening, designed to help avoid, mitigate or minimize impacts resulting from 
unbalanced use of agrochemicals. Close attention will be paid to safe storage and 
handling of fertilizers, as part of the safeguard review. The ESMF will include a chapter 
dealing with Pest and Pesticide Management issues. This chapter will not be a full-
pledged Pest Management Plan (PMP), but a plan, which addresses the selection, safe 
use, storage and disposal of pesticides and their package materials in order to avoid 
health impacts on farmers and their families and avoid impacts on the environment.  
 
Farmers will be trained in pest and pesticide management issues. One of the PMU staff 
will be responsible for the implementation of the ESMF. The ESMF will also discuss 
institutional arrangements, with clear roles and responsibilities for screening program 
activities, preparing and approving appropriate sub-project safeguard instruments, and 
implementing and monitoring required measures.  Finally, the ESMF will devise any 
capacity strengthening and awareness raising measures deemed necessary for relevant 
stakeholder groups. As such, it is both a planning tool and a way to maximize the positive 
effects of this operation.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There is no major indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated activities in the 
project area.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The risks associated with pesticide and fertilizer use may be mitigated through proper 
instruction of beneficiaries on how to safely use such inputs, the increased quantities of 
pesticides that will be needed, and how to mitigate potential harmful effects, and to this 
end a section of the ESMF will discuss these aspects. The CERPA (Centres RÃ©gionaux 
de Promotion Agricole) and CECPA (Centres Communaux de Promotion Agricole), the 
regional and local extension agencies of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and 
Fisheries, as well as the producer organizations have a good experience in implementing 
such safeguard measures in the cotton sector.   
 
Page  4
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The safeguard instruments will be prepared following a broad-based consultation 
framework involving the CERPA and CECPA, the regional and local extension agencies 
of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, as well as the producer 
organizations in the targeted areas. The ESMF including pest and pesticides management 
issues will be prepared in full compliance with national and Bank safeguard policies. 
Prior to disclosure in-country and at Bank InfoShop, a workshop will be held with 
relevant stakeholders to share study findings and gather the views of the participants, as 
well as a way to foster their ownership of project safeguards implementation.  
 
The preparation of the ESMF will be completed by December 15, 2008. The ESMF will 
then be disclosed in-country and at Bank InfoShop upon approval by ASPEN and 
national safeguard Unit (ABE). The study will be carried out by the Recipient, with the 
possible assistance of some consultants.
