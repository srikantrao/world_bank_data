B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The original objective of the Education for All Project is to establish a sustainable framework for 
good quality basic education. The project has three components: (i) expanding access to 
education; (ii) improving quality of education; and (iii) strengthening capacity for decentralized 
management.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The additional financing would complement Component 3 by contributing to an uninterrupted 
delivery of education service by strengthening the overall human resource and budgetary 
management. The US$10 million additional financing would contribute to the financing of 
salaries of at least 20,000 teachers for a period of four months (September-December 2008).  
 
The financing of these recurrent expenditures is necessary to meet the development objectives 
of the pro
ject. Guinea’s current Country Financing Parameters note that there is no country limit 
for recurrent costs (OP 6.00).

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Government of Guinea is familiar with the Bank safeguard policies, based on experience 
with other Bank-funded projects.  
 
While the original project is category B, the additional financing is a Category C project and 
does not trigger any safeguards measures. No Environmental Assessment or Management 
Framework is required.
