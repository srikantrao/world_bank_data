2. Project Objectives 
The Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), a multi-donor trust fund 
(program) administered by the World Bank, will fund an output-based aid (OBA) scheme 
for Kampala’s urban water supply and sanitation sector.  The scheme will be 
implemented by Uganda’s National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), also the 
grant recipient.  The project will provide yard tap and public water point (PWP) 
connections to Kampala’s urban poor using performance-based subsidies, whereby 
NWSC will pre-finance the connections, and once the connections are independently 
verified to be working, of appropriate quality, and targeted to the poor, then GPOBA will 
disburse payments to NWSC. The OBA scheme will provide for a one off connection 
payment (“subsidy”) to partly defray the costs of making these new metered connections. 
This is an important pilot for OBA, as it is being conducted with a purely (100% 
government-owned) public utility, and is therefore particularly innovative, and hopefully 
will provide interesting lessons for future replication.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project aims to provide subsidized connections to the existing water supply network 
to poor households living in the slums and poor peri-urban areas in and around Kampala. 
Page  2
The type of targeting is to be done by areas (i.e. geographic). Further, the project will 
only subsidize outdoor yard taps and public water points, which the poor are more likely 
to use (and the non-poor not as likely to use).  
 
The total project envisages making about 20,000 new connections over a four-year 
period.  Of these connections, about 19,000 will be yard taps.  
 
As part of the project’s implementation, an Urban Pro-Poor Unit has been set upto 
coordinate effective implementation of services in low income areas.  This unit is 
specialized in dealing with the poor, and will help ensure that appropriate capacity is 
provided regarding:  demand management; payment of bills; sanitation, health and 
hygiene considerations; etc.  NWSC will be responsible for ensure that all fiduciary 
aspects of the project are met, including the environment and social requirements 
outlined in the ESMF and RPF.  
 
In addition, an impact evaluation will be undertaken to determine the actual health, 
education, and income benefits of the project, to be funded separately by GPOBA.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
This project will involve extensions from the existing piped network in Kampala, into the 
poorest parts of Kampala.  The project will not fund the extension of any primary and 
secondary networks, as for the most part these already exist:  the project areas were 
selected based on where there are existing networks.  Production capacity is sufficient, 
especially given the recent completion of the GABA3 water treatment facility, which was 
developed prior to and regardless of this GPOBA pilot being undertaken.   
 
As described above, as part of the project's implementation, an Urban Pro-Poor Unit has 
been set up within NWSC to coordinate effective implementation of services in low 
income areas. This unit is specialized in dealing with the poor, and will help ensure that 
appropriate capacity is provided regarding: demand management; payment of bills; 
sanitation, health and hygiene considerations, etc. NWSC will also be responsible for 
ensuring that all fiduciary requirements (especially environment and social safeguards 
aspects) of the project are met in the approval, contracting, and monitoring and in 
accordance with the procedures outlined in the ESMF and RPF.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
OP/BP 4.01 and OP/BP 4.12 were triggered by the project, although in both cases, the 
risk was seen as minimal, and existing procedures used by the highly reputed NWSC 
were seen as adequate to meet the safeguards requirements.  
 
Environmental Assessment  
 
No potential large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are expected.  The main 
safeguard issue with regards to OP/BP 4.01 was construction/site location impacts.  
Therefore detailed 
–
and existing – construction guidelines are provided in the ESMF 
report.  The construction guidelines describe how to deal with many aspects of 
environmental safeguards, including (but not limited to):  
 
•
Site establishment and management (pollution and noise control, hazardous 
chemicals, soil erosion, traffic management,)  
 
•
house-keeping,  
 
•
fire-risk and burning,  
 
•
destruction of plants and trees,  
 
•
disturbance of animals,  
 
•
control of damage to soil or water,  
 
•
worker safety, and  
 
•
drinking water quality.  
 
Social Assessment  
 
Involuntary resettlement is not expected to be associated with this project.  For public 
water points, all connections will be made in local public spaces in the form of public 
water points, with the consent of communities after community consultation has taken 
place.  In the case of yard taps, connections will only be made if the connection is 
demanded by the household who will be responsible for paying the bills for the water 
supplied.  Therefore the project is purely demand driven.  
Page  4
However, there may be temporary disruption to household activities, and in some cases 
there may be property damage.  Therefore, an RPF was requested, and prepared by the 
Recipient.  The Recipient will use well tested and locally appropriate procedures that are 
already in place.  The Urban Pro-Poor Unit will ensure that the potential beneficiaries are 
well apprised of their rights, and are able to achieve maximum benefit from this GPOBA-
funded project.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Environmental 
–
As described above, the main adverse impacts may occur only dueto 
mismanagement during construction period.  The ESMF provides Construction 
Guidelines for the project to follow.  These are the normal construction guidelines 
followed by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation for all of its donor-funded 
projects.  
 
Social – No land acquisition is expected, and as all of the connections are external yard 
taps or public water points, which either the household must demand (in the case of yard 
taps) or the community must agree to (in the case of PWPs), involuntary land acquisition 
is not expected under any circumstance.  Nevertheless, as there may be some occasions of 
temporary disruption, NWSC will use its normal course of action to inform, discuss and 
compensate those affected, as described in the RPF.  This is normal NWSC policy, and is 
well-documented and inclusive.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The construction guidelines (included as part of the ESMF) used by the Recipient are 
extensive, and describe how to deal with many aspects of environmental safeguards, 
including (but not limited to):  
 
•
Site establishment and management (pollution and noise control, hazardous 
chemicals, soil erosion, traffic management,)  
 
•
house-keeping,  
 
•
fire-risk and burning,  
 
•
destruction of plants and trees,  
 
•
disturbance of animals,  
 
•
control of damage to soil or water,  
 
•
worker safety, and  
 
•
drinking water quality.  
 
The RPF clearly explains the extensive existing policy on how any claim can be placed 
with NWSC regarding property damage or disruption.  There is an well-laid out 
procedure to discuss claims, based on local practice, but well documented and structured 
Page  5
to ensure proper and fair consultation and compensation.  Claim forms and receipt of 
compensation forms are provided as part of the RPF.  
 
The Recipient has prepared the ESMF and RPF with its own staff and own funds.  The 
Recipient has provided detailed information on existing guidelines for construction and 
social policies, and included these in the ESMF and RPF.  The Recipient has placed these 
reports locally at several prominent locations to ensure maximum disclosure.  The 
Recipient is also providing workshops from its own funds to ensure that users are fully-
apprised on the potential benefits of the project, and related health, hygiene and sanitation 
issues.  
 
Further, GPOBA is providing funds for workshops to ensure additional capacity in 
terms of sanitation and hygiene to ensure maximum benefit of the water connections, as 
well as on the implications of the RPF.  
 
As described above, as part of the project’s implementation, an Urban Pro-Poor Unit has 
been set up within NWSC to coordinate effective implementation of services in low 
income areas.  This unit is specialized in dealing with the poor, and will help ensure that 
appropriate capacity is provided regarding:  demand management; payment of bills; 
sanitation, health and hygiene considerations; etc.  NWSC will be responsible for ensure 
that all fiduciary aspects of the project are met, including the environment and social 
requirements outlined in the ESMF and RPF.  
 
NWSC is regarded as one of the best public utilities in Sub-Saharan Africa, and has very 
high capacity.  The Urban Poor Unit is well staffed and highly dedicated to its mission of 
ensuring that the poor can benefit from the network water supply, and that the rights and 
capacities of the poor are taken well into account in project design and implementation.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
1) The National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) is the national utility 
providing water and sewerage services in Uganda’s main cities, and is 100% 
government-owned.  
 
2) The Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) is responsible for overall water and 
sanitation environment concerns, and sits on the Board of the NWSC.  All NWSC 
activities that impact the environment are discussed with the MWE as required under 
Ugandan law.  
 
3) Local communities play a key role in this project, in particular when it comes to  
 
a) 
dispute resolution that can be resolved through mediation, and  
 
b)
the establishment of public water points, for their use and management within the 
community.  
 
Page  6
Local communities are usually represented by a “community liaison officer” or, on a 
larger scale, a “parish leader”.  
 
4) Households are key to the project, as all yard taps must be “owned” by a household 
that will be responsible for paying the bills.  The project is completely demand driven:  
only after a household demands the connection and is able to pay the user connection fee 
will a household receive a connection.  
 
The project beneficiaries – the poor households and community leaders themselves – are 
directly included in the consultation process both prior to the project’s implementation, 
and throughout the project’s implementation.  Most importantly, these beneficiaries will 
be consulted long into the future once the project has closed, as this is the role of the 
Urban Pro-Poor Unit.  
 
The project beneficiaries have good access to the safeguard documents, and will be 
actively encouraged to attend the workshops funded provided by NWSC and GPOBA.
