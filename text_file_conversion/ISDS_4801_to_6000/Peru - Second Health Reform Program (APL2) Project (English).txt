C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
This proposed second phase APL would have four components and total project costs of 
US$162.4 million.  This project has been jointly prepared with the IADB.  The GoP has 
requested that the Bank and IADB finance up to US$15 million each, with the remainder to be 
covered by other fiscal resources.  The project will be implemented in the same departments as 
under the APL I (i.e. Amazonas, Hu√°nuco, Huancavelica, Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac, Cusco and 
Puno) plus two additional regions: Cajamarca and Ucayali. These departments were prioritized 
because IMR and MMR still remain well above the national average, and thus need further 
project intervention.  Disbursement for this project will be based on standard mechanisms for 
investment projects as requested by the GoP and the categories under which funding will cover 
components were prepared by the borrower.  
 
Component 1. Improving health practices at the household level for women and children under 
age three in rural areas of the nine targeted Departments (US$6.0 million). This component will 
finance three lines of actions:  
 
Subcomponent 1.1. The design, implementation, and monitoring of a Behavioral Change 
Communication and Education Program (BCCEP). The BCCEP aims to promote healthy 
practices at the household level, including increase demand for health services, with a focus on 
mothers during pre- and post-natal periods and children under three, taking into consideration the 
cultural context of rural and indigenous populations.  
 
To achieve this objective, the activities to be financed include: (i) studies to identify current 
practices, beliefs and attitudes, including the use of health services; (ii) 9 tailored BCCEP 
strategies (by region); (iii) development, validation, and production of culturally sensitive printed 
and audio-visual materials (radio spots, soap operas, videos, etc.); (iv) basic training and 
dissemination equipment (PCs, data display devices, TVs, DVD); (v) training of MINSA, 
DIRESAs staff, as well as staff, networks, micro-networks, and community agents for the local 
implementation of the BCCEP; (vi) a training program for local authorities, community leaders, 
social and civil society organization; (v) learning workshops and study tours; (vi) technical 
assistance to health staff and community members on the implementation of the BCCEP; (vi) 
monitoring and evaluation of the BCCEP; (viii) evidence-based studies for health promotion in 
maternal and neonatal health care.  In addition, a competitive fund of approximately US$1 
million (to be financed under the IADB loan), would be established to finance local initiatives to 
improve healthy communities.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2. The provision of national identity cards to unregistered pregnant women. 
This sub-component aims to support the GoP in enrolling eligible women and their children for 
SIS benefits. The lack of national identification documents is a serious obstacle to accessing 
social programs: the problem is especially serious in indigenous rural areas. In the country, 
almost 10% of adult population is undocumented, and women who lack a Documento Nacional 
de Identidad (DNI) may lose access to health insurance (SIS), as well as to other social 
protection and development opportunities. Therefore, the Project will support the provision of 
DNI to unregistered pregnant women.  
 
Page  3
Specifically, the project would finance: (i) the design and implementation of a campaign 
promoting identity rights. This campaign would facilitate the work to be carried out by civil 
servants in charge of the delivering of the DNI; (ii) the design, production and dissemination of 
materials promoting identity rights for all nine Departments; (iii) training of health staff and local 
authorities on the promotion of identity rights; and (iv) minor rehabilitation investments to 
facilitate the installation of RENIEC or local government registrars in local health facilities 
which have birthing services.  
 
Component 2. Increasing the capacity to provide better maternal and child health services for 
the poor (US $142.3 million). This component would strengthen the health delivery model 
through improving the capacity of health service networks to attend obstetric and neonatal 
emergencies, to improve the integration between pre-natal and post-natal care, and health care 
for children under three.  The component would support:  
 
Subcomponent 2.1. Improvement in the quality of services in health facilities. This would 
include: (i) minor constructions, rehabilitation, and equipment investments for the networks in 
the Departments supported by the Project, related to the improvement of the 8 essential obstetric 
care functions, and one neonatal service ; (ii) technical assistance and training for health 
personnel; (iii) inclusion of an intercultural focus in service provision; and (iv) a fund to support 
innovative proposals to finance local initiatives for health services provision (to be financed by 
the IADB)..  
 
Subcomponent 2.2. Raising the efficiency and effectiveness of networks. The main purpose of 
this subcomponent is to improve the new health delivery model to be implemented under the 
project. The table below explains the differences between the old and new health model for 
mother and child care.  
 
This would include: (i) strengthening management systems at the network level; (ii) improving 
the referral and counter-referral system, (iii) supporting the implementation of health care chains 
for maternal and neonatal service referrals and clinical agreements between providers, (iv) 
clinical governance studies, and (v) regulation of the health networks and maternal health care 
chains.  
 
Component 3.  Strengthening government capacities to offer more equitable and efficient health 
system in a decentralized environment (US$5.2 million). This component would work towards 
the strengthening of MINSA, and the decentralization of the health system through:  
 
Subcomponent 3.1. Regulatory framework in support of service quality.  The PARSALUD 
results-based model entails innovations that require regulatory reforms in order to ensure that 
they are incorporated into the institution and are sustainable. Technical assistance will be 
provided in order to support the integrated health model and the development of support systems. 
These include the development of the regulatory framework and implementation plan for: (i) the 
accreditation and certification system, currently proposed by the law but not regulated, (ii) 
infrastructure maintenance systems, (iii) a reference laboratory system, (iv) hemotherapy (v) 
hospital financing, (vi) pharmaceutical purchasing and logistics system, and (vii) a health 
communication and promotion system.  
Page  4
Subcomponent 3.2. Strengthening of SIS.   The Project would support SIS to develop the public 
insurance system. This would entail technical assistance for: (i) the development of the 
regulatory framework, improvement of the SIS information system, aimed at better monitoring 
enrollment, coverage and access in the Departments initially included in the project, (ii) quality 
assurance mechanisms, and technical assistance for the implementation of the SISFOH targeting 
system to ensure adequate targeting of health insurance financing in urban areas.  
 
Subcomponent 3.3. Systems development to enhance the monitoring capacity of MINSA.  This 
set of activities would support the improved implementation of existing systems, namely SIS 
(see above), SISMED, and SIGA, all of which can produce monitoring data and thus introduce 
greater accountability into the system.  This is particularly important for the MINSA 
decentralization process, whereby the sector is moving towards a greater regulatory role and the 
Departments will be taking on greater responsibility for implementation.  
 
Subcomponent 3.4. Support to decentralization.   The Project would support the continued 
implementation of Management Agreements (MA) now in place, as instruments for supervision 
and accountability between the central regulatory level and the Departments, which are 
responsible for service provision. To this end, the project would provide direct technical 
assistance and training to MINSA and regional staff in order to implement the MAs.  In addition, 
the Project will support the design of an incentive/penalty system that will ensure that the MAs 
are effective instruments.  
 
Component 4. Project Coordination (US$ 8.9 million)  
 
This component would finance activities related to the administration of the project, such as: (i) 
The financing of external concurrent auditors, (ii) monitoring and evaluation activities, and (iii) 
project management and procurement team within MINSA.  
 
The unit in charge of this project would be the PARSALUD unit which would operate as a PCU 
under an operations manual agreed with the Bank.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will be implemented in the same regions as under the APL I (i.e. Amazonas, 
Hu√°nuco, Huancavelica, Ayacucho, Apur√≠mac, Cusco and Puno, the poorest Departments of 
the country) plus two additional regions: Cajamarca and Ucayali. These last two areas were 
prioritized because despite some advances in the reduction of the IMR and MMR, these 
indicators still remain well above the national average. The population in these areas is primarily 
indigenous, rural, and disperses, and speaks native languages, with the exception of Cajamarca, 
where most of the population speaks Spanish.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The borrower's institutions are fully prepared to apply the safeguard policies.  The PARSALUD I 
ICR reported that during APL I various supervision teams regularly monitored the compliance 
with the environmental regulations and appropriate procedures for handling and managing 
medical waste at the participating health facilities, finding no relevant issues. In addition, 
Page  5
PARSALUD I addressed key issues linked to Indigenous peoples through a number of activities 
related to the cultural adaptation of maternal and child health services, including the provision of 
the delivery in vertical position in indigenous areas, as well as training of health professionals in 
local culture and language. The ICR further reported that the project complied with OP 4.01 
(environmental assessment) and OP. 4.10 (indigenous peoples). PARSALUD II will build upon 
lesson learned on PARSALUD I.  
 
In addition, due to Peruís large indigenous composition, and political will of inclusion 
reinforced in previous years, the country and the health sector have accumulated extensive 
experience working on Indigenous populationsí cultural adequacy. In this regard, the project has 
prepared a state of the art Communication and Health Promotion Strategy that addresses cultural 
differences, with strong emphasis on indigenous behaviors, beliefs, and practices of maternal and 
child health care.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
An environmental assessment (EA) concluded that wastes are expected to be generated from 
minor construction works and rehabilitation of health facilities that the project will intervene, as 
well as additional health care waste (HCW) generated from the increased demand of health 
services.  
 
The EA addresses issues and required environmental management and mitigation measures 
associated with the project, with an emphasis on Component 2. It identifies lines of action for 
every objective, and identifies anticipated impacts associated with each type of activity, by type, 
duration, geographical area, and magnitude.  The EA also analyzes and recommends appropriate 
technologies for the disposal of HCW that comply with national medical waste regulations.  
 
The EA further provides approximate costs for wastewater and hazardous solid waste 
treatment by type of health establishment. The EA proposes a Solid and Liquid Waste 
Management System which (i) establishes basic procedures in each of the management stages for 
HCW produced in health facilities and to proposes best practices for implementation; (ii) defines 
monitoring and evaluation processes for the management of HCW produced in the intervened 
health facilities; and (iii) estimates the costs and capacity building strategies for the 
implementation of the Solid and Liquid Waste Management System, including intercultural and 
regional adaptations (mountains, jungle, rural or urban). The EA covered the Project as a whole, 
not only to the part financed by the Bank, as this is a requirement of Peruís legislation.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 X  
This OP is not triggered because the project does not include interventions in protected 
natural areas or areas vulnerable to disasters.

Yes No TBD 
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
This OP is not triggered because the project does not foresee any fumigation regarding 
tropical and vector control diseases. All interventions are related to the maternal and child health 
care.   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
 X  
This OP is not triggered because the project does not include interventions in areas with 
archeological heritage, architectural history or national monuments.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
On the basis of a Social Assessment through consultations carried out with indigenous 
communities in two occasions in the Andean areas (Tambo in Ayacucho and Sicuani in Cusco) 
and in the Amazons areas (Pucallpa in Ucayali and Nieve in the Department of Amazonas), an 
Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) was developed in June 2006, and discussed with the population. 
This Plan includes (i) findings from the social assessment, (ii) description of the free, prior and 
informed consultation process, (iii) an action plan of actions that ensure that indigenous peoples 
receive culturally-sensitive and appropriate health services, (iv) procedures for the resolution of 
grievances arising from project implementation, and (v) monitoring and evaluation mechanisms 
for the implementation of the action plan. A detailed budget will be defined during the appraisal 
mission.
