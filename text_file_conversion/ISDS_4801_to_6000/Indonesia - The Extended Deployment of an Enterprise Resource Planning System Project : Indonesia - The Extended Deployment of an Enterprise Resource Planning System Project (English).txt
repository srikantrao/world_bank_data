-
Component 1 & 2: Investments related to improving the electricity system and 
strengthening the transmission network;  
 
-
Component 3: Implementation of an initial pilot and then subsequent deployment of an 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the Java-Bali business units; and  
 
-
Component 4 & 5: Technical assistance to assess the feasibility of a key power plant; 
and strengthen capacity and assist with the restructuring of PGN, a state-owned gas 
company.

The additional financing seeks to strengthen the management capabilities of PLN's 
Sumatra and Sulawesi units by expanding an ERP system that has been successfully 
implemented and operated in Java-Bali.   
 
3. Project Description 
The additional financing requested would support the fine tuning of the PLN Best 
Practices Template and the underlying ERP software and the extension of the ERP to the 
business units in Sumatra and Sulawesi, including strengthening of the ERP client and 
software support unit.  In addition, to ensure continued sustainability, the PLN Computer 
Center and the Disaster Recovery Facility would be upgraded to take into account the 
increased computer and telecommunications load.  To plan future reforms and gain 
additional impact from the ERP implementation, the area of customer relations and 
billing would be studied with a view to carrying out further improvements.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The proposed project for additional financing will support the deployment of the ERP 
system to PLN's business units in Sumatra and Sulawesi.
