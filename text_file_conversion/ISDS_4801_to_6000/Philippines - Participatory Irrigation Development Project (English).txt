2. Project Objectives 
Under APL 1, the project will have the following objectives:  
 
(a) 
enhance the National Irrigation Administration’s (NIA’s) financial viability, and 
its institutional capacity to support improvements in irrigation service delivery;  
 
(b) 
transfer increased operations and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities of 58 
national irrigation systems (NISs) to capable irrigators’ associations (IAs); and  
 
(c) 
increase irrigation efficiency and promote reliable access to water  among farmers 
in the selected 58 NISs.   
 
3. Project Description 
PIDP APL1 is the first of three APLs designed to support NIA’s long term sectorreform 
program.  The development objective of the overall PIDP APL Program (three phases) is 
to improve irrigation service delivery on a financially and technically sustainable basis 
that will contribute to increased agricultural production and productivity among 
beneficiary farmers in irrigated areas. This overall program objective will be achieved 
through:  
 
Page  2
(a) 
Institutional reform through the rationalization and reform of NIA to develop it 
into a more operationally efficient and financially viable irrigation service agency, as 
well as supporting policy reforms for improving sector efficiency;  
 
(b) 
Sustained institutionalization of shared management responsibilities for operation 
and maintenance of National Irrigation Systems (NISs) between NIA and the Irrigators’ 
Associations (IAs), as well as complete devolution of Communal Irrigation Systems 
(CISs) to Local Government Units (LGUs) and IAs, as mandated under the 1991 Local 
Government Code and the 1997 Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA); 
and  
 
(c) 
Improving irrigation efficiency in all NISs, through rehabilitation and 
modernization of infrastructure and adoption of improved O&M arrangements, in order 
to increase actual irrigated areas and cropping intensity.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project will support rehabilitation of 14 core A and 44 core B NIS systems in the 
Philippines. In addition, one of the core B NIS systems will draw water from the 
reservoir retained by the existing Magat dam built in the 1980s with support from the 
World Bank. The differences between Core A and Core B systems are on the nature of 
rehabilitation and modernization works to be carried out under the project. Core A will 
have major rehabilitation works (such as repairs of dam structures, installation of gates, 
concreting and repairs of canal linings, etc.), whereas Core B activities will mainly 
involve minor repair works which would improve O&M and efficiency.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environmental impacts. The environmental assessment (EA) study commissioned by 
NIA indicated that the environmental impacts of the Project will be mostly positive and 
beneficial, as the current threats to the long term sustainability of the Core A NIS systems 
(i.e., siltation, erosion, flooding, etc.) would be significantly addressed through 
installation of physical measures as part of the systems rehabilitation and capacity 
building of irrigators associations (IAs) to conduct routine operation and maintenance 
activities. The negative impacts identified in the EA are those related to civil works 
resulting from the rehabilitation of the existing system, all deemed assessed to be 
localized and temporary and expected to occur only during the construction phase. The 
project is not expected to affect any natural habitats since the civil works will be limited 
only to the rehabilitation of the existing systems and no new areas will be opened.  
 
Pesticide use. The EA study, which also covered an assessment on the use of chemical 
pesticides by farmers in all Core A NIS systems, revealed that 11 out of the 14 core A 
systems are already practicing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) under the Department 
of Agriculture’s National KASAKALIKASAN Program (the national IPM Program in 
the Philippines). The non-adoption of IPM in the three systems, all in Mindanao, may be 
an indication that IPM is not yet popular and/or getting support from Mindanao farmers. 
It is expected that with the rehabilitation and repair of irrigation systems under the 
project, greater agricultural productivity will be achieved in the project sites, however, in 
view of the adoption of IPM by farmers in majority of the Core A systems, coupled with 
the project guidelines not to finance purchase of chemical pesticides, the task team has 
assessed that pesticide impacts would be very minor.  
 
Dam safety. A dam safety assessment was also carried out by a World Bank Dam 
Specialist to evaluate the integrity of the Magat dam, where one of the Core B NISs will 
draw water from the reservoir retained by dam. This is in accordance with the Dam 
Safety Policy. Based on the assessment, it was concluded that the Magat dam and its 
appurtenants were designed according to good practice, built with quality and the 
structures are reasonably well maintained. However, as Magat dam is a high hazard large 
dam with catastrophic consequence if failure occurs, the assessment required that an 
Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) and an Operation and Maintenance Plan (OMP) be 
prepared and submitted to the Bank prior to appraisal. The Borrower has submitted to the 
Bank its Operation, Maintenance and Safety Manual for Magat Dam and this has been 
submitted to the Safeguards Secretariat and the Infoshop.  
 
Social impacts. The January 2007 Social Assessment Report (SAR) revealed that eight 
and five of the 14 Core A systems have involuntary resettlement (IR) and indigenous 
peoples (IPs) issues, respectively. An Updated SAR, however, resulting from extensive 
joint field visits by NIA and the Bank from June to September 2008 showed that, of the 
14 Core A systems, four do not have IR issues, nine have minor IR impacts and only one 
system (i.e, THIRIS) has significant impacts, where the number of potentially displaced 
Page  4
persons, all informal settlers, may go beyond 200. The Updated SAR also showed that 
none of the Core A systems has impacts on IPs. The site visits confirmed that the IPs and 
their ancestral domains are in the watershed areas and will not be affected by the civil 
works activities.  The updated SAR will be disclosed locally and in the Infoshop prior to 
appraisal completion, as advised during the Safeguards Review Meeting.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project will have a number of long term positive impacts in terms of achieving 
sustained yields through improved irrigation services, reduced conflicts due to illegal 
turnouts and addressing the current threats to the long term sustainability of the Core A 
NIS systems due to problems of siltation, erosion, flooding, etc. which will be addressed 
by the project.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Among the alternatives considered to reduce involuntary resettlement is the revision in 
the design of the rehabilitation work to avoid and/or minimize displacement of settlers.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
To address potential negative environmental impacts, individual initial environmental 
examination (IEE) report was prepared for each of the Core A NIS system, which was 
annexed to the main EA report. The IEE reports include specific mitigation measures to 
address identified impacts as well as set out the implementation and monitoring 
arrangements for the EMP. The IEE reports were submitted to the Department of 
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for review and issuance of environmental 
compliance certificates (ECCs) in compliance with the requirement of the Philippine 
environmental impact assessment (EIA) system.  
 
On pesticides, while the project will not finance the purchase of chemical pesticides nor 
will encourage its use, it will however support the continuous and sustained adoption of 
IPM in all systems (both in Core A and Core B NISs) through trainings and season-long 
farmers field schools (FFS) under the KASAKALIKASAN Program. The funding for 
training will be made part of the Project.   
 
NIA has also submitted to the Bank its updated Operations, Maintenance and Safety 
Manual for Magat Dam which is equivalent in content and substance to the EPP and 
OMP. The manual would guide the operational staff in performing their day-to-day work.  
 
To mitigate the IR impacts, an inventory of affected persons and affected assets for the 
nine Core A systems with minor involuntary resettlement (IR) issues, was conducted by 
NIA, the results of which were submitted to the Bank. The Bank reviewed these 
documents and asked the Borrower to complete all the supporting documents. NIA 
committed to complete all the documents and submit to the Bank before the negotiations, 
if these systems are to be implemented in year 1. Failure to submit will mean that these 
Page  5
systems will be tabled for future year implementation or as soon as the documents are 
ready and accepted by the Bank. A full resettlement action plan (RAP) was prepared for 
THIRIS, the only system with major IR issue, which will be validated during appraisal. If 
found unsatisfactory, THIRIS will be scheduled for year 2 and beyond of the project.  
 
The IPPF was prepared by NIA and submitted to the Bank in case any of the Core B 
systems program of works (POWs) would affect the IPs. The Framework defined the 
mechanisms for just and humane engagement of the potentially displaced persons and 
indigenous peoples. As a result of the guidance provided during the Safeguards Review, 
the IPPF would be updated and disclosed prior to appraisal completion.  
 
The Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework was submitted by NIA to the 
Bank, which found this document to
 be
compliant with the Bank’s OP 4.12. Thesame 
have been disclosed locally and sent to the EAP Safeguards Secretariat as well as 
submitted to and disclosed at the Infoshop.  
 
NIA has been implementing World Bank-funded projects and, as such, is familiar with, 
and has implemented the safeguard policies of the World Bank. Its approved 
Rationalization Plan has also included the establishment of a permanent Environmental 
Unit (EU) to ensure implementation of environmental and social safeguard measures in 
NIA Projects and to help build the capacity of the Regions and IAs. The EU will be 
staffed by an Engineer, an Environmental Specialist, a Social Safeguards Specialist, a 
Watershed Management Specialist and a Research Analyst. For enhanced accountability 
and transparency, the safeguards planning and implementation has been integrated to the 
NIA’s Integrity Development Program.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
A
participatory stakeholder analysis identified the project’s major stakeholders among 
government agencies, the irrigators’ associations (IAs), and business groups and other 
non government organizations. Acceptance of the project is high but terms of 
engagements with them to get their cooperation due to sometimes conflicting interests 
will have to be seriously addressed on a system-to-system basis. Most significant of the 
stakeholders because of the critical functions they play in the sustainability of the 
irrigation systems are the IAs which are in varying degrees of organizational capacities, 
mostly low, despite major inputs given by the NIA in the past. Attention to gender 
balanced development inputs is practically nil; fortunately, there are enough women 
leaders who are active within the IAs. The project may engage the services of 
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and other development partners for different 
aspects of institution building activities.
