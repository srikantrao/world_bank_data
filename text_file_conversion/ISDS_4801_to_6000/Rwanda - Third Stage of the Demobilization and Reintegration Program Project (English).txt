B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective of the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Project (RDRP) is to enhance the 
capacity of the Government of Rwanda to demobilize regular and irregular combatants and ease 
their transition to civilian life through the provision of reinsertion and reintegration support; and 
support those ex-combatants from previous phases who remain vulnerable.  Specifically, the 
RDRP will:  
 
ï
Establish the capacity to repatriate and demobilize up to a maximum of 5,500 members 
of armed groups (including approximately 500 children) operating outside of Rwanda and 
particularly those in the Eastern DRC;  
 
ï
Establish the capacity to demobilize up to a maximum of 4,000 personnel from the 
Rwanda Defense Forces once the threat of AGs is reduced, allowing for the reduction of defense 
sector expenses;  
 
ï
Allow for the provision of reinsertion and socio-economic reintegration support for all 
demobilized ex-AG members, newly demobilized RDF and 500 phase-II beneficiaries, 
complemented by Vulnerability Support Window grants (VSW), for vulnerable ex-combatants;  
Page  2
ï
Facilitate the progressive mainstreaming of RDRP activities to local authorities and 
relevant institutions, in order to build sustainable support mechanisms for activities initiated 
under the program, and integrate ex-combatants into wider development services; and  
 
ï
Support up to a maximum of approximately 10,000 dependants of repatriated AG 
members.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
There are an estimated 8,000 Rwandan combatants who fled the country following the 1994 
genocide and who continue to operate militarily in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo 
(DRC).  There are also several thousand combatants in other countries, primarily in the Republic 
of Congo, but also in Zambia, Malawi, Central African Republic and South Africa. The 
Government of Rwanda and the international community in general see these armed groups 
(AGs) as a continued threat to peace, stability and prosperity both in Rwanda and the wider 
Great Lakes Region.  
 
Regional governments and the international community have taken a number of steps to try and 
help address this threat, particularly for AGs in the Eastern DRC.  A series of efforts by national, 
regional and international actors are underway to support the pacification of the Great Lakes 
Region, notably, the Nairobi Joint Communiqu√©, the Kivu Peace Conference, and UN Security 
Council Resolution 1804 of March 13, 2008.  UN Resolution 1804 specifically calls upon the 
main AG force, the Forces d√´mocratiques pour la lib√©ration du Rwanda (FDLR), to disarm 
andrepatriate, or face sanctions.  
 
The Government of Rwanda (GoR), in turn, has been facilitating peaceful disarmament and 
repatriation of Rwandan armed groups outside of Rwanda through a systematic process of 
demobilization, reinsertion and reintegration (DRR).  The second stage of a national DRR 
process that is supported by IDA and the international community (through a multi-donor trust 
fund for the greater Great Lakes region) will end in December 2008, with the closing of the 
Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project (P075129).  It is this context that the GoR 
has proposed to undertake a third stage DRR program in hopes of facilitating the demilitarization 
and reintegration of the majority of FDLR members, further reductions to the size of the national 
army (the RDF), and to address the needs of the outstanding case-load of phase II combatants 
who were demobilized or who remain particularly vulnerable.  Specifically, GoR anticipates that 
up to 5,500 AG members and 4,000 members of RDF will be demobilized and assisted to 
reintegrate into civilian life over the next three years.  The outcome of these efforts is expected to 
be an improved security situation in Rwanda.  
 
The project would support the following types of activities:  
 
ï
sensitization of specific combatants groups and communities in general regarding the 
process and rationale for program;  
 
ï
demobilization and possible repatriation  of AGs on foreign soil, and demobilization of 
the RDF;  
 
ï
support for the short-term reinsertion of all combatants (through provision of basic needs 
kits, recognition of service allowances) and AG dependents (through a resettlement kit);  
Page  3
ï
general support for economic reintegration through micro-project and vulnerability 
support window grants, and for social reintegration through the provision of psycho-social 
counseling, HIV/AIDS awareness training, and community sensitization;  
 
ï
specially targeted social and economic support for children and severely disabled ex-
combatants, and  
 
ï
program management and administration.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
As the resettlement of former AGs and the RDF is unrestricted, the RDRP will be implemented 
throughout Rwanda.  Two demobilization centers in Mutobo and Muhazi will operate as under 
the second phase of the RDRP.  However, as both of these facilities exist, there are no expected 
safeguard issues.  Reintegration support grants are provided to ex-combatants on an individual 
basis for the purposes of demand-driven micro-projects in or near their homes and communities.  
As the ex-combatants supported under the program are both widely dispersed and a very small 
portion of the overall population, no cumulative environmental impact is expected. While many 
micro-projects financed under the second phase addressed training and capacity building for 
individuals or micro-enterprises, some support was also used to set up income-generating 
activities that might suggest mitigation measures.  As such, it is expected that an Environmental 
and Social Management Framework document will be prepared to screen and identify 
appropriate mitigation measures.  Preliminary review suggests specific attention should be paid 
to activities that might increase soil erosion and negative impacts of possible fuel wood use.  In 
the event that land acquisition is required for some reintegration support, a specific annex to the 
ESMF will be prepared that treats specific Resettlement Policy Framework issues.  The RPF 
would be disclosed separately from the ESMF.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
To date, all screening of micro-projects under the RDRP II (P075129) is carried out by the 
Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission (RDRC) provincial and district officers.  
A
2007
review of the application of safeguard procedures approved by the Bank for the project 
found that screening of micro-projects for potential environmental and social impacts is being 
carried out as per the procedures outlined in the Program Implementation Manual.  It was also 
confirmed through discussions with RDRC national, provincial and district staff that the micro-
project activities undertaken by ex-combatants were small in nature and were not expected to 
have any significant impacts.  The consultant further found that the numbers of ex-combatants 
(estimated to be between 0.5 and 1 percent of the total adult population) and the types of 
activities being supported by the program are minor in relation to the large number of citizens 
engaged in similar pursuits (farming, fishing, small enterprise, etc.) in each district. As such, the 
consultant concluded that there is no likelihood that this dispersed and low number of micro-
projects, even if there were impacts, would have any cumulative effects.

As with the past phase, the third phase EDRP is expected be classified as environmental 
category B.  It includes reintegration activities that primarily take the form of micro-projects that 
promote income generation.  While many of these micro-projects will have no environmental or 
social impacts, some agriculture, animal husbandry, brick-making and other similar activities are 
also financed.  These are on a very small scale (micro-project grants are worth approximately 
$225) and widely dispersed and so would have marginal environmental impact and no 
cumulative effect. Nonetheless, an appropriate screening devise and relevant mitigation measures 
are considered appropriate and will be updated (the current project uses such a screening devise) 
through the preparation of an ESMF.  The project will not be supporting any major physical 
works, however, some land acquisition may be required for some forms of reintegration support 
and therefore may trigger OP/BP 4.12.  Nonetheless, the task team believes that such instances 
could be addressed through a combined ESMF document given the demand-driven nature and 
small size of such activities.

There may be some land acquisition required under the project that would trigger 4.12.  
Therefore, the EA that will result in an ESMF will specifically look at the issue and if necessary, 
prepare a RPF as an annex to the ESMF that would be disclosed separately
