B.  Project Objective [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The development objective of the proposed project is to provide a well-grounded assessment of 
the need for exploratory drilling of the below-mentioned sites. The project will achieve this 
through seismic and electric conductivity prospecting, gravimetric and magneto-metric, 
geological as well as other field investigation methods and techniques. The comprehensive field 
investigations will enable to decide whether to proceed with exploratory drilling or not. Since 
there are significant exploratory and operating risks associated with geothermal projects, the 
main benefit from the project implementation will be mitigation of those risks.  
The global objective of the geothermal energy based electricity development project is to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project will be supported by the on-going GEF/World Bank GeoFund program through its 
TA window. The proposed geothermal project to conduct comprehensive field survey of the 
aforementioned prospective geothermal sites will have one component:  
A. Technical assistance 
(indicative amount of US$ 1.20 million, including GeoFund funding of 
US$ 1 million and government co-financing of US$ 0.20 million)
 
to conduct comprehensive 
field investigations works. This component covers the following areas: 
Page  2
-2-
·
Establishment of reliable geological data for investment:
Comprehensive field 
investigation works of the aforementioned prospective geothermal sites (through seismic 
and electric conductivity prospecting, gravimetric and magneto-metric and geological 
investigations);  
·
Operating costs:
financing of the incremental operating costs of the implementing 
agency for this project (US$ 60,000).   
Conditional upon the outcome of the comprehensive field investigation works, further GeoFund 
support will be considered through its Direct Investment Funding (DIF) window or Geological 
Risk Insurance (GRI) window to help financing of investments enabling utilization of 
geothermal energy resources (indicative total amount: US$4 million, of which US$3.0 million 
from the GeoFund and US$ 1.0 million from the Government). Those investment costs will 
include the drilling costs of exploratory wells. The GeoFund will support part of the eligible 
drilling costs of one or two wells with the estimated depth of 3 km; 
If the results of the TA suggest that drilling of exploratory wells is justified, then an EA for that 
activity will be financed under this project, and the ISDS will be modified to reflect the change 
in EA category (from C to B).  TORs for the EA will be disclosed in-country and in the 
Infoshop. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The following locations for further comprehensive field investigation works were selected: (1) 
Yeratoumber site; (2) Gridzor site; (3) volcanic site of the Mount Sharai, and (4) Karkar site to 
the South-East of Jermakhpyur with similar volcano-tectonic structure. These areas are located 
far from the settlements and are not expected to lead to resettlement issues. The areas are not 
used for agricultural or any other economic purposes. Also the sites are not within any natural 
preserve and do not closely border with natural habitats. The site areas are represented mostly by 
alpine meadows with limited accessibility for rural residents. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity [from PCN] 
 
The project will be implemented by the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Fund (R2E2 
Fund) which is the implementing agency of the Armenian Renewable Energy Project. It has an 
adequate institutional capacity for dealing with safeguard issues; its staff has received substantial 
training on Bank's safeguard policies during the early stages of the Renewable Energy Project 
implementation.

(

As the project proposes to have only TA activities related to field geological and 
seismic surveys it is not expected to produce any environmental and social 
impacts. Thus the project might be considered as Category C project, which

doesn’t need any follow-up safeguards issues.
