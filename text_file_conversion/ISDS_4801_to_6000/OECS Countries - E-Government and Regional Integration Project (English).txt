2. Project Objectives 
The overall development objective of the project is to promote the efficiency, quality, and 
transparency of public services through the delivery of regionally integrated e-
government applications that take advantage of economies of scale.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is designed as a Programmatic Loan, with two key phases.  
 
In Phase 1, the project has two main substantive components:  
 
Component 1. Horizontal (Cross-Sectoral) E-Government Interventions. This would 
involve a number of sub-components, namely: (i) Policy and Strategy Implementation; 
(ii) Legal and Regulatory Framework Implementation; (iii) ICT Standards and Total Cost 
of Ownership Optimization; (iv) E-Government Institutional Framework  
 
Strengthening; and (v) Automated Registries and Multi-Purpose Identification Systems.  
 
Page  2
2. Vertical (Sectoral) E-Government Interventions. This component will support 
further regional harmonization and upgrading of existing information systems in the core 
areas of public finance: (i) E-Government in Public Financial Management Systems; (ii) 
E-Government in Tax Administration; (iii) E-Government in Customs; (iv) Electronic 
Government Procurement; and (v) E-Government in Health and Other Social and 
Productive Sectors.  
 
A
third component for project management is also included in both phases.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will be implemented in the OECS countries. The physical components of the 
project will be limited to the installation of ICT hardware in existing buildings, and are 
not expected to require any major works. Minor works may be required within existing 
building for internal refurbishing of existing facilities, such as server rooms, to 
accommodate ICT equipment and any ancillary electrical or air conditioning installations.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
No negative social or environmental impacts are expected from the project.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project will have many positive social impacts related to improved delivery of 
government services. In addition, some long-term positive indirect environmental 
impacts are expected due to reduced use of transportation services by citizens and 
Page  3
businesses in order to interact with government, since now it will be possible to conduct 
many transactions on-line.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts.
