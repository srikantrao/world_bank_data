2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the proposed Project is to improve market 
access  for micro and small-scale rural agricultural producers and tourism product and 
service providers.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project is expected to be a SIL and the project consists of three components:  
Component 1. Rural Subprojects in Agriculture and Rural Tourism; Component 2. 
National Technical Assistance and Capacity Building; and Component 3. Project 
Management.  
 
Component 1. Rural Subprojects in Agriculture and Rural Tourism (Total US$14.22 
million; IBRD US$12.22 million).  This component will finance two types of rural 
subprojects.  Type A subprojects will support revenue generating activities in agriculture 
and tourism.  Type B subprojects will support provision of critical infrastructure, 
marketing and management in the agriculture and tourism sectors.  It is estimated that the 
project would finance approximately 75 Type A and 40 Type B subprojects over the 
Page  2
course of its implementation.  The project is expected to directly and indirectly benefit an 
estimated 22,000 rural residents through revenue-generating sub-projects and from 
critical market-oriented infrastructure, marketing and management.  The inclusion of 
young people and women will be encouraged.  
 
Component 2. National Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (Total US$1.25 
million; IBRD US$1.25 million).  The main objective of this component is to strengthen 
relevant national organizations to enhance their capacity to continue assisting the rural 
enterprises and other Project partners and ensure the sustainability of the rural 
enterprises.  Hence, the component will finance technical assistance and capacity 
building for key organizations and agencies that deliver support services in agriculture 
and rural tourism at the local level.  JSIF will invite TA and capacity building proposals 
from organizations such as Rural Agricultural Development Authority (RADA), Tourism 
Product Development Company (TPDCo), Jamaica Agricultural Society (JAS), 
Chambers of Commerce, etc.  JSIF will evaluate the proposals based on their potential 
contribution to the achievement of the Project Development Objective and their 
contribution to the operation and sustainability of rural subprojects (Type A and B) 
financed under the Project.  JSIF will finance and procure the agreed services/activities.  
An estimated 20,000 rural residents will benefit indirectly from the training and capacity 
building provided to beneficiary organization staff under this component.  
 
Component 3. Project Management (Total US$2.03 million; IBRD US$1.53 million).To 
implement the Project, JSIF will put into place a small technical Project Management 
Team (PMT), funded by this component, while JSIF core staff will implement 
procurement and financial management.  This component will finance project 
management, technical expertise (tourism and agricultural specialists, monitoring and 
evaluation), staff training, the annual audit, vehicles, office equipment and other 
operating costs.  This component will also ensure that effective fiduciary arrangements 
are in place during implementation.  The outputs of this component are the efficient and 
effective Project implementation and monitoring.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Geographic Scope/Project Area: The project will have national coverage. However, in 
order to maximize development impact, the project will initially focus on eight parishes: 
Clarendon, Manchester, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James, Trelawny, and 
St. Ann as well as the blue and John Crow Mountain regions.  
 
Project Beneficiaries: The Project will directly benefit an estimated 7,500 micro and 
small-scale  rural producers and tourism product and service providers who will benefit 
from revenue-generating subprojects and from critical market-oriented infrastructure, 
marketing and management.  The Project will encourage the inclusion of young people 
and women and an estimated 15 percent of all direct beneficiaries will be youth (under 30 
years old) and 35 percent will be women.  An additional 20,000 rural residents will 
benefit indirectly from the training and capacity building provided to RADA and TPDCo 
staff.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
This is a Category B project. No major adverse environmental impacts are envisaged as a 
result of the project. Some of the potential negative environmental impacts associated 
with tourism sub-projects include trail disturbance; natural resource loss from tampering 
of flora/ fauna; desensitization of existing natural fauna from human presence; possible 
damage to seafloor from divers/ snorkelers; improper sewage and solid waste disposal 
etc. Similarly, potential negative environmental impacts associated with agricultural sub-
projects include water pollution (groundwater contamination from seepage of animal 
waste; feedlot and fertilizer runoffs etc.); solid waste pollution (improper disposal of 
agro-processing wastes) etc.  
 
Among the Bank's safeguard policies, the Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural 
Habitats (OP 4.04), Forests (OP 4.36) and Pest Management (OP 4.09) are triggered.  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): The proposed project will support multiple 
small sub-projects; as such the size and nature of these projects are not expected to have  
significant negative environmental impacts. Environmental screening procedures and an 
Environmental Management Framework (EMF) have already been developed in the PIU 
under a previous Bank project, and will be applied to these sub-projects. Revisions to the 
existing EMF to screen for environmental impacts from new types of sub-projects 
(tourism and agricultural) as well as appropriate environmental mitigation plans are being 
prepared. The project will ensure compliance with the Bank safeguard policies for small-
scale infrastructure investments through the incorporation of specific guidelines in the 
Operational Manual.  
 
Page  4
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04): The sub-projects financed under the REDI project are 
not expected to have significant impacts on critical natural habitats. However, this policy 
has been triggered as a precaution. Environmental screening procedures have already 
been developed within JSIF, and during preparation, the EMF will be reviewed to ensure 
the screening of sub-projects for impacts on natural habitats, with appropriate 
environmental management plans.  
 
Forests (OP/BP 4.36): The sub-projects financed under REDI will not result in 
significant conversion of degradation of critical forest areas. However, this policy has 
been triggered as a precaution, as there may be possible sub-projects supporting forest 
restoration activities (such as afforestation). Any such activities will be minor and 
positive in nature from a forest perspective. Until there is a more defined program in this 
areas, a sector-wide analysis of policy and institutional issues is not warranted. During 
preparation, the revised EMF will include guidance on assessing the potential for 
improved biodiversity and ecosystem functions from forest restoration activities.  
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09): This Bank policy has been triggered as agricultural sub-
projects may directly or indirectly contribute to the increased use of pesticides because of 
the intensification of the production of certain crops. The Operations Manual will include 
specific provisions regarding the prohibition of certain types of pesticides (those on the 
World Health Organization's Hazardous Pesticides List) and guidelines for the selection, 
application, storage, handling, transport, and disposal of pesticides. The selection criteria 
for sub-projects will also encourage the use of sustainable farming practices to promote 
the application of Integrated Pest Management, organic farming practices and renewable 
energy.  
 
The project is not expected to cause any adverse social impacts. Long-term impacts are 
expected to be positive or neutral from a social standpoint. The project is seeking to 
improve productivity and rural incomes while mainstreaming social safeguards into 
production. These investments are expected to generate positive impacts. The project 
does not trigger social safeguards.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Recent supervision missions for other Bank projects in Jamaica reviewed experience of 
the PIU in the implementation of the Environmental Management Framework (EMF) to 
identify possible problems encountered, highlight lessons learned, and assess institutional 
Page  5
capacity. Overall, the PIU is found to have adequate capacity to administer environmental 
screening procedures and implement mitigation plans.  
 
The institutionalization of the EMF has continued to improve, with environmental 
management procedures on track to being fully developed. Supervision of selected 
subproject sites has shown that the EMF procedures and mitigation plans are also being 
implemented well in practice. The automation of processes helps keep the Environmental 
Officer's workload manageable; with additional subprojects under the proposed REDI 
Project, staffing may be revisited.  
 
Regular training of Technical Officers continues to strengthen their capacity to 
implement and monitor environmental management actions. Customized environmental 
management plans (EMPs) are being appended to contracts and bid documents. The PIU 
has recently achieved ISO 14001 certification, becoming one of the first such institution 
in the Caribbean to receive this recognition.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
A
large segment of the Project's beneficiary population belongs to productive small-
farmer organizations, and groups related to agriculture and tourism activities. Currently 
these organizations have limited involvement with local development investment. The 
Project will promote and establish mechanisms for their participation. The development 
of rural tourism and agriculture is a central part of the government's rural development 
strategy, the Project will support participatory processes to identify potential products and 
will select interventions that create jobs and raise rural income.
