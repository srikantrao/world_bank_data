B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project development objective is to transform the Rio Bogota from an environmental 
liability into an urban asset for the metropolitan region by improving water quality, reducing 
flood risk, and creating a series of multi-functional parks along the river.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project will be financed and implemented by the CAR, with an overall cost of 
US$446 million with the World Bank loan of tentatively set at around $250 million. The 
components are:  
 
Component 1: Salitre WWTP: This component includes the upgrading and expansion of the 
existing 4 m3/d primary plant to an 8 m3/s secondary plant. The existing plant site is sufficient to 
accommodate the expansion and no land acquisition is required.  
 
Page  2
Component 2: Flood Control and Recuperation of the Rio Bogota: This component will finance 
a
comprehensive river recuperation program that incorporates best practice in urban river 
restoration. This component will complement the wastewater infrastructure by improving flood 
control, restoring part of the river flood plain, creating and enhancing wetlands, and 
supplemental providing in-situ wastewater treatment.  
 
The flood standard along the Rio Bogota currently averages around 20 year return period and 
the dikes were designed to protect rural areas. The eastern side of the river has rapidly urbanized, 
mainly with industrial zones and low-income neighborhoods. The western side of the river is 
largely rural, but development is spilling over to the right bank. To respond to the new urban 
realties and protect the higher value land along the river, there is a need to upgrade flood control 
standards. The component will finance flood control works along a 68 kilometer stretch of river 
that runs through the metropolitan area.  
 
The river dikes are designed in an ecologically sensitive fashion. Rather than simply increasing 
the height of the river dikes, which is the normal engineering approach, the embankments on the 
rural western side will be relocated 30-120 meters to restore part of the original flood plain. In 
addition, there are many meanders in the river which will be reconfigured to create parks with 
constructed wetlands to improve water quality, enhance ecological habitat, and provide 
recreational space. The relocation of the dikes generates moderate land acquisition requirements, 
and some household displacement. The land acquisition and resettlement costs will be financed 
by the CAR, and the World Bank resettlement policies will be followed.  
 
Studies will be undertaken to determine if supplemental oxygenation will be required to 
maintain aquatic life in the river. There are also a number of large wetlands associated with 
tributaries flowing into the river, and studies will be undertaken to determine if the wetlands can 
be improved to enhance storm water treatment and ecological habitat. The CARís overall vision 
is to create a linear park along the river with a healthy eco-system that will serve as the western 
boundary for the city of Bogota. The CAR will own and maintain the property and works for this 
stretch of the river.  
 
Component 3: Water and Environmental Planning: The upgraded Salitre WWTP, along with 
the interception and conveyance of other wastewater flows out of Bogot√°, will improve water 
quality but much more analysis and work will be needed to recuperate the Bogot√° River. This 
component will therefore finance a number of studies and actions that will provide a framework 
for future water quality and environmental improvements.  
 
A
series of studies will be funded to promote integrated urban water planning. Potential topics 
include point and non-point pollution control, sewage and stormwater collection, and ecological 
restoration. The goal is to create cost-effective water quality improvement actions that combine 
conventional and natural approaches, as well as water reuse for wetland and river restoration, 
agriculture in the adjacent La Ramada irrigation district, and hydropower in the Muna 
hydropower complex. The component will also provide planning support for the Canoas WWTP 
and recuperation of the Muna reservoir. A study to develop a biosolids management plan for 
EAAB is also under consideration. The CAR will work with EAAB and other partners in 
undertaking these planning studies.  
Page  3
Component 4: Project Management: The CAR currently has a strong project team of around 12 
professionals preparing the project who will continue to support the implementation. The 
professionals include a wastewater engineer, hydrologist, environmental scientists, social 
specialist, resettlement expert, lawyer, procurement and financial management specialists, and 
two project managers. CAR will also contract supervision companies to monitor the civil works 
financed under the project. CAR plans to finance the project management team with its own 
resources.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Location of Rio Bogota Basin: The Rio Bogota starts an elevation of 3400 m and traverses a 
distance of 370 kilometers before discharging into the Rio Magdalena at an elevation of 280 
meters. The total area of the Basin is 6,000 km2, almost entirely within the department of 
Cundinamarca. The population of the Basin is around 8 million located in 42 municipalities, 
including the Bogota District Capital, representing 20% of the Colombiaís population and 26% 
of its GDP.  
 
The basin is divided into three parts: i) upper basin which is north of Bogota city; ii) middle 
basin in the Bogota metropolitan areas; and iii) lower basin which is below the Bogota Sabana 
(high plains). The average dry season flow of the River Bogota before it enters Bogota City is 
around 15 m3/s, and Bogota discharges approximately 22 m3/s of wastewater into the river. The 
Rio Bogota runs alongthe western perimeter of Bogota city and is highly contaminated.  After 
leaving Bogota, the river plunges 2000 meters in a short distance into the Rio Magdalena valley. 
The Bogota power company (EMGESA) has constructed a 1124 MW (installedcapacity) 
hydropower facility downstream of Bogota to take advantage of the river flow and elevation 
drop. The holding reservoir for the EMGESA power complex is the 853 ha Muna reservoir 
which is also highly contaminated. The spectacular ìFalls of Tequendamaî are located slightly 
downstream of the Muna reservoir.  
 
Water Use and Quality in Rio Bogota Basin: water quality data of the Bogota River indicates 
that in the middle basin the river is essentially a sewage canal. The promulgated water quality 
standards call for improving the river water quality to Class IV, which would be at least 
acceptable for irrigation and livestock use.  
 
The Bogota metropolitan area dominates both water use and wastewater generation. The lower 
basin is sparsely populated and is insignificant in terms of water use. The Rio Bogota discharges 
into the Rio Magdalena, which is Colombiaís largest river (7100 m3/s), and the pollution is 
dramatically diluted.  
 
Rapid Urbanization around Bogota: The population of the Basin is expected to increase from 
around 8 million in 2002 to over 12 million by 2020, with most of the growth taking place in the 
Bogota metropolitan area. Historically, the Rio Bogota has been the western boundary of the 
city, and the urban growth has been channeled primarily to the north and south of Bogota. The 
mountains to the east of Bogota have formed a natural physical barrier, although the 
development of squatter communities on the mountain slopes is widespread.  
 
Page  4
Given the development pressures in Bogota, the urban area is expanding to the edge of the Rio 
Bogota (which is the boundary of the Bogota District Capital) and in many cases leaping over the 
river into adjacent municipalities. Due to the poor environmental conditions along the river, and 
its natural transportation barrier due to a limited number of bridges, the development along the 
river has naturally been restricted to high density low-income neighborhoods and industrial 
zones. Flood control works along the river were originally designed for rural areas and only offer 
protection against floods with a return frequency of 20 years or less. There is an urgent need to 
upgrade flood control works to reflect the new reality of urbanization along the river.  
 
Wetlands in the Bogota Metropolitan Area: In the past, the rapid runoff from the mountains 
combined with the relatively flat plains around Bogota resulted in a wide spread network of 
wetlands along the Rio Bogota. Pre-hispanic societies constructed extensive hydraulic works to 
manage irrigation water in the wetlands.Over the past forty years, the wetland areas around 
Bogota have decreased from 50,000 hectares to 800 hectares due urban expansion and 
conversion of wetlands to agricultural and pasture land . The few remaining wetlands are 
generally polluted with sewage and stormwater and provide only less than optimum habitat for 
wildlife. There is a strong citizenís movement to protect and enhance the remaining wetlands, 
and in 2005 the Bogota Department of Environment issued a formal wetland policy for the city.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower will be the Corporacion Autonoma Regional de Cundinamarca (CAR) which is 
the regional autonomous environmental agency. The CAR receives its funding from municipal 
property taxes, and its Board of Directors consists of representatives from the municipal 
governments within its jurisdiction. The CAR is responsible for promoting the implementation of 
Colombiaís national environmental policies.  
 
The CAR has a strong record of environmental management and functions both as project 
owners (parks, landfills, wastewater treatment plants, etc.) as well as environmental regulator for 
some types of infrastructure projects. It has past experience with projects funded by international 
banks, such as the Inter-American Development Bank. The CAR has limited experience, 
however, with resettlement programs.

Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
Although the Project is an environmental improvement project, it is classified as a Category 
A
project requiring a full environmental assessment due to its size and potential impacts. The 
Ministry of Environment (Ministerio de Ambiente, Vivienda y Desarrollo Territorial) has already 
provided the environmental license to EAAB for Component 1 when Salitre WWTP was 
originally designed for a secondary treatment plant in 1996. For Component 2 (river works) the 
Page  5
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
CAR explained that an environmental license is not required as the works are being undertaken 
by an environmental authority and as the current design is based on licensed original river work 
project, but they are required to prepare a Documento de Evaluacion y Manejo Ambiental 
(DEMA). The EA required by the World Bank will cover all project components, and the also 
fill the Colombian DEMA requirements.  
 
OP4.01 states that the Borrower should contract an independent consultant to prepare the 
EA. The CAR, however, has requested that they be allowed to prepare the EA because they have 
the necessary in-house expertise, can undertake the EA more efficiently than a consultant, and 
they have already started preparation of the EA in-house environmental consultants. After 
discussing with Bank team environmental specialist, it was agreed that CAR could proceed with 
the preparation of the EA provided there are neutral facilitators/chairs at the public consultations 
and the draft EA be reviewed by an independent panel of experts.  
 
The CAR will have two public hearings for the EA as required by OP4.01. The first public 
hearing is scheduled in March 2009 and will review the TOR for the EA. The second public 
hearing is scheduled for mid-2009.  
 
The preliminary environmental screening undertaken by the Bank identified the following 
issues that will be addressed in the EA (among other topics):  
 
Component 1: Salitre WWTP  
 
ï

Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
Due to the large amounts of earthworks to be undertaken under the project, and the long 
history of human settlement in the Bogot√° sabana‚
 îparticularly around the river and its 
associated wetlands, there is the possibility of chance archeological finds. As is normal practice 
with the CAR, all construction documents will include procedures for dealing with and 
safeguarding chance archeological finds.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
For the Salitre WWTP in Component 1, the existing plant site is sufficient to accommodate 
the plant expansion and no land acquisition is required. Only the river works in Component 2 
involve resettlement. In the 68 kilometer river stretch, portions of 331 lots will be purchased by 
CAR in order to move the Rio Bogota river embankment mainly in the rural western bank, as 
well as to create riparian zones. The 331 lots are divided as follows: Section A = 47 lots, Section 
B
=
111,
C
=
100,
D=17, E=26, and Meandro del Say = 30.  
 
Construction of the river works will be phased over at least a 3 year period, starting with 
Section A first and working downstream. Sections A, B, part of C, D, E, and Meandro del Say lie 
primarily in rural areas, and land acquisition involves the purchase of small parts of large land-
holdings along the river. CAR will prepare economic compensation plans for these sections.  
 
A
part of Section C (Porvenir or Section C2) poses the major resettlement challenge. 
Approximately 100 households in the low-income area of Porvenir, most of them without title to 
the property, will be relocated. A resettlement action plan that meets Bank resettlement 
requirements will be prepared to guide the land acquisition and relocation activities.
