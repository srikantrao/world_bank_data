2. Project Objectives 
The Project development objective (PDO) is to increase the value of agricultural 
production in targeted irrigated areas of the Sierra through improved off-farm and on-
farm irr
igation infrastructure, irrigation management practices, water users’ organization, 
a
better coordination between the irrigation scheme and the agricultural supply chains 
linked to it and formalization of water rights.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed lending instrument is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$ 20 million 
over a five year period.  The overall project cost is estimated at US$ 49 million.  It would 
be implemented through the following components:  
 
Component A.  Modernization and Rehabilitation of Collective Irrigation and Drainage 
Systems (Total cost US$14.98 million)  
 
This component would support eligible Water Users Organizations to improve their 
water supply service to farmers.  More specifically, it would finance the feasibility 
Page  2
studies, execution and supervision of infrastructure subprojects in the collective irrigation 
and drainage systems.  Such subprojects could include, for example, canal improvements 
(i.e. canal lining) and small water regulation reservoirs.  It would benefit about 15,000 ha 
of irrigated area and 16,000 families.  
 
In order to encourage improvements in collective irrigation management, including cost 
recovery, and increase the likelihood of Project sustainability, only WUOs, within the 14 
prioritized WUAs, reaching a minimum performance level would be eligible for Project 
financing under this component.  Component C1 will provide capacity building to all 14 
prioritized WUAs to reach this eligibility level.  
 
Only subprojects meeting a set of criteria would be eligible for Project financing.  Those 
criteria are detailed in the PAD Annex 4 and aim, among other things, at ensuring that 
subprojects will: (a) contribute to improving water delivery services to farmers in a cost-
effective manner; (b) be selected following a participatory process involving the water 
users and the regions; (c) have acceptable design standards, and (d) comply with 
environmental and social safeguards. Subprojects will require a financial contribution 
from WUOs and regional governments.  Subprojects should have a total cost below 
US$250,000 (i.e. small to medium-size physical works).  
 
This component would also finance the feasibility studies, works/installation and 
supervision of works of some 150 measuring devices to be installed at the head of the 
hydraulic sectors defined in relation with the water user rights that will be formalized 
under component D1.  These activities would be entirely financed by the Project.  
 
Component B.  On-farm Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement (US$12.96 million)  
 
This component would support farmers, located in the 14 prioritized WUAs, in 
increasing irrigation performance at farm level through the installation of improved on-
farm irrigation systems in areas cultivated with, or to be dedicated to, the production of 
high value agricultural commodities.  More specifically, it would finance the feasibility 
studies, execution and supervision of subprojects including: (a) collective works and 
equipment at the tertiary level up to the farm intake and (b) works and equipments on the 
irrigation plots.  
 
Only subprojects meeting a set of criteria would be eligible for Project financing.  Those 
criteria are detailed in annex 4 and aim, among other things, at ensuring that subprojects 
will: (a) contribute to improving on-farm irrigation management in a cost effective 
manner, (b) have an adequate supply of irrigation water; (c) have acceptable design 
standards; (d) consider environmental and social safeguards and (e) benefit the 
production of high-value crops with an identified market (viable business plan).  
 
Individual farmers as well as farmers groups will be able to participate in this 
component (see lessons learned).  Farmers’ financial contribution to subproject 
implementation will depend on the size of the group: the bigger the group, the smaller the 
financial contribution required from each beneficiary.  This is to favor the formation of 
groups for the later marketing and processing of agricultural production.  The region will 
also participate in subproject financing. This component would improve about 4,000 ha 
or 1 per cent of the irrigated area in the Sierra and benefit about 4,000 farmers, as the 
average family property is 0.94 ha.  
 
Component C.  Institutional Strengthening and Support to Production and Marketing 
(US$11.21 million)  
Page  3
Sub-component C.1.  Awareness Raising and Capacity building of Water Users 
Organizations (US$5.71 million)  
 
This subcomponent would support three broad types of activities: (a) sensitization of 
water users in the territory of the 37 WUAs on some key aspects of water management; 
(b) a comprehensive capacity building program for the 14 prioritized WUAs and (c) the 
promotion of component A in the 14 prioritized WUAs.  
 
The comprehensive capacity building program has three objectives: (a) to help each 
WUA identify the strategic water management issues in the system and formulate action 
plans (including investment and training) to address them; (b) to help them achieve 
eligibility level for Component A; and (c) to help the WUAs and CRs improve water 
delivery service to farmers and, more generally, to increase their sustainability and the 
quality of their management.  This comprehensive program will be tailored to the specific 
context of each WUA.  
 
Sub-component C.2.  Awareness Raising and Capacity Building of Agricultural 
Producers and Business Groups (US$5.49 million)  
 
This subcomponent will include three broad types of activities, all in the territory of the 
14 prioritized WUAs: (a) activities aimed at promoting the adoption of improved on-farm 
technologies; (b) technical assistance to farmers who adopt those technologies and (c) 
activities aimed at supporting the production and marketing of high value crops.  
 
The Project will facilitate the transition of interested farmers and groups to higher value 
crops and improved on-farm irrigation technologies.  More generally, it will attempt to 
increase the value of the agricultural production by better coordinating farmers with the 
agricultural supply chains linked to the irrigation scheme, especially around issues such 
as productivity, reliability of deliveries and quality.  This will entail for each irrigation 
scheme: (a) a diagnosis of the main high value agricultural supply chains; (b) the 
provision of technical assistance to help farmers and groups to formulate and implement 
business plans around viable agricultural supply chains; and (c) the promotion of 
interactions between farmers groups and key stakeholders.  
 
This activity will be implemented by PSI with locally contracted agro-business 
consultants and partners.  It will be closely coordinated with other projects/programs in 
the Sierra, such as Sierra Exportadora/PROSIERRA, Aliados/MARENASS, INIA, 
INCAGRO and the DirecciÃ³n de la PromociÃ³n Agraria of MINAG (see section C.1.on 
partnerships arrangements for more details).  
 
Component D.  Formalization of Water Rights and Extension to the National Water 
Registry (US$ 7.07 million)  
 
This component would finance the formalization of about 200,000 agricultural water 
rights in the Sierra and their integration into the existing national water rights registry 
(RADA) in 20 valleys of the Sierra (see PAD Annex 4 and map 2 for the name and 
location of the valleys).  
 
Component E.  Project Implementation Support (total cost US$ 2.80 million)  
 
This component would finance the administration, monitoring and evaluation (including 
baseline and impact assessment studies) and auditing of the Project and “strategic sector 
studies” such as feasibility studies for follow-up projects or in-depth analysis of key 
topics. It would also support the capacity building of PSI national and regional teams and 
other key stakeholders in the implementation of the Project, such as regional 
Page  4
Governments, in conducting, supporting and monitoring field operations financed by the 
Project.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
While a limited number of the Project activities (sensitization of water users, parts of 
component C1) will cover the entire Sierra area, in other words the jurisdiction of the 37 
WUAs (about 400,000 ha of irrigated land and 400,000 irrigation water users), the 
majority of Project activities will only concern 14 WUAs selected for their relative level 
of performance and their potential for the production and commercialization of high 
value crops for internal urban markets and exports.  These 14 WUAs are (corresponding 
Region in parenthesis): Abancay (Apurimac), Alto Piura-Huancabamba (Piura), 
Andahuaylas (Apurimac), CallejÃ³n de Huaylas (Ancash), Cachi (Ayacucho), Colca 
(Arequipa), Cusco (Cusco), Huancavelica (Huancavelica), Lagunillas (Puno), Mantaro 
and Tarma (Junin), Chonta, Condebamba and Mashcon (Cajamarca).  These 14 
prioritized WUAs cover an irrigated area of about 200,000 ha (about 50% of irrigated 
area in the Sierra) and 222,000 water users, equivalent to an average irrigated area per 
farmer of 0.9 ha (see PAD Annex 4, map 1, for the localization of these WUAs).  
Component A would benefit about 15,000 ha of irrigated land (16,000 families) and 
Component B about 4,000 ha (4,000 farmers) within these 14 WUAs.  
 
From a bio-physical point of view, diversity is the central feature of the Sierra, a region 
commonly defined as that part of the Andean mountain range with an altitude of over 
2,000 meters.  Between 2,000 and 4,500 meters, crops and livestock are produced in four 
ecological zones.  At the lowest level, there are the narrow bottom sections of Andean 
valleys.  These have, in general, good alluvial soils, a temperate to subtropical climate 
and the land is mostly irrigated.  Up to 3,200 meters, lower temperate hills and slopes are 
used mainly for maize and cattle. Between 3,200 and 4,000 meters there are higher hills 
and the upper valley slopes. Exposed to frosts, the main crops are wheat, barley and 
traditional Andean grains, as well as tubers.  Cattle and sheep are also kept.  Finally, at 
above 4,000 meters are the high altitude punas, used for pasturing sheep, llamas and 
alpacas.  
 
Irrigation in the project area is usually characterized by low water use efficiency due to 
the wide use of unimproved irrigation technology, deteriorating infrastructure due to poor 
operation and maintenance and inadequate water pricing.  Productivity is low because 
irrigated areas in the Sierra are mainly used for the production of low-value crops, mostly 
for self-consumption and yields are low. Excessive use and unsafe handling of pesticides 
is also a problem in some areas.  Soil degradation including soil erosion and nutrient 
depletion affects some areas, especially the ones located on the slopes of the mountains.  
Increasing water scarcity is a problem, resulting in water conflicts in some of the areas 
and insufficient water to irrigate all the command area most years.   
 
Sustainable growth in the sierra involves tackling a number of environmental problems.  
Of these, the three most pressing are land degradation, water pollution (from domestic 
waste and mining) and the loss of biodiversity, in addition to the above-mentioned 
Page  5
increasing water scarcity.  Land degradation is mostly manifested as soil erosion, fertility 
loss and the impoverishment of natural pasture.Some 52 percent of soils in the sierra are 
thought to be affected by moderate to severe erosion and 4 percent from very severe 
erosion.  In the more populated areas of the sierra, a vicious circle seems to operate 
whereby population pressure leads to land scarcity, land scarcity leads to degradation, 
and degradation leads to greater population pressure.  Irrespective of which agricultural 
growth opportunities are exploited in the Sierra, the prevention and control of land 
degradation has to be part of sound agriculture.  
 
Peru is one of the world's twelve most megadiverse countries. The Sierra hosts some of 
the largest
 national parks and reserves in the Andes (e.g. HuascarÃ¡n NP and Salinas y 
Aguada Blanca Reserve).  Some of the areas are still reserved zones and all are under 
strong pressure from people living in the buffer zones.  Within Sierra agriculture, there is 
a
highly diversified mix of crops and varieties on small farms.  Some crop varieties are 
unique to the Sierra and practically unknown elsewhere.  There are also wild varieties of 
native cultivars.  Modern agriculture may pose a threat to this genetic wealth.  The 
conservation and use of this crop biodiversity is important both in preventing the loss of 
genetic material for use by future generations and to serving the needs of today’s 
smallholding farmers.  The conservation of biodiversity, including agro-biodiversity, is 
consistent with the development of niche products, and good though incipient 
experiences for export these products already exist in the Sierra.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
A
detailed Bank review of potential Project impacts, in terms of their identification, 
measurement, interpretation, information, and communication to information users has 
been conducted in a recent Bank mission (February 2008), concurring with the final step 
Page  6
of the Project EA preparation.  Based on the findings of this mission and the experience 
of the on-going Irrigation Subsector Project in the Coast (PSI-II), including its recently 
initiated pilots in the Sierra, on balance, the Project is expected to produce neutral 
environmental impacts.  No large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are 
foreseen.  Depending on the type of subprojects (on-farm or off-farm irrigation 
infrastructure improvements) however, it could generate positive, neutral or small 
negative impacts, the latter in terms of magnitude and significance, mostly temporary.  
 
O.P. 4.01â
 ”Environmental Assessment 
 
The Project is classified as Category B because its potential adverse environmental 
impacts on human populations or environmentally important areas are site-specific, 
reversible, and can be readily mitigated.  More specifically, the works undertaken as parts 
of component A and B are small to medium in scale.  They would consist of community 
work for the rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation schemes, the 
rehabilitation and construction of small dams (less than 5 meters) and the construction of 
new water intakes to supply existing irrigation schemes.  It is not expected that any 
subprojects will be classified as category A due to their size or expected impacts.  
Potential negative impacts (mostly localized and temporary) where on-farm and off-farm 
irrigation schemes will be rehabilitated and/or modernized, the latter including the 
possibility of new and small infrastructure works, include the following: (a) soil erosion; 
(b) partial destruction of landscape including destruction of small spots of riparian 
vegetation, when existent; (c) surface and ground water pollution, from sediments, 
pesticide residues and fertilizers; (d) change in the environmental value of lagoons not 
considered as critical habitats; (e) disrupting hydrological dynamics; (f) damage to 
historic cultural heritage areas; and (g) noise, toxic waste, dust and air pollution from 
vehicular and construction activities.   
 
Given that the specific location and nature of potential subprojects to be financed under 
Components A and B would only be know during Project implementation, specific 
environmental impacts, location and magnitude cannot be ascertained and a framework 
approach to environment assessment was adopted.  According to the EA/EMF revised by 
the Bank, mitigation measures have been mainstreamed in the subprojects cycle, and 
would require strict subprojects screening, evaluation, approval, and monitoring 
procedures to be incorporated into the project design.  
 
O.P. 4.09â
 ”Pest Management 
 
This policy is triggered because on-farm irrigation improvement (component B) on an 
estimated 4,000 ha should lead to the intensification of agricultural production by shifting 
from low-value crops to higher value crops for exports and internal urban markets, which 
could lead to increase use of pesticides.  A Pest Management Plan has been developed by 
the Borrower, building upon the one for the PSI II that was recently revised (April 2007) 
as the project was extending its activities in four pilot areas of the Sierra.  The PMP’s 
preparation studies identified 10 Category Ib and 9 Category II pesticides commonly used 
in the Sierra, i.e. highly and moderately hazardous pesticides according to WHO 
classification.The proposed Project (as in PSI II) would not finance the procurement of 
pesticides.  However, these agro-chemicals might continue to be used by farmers 
submitting on-farm irrigation subprojects in crops which do not involve organic farming.  
As a result, it was agreed (and included in the EMF and PMP) that irrigation subprojects 
Page  7
would not be eligible if the concerned crop involves the use of WHO Category I; in the 
case of WHO Category II, the subproject design and its environmental assessment 
(informe ambiental preliminar) would describe a proposal for adoption of good practices, 
requiring the adoption of an IPM strategy to ensure that pest management activities are 
sustainable and that health and environmental risks of pesticide use are minimized and 
are of a level that can adequately be managed by the user. In addition, the Project 
(Component C) would promote training in good practices and IPM information 
dissemination.  More specifically, in case of farmers using WHO Category II pesticides, 
the Project will provide more intensive training on pesticides management and distribute 
protection equipment to the farmers and would promote alternatives such as biological 
control, through strategic alliances with large agricultural exporters and/or national with 
national research and extension institutions.  
 
O.P. 4.04â
 ”Natural Habitats 
 
It is expected that the large majority of investments will take place in areas that have 
been traditionally dedicated to agriculture and will therefore not involve conversion of 
natural habitats.  This Policy was triggered because a few subprojects including the 
rehabilitation, improvement or construction of small regulating reservoirs located 
upstream of the irrigation schemes could potentially lead to the inundation of high value 
ecosystems.  Three types of activities could be financed on small regulating reservoirs: 
(a) rehabilitation of existing dykes, without any changes in its height; (b) increasing the 
height of an existing dyke or (c) construct new dykes.  In all cases, dykes would be of 
small size, less than 5 meters in height.  In addition, in areas where the Project would 
support rehabilitation/modernization of existing water intakes, there might be partial de-
characterization of landscape including destruction of small spots of riparian vegetation, 
when existent, and downstream aquatic ecosystems.  The Project’senvironmental 
management rules will explicitly forbid any Project activities in areas supporting critical 
natural habitats.  Any activity in the buffer zone of a protected area would be designed to 
help reduce pressure on the protected area itself.  The EA/EMF includes strict screening 
procedures, incorporating mechanisms to mitigate these potential adverse impacts, as 
well as a negative list of locations considered as critical natural habitats, to exclude those 
sites from project financing (see section 3 below).  
 
OP 4.11â
 ”Physical Cultural Resources 
 
This policy was triggered because of the prevalence of archeological and culturally 
significant sites and artifacts in the Sierra Region.  The Project will finance small-scale 
works in already established agricultural zones where there is little likelihood of 
disturbing archaeological, paleontological, or other culturally significant sites.  In any 
case, such impacts will be avoided through application of the subproject eligibility 
criteria and the safeguard screening system, and inclusion of “chance find” procedures in 
the contracts for any subproject involving works.  The EMF includes these screening 
procedures, incorporating mechanisms to mitigate these potential adverse impacts, 
including a negative list of locations considered as culturally significant sites, to exclude 
those places from project financing (see section 3 below).  
 
OP/BP 4.12â
 ”Involuntary Resettlement 
 
Contrary to what was foreseen at the identification stage, the Project does not trigger 
OP/BP 4.12 because it involves no taking of land or other assets and requires no physical 
Page  8
relocation of populations.  The subproject eligibility criteria and safeguard screening 
process would exclude any subproject that could involve such impacts.  
 
OP/BP 4.37 - Safety of Dams  
 
This policy was triggered because (a) some of the irrigated areas that will be improved 
depend on dams for their water supply and (b) some subprojects may include the 
construction or rehabilitation of small dams (less than 5 meters of height).  For new small 
dams, the EMF incorporates generic dam safety measures designed by qualified 
engineers; for existing dams, provision for conducing dam safety reviews by independent 
dam safety specialists have been included.  
 
OP/BP 4.10â
 ”Indigen
ous Peoples  
 
Since individual subprojects will only be identified during Project implementation, and 
because the Bank’s screening process indicates that Indigenous People are likely to be 
present in the Project area, but their presence cannot be determined until the subprojects 
are identified, the Borrower has prepared an Indigenous People Planning Framework 
(IPPF).  The IPPF provides for the screening and review of subprojects in a manner 
consistent with Bank safeguards policy.  When subprojects screening process indicates 
that Indigenous Peoples are present in the area of the subprojects, an Indigenous People 
Plan (IPP) will be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Bank policy.  The 
generic Terms of Reference for this IPP have been included in the IPPF.  The IPPF has 
been prepared based on a social assessment made for six of the 14 WUAs targeted for 
irrigation infrastructure improvement: Ayachucho (Ayacucho), Juliaca (Puno), Colca-
Chivay (Arequipa), Mantaro (Junin), MashcÃ³n (Cajamarca) and Chonta-Cajamarquino 
(Cajamarca).  The Borrower also developed a participatory and inclusive consultation 
process that accompanied the IPPF in four areas of the Project: Mantaro (Junin), Colca-
Chivay (Arequipa), Juliaca (Puno) and Ayacucho (Ayacucho).  Finally, the Borrower 
prepared an IPP as a reference to all the areas of intervention.  For this IPP the area of 
Colca-Chivay (Arequipa) was selected for the report.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No significant indirect or long tem or cumulative impacts are foreseen.  However, as 
mentioned, subprojects supported under Components A and B would go through a strict 
screening process to ensure maximum socioeconomic and environmental benefits are 
accrued and any unintended negative environmental impacts are avoided or minimized, 
including those eventually associated to secondary or indirect and long term effects.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
One alternative considered for the project was to work intensively in the Sierra but 
continue with some activities in the Coast, mainly on WUOs strengthening.This 
alternative was rejected by the GOP who considered a priority to generate additional 
socioeconomic benefits in the country by concentrating resources in the Sierra, as the 
Coast already benefited from phases I and II of PSI.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
O.P. 4.01â
 ”Environmental Assessment 
 
In accordance with this classification, an environmental assessment (EA), including an 
Environmental Management Framework (EMF) or Marco de GestiÃ³n Ambiental, has 
been prepared by the Borrower and reviewed by the Bank.  The EA and EMF specifies 
the criteria and proceduresâ
 ”including operating rulesâ ”that will be used during Project 
implementation to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.The EA also 
includes a preliminary negative list of locations considered as critical habitats, within the 
jurisdiction of the 14 WUAs, so as to exclude those sites from project financing (a final 
list will be provided and submitted for Bank negative will be provided and and submitted 
for Bank review before Project effectiveness).  For a brief description of the project 
environmental procedures, see PAD Annex 10.  
 
O.P. 4.09â
 ”Pest Management 
 
A
Pest Management Plan has been prepared by the Borrower, building upon the one for 
the PSI II that was recently revised (April 2007) as the Project was extending its activities 
in four pilot areas of the Sierra.  
 
O.P. 4.04â
 ”Natural Habitats 
 
The EMP is explicitly forbidding any Project activities in areas supporting critical 
natural habitats.  It also ensures that any activity in the buffer zone of a protected area 
would be designed to help reduce pressure on the protected area itself.  The EA/ EMF 
includes strict screening procedures, incorporating mechanisms to mitigate these potential 
adverse impacts (for a brief description of these procedures, see PAD Annex 10). The EA 
has identified the locations and types of natural habitats in the 14 project supported 
irrigation districts, and a preliminary list of critical habitats, including Ramsar sites and 
Protected Areas managed mainly for strict protection and ecosystem conservation – 
National Parks and National Sanctuaries (“Santuarios Nacionales”).  The final version of 
the Operational Manual (foreseen for January 2009, i.e. prior to Project effectiveness) 
will include the Project’s final/complete negative list of locations considered as critical 
natural habitats, so as to exclude those sites from Project financing.  This final list is 
being finalized by the National Institute for Natural Resources (INRENA) and would 
stem from the provisional list of “Ecosistemas FrÃ¡giles y Ã?
reas Prioritarias para la 
ConservaciÃ³n de la Biodiversidad en el PerÃº”.  
 
OP 4.11â
 ”Physical Cultural Resources 
 
The EMF includes screening procedures, incorporating mechanisms to mitigate 
potential adverse impacts on physical cultural resources and inclusion of “chance find” 
procedures in the contracts for any subproject involving works. As mentioned above, the 
EMF (and the Operational Manual) includes a preliminary negative list of locations 
considered as culturally significant sites, to exclude those places from project financing. 
The final version of the Operational Manual (foreseen for January 2009, i.e. prior to 
Project effectiveness) will include the Project’s final/complete negative list of locations.  
 
OP/BP 4.12â
 ”Involuntary Resettlement 
 
The Project does not trigger OP/BP 4.12 because it involves no taking of land or other 
assets and requires no physical relocation of populations.  The subproject eligibility 
criteria and safeguard screening process would exclude any subproject that could involve 
such impacts.  
Page  10
OP/BP 4.37 - Safety of Dams  
 
For new small dams, the EMF incorporates generic dam safety measures designed by 
qualified engineers; for existing dams, provision for conducing dam safety reviews by 
independent dam safety specialists have been included.  
 
OP/BP 4.10â
 ”Indigenous Peoples 
 
Since individual subprojects will only be identified during Project implementation, and 
because the Bank’s screening process indicates that Indigenous People are likely to be 
present in the Project area, but their presence cannot be determined until the subprojects 
are identified, the Borrower has prepared an Indigenous People Planning Framework 
(IPPF).  The Borrower conducted free, prior and informed consultations with potential 
affected communities during the preparation stage of the Project.  The IPPF provides for 
the screening and review of subprojects in a manner consistent with Bank safeguards 
policy.  When subprojects screening process indicates that Indigenous Peoples are present 
in the area of the subprojects, a rapid social assessment and Indigenous People Plan will 
be prepared in accordance with the requirements of Bank policy.  The generic Terms of 
Reference for this social assessment and IPP were included in the IPPF.  It is important to 
highlight that the IPPF was prepared based on the results of  six social assessments of the 
14 WUAs targeted for irrigation infrastructure improvement, they are: Ayacucho 
(Ayacucho), Juliaca (Puno), Colca - Chivay (Arequipa), Mantaro (Junin), MashcÃ³n 
(Cajamarca) y Chonta-Cajamarquino (Cajamarca). The Borrower also developed a 
participatory and inclusive consultation process that accompanied the IPPF in four areas 
of the project, Mantaro (Junin), Colca - Chivay (Arequipa), Juliaca (Puno), and Ayacucho 
(Ayacucho).  Finally, the Borrower prepared an IPP as a reference to all the areas of 
intervention. For this IPP the area of Colca - Chivay (Arequipa) was selected for the 
report.  
 
Borrower’s capacity to plan and implement measures described above  
 
PSI capacity will have to be strengthened in order to implement the measures described 
above.  The existing EA capacity established within PSI II will be increased with four 
staff to support subprojects EA review in the Sierra (one at the central level and three at 
the regional level).  It is also foreseen that the Project will hire three social specialists at 
the regional level.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Main stakeholders in the areas of the Project are: (i) the water users and water users 
organization associations, informal and formalized groups; (ii) farmers and farmers’ 
groups (iii) local authorities, mayor and presidents of the regions; (iv) local civil society 
organizations, NGOs, thematic groups, task force groups, networks and consortiums; (v) 
women and youth organizations, (vi) think tank and academy sector working in rural 
development, irrigation and agriculture.  
 
The mechanism for consultations of civil society organizations and stakeholders are 
mainly workshops and focus groups organized by areas of intervention, such as irrigation, 
agriculture, commercialization, environment, national resources and rural development. 
Page  11
Consultations can be more productive when the selection of participants focused on areas 
of intervention and site of action.  
 
The EA report, PMP, EMP, SAs and IPPF was subject to public consultation meetings 
with a broad range of stakeholders in which environmental issues (potential 
environmental impacts and benefits) have been discussed.  The EA is available at: (i) the 
PSI home page indicated below; (ii) INRENA’s library; (ii) INRENA’s EA Unit 
(OGATEIRN); and MINAG’s central archive.
