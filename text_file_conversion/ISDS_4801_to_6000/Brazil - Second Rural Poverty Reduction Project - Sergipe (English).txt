2. Project Objectives 
Building on the CDD approach utilized successfully under the first phase project, the 
second phase Rural Poverty Reduction Project: Sergipe (RPRP2) would support the 
Government of Sergipe in its efforts to reduce rural poverty under its "development with 
inclusion" strategy by: (a) improving access of the rural poor to basic socioeconomic 
infrastructure: (b) raising incomes and capital assets through investments in productive 
activities and facilitating linkages between small producers and markets; and (c) 
promoting the cross-sector integration of investments in rural areas through strengthened 
participatory planning, decision-making and monitoring at the community, municipal and 
state levels.   
 
3. Project Description 
Total project cost is estimated at US$27.1 million.  A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of 
US$20.8 million would finance:  
Page  2
Component 1 - Community Subprojects: to provide matching grants to community 
associations to finance their implementation of about 1,000 small-scale socioeconomic 
infrastructure and services (water supply, electricity, sanitation, education and health, 
cultural and environmental activities) and productive, market-oriented investments. 
Community associations, through their participatory Municipal Councils (known in 
Sergipe as CONDEM), will identify, prioritize, implement, operate and maintain 
subproject investments, drawing on an information campaign conducted by the State to 
help to promote understanding of project objectives, eligibility and rules and on the 
project Operational Manual.  
 
Component 2 - Institutional Development:  executed by the Sustainable Development 
Company of the State of Sergipe (PRONESE), would include (a) technical assistance and 
training to support the mobilization and strengthening of community associations in their 
role of identifying, preparing, executing, operating and maintaining subproject 
investments; (b) capacity-building for project Municipal Councils on their responsibilities 
outlined in the project Operational Manual, including assessment and supervision of 
community associations, participatory planning and the financial management of 
community subprojects, and environmental management for these subprojects; and (c) 
workshops and seminars for Municipal Councils and community associations to 
exchange experiences with project implementation and facilitate integration with other 
federal and state poverty reduction programs.  
 
Component 3 - Horizontal Integration: to provide technical assistance to the State 
Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN) to strengthen its  results-based management capacity 
to plan, integrate, monitor and evaluate public policies and investments for poverty 
reduction, and to improve the alignment of public expenditures with the State's 
development priorities, as outlined in the State Multi-annual Development Plan (PPA, 
2008-2011).  It will also include training events for municipalities to assist them in 
integrating federal and state poverty reduction programs.  
 
Component 4 - Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation:  to 
support the costs (excluding salaries) of project administration/coordination, supervision, 
monitoring and impact evaluation.  
 
Types of activities under this community demand-driven project will be similar to the 
first phase project but with greater emphasis on certain aspects, as follows:  
 
(a) Productive, income-generating investments to help increase the State's Human 
Development Index will receive more focused attention. These inherently more complex 
subprojects mandate tight screening processes including economic, social and 
environmental analysis and more systematic technical assistance, supervision and 
marketing support.  Demand is expected to be strong.  Productive investments financed 
under the first phase project were 162% of the appraisal estimate and about 31% of all 
investments financed.  
 
Page  3
(b) The project will intensify its approach to integration - initiated successfully under 
the first phase loan.  As conceived, other federal and state programs will use - in parallel - 
the project-created operational mechanisms (participatory Municipal Councils and 
community associations)to allocate resources for a range of complementary investments 
designed to deepen and accelerate development impact.  The STU, PRONESE, will also 
continue to strengthen partinerships with federal, state and municipal authorities, and 
other entities which provide training to community associations.  
 
(c)  The project would also continue to give priority to ethnic groups (indigenous and 
Quilombola) and to women and youth through information dissemination in appropriate 
forms, mobilization and financing for eligible investments.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will cover 71 municipalities in Sergipe, with 70% of component resources 
concentrated in the 41 poorest municipalities (i.e., HDI <0.623).

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The first phase project (closed end-December, 2006, the Sergipe Rural Poverty Reduction 
Project (classified as Category B) applied several environmental "screens" to the 
technical assessment of subproject proposals, and operated on the basis of a project 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Operational Manual which have functioned 
in a satisfactory manner.   
 
Page  4
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No indirect negative impacts or long-term impacts are anticipated.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
NA   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
A.  Safeguards applying to the project and measures to be applied are as follows:  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01):  
 
1.   The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the proposed RPRP-2 project 
describes the legal, institutional and operational context, requirements and procedures for 
ensuring that environmental issues are addressed throughout project implementation. 
These represent both a continuation of successful practices established under RPRP-1 
(2002-2006), updated with new developments and activities required under more recent 
environmental legislation in the State of Sergipe, and by lessons learned from the first 
phase project (RPRP-1) and similar projects in eight other states of the Northeast. The 
EMP also reflects current Bank Safeguards requirements and responds to questions 
identified in the Bank report e
ntitled “Thematic Review – Rural Infrastructure Projects in 
Brazil” (QAT Thematic Review, 2002).  
 
2.  The EMP addresses the following aspects of environmental management:  
 
•
Ensuring that the Project is fully compliant with relevant State and Federal 
environmental legislation and with Bank Safeguards;  
 
•
Assessing adverse and/or positive environmental impacts associated with the 
financed subprojects, both individually and collectively;  
 
•
Identifying opportunities for employment generation and income through 
activities to protect, restore, conserve and/or properly value the environment;  
 
•
Building into all eligible subprojects activities designed to protect, restore, 
conserve and/or properly value the environment;   
 
•
Generating synergies between productive activities, community development 
andenvironmental protection, including the formation of localized linkages between 
subprojects and other public or private initiatives;  
 
•
Training for all involved parties, particularly the beneficiary public, to promote 
environmental management, both in regard to subprojects and in overall environmental 
issues;  
 
•
Joint management of environmental issues between the project, local and 
stateentities; and  
 
•
Linking environmental conservation and protection activities with poverty-related 
investments consistent with the State’s Multi-annual Development Plan (PPA,2008-
2011).  
Page  5
Environmental Evaluation Cycle:  
 
3.  Environmental evaluation of each subproject prior to its financing is already a 
standard and adhered-to procedure designed to prevent, minimize or mitigate eventual 
adverse effects on the environment.  Basic screening includes:  
 
•
Use of standard subproject designs for the most commonly-demanded and/or 
technically difficult subprojects, incorporating environmental analysis and mitigation 
features;  
 
•
Applying a checklist of environmental elements to all subprojects during their 
design and approval phases, and obtaining environmental licenses from state agencies for 
those which require this procedure;  
 
•
Monitoring compliance with Bank Safeguards throughout the subproject cycle, 
and ensuring compliance with state and federal environmental laws.  
 
•
No agreement is signed or funding transferred until environmental viability is 
determined.  Further, no subprojects that: (a) harm natural habitats or (b) include the use 
of pesticides, will be approved for funding.  
 
Upgraded/new procedures for RPRP-2 include:  
 
•
Environmental worksheets;  
 
•
Pre-selection and environmental classification of subprojects into CategoriesA, B 
and C depending on assessed potential impact;   
 
•
Identification of opportunities for environmental subprojects;  
 
•
Introduction of Participatory Environmental Assessments by communities;  
 
•
Introduction of Assessments of Aggregate (cumulative) Impact;  
 
•
Indicator-based, subproject environmental monitoring; and  
 
•
Demonstration of alternative, environment-friendly technologies.  
 
Public Consultation:  
 
Public consultation has been conducted within the proceedings to prepare the Sergipe 
Participatory Master Plan for Territorial Development (PP).  The project was presented at 
numerous municipal meetings, reaching some 22,000 rural participants/stakeholders. The 
preliminary version of the EMP has been available in the project website 
(http://www.pronese.se.gov.br) since 2005.  The 2008 updated version of the EMP was 
reviewed by the Bank, submitted to the Infoshop on July 23, 2008, and made available 
through the State Technical Unit website (as above).  
 
For details, see PAD, Annex 11 and project Operational Manual.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10):  
 
1.  Indigenous: Sergipe has one legally-recognized indigenous ethnic grouping –the 
XokÃ³ – located in the municipality of Porto da Folha and numbering of about360 
Page  6
people.  They no longer speak their original language and today communicate in 
Portuguese. Under the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project (1996-
2001), the AssociaÃ§Ã£o 
IndÃ­gena Povoado XokÃ³, a community association representing this 
group,successfully submitted a subproject proposal to finance agricultural mechanization 
valued at US$24,820 and benefiting 68 families. A second proposal for a manioc mill 
submitted in 2005 under RPRP-1 was approved by the Porto da Folha Municipal Council 
-
in which the XokÃ³ community had actively participated since 1999 -but not financed 
due to declining funds in the project’s final stages.  
 
2.  Quilombola: There are also 15 quilombola (African slave-descendent) communities 
certified by the FundaÃ§Ã£o Cultural Palmares and 19 others claiming quilombola 
identity.  To date, some 25 of these 34 communities have benefited from 46 community 
subprojects under the RPRP program representing a total investment of about US$1.3 
million, benefiting over 5,000 families (with repetition).  
 
3.  The RPRP-2 will continue to support these groups by extending coverage to groups 
not already reached and intensifying actions for those already served. XokÃ³ and 
quilombola communities will continue to be brought into the project through culturally 
appropriate communications and outreach campaigns developed in collaboration with 
indigenous entities/local leaders and designed to help these traditional peoples understand 
project objectives and procedures.  This will be complemented by a training and capacity-
building program developed in collaboration with relevant State and Federal agencies, 
NGOs and institutions in the region. The objective is to ensure open and equitable 
participation of traditional communities in the project (See PAD Annex 11 and project 
Operational Manual).  
 
4.  The Traditional Community Participation Plan is an integral part of the project 
Operational Manual, reviews the experiences with indigenous peoples and quilombola 
communities under the previous project as well as lessons learned, and defines guidelines 
and specific procedures for engaging these communities in project activities. This 
document is being submitted to the InfoShop and it is already available through the State 
Technical Unit website (http://www.pronese.se.gov.br).  
 
Public Consultation:  
 
5.  Public consultation on all aspects of Project design – including support totraditional 
communities – has been conducted effectively through the participatory MCs in which 
representatives of traditional communities have actively participated since 
implementation of the RPAP. This process will continue under RPRP-2.  The MCs 
provide open forums which meet regularly and are recognized as legitimate, inclusive 
chambers for local consultation and decision-making.  During project preparation, 
consultations took place between XokÃ³ leaders and expert anthropologists, The 
Traditional Communities’ Participation Plan is being submitted tothe InfoShop and it is 
already available on the website of the project State Technical Unit 
(http://www.pronese.se.gov.br).  
 
Page  7
6.  In addition, many public, consultative events have been arranged by PRONESE since 
2006 to discuss the RPRP specifically or as part of a broader agenda, in the context of its 
approach to the development of traditional populations:  
 
(a) In partnership with Banco do Nordeste and the Ministry of Agrarian Development, 
PRONESE brought 2,700 people together in four regional events to promote the 
Programa Terra de Negro (a special line of the National Credito Fundiario Program 
(PNCF) designed for quilombola land settlements) and disseminate information on the 
Bank-supported RPRP.  
 
(b) In 2007, a state-level meeting was held with the participation of the Movimento dos 
Sem Terra (MST), the Sergipe Federation of Rural Workers (FETASE) and the Sergipe 
Quilombo Coodination to discuss state policies, including the RPRP,  targeting traditional 
communities.  
 
(c) All 75 municipal State-sponsored conferences 
–
coordinated by the State Secretary 
of Planning and designed to prepare Territorial Development Plans and discuss programs 
including the RPRP - dealt with issues of social inclusion, ethnic diversity, racial 
tolerance and traditional communities. Meetings were held in 15 municipalities with 
traditional populations, 13 of which are within the RPRP-2 area. Another eight regional 
meetings and one state-level event covered the same themes.  
 
(d) Two meetings were held recently by PRONESE to work on the strategy for 
participation of traditional communities in the RPRP-2: (i) with representatives of the 
state agency created to mobilize, organize, and support quilombola communities 
(COOPIR/SETRAPIS); and (ii) with the Diversity, Identity and Citizenship Unit of the 
State Secretariat of Education, responsible for delivering public education to indigenous 
and quilombola peoples.  
 
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04):  
 
As discussed in the EMP and further detailed in the project Operational Manual, neither 
the State, nor the Bank, through the Project, will approve subprojects which cause 
degradation to essential natural habitats.  The EMP provides (a) a list of Federal and State 
Conservation Units in Sergipe; (b) a list of identified, valuable and sensitive areas and 
eco-systems; and (c) a list of areas for which new Conservation Units are being proposed.  
This information will help identify valuable natural habitat areas.  
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09):  
 
The EMP already defines a process, including screening criteria in the project 
Operational Manual, for detecting the potential use of pesticides under both the RPRP-1 
and proposed RPRP-2.  Where appropriate, the proposed project already promotes 
integrated pest management approaches under subproject investments.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11):  
Page  8
In the event of “chance finds”, the project Operational Manual already 
outlinesprocedures to be followed in the event of such discovery of culturally-significant 
materials during subproject implementation.  
 
B.  Borrower Capacity:  
 
1.  PRONESE, the State Technical Unit for the first-phase of this two-phase operation, 
has complied fully with Bank Safeguards and project environmental rules.  
Environmental considerations are built in throughout the subproject cycle.  Special 
activities to further improve environmental understanding and/or performance are 
organized when needed, and the standardized subproject designs use the upgraded 
environmental checklist.  
 
2.  PRONESE has a staff of 29 graduates with specializations in agriculture/land, 
environmental sciences, social sciences and economics, as well as 20 technicians and 51 
administrative, financial and legal personnel.  The STU can call on specialized 
consultants in irrigation, environment, water resources and social sciences and has open 
access to all state environmental agencies (see EMP, Operational Manual and project file) 
to analyze, monitor and supervise environmental safeguards.  PRONESE staff provides 
advice on subproject preparation and coordinates subproject activities with the 
community associations (CA) and Municipal Councils (MC). They also supervise 
subproject implementation, including compliance with project environmental norms.  
 
3.  In 2005, PRONESE's Administrative Council approved the creation of a new STU 
unit, the Environmental Quality Technical Group (NTGA), currently being 
established/staffed.  NTGA will consist of specialists in biology, agronomy, 
environmental management, forestry and civil engineering and will have access to 
support from specialized public and private entities: State Department for Agricultural 
Development (DEAGRO); State Secretariat of Environment and Water resources 
(SEMARH); State Secretariat for Science and Technology (SEDETEC); Brazilian 
Institute for the Environment (IBAMA); Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation 
(EMBRAPA); Brazilian Institute for Support to Small and Micro Enterprise (SEBRAE-
SE); Federal University of Sergipe; Tiradentes University; and, ArticulaÃ§Ã£o do Semi-
Arido (ASA/Sergipe), as well as other NGOs specialized in environment and sustainable 
development.  
 
4.  The objective of NTGA is to ensure that community subprojects do not have 
negative impacts on the environment by: (a) supporting the process of obtaining 
Environmental Licenses for subprojects, when needed; (b) submitting requests to 
SEMARH for Water Use Permits, when needed; (c) evaluating subproject proposals from 
the environmental perspective, recommending mitigation actions where needed; (d) 
validating the pre-selection and classification of subproject proposals by the MCs for 
environmental screening, and assisting the screening process itself; and (e) preparing 
training programs and information campaigns for the CAs and MCs and PRONESE itself 
Page  9
and for broader environmental education, to raise societal awareness for the prevention, 
detection and resolution of environmental problems.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
A.  Key Stakeholders:  
 
The primary stakeholders are poor rural communities organized into Community 
Associations and project Municipal Councils, with particular focus on Quilombola 
(African slave-descendent)
 communities, indigenous groups (XokÃ³), female-headed 
households and young people, generally among the poorest.  Secondary stakeholders 
include State and local/municipal authorities and civil society linked to and integrated 
with the project throughout its implementation cycle.  
 
B.  Mechanisms for Consultation and Disclosure:  
 
Public consultation on all aspects of project design including environmental standards 
and requirements and indigenous populations has been conducted effectively through the 
participatory Municipal Councils and through state-wide information dissemination 
activities which are ongoing/continuous via various media.  As noted in section 4 above, 
the Councils provide open forums which meet regularly,  include the participation of 
technical specialists and representatives of State and Municipal programs, and are 
recognized as legitimate, inclusive chambers for information dissemination and debate, 
priority-setting and decision-making. See also Section 4 above for specific 
environment/Safeguards-related forms of public consultation.
