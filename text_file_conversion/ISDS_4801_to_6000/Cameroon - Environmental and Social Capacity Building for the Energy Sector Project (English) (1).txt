2. Project Objectives 
Cameroon is facing development decisions in the energy sector that will by themselves 
have far-reaching consequences for the natural and social environments, and the 
development that will be enabled in other sectors by the availability of new energy at new 
locations will have additional impacts.  PReCESSE is being designed to enhance the 
probability that as many of those consequences as possible will be positive.  This is 
guided by three principles: (i) addressing governance including anticorruption, (ii) 
reinforcing management for results, and (iii) strengthening partnerships, alignment and 
harmonization.  
 
The development objective of the project would be to:  
 
Improve the management of and accountability for environmental and social issues 
related to large infrastructure investments.  
 
The Project would initially focus capacity building efforts towards the energy sector, in 
support of the Energy Sector Development Project and the PRG for the Kribi power 
project.  The mobilization of supplemental resources to more explicitly address issues in 
the minin
g
and transport sectors would we explored during the projectís mid-term 
review.  
Page  2
The expected long-term benefits of the project are to: (i) reduce the negative 
externalities of large infrastructure projects, and (ii) develop a transparent, stable and fair 
framework for managing environmental and social risks that should comfort large 
infrastructure investments, and (iii) institutionalizes information flows between the 
populations affected by large infrastructure projects and other stakeholders, and political 
decision-makers   
 
3. Project Description 
The Project would include the following three components:  
 
Component 1 (US$8 million).  Strengthening the Ministry in charge of the Environment 
to fulfill its mandate to define, monitor and control environmental and social obligations 
of large infrastructure project operators, in compliance with the environmental law of 
1996 and its implementation decrees.  The project would fund: (i) technical expertise in 
the application of environmental regulations, (ii) the preparation of sectoral guidelines for 
the electricity, mining and transport sectors, in cooperation with relevant departments and 
private investors, (iii) harmonization of national environmental standards and procedures 
with international best practices (The Project would support Cameroon to develop its own 
standards and procedures based on international best practices.  These best practices 
would include: (i) standards for equipment and products, (ii) environmental practices, 
including limits on emissions, or waste disposal methods, and (iii) environmental 
management procedures and systems.Sources of international best practices include: (i) 
international conventions, treaties and agreements, (ii) the guidelines of NGOs and 
international organizations, such as the World Conservation Union (IUCN), the United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the International Standards Organisation 
(ISO), the World Bank, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), and the World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and (iii) industry guidelines, 
voluntary codes of conduct and statements of environmental principles prepared by 
professional or industry associations, such as the International Association of Oil and Gas 
Producers); and (iv) the development of capacity to manage the EA process and to verify 
compliance, either directly or though a delegation of authority to sector ministries.  
 
Component 2 (US$9 million).  Establishing frameworks to manage social externalities 
associated with large infrastructure projects, in compliance with international best 
practices.  The component would strengthen the ministries of Social Affairs, of Health, of 
Culture, and of Lands, each according to its statutory mandates, building on the lessons 
of the Chad Cameroon Project.  More specifically, the project would: (i) provide 
assistance to the Ministry of Social Affairs, which is the governmental structure in charge 
of marginalized populations including Indigenous Peoples, and through the Ministry to 
provide support to the FEDEC, (ii) build capacity within the Ministry of State Property 
and Land Affairs and help harmonizing the national legislation on involuntary 
resettlement and land issues, (iii) strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Culture, 
which is in charge of monitoring of impacts of projects on physical cultural resources, 
and (iv) provide assistance to the Ministry of Health to better manage the impacts of large 
infrastructure projects, most notably dams, on human health.  The project would also 
strengthen the capacity of civil society organizations to serve as intermediaries for the 
concerns of civil society, and as sentries to ensure the full implementation of national 
regulations.  
Page  3
Component 3 (US$3.0 million).  Supporting the Environment Unit in the Ministry of 
Energy and Water, to ensure that the environmental and social issues arising from large 
energy sector infrastructure projects are addressed in compliance with international best 
practices.  The Ministry of Energy and Water is the structure responsible for defining and 
monitoring the implementation of the Energy Sector policy.  Most particularly, the 
project would support the unit to: (i) monitor and advise on the preparation of 
environmental assessments, audits and EMPs for energy sector infrastructure projects, 
prior to their submission to the Ministry of Environment for their review, (ii) trigger and 
monitor the preparation of security, social and environmental audits for existing 
infrastructure, in compliance with the 2005 EA decree (dams, power plants, power lines, 
distribution networks), (iii) participate in monitoring the implementation of management 
plans approved by the Ministry of Environment, (iv) contribute to the preparation of 
environmental and social guidelines for the electricity sector, and (v) oversee the 
preparation of a Social and Environmental Assessment for the Energy Sector.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Project does not include or directly help to prepare investments that might directly 
trigger any of the World Bankís safeguard policies.  Nonetheless, the project will 
indirectly help with the management of other investments, most particularly in the energy 
sector and thus exposes the bank to reputational risks, most particularly:  
Page  4
(i) 
the Government may not understand or respect the need for transparency in 
developing and implementing environmental management procedures, guidelines and 
regulations, and may act in non-transparent ways;  
 
(ii) 
the Government may make unsound and/or non-transparent decisions on future 
projects in energy, mining, transport, or regional development, and the Bank may be seen 
as somehow responsible, having financed the capacity-building that theoretically would 
have prevented such things from happening; and  
 
(iii) 
the environmental community at large may suspect the Bank of being an enabler 
for rapid development (or as colluding with the Government, utility company, mining 
companies, etc.), rather than a promoter of environmentally and socially sustainable 
development and a protector of valuable natural, cultural and human resources.  
 
(iv) 
As with all capacity-building projects, the project may not work for a variety of 
reasons such as: incompetent consultants; implementing arrangements that either stress 
the agencies by adding the burden of supporting and supervising the consultants, or waste 
the consultants' time because the agencies cannot respond, or both; senior officials that 
haven't bought into the project and don't listen to and follow up on the recommended 
measures and programs.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No long-term impact as this is a capacity building project.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
As a consequence, the project was categorized as a B, and disclosure requirements apply.  
To address these risks, the Task Team will get agreement at appraisal with the 
Government on a document (Annex 10) that will present:  
 
(v) 
the broad terms of reference (i.e., the scope of work, in as much detail as is 
possible at this stage) for capacity-building in each project component;  
 
(vi) 
the working arrangements (e.g., individual specialists, a firm or firms, 
secondment of officials to work in teams with the experts, etc.);  
 
(vii) 
the review and approval arrangements: who in the client agencies will review, 
comment on, and eventually accept the products of the TA;  
 
(viii)  the responsibilities for the overall direction of each component;  
 
(ix) 
the process and responsibilities for decision-making with respect to adoption and 
implementation of recommendations and materials produced; and  
 
(x) 
a timetable for periodic updates to stakeholders on progress of the TA.  
 
The draft document has already circulated among the project stakeholders, including 
participating CSOs.  The Task Team would also that the draft document is fully discussed 
during appraisal, including discussions with participating CSOs.  Once agreed, the 
document will be publicly disclosed as if it were a safeguards document, both in country 
and at the InfoShop.  
Page  5
The purpose of the project is to build effective capacity to implement the provisions of 
Cameroonís environmental regulations. There is currently sufficient capacity to start the 
project including the measures spelled out in the document.However, further capacity 
must be developed during the project to fully meet its objectives, particularly in terms of 
monitoring the investor commitment spelled out in their EMPs, and enforcing 
regulations.  
 
Beyond overall limitations in implementation capacity, the keystone to the successful 
implementation of the proposed measures is the willingness of MinEP and other 
ministries to implement the project in a transparent manner.  Disclosure of the safeguards 
document is a major confirmation of this willingness.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The basic consultation mechanism will be the regular project coordination meetings of 
the 12 project focal points (2 each for MinEP, MinAS, MinDAF, MinSant√©, Min 
Culture, and CSOs, chaired by the Project Coordinator.  CSO participation at all steps of 
the project would ensure transparency of its implementation.  Regular consultations with 
CSOs during preparation, either directly or during coordination meetings attended by the 
Bank, have ensured that they fully understand and share the projectís objectives.  
 
Furthermore, as part of Component 1, MinEP will organize a consultation platform for 
the electricity sector, involving: (i) Government, as custodians of regulatory processes 
and national policy, (ii) industry operators, such as AES-Sonel, AluCam, and EDC, and 
(iii) the NGO and CSO community.  The electricity sector platform would take example 
on the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline platform that was implemented as part of the CAPECE.  
During the preparation of the Energy Project, the Bank organized a consultation with 
NGOs and CSOs and made the commitment to institutionalize such meetings.
