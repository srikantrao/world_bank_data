II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project does not trigger World Bank EA safeguard policy (OP/BP/GP 4.01).  The 
project consists of the provision of new multi-system electric locomotives, and new 
sliding door covered freight wagons. The environmental screening of the project has 
determined that no activity within the project will have any adverse impacts on the 
environment.  The project is not financing the disposal of any locomotives or wagons 
and, moreover as the procurement of locomotives and wagons is to meet increasing 
demand for freight transport, provision will not result in the withdrawal or disposal of 
any of the current fleet of either wagons or locomotives.  Accordingly, it has been 
determined that OP 4.01 has not been triggered and project has been assigned a 
“Category C” environmental rating.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A
