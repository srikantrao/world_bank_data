  2. Project Objectives:
  The carbon operation (P098638) is envisaged under the Lagos Metropolitan Development and
 Governance project (P071340). The Project objective for LMDGP is to increase sustainable access to
 basic urban services through investments in critical infrastructure. Progress towards achieving the
 objective of the project will be measured through (i) increase in the percentage of population with access
 to safe water in the selected 9 slums; (ii) reduction in the percentage of households reporting flooding in
 the LGs where the selected drainage basins lie; (iii) increase in the percentage of generated garbage in
 Lagos that arrives for disposal at landfills; and (iv) reduced deviation between actual expenditures and the
 approved budget. The landfill gas component will support the achievement of objective (iii) above and
 the carbon revenues will support objective (iv) above.

maintenance of tertiary infrastructure; (ii) technical assistance (TA) for LASURA to support development
of a city-wide upgrading program; (iii) TA for Ministry of Physical Planning to develop policies for the
prevention of future slums; (iv) support to LGs to deliver a HIVIAIDS awareness campaign; and (v)
Conflict Resolution.
A2.      Drainage: US$62.64 million: The drainage component will develop a long-term technical
solution to flooding. It will support: (i) the highest priority civil works investments to mitigate flooding;
(ii) the establishment of an efficient GIS database management system using satellite imagery with
relevant GIS software; (iii) a rational reassessment of drain designs to develop a prioritized construction
program; (iv) a deferred maintenance program to clear the large volumes of solid waste, silt, and
vegetation which has built up over the years in the absence of adequately funded drainage maintenance
programs; (v) the development of a routine maintenance program to mitigate the extensive flooding that
annually plagues the city; (vi) technical assistance and training to the ODS; and (vii) Conflict Resolution.
A3.      Solid Waste Management: US58.48 million: Solid waste activities will be unbundled to
segregate collection, transfer, and disposal activities; and initiate private sector participation in transfer
and disposal activities. The project will finance (i) civil works for the upgrading of six transfer stations,
and two landfill sites; (ii) communal depots; (iii) technical assistance to L A W A develop appropriate
solid waste collection routes, contract instruments for private sector collection, and contract instruments
for the management of transfer stations and landfills with contracts for disposal and transfer being
financed by IDA; (iv) an Information, Education and Communication Campaign to raise awareness on
solid waste issues in the city; (v) a HIVIAIDS awareness campaign on project sites; (vi) technical
assistance to support LASEPA and MoE to enable them to better discharge their functions; and (vii)
evaluations of the overall functioning of the solid waste management system in Lagos thrice during
implementation.

B.       Public Governanceand CapacityBuilding: US$7.9million

     institutional reforms and capacity building initiatives (some of which are already identified), including
     records management, public expenditure tracking in specific sectors, leadership training, city-wide
     consultative forums around specific metropolitan growth and poverty related issues, and enhancement of
     LG performance.
     B3.      Economic Intelligence and Service Delivery Monitoring (US$1.3 million). The project will
     support the Office of Statistics to undertake data collection and analysis growth and poverty reduction in
     support of MEPB's role for M&E. Thedatawill help agencies plan and prioritize expenditures, monitor
     outcomes, and measure their performance.

,    C.       M&E; Urban Policy Dialogue; Communications and Coordination: US$3.75 million
     This component will finance systematic monitoring of processes and intermediate results of LMDGP;
     knowledge management to strengthen metropolitan policy dialogue, and communications to inform and
     educate all stakeholders on the potential benefits of LMDGP; and operating costs.


     4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
     The project is located in Lagos. The parent project envisaged a landfill gas collection, flaring and
     composting operation. All safeguards and disclosure requirements for the carbon operation are covered
     under the process agreed and undenvay under the parent project including a Resettlement Policy
     Framework (RF'F) that was prepared and disclosed. In the event that the upgrading and landfill related
     activities created temporary impacts on a limited number of households, the recommendations in the RF'F
     will be used for preparation of the RAP which will be disclosed in-country and at the Info shop prior to
     the commencement of civil works. There is therefore, no need to prepare a separate EA document, as the
     existing EA under the parent project has adequate measures to manage the risks from the installation of a
     gas collection system with vertical wells, flaring equipment and electricity generators. The potential
     environmental impacts are most likely to be small-scale and site-specific, typical of a Category B project.
     Mitigation measures planned for the waste collection points, transfer stations and the landfills to cover
     possible leacheate contamination and leakage are well covered in the already disclosed EA prepared for
     the parent project, and it is this measure that will be applicable here.
