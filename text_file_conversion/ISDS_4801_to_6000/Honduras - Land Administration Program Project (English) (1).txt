B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
This ISDS refers to the second phase of a national Land Administration Program (APL) 
originally planned for three phases over 12 years and now expected to be implemented in four 
phases over 16 years.  
 
The (adjusted) objective for the overall Program is to strengthen property rights in Honduras 
through modernization of the legal framework, institutional strengthening and development of a 
fully integrated and decentralized National System for Property Administration (SINAP).  It is 
expected that successful Program implementation will result in increased land governance and 
tenure security in the country, decreasing at the same time land conflicts and promoting, in 
combination with other factors, land markets and investments as well as the strengthening of the 
land rights of indigenous and afro-descendant peoples.  
 
The PDO for Phase II is to provide the population of targeted areas with improved, 
decentralized land administration services, including better access to and more accurate 
information on property records and transactions. To achieve this objective, PATH will continue 
Page  2
to promote the streamlining of the systematic regularization, titling, and registration process and 
the improvement of land administration services in terms of access and transparency.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Phase II of PATH will be implemented over a period of five years and will include five 
components: (i) Legal, institutional, and technological strengthening; (ii) Systematic 
regularization, titling, and registry; (iii) Strengthening and regularization of protected areas; (iv) 
Strengthening of indigenous and afro-
descendant peoplesí property rights; and (v) Project 
management and Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E).  These components are summarized below:  
 
1. Legal, Institutional and Technological Strengthening. Component 1 will contribute directly to 
improving governance and sustainability of land administration in the country, with a renewed 
focus on municipalities and key institutions, while also ensuring the consolidation of SINAP and 
promoting a culture of registry.  Accordingly, this component will support: (a) Consolidation of 
the policy and regulatory framework, including preparation and consultation of policies, norms, 
manuals, procedures, and regulations related to property rights and land administration; (b) 
Institutional strengthening and sustainability, targeted at the Property Institute (IP) and particular 
areas of co-executing entities such as the National Agrarian Institute (INA) and the Ministry of 
Interior (SGJ) and focusing on the modernization of selected property registries, safeguards 
implementation, Communication and Gender strategies and similar themes; (c) Municipal 
strengthening, including strengthening of municipal cadastral units, training and general 
technical capacity; and (d) further development and implementation of SINAP, including its 
main modules: the integrated registry system (SURE), the geographical information system for 
territorial planning (SINIT), the registry of norms for territorial planning (RENOT), and the 
metadata module (Cearinghouse), as well as expansion of the wireless network (Red 
Metropolitana Inal√°mbrica) created to facilitate data transmission and inter-agency 
communications and to ensure connectivity of SINAP.  
 
2. Systematic Regularization, Titling and Registry.  Under Component 2, Phase II will promote 
a
focalized, systematic surveying and cadastral process, with a focus on providing direct benefits 
to rural and urban populations.  Specifically, Component 2 will support: (a) field work, 
surveying and validation; (b) legalization, titling and registration, and (c) municipal territorial 
planning.  Activities under this component will include aerial photography, surveying of inter-
municipal boundaries, parcel-level surveying and validation, conflict resolution, regularization, 
titling and registration into SINAP, and when required, territorial plans for municipalities.  
 
Participating municipalities will be selected based on agreed criteria that would consider, inter 
alia, volume of registry transactions, presence of an important urban center, economic relevance 
for its region (tourism, agriculture, services, and other activities), and synergies with 
development projects that would enhance the Programís impact.  The sustainability of this 
process will be enhancedby the strengthening of particular departments of the IP and the 
cadastral units of the selected municipalities, in addition to the modernization of the property 
registries which cover such municipalities.  At the end of the second phase, selected 
municipalities should be able to respond adequately to the local demand for regularization and 
updating and maintenance of cadastral data, in close coordination with the IP and INA.

3. Demarcation and Regularization of Protected Areas.  Component 3 will help ensure 
sustainability of the environmental impacts and benefits of the first phase through (a) 
regularization of six of the eight protected areas demarcated during Phase I, including census of 
any households living within the boundaries of the areas, internal cadastre, integration into 
SINAP, and provision of usufruct contracts to eligible beneficiaries. At the same time, this 
component will support (b) demarcation of at least two existing protected areas not included in 
Phase I, as well as c) surveying of public forested lands, after which the survey information will 
be passed on to the concerned agencies for validation.  
 
4. Strengthening of Indigenous and Afro-
descendant Peoplesí Land Rights.  PhaseII will reflect 
a
broader approach to promoting the land rights of indigenous and afro-descendant peoples, 
ensuring respect for their collective tenure traditions and implementation of the relevant legal 
framework.  As learned during the first phase, this is a challenging objective, which needs to be 
approached strategically and progressively. Accordingly, Component 4 will support (a) titling of 
indigenous land in the Mosquitia emphasizing collective titling that reflects the cultural traditions 
and social organization of the Miskito people living there.  Miskito communities have not 
managed to receive titles to any of their lands, yet have been under increasing pressure due to the 
advance of the agricultural frontier and agribusiness interests.  The final designation of the 
communities to be titled in the Mosquitia will be made during project preparation through a 
process of free, prior informed consultation. Component 4 will also support (b) preparation of 
management plans for the titled community lands, and (c) technical assistance, and capacity 
building, which would include, inter alia, education on property rights, legal aid, and small 
productive projects, to be made available to both Garifuna and Miskito communities.  
 
5. Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).  This component will support 
(a) costs related to the functioning of the Program Coordination Unit (PCU), including project 
management, coordination with other agencies and municipalities participating in the Program, 
and audit reports; and (b) costs related to the M&E of program activities, including measures of 
the socio-economic impact of the program.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Program will continue to be national in scope.  Phase II is expected to focus on various 
activities affecting lands in selected municipalities of 8 to 10 departments (which will be 
confirmed during project preparation); demarcation and regularization of selected national parks 
and other protected areas; and activities affecting Miskito and Garifuna areas on the Atlantic 
Coast (in Colon, Atl√°ntida and Gracias a Dios), but with titling in Miskito communities only.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
During Phase I of the Program, capacity for implementing safeguards among the various 
implementing bodies was variable.  Following the Inspection Panel investigation carried out 
during 2006 and most of 2007, a concerted effort was made to improve in-country understanding 
of and capacity to deal with the applicable safeguard policies, a process that coincided with 
enhanced, integrated supervision by the Bank in general, and with more active oversight by 
Bank-based social and environmental safeguards specialists in particular.  The participation of 
numerous PCU technical staff in the preparation and updating of safeguards-related manuals and 
instruments, such as the Protected Areas Regularization Manual on the environment side and the 
Page  4
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan on the social side, has led to greatly strengthened capacity 
for safeguards management centrally.  During Phase II, these improvements will be built upon 
and extended to key executing entities such as the IP and INA.  For example, staff in INA will 
receive training not only in areas that are directly related to its responsibilities under the Program 
(e.g in the titling of lands for indigenous and afro-descendant communities), but also in 
associated areas with which they have less experience (e.g. the promotion of alternative conflict 
resolution mechanisms).  Such activities will be provided for under Component 1.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
A
clarification on the application of OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement: As was the 
case in Phase I, this policy applies not because land regularization activities under the Program 
will involve physical displacement and resettlement (in fact, this possibility will continue to be 
explicitly excluded), but because of the potential that the demarcation and stricter enforcement of 
a
protected areaís boundaries under Component 3 will lead to restriction of access to commonly 
used natural resources on the part of communities living in the vicinity of the protected area.  
The Process Framework prepared under Phase I, which outlines the participatory process by 
which any such restrictions can be identified, monitored, and mitigated, remains in force and will 
be implemented as needed.  In addition, as a good practice measure, the Public Need 
Regularization process that is meant to resolve conflicting and overlapping claims to land plots, 
and that has been applied mainly in the urbanized perimeter of Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, 
is being closely monitored to ensure that the informal, largely poor households benefiting from 
Public Need titling activities do not suffer from undue economic displacement.

Environmental Safeguard Issues  
 
All of the safeguard policies that were triggered for Phase I are triggered here as well.  In 
addition, OP 4.36 on Forests is triggered in order to give specialized attention to public forested 
areas that will be surveyed and validated during Phase II.  
Page  5
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
All of the direct and indirect environmental impacts originally detected as part of the 
Environmental Assessment (EA) carried out in mid-2003, prior to the approval of Phase I, are 
still relevant.  Indirect adverse impacts reflecting a longer-term time horizon and taking into 
account experiences from land regularization programs throughout Latin America included, inter 
alia,  
 
ï
Deforestation in anticipation of land titling: It is possible that the landholder might 
accelerate land clearing activity in advance of the arrival of the project field teams who would 
measure, map, and register a land parcel, in order to demonstrate the largest possible area under 
ìproductive useî.  
 
ï
Increased land clearing from greater access to capital: By receiving secure land titles, 
many landowners would enjoy increased access to capital, resulting from improved access to 
credit.  This means, of course, that some of them might opt to use part of their increased access 
to capital for clearing the remaining forests on their property to expand their area of pasture or 
cropland.   
 
ï
Increased migration to forest frontier areas: Some rural landowners might be inclined to 
sell their fully-titled land and use the proceeds to migrate and clear more land at the forest 
frontier, even though this goes against recently observed migration trends in Honduras.  
 
Other, more direct adverse impacts identified for Phase I included the possibility that 
protected area limits would not be respected if land regularization activities were programmed to 
take place prior to demarcation activities, or that lands having, or suspected to have, culturally 
valuable resources would be titled to private owners before the appropriate government agencies 
(such as IHAH) had a chance to get involved in the identification and protection of such 
resources.  To prevent, mitigate, and manage all adverse impacts, a series of measures were 
prepared and adopted for Phase I.  These mitigation measures, which are still in force, are 
encapsulated not only in the original Environmental Management Plan (EMP), but also in two 
key annexes to the Programís Regularization Manual.  The first, on the regularization of 
protected areas (including national cultural heritage sites), was recently finalized and is already 
in use.  The second, on the regularization of public forested areas, is in the process of approval, 
and will be available for piloting toward the end of Phase I.  
 
Because of the relatively late development and application of these specialized 
environmental annexes, protected areas- and forests-related activities envisioned under 
component two of Phase I have been slow in getting started; in fact, it is mainly for this reason 
that Phase I had to be restructured and the number of protected areas targeted for regularization 
reduced from twelve to eight.  Consequently, environmental impacts deriving from program 
activities have been minor so far; the only really problems detected through Bank supervision 
had to do with the improper disposal of the byproducts used in boundary marker construction in 
the course of demarcating one of the areas.  This impact has since been addressed, with no long-
term negative consequences.  Of the indirect adverse impacts mentioned above, none have had a 
chance to materialize due to the aforementioned delays.  However, it is expected that ensuing 
regularization within protected areas could lead to increased social conflict, a possibility that is 
being dealt with through the development and testing of conflict
-
resolution procedures that are

Yes No TBD 
specific to Component 3 of the next phase in the Program.  
 
A
limited amount of additional EA work will be carried out during the preparation of Phase 
II, leading to a light revision of the EMP so that it provides up-to-date information on the status 
of the protected areas that are subject to demarcation and regularization actions as a part of 
Component 3.  As part of the revision, the EMP will incorporate the lessons learned from the 
implementation of the few environmental management and mitigation actions that were required 
under Phase I, so that any changes that are deemed advisable can be taken on board by the 
relevant project coordination staff.  
 
One important addition to Component 4, which involves strengthening of indigenous and 
Afro-Honduran land rights, has to do with support for small productive projects in both Garifuna 
and Miskito areas covered by the project.  These projects will be designed and implemented on a 
demand basis, and so it is not possible to determine ex-ante what types of activities might be 
included, or what environmental impacts might ensue.  A set of screening criteria organized 
along the lines of the categories that are eligible for support under this component will be applied 
to all such projects before they can advance beyond the proposal phase, and will be incorporated 
into the PATH Operations Manual.  These criteria will reflect the principles embodied in all of 
the safeguard policies that apply to PATH II, as well as those of some that do not.  For example, 
in addition to having to be culturally compatible, or to apply a precautionary approach to 
activities carried out in critical natural habitats, all small projects eligible for support will be 
prohibited from involving either the procurement of pesticides or the increased used of 
pesticides, lest OP 4.09 on Pest Management be triggered.  
 
Social Safeguard Issues  
 
The Government of Honduras has confirmed its interest in pursuing the recognition of the 
property rights of indigenous and afro-descendant peoples under Phase II.  Piloting of this effort 
during Phase I has been challenging, particularly in Garifuna communities along the Atlantic 
Coast.  The Inspection Panel investigation that took place came in response to a request by 
OFRANEH (Organizaci√≥n Fraternal Negra Hondure√±a), a Garifuna organization.  The 
Panelís findings were concentrated almost exclusively on problems in the implementation of OD 
4.20 on Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10 for the purposes of Phase II).  The Regional 
Management Action Plan that was subsequently prepared to address the findings is being 
implemented with full support from the Government and the PCU, and a Progress Report will be 
sent to the Bankís Board in October 2008.  This Report will show that the Program is broadly in 
compliance with the policy, even though risks remain with respect to the consolidation of the 
legal framework for the titling of indigenous and Afro-Honduran lands, the management of 
expectations with regard to the speed and quality of benefits delivery in both Miskito and 
Garifuna areas, and modalities and mechanisms for the involvement of Garifuna communities 
allied with OFRANEH in the Program.  
 
Currently, both Garifuna and Miskito communities selected for pilot efforts under the first 
phase are broadly supportive of the Program.  Given that almost all of the Garifuna lands were 
titled before Phase I even started, Phase II would focus on Miskito communities, which have 
relatively low levels of conflict while facing increasing pressure on their lands due to the 
Page  7
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
advance of the agricultural frontier and agribusiness interests.  Miskito organizations and 
communities have confirmed their interest in continuing to participate in the Program.  Finally, 
during the second phase, special attention will be paid to implementing a culturally sensitive 
Communications Strategy (which should help with the management of expectations), to 
strengthening INAís capacity for leading titling activitiesin the Mosquitia and elsewhere, and to 
developing effective and locally acceptable conflict resolution mechanisms.  As required, an 
updated Social Assessment Report and Indigenous and afro-descendant Peoples Development 
Plan (IPDP) will be completed during project preparation.
