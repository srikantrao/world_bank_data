2. Project Objectives 
The overall program (APL-1 +APL-2) development objective is to improve the 
environmental quality of the M-R Basin, and the sanitary conditions along the banks of 
the RÃ­o de la Plata. Due to the complexity and size of the project, a two-phase 
Adaptable Program Loan (APL) was adopted, but completion of all activities in both 
phases is needed in order to achieve the objective. The project (APL-1) development 
objective is to contribute to government’s overall program developmentobjective by (i) 
improving sewerage services in the M-R basin and other parts of the province and city of 
Buenos Aires; (ii) reducing industrial discharges to the M-R basin; (iii) improving urban 
drainage and land-use in the M-R basin; and (iv) strengthening the institutional 
framework for ongoing and sustainable clean-up of the M-R basin   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project (APL-1) will address the complex situation in the M-R basin 
through coordinated action in three areas, followed by a fourth project component for 
Page  2
technical assistance and project management.  The project is designed based on a new 
approach differing form previous clean-up attempts. The new government strategy is 
based on two concepts (i) the establishment of a strong River Basin Authority, to 
strengthen coordination among various authorities; and (ii) zero discharge of municipal 
and industrial wastes into the M-R river, which considers the low auto-purification 
capacity of the M-R river.  The proposed project includes the following components:  
 
Component 1 : Sanitation (US$ 919 million total, US$655 million loan) is designed to 
eliminate sewage discharges into the M-R River through the provision of infrastructure 
works such as collectors, preliminary treatment plants, and sub-aquatic outfalls which 
will discharge effluents to the La Plata River. This infrastructure will help to: (i) limit 
domestic and industrial wastewater discharges into inland rivers such as the M-R and 
protect these receiving bodies by diverting all collected wastewater through two long 
effective sub-aquatic outfalls designed so that the effluent is diluted and dispersed in a 
river with a larger auto-purification capacity; (ii) distribute the flow between two 
preliminary treatment plants in order to provide greater flexibility and security to the 
sewerage and treatment systems; and (iii) allow industries located in the AySA service 
area, which have pre-treated their wastewater to the required norm, to connect to the 
sewerage network thus limiting the level of in-situ treatment.  
 
Component 2: Industrial pollution abatement (US$ 58 million total, US$ 50 million 
loan) is designed to eliminate all industrial wastewater (organic as well as toxic effluents) 
discharges directly into the Matanza-Riachuelo River. Through a combination of 
technical assistance to improve monitoring, control and enforcement by the M-R River 
Basin Authority, and matching grants to support private sector investments in pollution 
control and cleaner production measures, this component will aim to reduce industrial 
effluent discharges and aid in the environmental recuperation of the M-R. World Bank 
financing of US$50 million has been requested for this component. In parallel, a further 
US$80 million in a Cleaner Production project tentatively scheduled for Board delivery 
in 2009 has been requested as well.  
 
Component 3: Territorial management (US$ 60 million total, US$ 50 million loan) 
designed to address the high environmental degradation levels especially in unregulated-
low-income urban areas. This component seeks to contribute to the appropriate urban 
development expansion and improving the living conditions of the poor. Towards this 
end, the component seeks to strengthen institutional development for territorial planning 
and flood control, and develop pilots of integrated investments in basic infrastructure 
services and flood control to improve urban and living conditions in selected low-income 
areas of the basin. The government has requested US$50 million in World Bank 
financing for this component, while recognizing that the cost of the required interventions 
are much higher and will likely need follow-on financing.  
 
Component 4: Technical Assistance and Project Management component, including the 
financing of additional studies required during the course of project implementation, the 
design of subsequent phases of the project, expert support (including international 
Page  3
expertise and a possible international oversight panel), communications and community 
outreach, impact monitoring, and overall project management.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The proj
ect’s area of influence is quite large, with most of the proposed investments and 
programs to be located within the M-R basin, the AySA concession area and the RÃ­o 
the La Plata –all within the Buenos Aires Province.  The project’s area of influence 
involves the following (often overlapping) areas: (i) the entire Matanza-Riachuelo Basin; 
(ii) the entire AySA concession area; (iii) the reaches of the Lujan River, from the mouth 
of the Reconquista River to it’s confluence into RÃ­o de La Plata; (iv) the reaches of the 
RÃ­o de la Plata between the coast and the outer limit of the so-called “Parana de las 
Palmas Flow Corridor”; and (v) the coastal section between the coast of the RÃ­o de La 
Plata, the neighborhood access road to the river at approximately 14,000 m southeast of 
the boundary of the General Belgrano plant site, the Boca railroad, and the boundary 
between the districts of Quilmes and Berazategui.  
 
Key considerations relating to the physical location and characteristics of the project 
area include the large numbers of poor and vulnerable communities that live in close 
proximity to the M-R basin and who are most exposed to the uncontrolled and untreated 
discharges; the specific water quality characteristics of the M-R basin and the RÃ­o de la 
Plata; and the international riparian issues relating to the RÃ­o de la Plata.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Overall, the environmental benefits of the project are expected to outweigh the 
environmental costs of the project. The expected benefits include : (i) improved quality of 
Page  4
life for the 3.5 million inhabitants of the M-R basin; (ii) improved sewerage and drainage 
services in the M-R basin and other parts of Buenos Aires by expanding the coverage of 
the sewerage network to 1.7 million people in the basin (from 35 percent to about 75 
percent), especially in poor marginal areas; (iii) improved environmental quality for 
rivers and tributaries crossing the urban area and the pollution of the RÃ­o de La Plata 
through investments in industrial pollution control; and (iv) improved urban living 
conditions associated with territorial development and reduced flooding in the M-R basin.  
 
Potential environmental risks during both the construction and the operational phases of 
the project have been identified. During the construction phase, the principle 
environmental risks emerge from the management and control of temporary risks of the 
construction itself. These risks include the normal impacts associated with large scale 
construction such as dust and noise control; the management of hazardous materials; 
control of erosion and sedimentation; disposal of tunnel spoil and large earth movement; 
and occupational health and safety.  
 
During the operational phase, potential environmental risks may include those from an 
increased contamination of the RÃ­o de la Plata associated with the sub-aquatic outfalls; 
re-suspension of toxic materials in dredging operations; effects on the groundwater table; 
noise and odor associated with the treatment plant; and disposal of the solid wastes 
generated by the treatment plant. A detailed summary of potential environmental impacts, 
risks, mitigation and management measures is presented in Annex 10 of the PAD.   
 
Environmental risks associated with components 2 and 3 are, by their nature, much less 
significant and are expected to be almost entirely positive. Any adverse impacts will 
mostly be associated with small-scale construction of civil works for flood control. Since 
most of the investments under these components have yet to be identified, it is not 
possible to say with absolute certainty what the risks will be. Thus, for both these 
components, an environmental management framework (EMF) has been developed 
which will require screening and scoping of issue for all proposed investments and, 
where appropriate, the development of management and mitigation measures.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
As mentioned above, the long term impacts are expected to be overwhelmingly positive.  
There are adverse impacts expected from the operation of the treatment plant and 
subsequent discharges into the RÃ­o de la Plata. The pollution loads areexpected to affect 
a
relatively small area of the RÃ­o de la Plata, especially given the very high dilution 
factors of the river. As the project area is one of intense urbanization and industrial 
development, the overall success of the project will be determined, to a certain extent, by 
how successful governments are at encouraging the closure or relocation of highly 
polluting industries and the long term ability to control future growth and 
industrialization in the highest risk areas.   
 
Page  5
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
A
variety of technical alternatives were considered for the sanitation component 
(Component 1).  These included the level of wastewater treatment, the length of outfalls, 
and the number and location of the wastewater treatment plants. A summary of the 
description of the alternatives and the reasons for rejection of those that were not selected 
is presented in Annex 12 of the PAD.  
 
An issue of major importance for the project is the choice of preliminary treatment of 
the wastewater coupled with discharge of the effluent into the La Plata River through a 
long, effective outfall. This decision to choose a lower level of treatment over a higher 
level has been challenged by various NGOs. However, this choice is justified as the main 
protection of Buenos Aires from the negative impacts of the effluent discharges is 
provided by the effective outfall and making use of the oxygenation capacity of the La 
Plata River into which it drains. Choosing a higher level of treatment (secondary) and a 
shorter outfall would not be adequate, in addition to being much more expensive and 
unaffordable (in terms of investment and also operation and maintenance). Furthermore, 
the alternative with secondary treatment and an effective outfall is equivalent, in terms of 
risks to humans and to the environment, to the selected alternative (preliminary treatment 
and an effective outfall) but is much more expensive, and is therefore not selected.  
 
These conclusions are a result of a mathematical modeling of the impact of the various 
alternatives on the water quality of the La Plata River. They are also compatible with the 
recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) that, from the public health 
standpoint of human exposure to wastewater, additional treatment higher than 
preliminary prior to the discharge does not reduce health risks. That is to say, the health 
risk associated with a system comprised of preliminary treatment followed by an 
effective outfall is identical to that from a system comprised of secondary treatment 
followed by an effective outfall. The WHO report refers to risk related to human 
exposure through bathing, which is not exactly the risk in the case of discharge to the La 
Plata River; but as the main risk of effluent discharge is imposed by pathogenic 
organisms, the WHO exposure risk measure serves as a good proxy.  
 
For the industrial pollution component (Component 2), two alternatives were 
considered, viz. (i) a high level of treatment of all industrial wastes and discharge of the 
effluents, except those which contain toxic matter, to the M-R river, and (ii) a lower level 
of treatment of all industrial wastes and discharge of the effluents, except those which 
contain toxic matter, to the municipal sewerage network for further processing with 
domestic wastewater. Alternative (i) was rejected since it was found, through 
mathematical modeling that even after a high level of treatment, the discharge of 
industrial effluents to the M-R River will still render it anaerobic. So that the only way to 
induce aerobic conditions in the river and recover its water quality is through Alternative 
(ii).

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01). For all works in component 1 
contemplated for APL-1, the project proponents have prepared extensive environmental 
assessments. At the overall project and river basin level, ACUMAR commissioned an 
Integrated Environmental Assessment that describes the regional environmental issues 
facing the M-R Basin, the baseline environmental situation, the applicable legal and 
institutional framework guiding the management of the basin, the principal management 
strategies considered, and alternatives considered for different basin management 
approaches. In addition, the Integrated Environmental Assessment (IEA) provides a 
comprehensive description of the overall project components, their main environmental 
risks and benefits, and the measures to be employed during project implementation to 
ensure management of adverse environmental risks. This IEA contains the hydrologic 
modeling that supports the entire impact analysis of the project. A more specific EIA has 
been developed by AySA for Component 1 and made available for public review and 
comment. This EIA considers realistic alternatives to each proposed work and evaluates 
the proposed works in the context of the AySA Plan Director.  
 
A
comprehensive Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been developed which 
spells out institutional responsibilities for implementation of mitigation commitments, 
supervision and monitoring of compliance with agreed mitigation measures. All 
contractors will be required to follow site-specific management plans agreed and 
incorporated into all construction contracts. Mitigation for works will be guided by an 
environmental construction manual which describes best practice methods for common 
environmental issues such as sediment and erosion control, solid waste management, 
noise and safety concerns.  
 
For components 2 and 3, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been 
developed, which describes the procedures for screening and evaluating any proposed 
sub-project under those two components. Where needed, an environmental management 
plan will be developed for sub-projects which will address specific issues identified 
during screening. The frameworks also describe the procedures and expectations with 
respect to disclosure of information and consultation with affected communities.  
 
Both ACUMAR and AySA will implement a communications strategy for the project 
which will define the methods for public disclosure of all relevant documents including 
monitoring reports during implementation.  
 
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04). Since the project aims to contribute to the significant 
improvement of water quality conditions in the M-R basin, it is expected to have 
significant positive impacts for the natural riverine habitats located in the project area. An 
area of the receiving waters in the RÃ­o de la Plata willbe degraded as a result of the 
pollution discharge from the wastewater treatment plant. Models developed for the 
outfalls indicate that the discharge plume is expected to be fully contained within a 
relatively small area of the receiving waters. The pollution is not expected to affect 
downstream coastal areas designated as conservation areas.  
Page  7
Forests (OP 4.36). There are no forests affected by the project and therefore no action 
required under this policy.  
 
Cultural Property (OP 4.11). Preliminary site evaluations for proposed civil works 
construction do not provide any evidence of cultural property which will require 
mitigation or management measures.  However, all construction contracts will include a 
“chance finds” clause which will require contractors to stop construction in the event that 
any underground cultural property sites are encountered during construction.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). Since the vast majority of construction will take 
place underground or on sites that do not require any land acquisition or resettlement, the 
project expects minimal need for resettlement. However, as a precaution the project has 
developed a Resettlement Framework (RF) in the event of any unexpected land 
acquisition.  Among other things, the RF spells out the eligibility criteria, forms of 
compensation, and dispute resolution mechanisms which will be available to potentially 
affected people.  
 
Indigenous People (OP 4.10). There are no indigenous people affected by this project 
and therefore no action required under this policy.  
 
Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP/GP 7.60). The project is not being implemented in 
any area known to be the subject of international dispute and therefore no action is 
required under the policy.  
 
Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP/GP 7.50). The RÃ­o de la Plata, whichis 
the main receiving water of the discharge from the outfalls, is an International Waterway 
as defined under the policy. Navigation and other activities to be carried out in the central 
section of the river shared by Uruguay and Argentina are regulated by a bi-national 
agreement, the RÃ­o de la Plata Treaty (Tratado del RÃ­o de la Plata). The ComisiÃ³n 
Administradora del RÃ­o de la Plata (CARP), madeup of Uruguayan and Argentine 
members, is in charge of the treaty implementation and enforcement.  Therefore, 
Argentina is required to notify the CARP, as indicated in the bilateral agreement, of its 
intent to construct the project and will seek the Commission’s no-objection to proceed 
with the project. Initial notification about the Riachuelo outfall has already been sent to 
CARP and the official response is expected by October 15 2008. The Bank has officially 
requested GoA to submit an additional letter informing about the Berazategui outfall 
before negotiations.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
As part of the project preparation process, extensive stakeholder consultation has been 
carried out using formal as well as informal methodologies. Information on the project 
and its components has been made publically available through public disclosure events 
and workshops. Informal focus groups discussions have been conducted with NGOs, 
local government, affected people and beneficiaries at various points during preparation 
Page  8
and appraisal. In addition, household and individual surveys done by the economic 
evaluation team have been used to disseminate information and gather stakeholder 
perceptions.  
 
ACUMAR and AySA have also established social departments within their 
organizational structure. These teams have been established to be in constant contact with 
the local communities. ACUMAR, for example, has established a network of 
approximately 300 community and environmental NGOs that are part of its broader 
communications strategy relating to issues facing the M-R basin. This network provides 
an opportunity for information disclosure not just on the project but on a wide array of 
development issues facing the basin. In addition to general public disclosure, several 
experts in the sanitation, engineering, environmental area have given advice and 
assessment to the project team.  
 
ACUMAR and AySA have each commissioned social assessments through consulting 
firms. ACUMAR’s social assessment was a regional, basin-wide, project social 
assessment, describing the social baseline conditions which exist in the M-R basin, 
identifying the stakeholders, highlighting the existing communication channels, and 
pinpointing the overall social impacts of the project. AySA’s social assessment, on the 
other hand, explores the opinion of stakeholders about the proposed infrastructure works 
to be carried out by the company.  
 
The project stakeholders identified and contacted by the social assessment consulting 
teams include local and international NGO, neighbors associations, community groups, 
individuals, universities, national, provincial and municipal governments, industrial 
associations, and professional associations.  
 
The potential social impacts associated with the various components of the projects 
were also identified. For the sanitation component, some temporary social impacts are 
expected during the construction phase. These include restriction of access to some 
public areas, increased transit of trucks to the trenches and collector sites etc. However, 
the construction methods proposed (pipe jacking and tunneling) to be used for pipe 
installation have been explicitly designed to minimize impacts, including any 
resettlement. Pipe routes have been selected to be located in public areas and will not 
impact private property  
 
The most important finding from the social assessments was that the project (as well as 
the sanitation component alone) will have a positive social impact on the population in 
the M-R basin as well as in the Bs As Metropolitan Area. The investments will contribute 
to improving the quality of life of the basin population by improvements in the 
environmental conditions, as well as by increasing the capacity of the sewerage systems.  
 
A
first major consultation event was carried out on July 10th 2008, for the scoping of 
the terms of reference for the EIA. A second round of formal public disclosure of the 
advanced draft EA report is planned for October 31st, 2008.  The draft EIA reports are 
already available to the public through the internet (AySA and ACUMAR websites), by 
posting of hard copies in ACUMAR as well as in the InfoShop. Most of the identified 
stakeholders have taken part of these events and only one written concern has been sent 
to the preparation team who responded with no further consultation. In order to foster 
participation and to bring more information to stakeholders (one of the main finding of 
Page  9
the social assessment), a communication strategy is being designed based on the main 
findings of the social assessments studies.
