2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the proposed Additional Financing is unchanged from the original 
project except for changing the original reference to three departments.  The PDO would 
be:  ìThe Pilot Community Development Project seeks to test a decentralized, 
participatory, bottom up development approach as a way to improve the quality of life 
and social inclusion of poor rural and marginal urban communities in eight departments 
in eastern and southern Paraguay. The Project will contribute to the development of the 
capacity of local communities to implement poverty alleviation and community 
development activities by: (i) supporting small productive, income generating and 
community development sub-Projects for poor communities; and (ii) building capacity of 
local institutions and beneficiary organizations to identify, design and implement these 
activities.î

3. Project Description 
The proposed AF would support the costs associated with the scaling-up of activities to 
enhance the development impact of the Project.  No major changes are proposed to the 
ongoing Project. It will continue to support the initial three components:  
 
(a) 
Community Development Sub-projects.  Grants for an additional 500 small-scale 
demand-driven income generating sub-Projects (e.g. small enterprises, artisan workshops, 
agricultural diversification, etc.) prepared and submitted by groups of eligible 
beneficiaries.  
 
(b) Capacity-
Building and Institutional Development.  Strengthen local communitiesí 
capacity to design, implement and monitor community development activities and to 
facilitate their participation in overall Project implementation. Finance support services, 
training and organizational development, and the implementation of a participatory 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.  
 
(c) 
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.  Support to the Project 
Coordination Unit (PCU) to coordinate the technical and administrative aspects, oversee 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project, and to carry out specialized 
studies   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Poverty and social exclusion in Paraguay continues to prevail, with the overall poverty 
rate having increased from 30 percent to 38 percent between 1995 and 2005.  Inequality 
as measured by the Gini index is also very high (0.506), and between 1999 and 2005 it 
has been increasing in urban areas (from 0.470 to 0.485) although it has fallen somewhat 
in rural areas (from 0.567 to 0.513). Institutional weakness of the state and civil society 
are key constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction.  
 
The number of Departments will be increased from the three original Departments of 
Itapua, Misiones, and √ëeembucu, where the project is currently operating, byexpanding 
the project area to include an additional five Departments; Caaguaz√∫,Central, Cordillera, 
Guaira and Paraguar√≠.  These new Departments share similarecosystem characteristics 
as those involved in the original project including Alto Parana Atlantic Forest, Misiones 
Grasslands, and Humid Chaco ecosystems.  Caaguazu, Itapua and Misiones are the most 
important based on presence of critical ecosystems and endangered species.  
 
Indigenous Peoples also exist in the new Departments, especially in Caaguaz√∫ and 
Central. In Caaguaz√∫ there are about 6,900 individuals of indigenous descent (or 
approximately 1.6% of the total population in Caaguaz√∫), from three differentethnic 
groups, a majority of which belong to the Guaran√≠ ethno-linguistic family. In Central 
the overall indigenous population amounts to just over 1,000 people from 6 different 
ethnic groups, and make up just 0.1% of the total population in the Department.  In 
Guair√° there about 1,000 indigenous peoples, less that 0.6% of the total population, 
distributed in 8 communities (from the Mbya family). Itap√∫a has an indigenous 
population of about 2,000 individuals, distributed in32communities (Mbya and Mak√°), 
which in total represent less than 0.5% of the total population in the Department

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No potential indirect or long-term impacts are expected due to anticipated future 
activities.  This assessment is based on the fact that the scale of sub-projects is small and 
distributed over a broad geographic range.  No important impacts were reported or noted 
for the first phase activities of PRODECO.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N.A.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The experience to date with project implementation has been positive with respect to 
safeguard issues as applied through the existing Environmental Management Framework.  
The project has a local, participatory, and decentralized approach to the environmental 
screening process and capacity building.  Capacity-building and training for technical 
assistance providers and Community Development Agents will also be strengthened in 
regard to environmental assessment, Integrated Pest Management, Health and Safety, and 
supervision of mitigation aspects.  
 
While the Pilot Project did not trigger the Indigenous Peoples Operational Policy, the 
design of the original Project itself contemplated mechanisms to guarantee benefits to 
Page  4
indigenous peoplesí communities within the Project area. Based onSocial Assessment 
and the extensive consultation process conducted as part of project preparation, the 
Project developed specific mechanisms to include and guarantee benefits to indigenous 
peoplesí communities within the Project area. Thesemechanisms were: the inclusion of 
specific eligibility criteria to favor the inclusion of indigenous groups, the dedicated 
presence of project staff (Community Development Agent) to coordinate IP activities at 
field level, the provision of special assistance and funds targeted at IP communities to 
formulate subproject proposals, and mechanisms designed to ensure their continued 
participation during implementation and monitoring of the project. Specific training and 
capacity building activities were also targeted at the local/municipal level to ensure that 
indigenous peoplesí organizations are better equipped to participate in localdecision 
making processes.  
 
The expanded geographical scope of the Additional Financing implies that the universe 
of indigenous peoples increases, as in three of the new Departments there are indigenous 
communities.  The experience gained by the Project Coordination Unit and the staff in 
dealing with indigenous peoples will provide the basis for the work with indigenous 
peoples, as agreed under the IPPF.  The nature of the sub-projects under the Additional 
Financing remains the same. Hence the mechanisms for the inclusion of indigenous 
peoples included in the design of the original project remain applicable to the scaled-up 
project activities.  
 
Given the recent approval of two complementary Bank operations targeting indigenous 
peoples which geographically overlap with the activities proposed under the Additional 
Financing ñ the JSDF grants for Indigenous Community Development andIndigenous 
Lands Regularization for selected indigenous areas in Eastern Paraguay ñ the project will 
coordinate with these complementary operations to further enhance the participation of IP 
communities in the benefits of these projects.  Moreover, following an updated 
Agreement between the PCU and the Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Indigena (INDI), 
the project has agreed under the Additional Financing to employ an IP specialist to ensure 
the coordination of IP activities as well as employ specialized technical assistants 
dedicated at strengthening the capacity of IP communities.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include rural and urban families and indigenous communities included 
as beneficiaries under the project.  These groups are supported through training and 
capacity building activities, as well as during the planning and design phase of sub-
project activities to be funded.  Local governments are also involved to improve 
oversight, relevance and sustainability of sub-projects.  The environmental and overall 
sustainability concepts have been integrated into the framework of these activities and 
designed according to the capacities, needs, and cultural context of the different 
stakeholder groups and reflecting institutional needs and capacities.  
 
IP communities were specifically and adequately consulted during preparation of the 
original Project. The decentralized structure of the project also allowed for greater 
Page  5
participation of indigenous peoples in subproject preparation, implementation as well as 
M&E. Indigenous peoplesí associations and non-governmental organizations  also played 
important roles both in outreach and technical assistance in the context of subproject 
preparation and implementation in IP communities. Local and departmental level 
consultations and participatory evaluations with IP communities and representatives 
coupled with coordination between the PCU and INDI have also continued throughout 
the project cycle, providing opportunities for the needs and priorities of IP communities 
to be reflected in the ongoing operations of the project.  In addition, as indicated before, 
specific consultations were carried out for the preparation of the IPPF.  Furthermore, the 
IPPF sets clear participatory and consultative mechanisms for the preparation and 
implementation of specific sub-projects managed by indigenous communities.
