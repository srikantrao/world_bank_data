II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environmental Assessment Policies (OP/BP 4.01) will apply to EFIL IV.  Environmental 
issues of sub-borrowers and their sub-projects will be addressed through the sub-loan 
environmental eligibility assessment. The environmental assessment will be carried 
according tp environmental review procedures in the Operation Manuals for the TKSB 
and Eximbank. All environmental Category III sub-projects will be subject to the Bank's 
prior review for potential environmental impact purposes. There will be no large scale, 
significant, and/or irreversible impacts associated with the project   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
N/A   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrowers (TSKB and Eximbank), during the course of the proposed Project's 
predecessor EFIL III Project, have developed institutional capacity to determine and 
Page  3
monitor environmental risks of sub-projects. The staff in both borrowers are aware of the 
safeguard issues as they have been associated with the bank in the past and have 
constantly being rated satisfactory in implementing the safeguard policies. TSKB has had 
experience with 3 credit lines and Eximbank with one.  
 
TSKB, already has an established Environmental Assessment Framework document 
acceptable to the World Bank that defines environmental assessment procedures to be 
used in sub-project evaluation. Eximbank will prepare an Environmental Assessment 
Framework document acceptable to the World Bank that defines environmental 
assessment procedures to be used in sub-project evaluation. The Framework document 
will be included as a separate chapter in the Operations Manual. Eximbank wish to 
include the possibility of sub-projects that may, by Turkish environmental regulations, 
require an Environmental Impact Assessment Report. The OM will define procedures 
consistent with both Government of Turkey Environmental Assessment requirements and 
World Bank Environmental Assessment policies and procedures utilized in similar 
operations in Turkey.  
 
The framework documents of both Eximbank and TSKB will identify institutional 
responsibilities for each of the following elements:  
 
Sub-project Loan Preparation  
 
•
Environmental screening category  
 
•
Environmental impact assessment  
 
•
Environmental review process  
 
•
Prior and post review  
 
Sub-project Implementation  
 
•
Arrangements for environmental management, if necessary (mitigation and 
monitoring)  
 
•
Preparing of environmental screening form  
 
With regard to worker safety, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS) 
recently and in collaboration with the industry introduced training requirement and 
certification of workers’ safety on shipyards. The Ministry regulations arerelated to 
occupational health and safety and are prepared according to an EU directive (EEC 
89/391) on occupational health and safety standards.The project will leverage this 
initiative and plans to lend only to certified shipbuilders.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
