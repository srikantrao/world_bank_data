2. Project Objectives 
The overall program will improve access to water supply and sanitation, waste 
management and road infrastructure in the poorest neighborhoods. Second, it will also 
support community development, which would benefit community associations, non 
governmental organizations and local authorities, with the purpose of supporting their 
local economic development initiatives at the community, neighborhood, and city levels. 
Third, it will provide micro-finance services for revenue-generating activities in favor of 
individuals and communities. Fourth, it will provide technical assistance and project 
management support. It will support municipalities and communitie
sí management of 
public facilities (health, educational and training centers), fee recovery from users of 
popular market places, and from the distribution of public goods (collecting fees for the 
use of public water fountains).  
 
The Bank will finance the upgrading of the central commercial square in Djibouti-City 
(Place Harbi), the IsDB will intervene in the southern neighborhoods of Boulaos 
Page  2
(Quartier 7 and 7bis, Djebel), while the AsDB will invest in any of Balbalaís 
neighborhoods. The AFD will be implementing a complementary project to the latter the 
neighboring communities of Balbala. Each financial institution will enter into separate 
but parallel co-financing agreements. 
 
The Project Development Objective is to improve the accessibility and functionality, 
livability and social dimensions of the popular commercial area of the Place Harbi, 
located in central Djibouti-Ville. To improve its accessibility and functionality, the 
project would focus on the reorganization of the marketís activities, the construction of 
new market spaces, the creation of a new bus terminal, and the improvement of access 
roads. To improve the livability of the area, the proposed project would reduce pollution 
(creation of green spaces, separation of road traffic and market activities), improve 
hygiene (sewage and drainage system, solid waste management, street and sidewalk 
pavement) and a pedestrian area around the Great Mosque would be created. To improve 
the social dimensions, the population of market vendors would benefit from access to 
secure commercial tenure, better working conditions, and capacity building.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project (DUPREP) would be financed via a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of 
US$2.9 million equivalent. The IDA financing would be in the form of a grant, given the 
macro-economic performance of the country and its level of foreign debt, and 
consistently with the rating by the IMF and the World Bank. 
 
The project will address the poverty issues of a key part of the urban agglomeration, 
including the gender disparities present in the social fabric of the commercial area, 
through three major components: 
 
ï
Improvement of infrastructure: upgrading of the central market, restructuringof 
the informal ìmarch√© des caissesî, enhancement of the bus terminal, and the creation 
of public spaces around the Great Mosque. 
 
ï
Community development: the project would provide opportunities to the market 
vendors to improve their basic skills, by providing access to literacy and basic accounting 
training, as well as training in the management of micro-enterprises. Under this 
component, the project would also provide assistance to market vendors to obtain secure 
occupancy status in the market premises, by facilitating the establishment of lease 
contracts with the Authorities in charge of the facilities. The security of occupancy status 
would directly improve the living and operating conditions of the market vendors. 
 
ï
Technical assistance and project management: the project would provide technical 
assistance to the municipality and the management bodies for the functioning and the 
upkeep of facilities created, and assist the establishment of public-private partnerships to 
ensure that private investments expand the creation of commercial facilities and the 
rehabilitation of historic buildings in the area of the Place Harbi. In addition, the project 
would support the management and the implementation of the investments by the Agency 
designated by the Government.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Place Harbi is the popular area of the city with the highest concentration of revenue-
generating activities and potential for their improvement and increase. It is centrally 
located in the heart of the old colonial city. Project interventions would cause significant 
environmental improvements to the area and negative impacts are envisaged. The 
drainage and sewerage systems, currently obstructed, would be rehabilitated, solid waste 
management, critical to the sanitary functioning of the market facilities, would be 
overhauled and re-organized. Fumes from mini-buses and other vehicles would be 
minimized and confined to the bus terminal. Trees will be planted in the pedestrian area 
and in the bus terminal to provide shade and cooling to people and buildings. Rainwater 
will be collected via the roofing systems of the market structures and used for watering 
the green areas.  Traditional ventilation systems will be incorporated in the market 
buildings to improve comfort. 
 
The project was classified as Category C, on the basis of the lack of expected negative 
impacts, and the Regional Safeguards Coordinator after Concept Review has transferred 
to the Task Team Leader the responsibility for the surveillance of the potentially sensitive 
environmental, social and cultural aspects of the project. In addition, the Regional 
Safeguards Team had estimated that the capacity of ADETIP to conduct environmental 
and social assessments is regulated by its Operational Manual which has specific 
provisions for them. This capacity is being fully transferred to ADDS, which would be 
the implementing agency for the project.
