B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The $62M Cidades do Ceara Project ($41M funded by the Bank) will promote economic 
development of key regions in the state, starting with Cariri region, through the: integration of 
public policies, fostering regional economic potential, provision of urban services and enabling 
participation of local, regional and state actors. The longer term goal is to create regional 
development alternatives that can compete with FMA to attract businesses and population, 
enabling development of a model that could be later be replicated to other regions.  
 
Core indicators include:  
 
ÔÇß 
New businesses and jobs created and associated increase in revenue in the supported 
clusters (vs FMA)  
 
ÔÇß 
Improved municipal management and metropolitan governance reflected by 
improvements in key infrastructure services, fiscal management and business environment  
 
ÔÇß 
Successful articulation of different stakeholder groups acting within the region: Regional 
Development Council (state, municipal, private and civil society representatives), social capital 
Page  2
formed across business clusters; metropolitan  management in CRAJUBAR region, and more 
coordinated planning of state agencies   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will have three components:  
 
1) Territorial Improvement ($37M, 60% of total): investments in municipal infrastructure in the 
Cariri region to include: transportation, environmental sanitation, water, urban improvement, and 
accompanying provisions for ensuring efficient and sustainable management of the services.  A 
preliminary list of investment projects was development in the initial phases of project 
identification. While the selected investments will be aimed at improving the living conditions of 
the residents of Cariri, special attention will be given to linkages with the key economic clusters 
of tourism and shoe-making. The priority investments include urban by-pass and access roads, 
rural road improvements, parking facilities, urban center transit facilities, tourism route 
development, environmental sanitation, and improvements of urban parks. The detailed list of 
investments and their feasibilities will be prepared during project preparation.  
 
2) Innovation and Private Sector Development ($16M, about 25% of project) to improve the 
business environment, promote industry competitiveness, technology upgrading, training, and 
market outreach. The project will support the establishment of public-private Technology and 
Design Innovation Centers, based on the successful Technology Center  model developed in 
Spain (CITEs) and replicated in Peru, and building on the Stateís network of technology training 
centers (Centro de Ensino Tecnol√≥gico do Ceara-CENTEC ) in Cariri and Baixo Jaguaribe 
Regions, aswell as initiatives to improve the functioning of value chains of key sectors of the 
identified subregions and facilitate their access to domestic and international markets. Other 
private sector support measures that may arise from the business plan studies of the tourism, shoe 
and irrigated fruit clusters may also be supported under this component  
 
3) Institutional Strengthening ($9M, about 15% of total) focused on interventions to promote 
efficient and participatory governance at municipal, metropolitan and regional level; 
municipal/regional capacity to promote economic growth; public-private partnerships for local 
economic development (clusters) and replication of the regional development model to other 
regions in the State.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Cariri region is a poor region in a poor Northeast State, but with a large economic 
development potential. The Region encompasses 12 municipalities (approximately 582,000 
inhabitants) which concentrate 7% of state population. Nearly 69% of the population is 
considered poor since they earn less than 50% of the minimum monthly wage of about $180. 
Informal businesses prevail in the region, most of them connected to commerce, tourism and 
shoe industries (39% of State production).  The Human Development Index, measured in 2000 
was of. 0.636, which is less than the state average (0.699) and much lower than of the capital city 
of Fortaleza (0.786).  The metropolitan region of Crajubar, comprised of three urban 
municipalities and over 400,000 inhabitants, has huge metropolitan management, transport and 
environmental sanitation challenges.   Sewerage service is available to only 20% of urban 
population of the region, compared with 61% in Fortaleza and 40% for the state as a whole. In 
Page  3
addition urban drainage is a major issue, as is traffic congestion due to a lack of transport 
planning and basic infrastructure.  Tables 2 and 3 in Annex 1 provide more detailed information 
of the municipalities making up the Cariri and the Baixo Jaguaribe Regions.  
 
These regions also have enormous economic development potential.  In Cariri region, tourism 
and manufacturing industries, such as footwear, have been major drivers of private investments.  
 
Tourism encompasses a variety of modalities, including religious, cultural, scientific, ecological 
and business events.  Religious tourism is based on the Father Cicero, a catholic priest that had 
major religious and political influences in the region, during the late 19th century and early 20th 
century.  Major catholic events take place during the year in Juazeiro to celebrate the priest and 
his legacy.  Nearly 1,500,000 pilgrims from various Northeastern states visit Juazeiro every year.  
In addition, commerce, handcrafts, lodging and other tourism activities create most of the jobs in 
Juazeiro, most of them informal.  Other municipalities in the Cariri region also have significant 
potential for tourism, as it holds an extensive fossil basin which has allowed for the creation, 
under UNESCO?s auspices, of the first geopark in the Americas.  Given its peculiar nature, rich 
culture, emerging commerce and geographic location, Cariri region has become one of the 
preferred sites for tourism business events. Finally, the shoe industry in Cariri ranks as third 
largest in Brazil, is responsible for nearly 8,000 jobs and comprises approximately 40% of shoe 
firms located in Cear?.  Small and medium firms prevail, however, with a corresponding lack of 
skilled labor, innovation capacity, technical knowledge and market information. With heightened 
global competitive pressure in this sector, it is critical that the sector be upgraded in terms of 
design, technology, skills, marketing and other innovations.  
 
The Baixo Jaguaribe region leads Cear√°ís private investment in irrigated fruitsas well as the 
Stateís related production, with main products being melon, watermelon, mango, banana and 
pineapple.   The region has more than 54% of the State water resources and is also responsible 
for nearly 35% of the overall state production of fruits and 77% of the fruit export market.  The 
World Bank is deeply engaged in financing water conveyance infrastructure associated with the 
Stateísmajor dam (Castanh√£o), which contributes water for the irrigation of 43,000 ha.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The State of Ceara, and the staff of the proposed executing agency, Secretariat of Cities, has 
adequate capacity to deal with safeguard policies as they have successfully implemented the 
PROURB project which had the same types of investments as those envisioned in this project, as 
well as the PROGERIH water resource management project, which required large amounts of 
resettlement. Project preparation will include an assessment of safeguard policies and 
institutional capacity for their implementation in the relevant municipalities and state.

limited resettlement and (b) wastewater treatment and sanitary landfill. There are no major 
irreversible impacts expected. The proposed project will contribute to improve the environmental 
quality of the Cariri Region by decreasing traffic congestion and associated air pollution and 
improving the environmental sanitation conditions - drainage, sewerage and solid waste 
management. Temporary environmental negative impacts expected during the works execution 
will be mitigated through an appropriate environmental mitigation plan which will be 
incorporated into the project operational manual.  The project will also support the expansion of 
productive projects in the shoe, tourism and irrigated agriculture clusters, and the direct and 
cumulative environmental impact of these activities will be assessed and appropriate mitigation 
measures put in place. A regional environmental assessment will be prepared to guide project 
design.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)
