2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the project is to promote economic development, improve urban 
infrastructure, and enhance regional management capacity in the Central Cariri Region of 
Cear√°, which includes the nine municipalities of Barbalha, Cariria√ßu, Crato, Farias 
Brito, Jardim, Juazeiro do Norte, Miss√£o Velha, Nova Olinda, and Santana do Cariri.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project will have three components:  
 
Component 1: Infrastructure Improvements comprises investments in infrastructure at 
the regional and municipal levels of Central Cariri to address critical infrastructure 
deficits, protect and restore the environment, and improve public services for local 
residents and tourists. Regional infrastructure includes transportation infrastructure to 
reduce congestion, increase mobility and access to the main tourism sites, and a regional 
sanitary landfill to provide an environmentally sound disposal site for solid wastes 
generated in the region. Municipal infrastructure includes drainage improvements in 
Page  2
environmentally degraded areas, urban center upgrading, upgrading of public spaces used 
by ìromeirosî (religious pilgrims), environmental sanitation, and improvements to urban 
parks. These investments will complement the planned regional road rehabilitation and 
maintenance (Padre Cicero Highway) and other transportation investments to be financed 
by the State Government separate from the project. Annex 4 presents the proposed set of 
investments as well as a description of the criteria used for investment selection. While 
some of the investments are at an advanced stage of preparation, others are still to be 
refined and will be selected using the same set of criteria.  
 
Component 2: Cluster-based Local Economic Development. This component will 
initially facilitate the growth of the tourism and footwear clusters in the Central Cariri 
Region to enhance their competitiveness through business environment improvement, 
technology upgrading, training and market outreach, and provision of infrastructure for 
cluster development. Other clusters (such as the plated jewelry cluster) may be added 
later as they become more organized. For the footwear cluster, the key activities will 
include the establishment of a public-private Technology and Design Innovation Center, 
based on the successful Technology Center model developed in Spain (CITEs); provision 
of incentives for private sector collaboration and social capital enhancement in areas such 
as joint marketing, participating in trade fairs, study tours, and introducing technical 
innovation to the region; and professional facilitation of the cluster process. For the 
tourism cluster, the key activities will include the setting up of the Araripe Geopark  with 
investments such as visiting and learning facilities, observatory sites, reception facilities, 
information kiosks, and resting areas; the construction of a regional convention center; 
support to tourism planning, promotion and marketing, events organization and 
improvements, and capacity building; and professional facilitation of the tourism cluster 
process. A transportation and logistics plan will be developed to improve heavy freight 
traffic patterns and facilitate regional mobility. Municipal business regulation 
simplification will be supported by IFC to reduce bureaucracy for economic development 
for the main cities of Juazeiro do Norte and Crato.  
 
Component 3: Regional Management and Institutional Strengthening will support 
promoting effective governance at the municipal, regional and state levels through 
activities in i) Regional Management; ii) Municipal Institutional Strengthening; and iii) 
Implementation Support. (i) Regional management will be supported through technical 
assistance provided to the Consultative Committee (Comit√™ Consultivo), which will 
serve as the main channel for improving regional coordination and collaborations in 
Central Cariri, in the following areas: preparation and implementation of a regional 
environment strategy to address issues such as regional solid waste management, water 
management, sanitation and drainage improvements, and reforestation and prevention of 
deforestation; preparation and implementation of other regional strategies to address 
other critical regional management issues; development of the consortium for the 
construction and operation of the regional landfill, which will eventually tend to other 
regional issues such as metropolitan transport and environmental sanitation; and project 
preparation work to tap other sources of financing (such as PAC), as well as for follow-
on projects of the Bank. (ii) Municipal Institutional Strengthening will be provided 
through technical assistance and capacity building activities in areas such as planning, 
Page  3
local economic development, project design, appraisal and implementation (including 
procurement, M&E), revenue collection, budget and financial management, management 
of public services, and environmental management. (iii) Finally, the component will 
support the Secretariat of Cities in fulfilling its plan for municipal support and regional 
development, by financing technical assistance to the Secretariat for city and regional 
development, and implementation-related activities, including, inter alia, contracting of 
local and regional consultants and staffing of UGP, monitoring and evaluation activities, 
auditing, equipment, technical assistance, training, study tours, and incremental operation 
cost during project implementation.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Central Cariri region is a poor region in a poor state, facing a number of growth 
management and infrastructure-related challenges. The Region encompasses 9 
municipalities (approximately 554,000 inhabitants) which concentrate 7% of state 
population. Nearly 67% of the population is considered poor since they earn less than 
50% of the minimum monthly wage of about $180. Informal businesses prevail in the 
region, most of them connected to commerce, tourism and shoe-making (the latter 
accounting for 39% of State production). The Human Development Index (2000) was 
0.622 for the region, which is less than the state average (0.699) and much lower than of 
the capital city of Fortaleza (0.786). Tables 1 and 2 in Annex 1 of the PAD provide more 
detailed information of the municipalities making up the Central Cariri region.  
 
The CRAJUBAR region of Cariri, comprised of three urban municipalities (Crato, 
Juazeiro and Barbalha) and over 400,000 inhabitants, is the nexus of the project area in 
economic and population terms. In addition to boasting the highest HDI and lowest 
poverty levels of the Central Cariri region, CRAJUBAR also faces great metropolitan 
management, transport and environmental management challenges. Traffic congestion is 
a
major problem owing to a lack of transport planning and basic infrastructure. 
Environmental challenges such as deforestation and improper solid waste disposal also 
abound. Many of these issues, however, are inter-municipal and extend beyond the 
CRAJUBAR borders, highlighting the need for the entire Central Cariri region to work 
together to manage them.   
 
This region also has significant economic development potential. In the Cariri region, 
tourism and manufacturing industries, such as footwear, have been major drivers of 
private investment. Tourism in the region encompasses a variety of activities ranging 
from religious to scientific, cultural, ecological and commercial. Most tourists come for 
religious reasons, to celebrate the legacy of Father Cicero, an influential Catholic priest 
who resided in Juazeiro do Norte during the late 19th century and early 20th century. 
Major events in honor of Father Cicero take place throughout the year in Juazeiro and the 
city hosts nearly 1,800,000 pilgrims each year, mainly from the Northeastern region. 
Most of the jobs in Juazeiro are tourism-related (restaurants, commerce, handcrafts, 
lodging) and a large portion of them informal. Other municipalities in the Cariri region 
also have significant potential for tourism, as the region holds an extensive fossil basin 
which, under UNESCOís auspices, is lending to the creation of the first geopark in the 
Page  4
Americas. Given its peculiar nature, rich culture, emerging commerce and geographic 
location, Cariri region has become one of the preferred sites for tourism business events. 
Finally, the shoe industry in Cariri ranks as third largest in Brazil, is responsible for 
nearly 8,000 jobs and
 approximately 40% of shoe firms located in Cear√°. Small and 
medium firms prevail, however, with a corresponding lack of skilled labor, innovation 
capacity, technical knowledge and market information. With heightened global 
competitive pressure in this sector, it is critical that the sector be upgraded in terms of 
design, technology, skills, marketing and other innovations.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project triggers and addresses the following Bank safeguard policies:  
 
OP 4.01 ñ Environmental Assessment  
 
The package of project activities, including consulting services and works, has been 
prepared at the conceptual level, and some have gone on further to the level of technical, 
environmental and economic feasibility studies. During project implementation, for civil 
works contracts, further detailed engineering designs will be prepared.  
 
An Environmental Assessment (EA) which includes a Regional Environmental 
Assessment (REA) has been completed. In accordance with the Bankís environmental 
policies applicable to Category ìAî projects, the EA report provides an overview of the 
Central Cariri Regionís environmental challenges and strategic priorities, evaluates the 
positive and negative impacts of the proposed project interventions, assesses the capacity 
of the state and municipal agencies to implement environmental regulations, and 
proposes an environmental management plan with mitigating measures to address 
potential negative impacts and strategic environmental priorities. A social assessment has 
Page  5
also been prepared to propose priority actions to address the main social issues and risks 
in the region for the project, including an Involuntary Resettlement Framework. The EA 
Report contains an Executive Summary in Portuguese and English.  
 
A
Social and Environmental Management Plan (EMP), with a detailed presentation of 
impact mitigation measures was also concluded, and comprises the following: (i) general 
description of the project; (ii) characterization of Central Cariri municipalities; (iii) social 
and environmental institutional and regulatory framework; (iv) safeguard policies; (v) 
social and environmental assessment for regional and urban infrastructure investments 
(environmental assessment framework); (vi) social and environmental assessment and 
mitigating actions for the envisioned impacts at this stage in the Project; (vii) 
strengthening of social and environmental management with Cear√° State Government; 
and, (viii) action plans of the Project. A resettlement policy framework was also 
completed, and is attached as an annex to the EMP final report.  
 
The environmental assessment, conducted during project preparation, evaluates the 
overall environmental impacts of all the proposed investments under the project, in 
compliance with the Bankís environmental policy. Following the Cear√° Stateís 
environmental legislation, the analyses will be complemented by more detailed specific 
environmental studies after the completion of detailed designs of each specific 
intervention for the issuance of the Cear√° State environmental license. Those specific 
environmental studies will be carried out during the projectísimplementation stage, in 
parallel, and integrated with the preparation of detailed engineering designs. The 
preliminary environmental license, the environmental installation license and the 
operation license were already required, before construction work commences, and 
submitted to the Bank. Many of these documents are part of the EMP final report, 
attached as annexes. Submittal to the Bank of the preliminary environmental license is a 
condition for the bidding of construction work and installation license for the signature of 
the construction contract. Those conditions will be included in the Projectís loan 
agreement.  
 
Environmental Analysis of the Projectís Components  
 
The physical interventions envisioned in the Project are related to Infrastructure 
Improvements (Component 1), involving the following regional and urban interventions: 
(i): improvement in environmental sanitation with the regional sanitary landfill work 
(CRAJUBAR Consortium); (ii) improvement of the urban and regional transportation, 
with construction of a bypass road; (iii) improvement of urban areas such as parks and 
squares; and (iv) upgrades to tourism areas such as Araripe, and integrated urban center 
for the romeiros. Related to Cluster-based Local Economic Development (Component 2), 
the physical interventions include the investments in infrastructure in the Araripe 
Geopark and a Convention Center in Cariri.  
 
The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework developed for the project will be 
followed in the detailed design and implementation of these regional and urban 
interventions. The evaluation of necessities regarding land expropriation as well as land 
Page  6
tenure situations for each participant was conducted, together with the conclusion of the 
Social and Environmental Management Plan. Official documents are included as annexes 
to the EMP final report, describing the actual stage of these actions.  
 
CRAJUBAR Sanitary Landfill. Studies related to site selection for the future landfill, its 
conceptual design, and the TOR for the EIA to acquire the environmental licenses are 
also complete. The new landfill site, located in an area between Juazeiro and Crato will 
have the capacity to serve the 9 municipalities during next 20 years (based on individual 
production of solid waste equivalent to 0.65 kg/person/day), though it will initially serve 
only the CRAJUBAR region. The landfill site is being finalized with the participation of 
SEMACE. A study financed by FUNASA will prepare the detailed engineering design 
for the landfill. The current landfill site will be properly closed as part of the work. The 
licensing process has been started, under r
esponsibility of Cear√° State Government.  
 
Juazeiro do Norte Bypass Road. The bypass road is a clear priority for linking Crato to 
the main roadway to Fortaleza by bypassing central Juazeiro. The detailed design is to be 
undertaken as part of the scope of the consultancy for the Transport Plan. A detailed EIA 
(Environmental Impact Assessment), in compliance with Brazilian law and Bank 
policies, will be conducted. The licensing process has been started, under responsibility 
of Cear√° State Government.  
 
Juazeiro do Norte Integrated Urban Center Revitalization. A plan of this area to contain 
the infrastructure works oriented towards romeiro tourism must be made with the help of 
specialists in urban planning, local and social development, and management.  
 
S√£o Jos√© Seminary Vicinities and Central Area Squares Integration, in the city of 
Crato, will undertake measures to stop the serious hillside erosion which has already 
changed the landscape and forced many families to be relocated. The proposed 
interventions include rehabilitation of the drainage system to divert storm water properly 
into drainage canals, creation of a park by rehabilitating the hillside landscape with trees 
and other plants, and resettlement of families who are under severe threat of soil erosion. 
The Municipal government has secured resources from CEF ñ Caixa Econ√¥mica 
Federal (a Federal Government bank) ñ for the resettlement of families who live in risk 
prone areas. In accordance with the Resettlement Framework under preparation, a 
Resettlement Action Plan for the families will be developed in accordance with the 
Framework and executed at a later stage (once the families have been identified).  
 
The Convention Center of Cariri an intervention proposed by the Government of the 
State of Cear√° to be financed entirely through State counterpart funding, responds to a 
regional demand concentrated in the municipalities of Crato, Juazeiro do Norte and 
Barbalha, for a large and high quality venue capable of hosting various events, such trade 
fairs, conferences and seminars. The objective of the convention center is to support the 
region as a business hub, with emphasis on the strengthening of local productive sectors, 
including footwear and tourism, the latter pertaining to ecological, cultural and 
educational development. Given the size and type of intervention, the elaboration of an 
environmental feasibility study will be submitted to SEMACE for analysis. According to 
Page  7
the social assessments carried out, this work does not require actions relating to the 
acquisition of land or resettlement, as the land is already owned by the Municipality of 
Crato.  
 
Other road construction work such as works on Beira-Brejo Avenue in Barbalha should 
be better evaluated, especially during the execution of transport planning studies.  
 
One of the main environmental issues identified is the general lack of proper wastewater 
collection and treatment in the area. To tend to this critical need, at the request of the 
Secretariat of Cities, a Plan for Urban Environmental Sanitation for Central Cariri is 
currently under preparation, with financing from FUNASA. The purpose of the plan is to 
address issues of environmental sanitation, including wastewater treatment and 
collection, in line with the strategy of the State. The Cidades do Ceara Project will seek to 
incorporate sanitation-related activities as defined by the Sanitation Plan. The Project will 
monitor the implementation of the Plan as part of Component 3. Funding for related 
investments may be made available through PAC.  
 
OP 4.04 
ñ
Natural Habitats  
 
It is expected that the Project will have a positive impact on natural habitats, as the 
proposed interventions aim to maintain and consolidate the existing Araripe Conservation 
Unit (APA do Araripe). Among the planned infrastructure investments, the evaluation of 
the majority of the investments revealed that impacts on the natural habitat would be 
positive, as recovery of degraded urban areas and revaluation of the natural habitat, 
especially the Araripe Geopark area, and also in the project area of the proposed ring 
road, have been contemplated in the Project.  
 
In addition, the Project will support a Social and Environmental Management Plan and 
its implementation, which would involve plans and actions by the state and municipal 
governments to preserve the environmental conditions in the region, especially the 
Araripe Geopark.  
 
OP 4.12 ñ Involuntary Resettlement  
 
The project would require the resettlement of families living in risk areas (e.g. 
endangered by soil erosion in Crato). Also, land acquisition will be needed and there may 
be additional requirements for involuntary resettlements associated with the proposed 
infrastructure investments. The number of families affected is not clear at this stage, as 
project area, scope, and design are still being refined, but the number of affected families 
is not likely to be significant. These families will be compensated with appropriate 
housing built in safe areas in nearby areas. A Resettlement Framework was prepared in 
accordance with World Bank guidelines and safeguards (OP 4.12). The Resettlement 
Action Plan for the families will be developed in accordance with the Framework and 
executed at a later stage. Bank clearance of the respective Resettlement Action Plans will 
be a condition for the Bank to give no objection to the civil works bidding documents.  
 
Page  8
During preparation a meeting with key municipal representatives involved with 
resettlement processes, UGP members, and a World Bank social specialist was held to 
discuss Bank procedures related to resettlement. Among the topics covered were 
expropriation, indemnities, and cadastres. The project and municipal representatives 
agreed on an agenda for future activities to satisfy the Bank safeguard requirement for 
involuntary resettlement. Details of the consultation are located in Annex 9 of the EMP.  
 
OP 4.11- Physical Cultural Resources  
 
Urbanization of Tupinamb√° Sugar Mill Site, in Barbalha. This site is of historical and 
cultural value and therefore deserves a detailed evaluation. Legal processes have been 
conducted by the National Institute for Protection of Historical and Archeological Sites 
(IPHAN), leading to the possibility of access to Federal resources to upgrade the 
building. Investments under this project will not touch the building, but will entail 
upgrades of the surrounding area.  
 
Geopark: The policy also applies to the construction of infrastructure for tourism inside 
the Geopark, as the area contains archeological and paleontological assets, and would 
apply to any other chance find procedures in the EMPs for the proposed infrastructure 
investments.  
 
OP 4.36 ñ Forests  
 
The Project contemplates activities related to the management and conservation of 
protected forest areas. In the project area such protected areas include FLONA  - Floresta 
Nacional do Araripe; the Parque Arajara Reserve; the Timba√∫bas Ecopark, and APA ñ 
Chapada do Araripe. Among the environmental control activities are planned actions to 
promote environmental preservation of the FLORA and APA - Chapada do Araripe, 
including reforestation activities to improve degraded natural habitats, and support to the 
region in the management and protection of these natural resources. No negative impacts 
are foreseen with regard to these activities.  
 
Regarding the presence of indigenous peoples in the area, after careful analysis and 
screening, no indigenous peoples were found to be residing within the project area.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Positive Impacts  
 
The proposed Project is expected to have highly positive environmental impact given its 
focus on environmental improvements, particularly related to environmental sanitation. 
This positive impact will be achieved through the implementation of a sanitary regional 
landfill, combined with a solid waste management plan; environmental preservation and 
rehabilitation interventions such as the Sao Jose Seminary area in Crato as well as 
numerous parks. In addition, the construction of a bypass road which will help inter- and 
intra-regional accessibility and reductions in transportation time.  
Page  9
The technical assistance component of the project will give high priority to 
environmental protection, including the development and implementation of a Social and 
Environmental Management Plan to address issues such as solid waste management, 
water management , sanitation and drainage, reforestation and prevention of 
deforestation, and protection of the natural habitats units (APA 
ñ
Araripe Environmental 
Protection Areas), leading to an increase in value of the landscape and the recovery of the 
natural habitat. Moreover, promotion for the organization of footwear production and 
tourism clusters would generate positive impacts in the Central Cariri region, such as an 
increase in employment as well as in tourism activities and local hotel chain occupation. 
In addition to the environmental interventions, the Project will also improve the quality of 
life in specific low-income settlements. Some of the interventions, particularly those in 
Juazeiro, would enhance the pilgrimage experience of millions of predominantly low-
income people.  
 
Negative impacts  
 
The construction of some infrastructure investments could result in some limited 
negative environmental impacts. These would be mitigated through the implementation 
of a series of mitigating measures included in the Projectís environmentalmanual for 
construction work. Although most construction work will be of small dimensions, 
infrastructure construction could result in short-term localized environmental impacts 
including dust and noise pollution as well as erosion. These issues will be managed 
through a series of mitigation measures described in the Environmental Construction 
Manual (ECM).  
 
Some interventions may result in land expropriation and involuntary resettlement of part 
of the population. Alternative measures are being analyzed and a resettlement policy 
framework was devised to minimize the associated impacts.  
 
In the tourism sector, a need for professional training was identified as well as the need 
for the preservation of natural sites for further tourism development in the region. In the 
actual local social context, one of the noteworthy aspects raised by the social assessment 
is the involvement of child prostitution during intense periods of pilgrimage. To address 
this important social issue an Action Plan for Youth Assistance has been developed as 
part of the EMP; a detailed description of the activities (and budgetary allocation) for 
working with youth on issues of child prostitution, drug use, and others is located in the 
EMP.  
 
In the footwear sector, professional training is also needed and the main impacts are due 
to the use of coal for energy supply, resulting in illegal wood extraction as well as the 
absence of adequate treatment and disposal of the final residues generated in the 
productive processes. Measures to manage potential project-induced impacts in the sector 
have already been devised and are described in detail in the EMP. Such measures include, 
but are not limited to: support of technological advances in the sector including 
development of alternatives to coal for energy supply; activities to incentivize 
Page  10
introduction of community Effluent Treatment Stations (ETEs), especially for SMEs, to 
improve waste disposal mechanisms, increase recycling, etc; provide training, especially 
for SMEs, on improving the social and environmental conditions of the workplace.  
 
A
summary of the budget allocation for the management of safeguards issues and 
implementation of Action Plans is located in Table 8 of the EMP.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Two projects were evaluated in terms of location alternatives: the deployment of the 
landfill, with a specific study for selection areas suitable for the works, and the ring road 
of Juazeiro. Both evaluations sought minimize the negative impacts to be generated by 
operations.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Capacity Assessments of Cear√° State Government in Implementing Safeguards Policies.  
 
Capacity assessments of environment and social safeguards have been concluded. 
Because of the uneven capacities at the municipal levels, environmental and social 
safeguards will be implemented centrally at the State level. The Cariri office of SEMACE 
will play a critical role in ensuring the implementation of the Environmental Management 
Plan together with the Secretariat of Cities. The Project will also strengthen institutional 
capacity of the state and municipal governments in environmental planning and 
enforcements under Component 3. An Action Plan for Training and Communication has 
been developed as part of the EMP and defines specific measures to strengthen municipal 
capacity to oversee adherence of safeguards policies. These include:  (i) training (specific 
measures for training of local agents are described in general terms below and in detail in 
the Training and Communication Action Plan of the EMP); (ii) learning by doing through 
intensive support from the Secretariat of Cities during the implementation phase; and (iii) 
support to local agents by the Nucleus (NGSA ñ N√∫cleo de Gest√£o Social e Ambiental 
do Cariri). Among the specific activities for the Training and Communication Action 
Plan are: contracting of social and environmental consultants for the Nucleus to interface 
regularly with the UGP; training of local agents including technical environmental 
specialists from each municipality and of the regional SEMACE; and training and 
support of evaluation and oversight specialists from the Secretariat of Citiesí project team 
and from the regional (local) Project office during Project implementation.  
 
A
Consultative Committee will be formed which will include the Mayors of the nine 
municipalities of Central Cariri region. This Committee is an important instrument for 
achieving the Projectís goals, which refer to strengthening regional management. This 
Committeeís tasks would be, among others: unite the nine Municipalities to discuss 
regional issues, such as a regional environmental strategy; evaluate the Annual 
Investment Plan and establish a dialogue with the State Government about this Plan; 
follow the Projectís activities; and share experiences, ideas and information related to the 
Page  11
Project. The Committee will oversee the development and implementation of the regional 
environmental strategy.  
 
Supervision of the environmental aspects of the project will also be provided by the 
Regional office of SEMACE 
(Cear√° State Environmental Secretariat) based inJuazeiro. 
The Project will help strengthen SEMACE and municipal staff connected to 
environmental control and licensing performed in environmental programs for the 
monitoring and follow-up of construction work. SEMACE and local governments have 
committed to appointing environmental and social technical personnel who will be able 
to contribute to the implementation of the Project.  
 
The Social and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is complete and includes the 
main issues raised by the environmental assessment, works, and tourism and footwear 
sectors, such as:  
 
ï
Evaluation of resettlement necessities and land tenure situation for each component 
(for infrastructure activities);  
 
ï
Action plans, encompassing objectives, goals, foreseeable actions, timeline and 
budgeting;

In accordance with the Bankís Information Disclosure Policy (BP 17.50) a process of 
disclosure and public consultation as a part of the Environmental Assessment was 
completed. In addition to the numerous consultations and stakeholder interviews that 
have been conducted throughout the project identification and preparation process, a 
large public consultation meeting was held January 2008 in Crato at URCA ñ Cariri 
Regional University auditorium in which about 250 people from all 9 municipalities 
participated (and signed the list of attendance). The open public consultation meeting 
discussed the background and initial proposed actions for the Project. The consultation 
event also provided disclosure of the socio-environmental studies, identified partners in 
the process, and invited the public to participate in the process involving experience 
exchange and suggestions to be incorporated to the Project. The meeting was transmitted 
to the entire region by Crato Educational Radio Station. The Environmental Assessment 
Report, including the Social and Environmental Management Plan and the Involuntary 
Resettlement Framework, were published on the Secretariat of Citiesí public website on 
May2, 2008. At the time at which the public consultation was conducted, the 
Resettlement Policy Framework for the Project had not yet been prepared and specific 
resettlement needs had not yet been identified. During the presentation of the social 
analysis of the Project, however, it was announced that minimal resettlement would occur 
under the Project and that Bank safeguard policies would apply and an RPF would be 
prepared in accordance with such policies. In the weeks following the public 
consultation, a meeting with key municipal representatives involved with resettlement 
processes, UGP members, and a World Bank social specialist was held to discuss Bank 
resettlement procedures. Among the topics covered were expropriation, indemnities, and 
cadastres. The project and municipal representatives agreed on a schedule for conduction 
of activities to satisfy the Bank safeguard requirement for involuntary resettlement. 
Details of the consultation are located in Annex 9 of the EMP.
