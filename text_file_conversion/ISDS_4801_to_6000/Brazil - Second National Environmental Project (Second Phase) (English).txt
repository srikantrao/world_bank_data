2. Project Objectives 
The goal of the Program is to assist states and selected municipalities to increase their 
capacity to effectively manage their natural resources, control pollution and reduce 
environmental degradation which would bring about improvements in environmental 
conditions and quality of life. The Development Objective for the proposed Phase 2 of 
NEP II is to contribute to strengthening environmental capacity in key Brazilian 
institutions. This would be accomplished by enhancing the environmental management 
capacity of environmental institutions at the Federal, State and Municipal levels and by 
demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted subprojects focused on priorities determined 
by States. Institutional development would be promoted by strengthening environmental 
policies and regulations, strengthening environmental licensing, improving 
environmental monitoring, supporting innovative use of economic instruments and 
finally, through targeted decentralized demand-driven subprojects aimed at improved 
management and conservation of selected environmental assets.

3. Project Description 
a) Institutional Development Component (US$25.7 million total, US$18.0 million 
IBRD): will include the following subcomponents: (i) Strengthening Environmental 
Licensing policies and procedures in states and municipalities; (ii) Development of 
Environmental Quality Monitoring; and (iii) Economic Instruments for Environmental 
Management. As in the Environmental Assets component, the classification of states 
within the Eligibility Criteria matrix would allow them to qualify for resources (i,e, 
R$500,000 in Class 1 up to R$1,500,000 in Class 4 for the Environmental Licensing 
subcomponent).  
 
b) Integrated Management of Environmental Assets Component (US$3.0 million total, 
US$2.1 million IBRD): based on the principle that states identify and address their key 
environmental priorities through specific subprojects.  For Phase 2, the first requirement 
for participation is for states to update their top ranking environmental priorities (from 
those identified during Phase 1) to reflect current conditions.  
 
c) Coordination, Dialogue and Communications Component (US$ 5.0 million total, 
US$3.5 million IBRD): The project will support a unit with the technical and 
administrative capacity needed to develop subprojects and activities at a decentralized 
level.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project can be implemented in all 26 states of the Federative Republic of Brazil, 
depending if they qualify according to the project's eligibility criteria to be fulfilled.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
None at this point.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
None at this point.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Project Implementation Unit has prepared frameworks for Environmental 
Assessment, Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples or Quilombolas, 
observing the Bank's safeguards policies.  Proponents of subprojects themselves will 
classify the proposed interventions and forward this to the National Coordination Unit for 
review.  Subprojects classified as A or B would require appropriate EIA/EMPs, RAPs, 
etc.  There are environmental experts in the PCU who are competent to screen projects 
and to review the assessments to address safeguards policy issues.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stake holders are the Secretaries of Environment on each state the project will be 
implemented in.  Prior to achieving eligibility for project implementation, each State 
needs to update its environmental priorities.  The priorities setting involve consultation 
with potentially affected people. Subproject proposals are required to show that 
appropriate consultation has been carried out with potentially affected people.
