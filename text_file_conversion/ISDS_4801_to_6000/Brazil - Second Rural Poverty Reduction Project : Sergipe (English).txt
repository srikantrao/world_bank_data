B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
Building on the CDD approach utilized successfully under the first phase project, the second 
phase Rural Poverty Reduction Project: Sergipe (RPRP-2) would support the Government of 
Sergipe in its efforts to reduce rural poverty under its  “development with inclusion” strategy by: 
(a) improving access of the rural poorto basic socioeconomic infrastructure; (b) raising incomes 
and capital assets through investments in productive activities and facilitating linkages between 
small producers and markets; and (c) promoting the cross-sector integration of investments in 
rural areas through strengthened participatory planning, decision-making and monitoring at the 
community, municipal and state levels.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Total project cost is estimated at US$27.1 million. A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$20.8 
million would finance:  
Page  2
Component 1 
–
Community Subprojects to provide matching grants to community associations 
to finance their implementation of about 1,000 small-scale, socio-economic infrastructure and 
services (water supply, electricity, sanitation, education and health, cultural and environmental 
activities), and productive, market-oriented investments. Community associations, through their 
participatory Municipal Councils (known in Sergipe as CONDEM), will identify, prioritize, 
implement, operate and maintain subproject investments, drawing on an information campaign 
conducted by the State to help to promote understanding of project objectives, eligibility and 
rules and on the project Operational Manual.  
 
Component 2 – Institutional Development, executed by the Sustainable Development Company 
of the State of Sergipe (PRONESE), would include (a) technical assistance and training to 
support the mobilization and strengthening of community associations in their role of 
identifying, preparing, executing, operating and maintaining subproject investments; (b) 
capacity-building for project Municipal Councils on responsibilities outlined in the Project 
Operational Manual, including assessment and supervision of community associations, 
participatory planning and the financial management of community subprojects, and 
environmental management for these subprojects; and  (c) workshops and seminars for 
Municipal Councils and community associations to exchange experiences with project 
implementation and facilitate integration with other federal and state programs for poverty 
reduction.  
 
Component 3 – Horizontal Integration to provide technical assistance to the State Secretariat of 
Planning (SEPLAN) to strengthen its emerging results-based management capacity to plan, 
integrate, monitor and evaluate public policies and investments for poverty reduction, and to 
improve the alignment of public expenditures with the State’s development priorities, as outlined 
in the State Multi-annual Development Plan (PPA, 2008-2011). It will also include training 
events for municipalities to assist them in integrating federal and state programs for poverty 
reduction.  
 
Component 4 - Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation to support the 
costs (excluding salaries) of project administration/coordination, supervision, monitoring and 
impact evaluation.  
 
Types of activities under this community demand-driven project are expected to be similar to 
the first phase project but with greater emphasis on certain aspects, as follows:  
 
(a) Productive, income-generating investments to help increase the State's Human Development 
Index will receive more focused attention. These inherently more complex subprojects mandate 
tight screening processes including economic, social and environmental analysis and more 
systematic technical assistance, supervision and marketing support.  Demand is expected to be 
strong.  Productive investments financed under the first phase project were 162% of the appraisal 
estimate and about 31% of all investments financed.  
 
(b) The project will intensify its approach to integration - initiated successfully under the first 
phase loan.  As conceived, other federal and state programs will use - in parallel - the project-
created operational mechanisms (participatory Municipal Councils and community associations) 
to allocate resources for a range of complementary investments designed to deepen and 
Page  3
accelerate development impact.  The STU, PRONESE, will also continue to strengthen 
partnerships with federal, state and municipal authorities, and other entities which provide 
training to community associations.  
 
(c)  The project would also continue to give priority to ethnic groups (indigenous and 
Quilombola) and to women and youth through information dissemination in appropriate forms, 
mobilization and financing for eligible investments.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will cover 71 municipalities in Sergipe, with 70% of component resources 
concentrated in the 41 poorest municipalities (i.e., HDI<0.623).   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
PRONESE, the State Technical Unit for the first phase of this two-phase operation, has complied 
fully with Bank Safeguards and project environmental rules.  Environmental considerations are 
built in throughout the subproject cycle.  Special activities to further improve environmental 
understanding and/or performance are organized when needed, and the standardized subproject 
designs use the upgraded environmental checklist.  
 
PRONESE has a staff of 29 graduates with specializations in agriculture/land, environmental 
sciences, social sciences and economics, as well as 20 technicians and 51 administrative, 
financial and legal personnel. The STU can call on specialized consultants in irrigation, 
environment, water resources and social sciences and has open access to all state environmental 
agencies (see EMP, Operational Manual and project file) to analyze, monitor and supervise 
environmental safeguards.  PRONESE staff provides advice on subproject preparation and 
coordinates subproject activities with the CAs and MCs.  They also supervise subproject 
implementation, including compliance with project environmental norms.  
 
In 2005, PRONESE’s Administrative Council approved the creation of a new STU unit, the 
Environmental Quality Technical Group (NTGA), currently being established/staffed.  NTGA 
will consist of specialists in biology, agronomy, environmental management, forestry and civil 
engineering and will have access to support from specialized public and private entities: State 
Department for Agricultural Development (DEAGRO); State Secretariat of Environment and 
Water Resources (SEMARH); State Secretariat for Science and Technology (SEDETEC); 
Brazilian Institute for the Environment (IBAMA); Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation 
(EMBRAPA); Brazilian Institute for Support to Small and Micro Enterprise (SEBRAE-SE); 
Federal University of Sergipe; Tiradentes University; and, ArticulaÃ§Ã£o do Semi-
Arido(ASA/Sergipe) as well as other NGOs specialized in environment and sustainable 
development.  
 
The objective of NTGA is to ensure that community subprojects do not have negative impacts 
on the environment by: (a) supporting the process of obtaining Environmental Licenses for 
subprojects, when needed; (b) submitting requests to SEMARH for Water Use Permits, when 
needed; (c) evaluating subproject proposals from the environmental perspective, recommending 
mitigation actions where needed; (d) validating the pre-selection and classification of subproject 
proposals by the MCs for environmental screening (see Section II below) and assist the screening 
Page  4
process itself; and (e) preparing training programs and information campaigns for the CAs, MCs 
and PRONESE itself and for broader  environmental education, to raise societal awareness for 
the prevention, detection and resolution of environmental problems.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
1. The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the proposed RPRP-2 project will 
describe the legal, institutional and operational context, requirements and procedures for 
ensuring that environmental issues are addressed throughout project implementation. These will 
represent both a continuation of successful practices established under RPRP-1 (2002-2006), 
e.g., use of standard subproject designs incorporating environmental analysis and mitigation 
features; application of a checklist of environmental elements to all subprojects during design 
and approval; obtaining licenses from state agencies for subprojects which require this 
procedure; and monitoring compliance with Bank Safeguards throughout the subproject cycle.    
These will be updated with new developments and activities required under more recent 
environmental legislation in the State of Sergipe, and by lessons learned from the first phase 
project (RPRP-1) and similar projects in eight other states of the Northeast. The EMP will also 
reflect current Bank Safeguards requirements and respond to questions identified in the Bank 
report entitled “Thematic Review – Rural Infrastructure Projects in Brazil” (QAT Thematic 
Review, 2002).  
 
2.  The upgraded EMP will ensure that the Project is fully compliant with relevant State and 
Federal environmental legislation and with Bank Safeguards by: (a) assessing adverse and/or 
positive environmental impacts associated with the financed subprojects, both individually and 
collectively; (b) identifying opportunities for employment generation and income through 
activities to protect, restore, conserve and/or properly value the environment; (c) building into all 
eligible subprojects activities designed to protect, restore, conserve and/or properly value the 
environment; (d) generating synergies between productive activities, community development 
and environmental protection, including the formation of localized linkages between subprojects 
and other public or private initiatives; (e) training all involved parties, particularly the 
beneficiary public, to promote environmental management, both in regard to subprojects and in 
overall environmental issues;  (f) joint management of environmental issues between the project, 
local and state entities; and  (g) linking environmental conservation and protection activities with 
poverty-related investments consistent with the State’s Multi-annual Development Plan.  
 
3.  Upgraded procedures/actions contemplated include: (a) environmental worksheets; (b) 
pre-selection and environmental classification of subprojects into specific categories depending 
on assessed potential impact; (c) identification of opportunities for environmental subprojects; 
(d)  introduction of Participatory Environmental Assessments by communities; (e) introduction 
of Assessments of Aggregate (cumulative) Impact; (f) indicator-based, subproject environmental 
monitoring; and (g) demonstration of alternative, environment-friendly technologies.

Yes No TBD 
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
X
The EMP will discuss and the project Operational Manual further detail, measures to ensure 
that neither the State, nor the Bank, through the Project, will approve subprojects which cause 
degradation to essential natural habitats.  The EMP will provide: (a) a list of Federal and State 
Conservation Units in Sergipe; (b) a list of identified, valuable and sensitive areas and eco-
systems; and (c) a list of areas for which new Conservation Units are being proposed.  This 
information will help identify valuable natural habitat areas.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
X
The EMP already defines a process utilized under the RPRP-1, and to be utilized under the 
proposed RPRP-2, for detecting the potential use of pesticides, and screening criteria are already 
included in the project Operational Manual. Where appropriate, the proposed project already 
promotes integrated pest management approaches under subproject investments.   
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
In the event of “chance finds”, the project Operational Manual already outlinesprocedures to 
be followed in the event of such discovery of culturally-significant materials during subproject 
implementation.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
1.  Indigenous: Sergipe has one legally-recognized indigenous ethnic grouping –the XokÃ³ – 
located in the municipality of Porto da Folha and numbering about 360people.  They no longer 
speak their original language and today communicate in Portuguese.  Under the Rural Poverty 
Alleviation Project (1996-2001), the AssociaÃ§Ã£o IndÃ­gena Povoado XokÃ³, a community 
association representing this group, successfully submitted a subproject proposal to finance 
agricultural mechanization valued at US$24,820 and benefiting 68 families. A second proposal 
for a manioc mill submitted in 2005 under RPRP-1 was approved by the Porto da Folha 
Municipal Council - in which the XokÃ³ community had actively participated since 1999 - 
butnot financed due to declining funds in the project’s final stages.  
 
2.  Quilombola: There are also 15 quilombola (African slave-descendent) communities 
certified by the FundaÃ§Ã£o Cultural Palmares and 19 others claiming quilombola identity.  To 
date, some 25 of these 34 communities have benefited from 46 community subprojects under the 
RPRP program representing a total investment of about US$1.3 million, benefiting over 5,000 
families (with repetition).  
 
3.  The RPRP-2 will continue to support these groups by extending coverage to groups not 
already reached and intensifying actions for those already served. XokÃ³ and quilombola 
communities will continue to be brought into the project through culturally appropriate 
communications and outreach campaigns developed in collaboration with indigenous 
entities/local leaders and designed to help these traditional peoples understand project objectives 
and procedures.  This will be complemented by a training and capacity-building program 
developed in collaboration with relevant State and Federal agencies, NGOs and institutions in the 
region. The objective is to ensure open and equitable participation of traditional communities in 
the project (See project Operational Manual).  
 
4.  A Traditional Community Participation Plan will be prepared as an integral part of the 
Page  6
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
project Operational Manual.  It will review the experiences with indigenous peoples and 
quilombola communities under the RPRP-1 project as well as lessons learned, and will define 
guidelines and specific procedures for engaging these communities in project activities. Once 
completed, this document will be submitted to the InfoShop and be made available through the 
State Technical Unit website (http://www.pronese.se.gov.br).
