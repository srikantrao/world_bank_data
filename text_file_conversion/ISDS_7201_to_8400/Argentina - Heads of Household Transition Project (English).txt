B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project would support the workfare part of the Heads of Household Program, a social safety 
net launched by the Government of Argentina in April 2002 to alleviate the impact of risking 
unemployment due to the sharp worsening of the economic crisis.  Although economic 
conditions have improved recently, unemployment rates are still quite high, particularly among 
the poor.  In addition, the project would support the delivery of personalized employment 
services to the beneficiaries of the Program, with the goal of improving employment outcomes 
for them.  As a result of the project, beneficiaries would receive support in obtaining 
employment (including labor orientation, supported job search, intermediation services, 
education, and training).   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
A
specific investment loan is proposed.  The project builds on the Heads of Household Project 
and is intended to facilitate the transition out of the emergency programs.  The Bank team is 
coordinating closely with the IDB team preparing the loan to support the expansion of the 
conditional transfer program.  This would need to continue during the preparation and 
implementation of the proposed project, particularly given the shared responsibilities of the 
Ministries of Social Development and Labor during the 6-12 month transition period next year.

Component 1:  Transfers to Heads of Household Participants ($200 million).  
A
substantial 
share of the loan (80%) would finance transfers to workfare participants (as is the case in the 
current Heads of Household Project).  The project would support further improvements in 
governance of the Program, including a continuation of supervision of municipal registration 
information, completion of the process of replacing bank payment of the monthly benefit by use 
of automatic debit cards, and stricter enforcement of work or training/education requirements, 
and over time job search and counseling.    
 
Component 2:  Provision of Employment Services and Provision ($8.5 million).  
Through 
this component the Ministry of Labor would carry out a program to strengthen the delivery of 
employment services at the municipal level through the provision of technical assistance and 
equipment.  Selectively, the Ministry would also establish some offices itself which would serve 
the double purpose of providing employment services and serving as models of best practice and 
sources of technical assistance.    
 
Component 3:  Provision of Basic Education and Training Services ($4 million).  
The  
project would finance the materials and other costs of providing basic education classes and 
training courses.       
 
Component 4:  Materials for Workfare Activities ($30 million). 
The project would on a 
relatively small-scale provide materials for workfare projects under the reoriented Heads of 
Household Program.  The purpose of these projects would be closely linked to improving the 
employment prospects of the participants.  They would mainly be small civil works at the 
municipal level, some productive projects for groups of mainly Heads of Household participants, 
and strengthening of community services.  The share of financing will depend on the 
characteristics of the municipalities and agreed during project preparation, but would be less than 
is the case under the current project. 
 
Component 5:  Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation ($5 million).  
This would 
support improvements in management of the Program to integrate better the different 
employment interventions and to provide support to the municipalities in the personalized 
support to beneficiaries.  The existing monitoring system of the Heads of Household Program 
suffered from several weaknesses.  Under the new strategy, it will be important not only to 
strengthen monitoring, but also to change the focus from an emphasis on registration and 
payments to beneficiaries, to one focused more on results in the provision of services to 
beneficiaries, and ultimately, to success in job placement.  The project would also finance 
rigorous evaluations of the impact and cost-effectiveness of the most important employment 
services, as well as education and training.  This would built on earlier evaluations carried out by 
the Ministry supported by the Bank.

The project, as currently defined, does not trigger the Bank’s environmental or social safeguard 
policies.  In order to understand better the social considerations of the Heads of Household 
program, as part of loan preparation, three activities are planned.  These include: (1)  the 
preparation of a social assessment which would cover the informal practices influencing the 
program currently, as well as attitudes towards the policies being proposed for the transitional 
period; (2) the examination in several municipalities of both the management of the Heads of 
Household Program and attitudes/capacity for the new activities to promote employment; and (3) 
a
series of consultations with government and key stakeholders in several regions of the country 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

concerning the strategy to be implemented during the transition.  Environmental aspects will 
continue to be addressed in the operational manuals for the relevant components.  Finally, the 
project will continue to support additional improvements in governance of the Heads of 
Household Program, with the aim of bettering its targeting performance.
