A.2. Project Objectives 
 
APPAP-II’s principal objective is to enhance the access to commercial financial services by 
farmers and small/medium size rural enterprises.  APPAP-II w
ill build on APPAP-I achievements 
by:  (a) building capacity for viable rural businesses through strengthening and expanding the 
rural advisory services program;  (b) supporting agricultural risk management initiatives; (c) 
facilitating the development and implementation of new financial instruments by commercial 
banks and leasing companies for deepening rural financial outreach;  and (d) supporting 
sustainable rural micro-finance schemes for providing financial services to rural micro 
entrepreneurs that are currently excluded from the formal banking sector. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
1)  Rural Financial Advisory Services
.  Through a series of workshops, the project will create 
awareness among farmers on the available financial instruments, improve their understanding of 
various financing options, and build general awareness of the need for developing viable business 
conce

600 consultants to establish a nationwide sustainable, financial consulting network along separate 
modules: (i) 
Business planning
: business plan preparation and assessment, farm management, 
cost and financial analysis, risk management; (ii) 
Financial products
: comparative analysis of 
different financing options such as traditional lending, leasing, and structured finance; techniques 
for collateral valuation; non-lending financial products such as production and price risk 
management instruments; and (iii) 
Tax and legal issues
: the legal framework regarding the 
various statutory forms of farm organization; legal and tax implications of different financial 
instruments, including prototype agreements under leasing and structured finance activities; the 
new land code and its implications; the crop-insurance legal requirements; and tax code and tax 
holidays for agriculture and small/medium enterprises. 
 
2a)  Agricultural Production Risk Management
.  The Government recently enacted a crop 
insurance program that seeks to ensure that farmers recover their production costs in the event of 
an adverse weather occurrence.  In support of this program, the project will finance: (i)  weather 
data infrastructure for accurate, reliable, tamper proof and preferably provide information 
automatically; (ii) training for developing the necessary technical skills for those involved in the 
program’s administration, and educational seminars for farmers about program implementation 
mechanisms and about their rights and obligations;  (iii) technical assistance to identify key 
problems and challenges in moving ahead with the crop insurance program, and suggest ways of 
dealing with these issues in order to enhance the program’s sustainability prospects. 
 
2b)  Commodity Price Risk Management
.  Commodity exchanges can significantly increase 
transparency, financing opportunities and efficiency in the market.  The Government is keen on 
removing all impediments to the growth of vibrant, adequately capitalized, modern commodity 
exchanges, and has set up a commission to that effect.  In view of the above, the project will 
support technical assistance and training aimed at supporting the government in putting in place a 
conducive environment for the emergence of modern commodity exchanges, and sharing best 
practices in setting up and running such exchanges. 
 
3)  Rural Outreach Expansion by the Mainstream Financial Sector
.  This component aims at 
helping commercial banks and leasing companies accelerate rural investment lending, particularly 
for the emerging farming clientele.  It will promote rural financial outreach through traditional 
loans and by expanding the use of non-traditional instruments like leasing of agricultural 
machinery, and the use of structured finance for selected supply chains.  This will be achieved 
through technical assistance, accompanied by a limited credit facility as “seed” money to 
stimulate these kinds of investments. 
 
4)  Micro Finance Development
.  In view of the potential contribution of micro finance service 
providers to meeting working capital and small investment loan demands from small farmers and 
other rural small/micro entrepreneurs, the project will support selected MFIs in order to enhance 
their performance, and expand their outreach.  Expanding their outreach will also require a menu 
of innovative products that are tailored to the needs of their new rural clientele.  It also requires 
that, as non-deposit taking institutions, they finance their growing portfolios from commercially 
sourced funds.  Project financed TA will support the development, piloting of innovative 
productions for MFIs.  It will also facilitate MFI-Commercial bank linkages.  A small credit 
facility will be available for onlending on the basis of performance criteria.
 
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Page  4
 
 
 
The project will be implemented countrywide based on demand for services and credit. Project 
activities will not be carried out in protected or culturally/socially sensitive areas. Where potential 
projects are proposed in the vicinity of protected areas or critical habitat, a specific environmental 
assessment will be required. The Microfinance Component of the project is specifically designed 
to benefit small rural households with high incidence of poverty that are currently excluded from 
the services of the formal banking sector, and thus have extremely limited access to financial 
resources needed to participate in the economic development of the country.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Judging from APPAP-I experience, the bulk of investment financing is expected to go into the 
replacement of dilapidated/obsolete agricultural machinery (tractors and combines) for existing 
farms.  Micro finance clients will likely be involved in local trade and vegetable gardening.  On 
the whole, no significant environmental impact is expected to occur as a result of this project.  
Nevertheless, Environmental Guidelines to establish mechanisms for identifying sub-projects that 
might require special environmental mitigation measures to protect environment and quality of 
the natural resources, and mitigation measures have been prepared.   
 
A comprehensive environmental review to prepare environmental screening and mitigation 
procedures for expected sub-project types was carried out.  The review (i) assessed the adequacy 
of the legal framework for environmental assessment; (ii) identified institutions that would be 
responsible for Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA); (iii) determined technical assistance 
and training needs for these institutions to adequately implement the EIA requirements; and (iv) 
proposed procedures for environmental screening, EIA preparation and implementation, possible 
mitigation measures for certain sub-project types, and monitoring and evaluation of 
implementation of EIA requirements.  A manual was prepared for credit officers of participating 
financial institutions as an easy to use referral guide for any environmental issues. Training will 
be conducted for credit officers and other stakeholders on the manual at the start of project 
implementation.  This approach was successfully used in APPAP-I. 
 
The draft manual was discussed at a consultation workshop with the stake holders and local non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and disclosed in country.  The loan agreement shall have 
appropriate language committing the borrower (financial intermediary) to implement the 
environmental guidelines set forth in the operational manual.  In addition, the project will 
annually contract the services of an independent consultant to evaluate the extent to which 
environmental screening is taking place, and in case where remedial action has been proposed, 
the extent to which these actions have been satisfactorily carried out.  This assessment will also 
recommend, as needed, any further training that might be needed to ensure adherence to the 
agreed environmental screening procedures and management plan. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The main institutional responsibility for environmental issues lies with the Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Environmental Protection 
(
MNREP
)
, which is staffed with 1,149 ins
p
ectors. The 
Page  6
 
 
Ministry has territorial offices in the oblasts and the cities of Almaty and Astana.  Staff at both 
headquarters and at the field level is highly trained, although currently understaffing is a problem. 
The law requires environmental reviews for all investment projects, new enterprises, and also 
enterprises that are privatized or alter their production processes.  The legislation also requires 
that the EIAs include alternatives to the proposed action, including that of no action.  Socio-
economic effects are also included in the EIA.  The legal framework is considered more or less 
adequate. 
 
Under the project, commercial banks and leasing companies will have the responsibility of 
approving loans and dispersing funds.  The Guidelines described above will help credit officers of 
the banks to screen each proposed activity, and where screening indicates that an EIA is required, 
the PFI will direct the borrower to conduct and submit an acceptable EIA prior to funding 
approval. Commercial banks, and in particular the staff dealing directly with APPAP II loan 
approvals, will receive training in environmental management, as part of the general training 
provided to credit officers under the project.  Monitoring will be carried out on a systematic basis 
by the project management team or its designate (e.g. a local environmental consultant). The 
World Bank should occasionally also include an environmental specialist on supervision missions 
to ensure that environmental monitoring is being conducted effectively and that monitoring 
results are being acted upon. 
 
As the main implementing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture will assist the commercial banks 
in environmental screening of credit proposals, and in overall implementation of the 
Environmental Guidelines, including cooperation with other Government agencies, especially 
Ministry of Environment. The Ministry of Agriculture has adequate capacity to provide this 
assistance which has been strengthened under a parallel World Bank Irrigation and Drainage 
Project, which included capacity building in the MOA for environmental review of rural 
investment operations. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The draft Guidelines were discussed at a consultation workshop with a number of stakeholders 
from the Ministry of Environment, NGOs and farmer organizations and disclosed in country; 
minor comments received, which were integrated in the final document.  Further public and 
stakeholder awareness of environmental requirements in lending will be ensured under the 
extensive workshops and awareness campaigns to be held under Rural Advisory Services 
Component of the APPAP II.  It is one of the themes of these campaigns.
