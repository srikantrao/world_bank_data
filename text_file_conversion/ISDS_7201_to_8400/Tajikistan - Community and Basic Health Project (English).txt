2. Project Objectives
The objective of the proposed project is to increase access to, utilization of, and patient
satisfaction with health services in project-supported areas, and to build capacity and
efficiency at national, oblast and rayon levels in administering a basic package of health
benefits and introducing financing reforms in primary health care.

3. Project Description
The project would be a Sector Investment Grant (SIG), financed by an IDA Grant of
US$10.0 million equivalent, co-financing from SIDA equivalent to US$6.0 million and
no counterpart funding.

 The project would have 4 components as follows:

 i) Policy, Planning and Donor Coordination in the Ministry of Health: to finance
training, local and international technical assistance, workshops/seminars, study tours and
minor civil works to help strengthen coherence and coordination in policymaking, policy
analysis and the management of donor support by MOH.

 ii) Implementing Organizational and Financing Reforms in the Health Sector: to finance
training, local and international technical assistance, workshops/seminars and study tours
to help support the implementation of per capita financing for primary health care and
implementation of the Basic Benefit Package.

 iii) Strengthening Primary Health Care in Selected Rayons: to finance local technical
assistance, training, medical equipment and civil works to help renew the PHC
infrastructure in two to four rayons in Sughd and Khatlon oblasts and support
complementary measures to improve service delivery and outreach, including training for
health workers and efforts to link health workers and communities more effectively.

 iv) Project Coordination and Capacity Building for Implementation: to finance
equipment, operating costs and local technical assistance for a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) consisting of a director, finance officer, procurement officer and procurement
assistant to be based in MOH for the purposes of carrying out fiduciary oversight of the
Project and building fiduciary capacity in MOH itself.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
This project is Category C. The project is limited to rehabilitation of small primary
health care facilities (usually 1-5 rooms). It is, however, conceivable that a few facilities
might need to be replaced within the existing building footprint, either by de novo

construction or by installation of prefabricated units. These are expected to pose minimal
environmental risks; and the Recipient, though not required to, has prepared an
Environmental Management Plan for this contingency.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
Nil

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Recipient has prepared an Environmental Management Plan covering issues
pertinent to small-scale civil works and will activate the provisions of this Plan should the
Project call for more than rehabilitation and/or installation of prefabricated units. The
Recipientâ TMs capacity to implement these measures is considered adequate, should they
become necessary.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The Environmental Management Plan.
