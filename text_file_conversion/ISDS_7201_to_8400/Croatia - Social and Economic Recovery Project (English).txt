A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The CSERP’s Project Development Objective is to support the economic and social 
revitalization of disadvantaged and war-affected areas as a way to increase social 
cohesion.  Social cohesion is a critical issue for (i) war affected groups (notably, 
minorities, returnees, and internally displaced persons), which still confront barriers to 
their social and economic integration; and (ii) local administrations, which are 
fragmented, often in competition for scarce resources, and lack implementation 
capacity.  The CSERP addresses these challenges by developing and strengthening local 
institutions.  At the central and regional levels, CSERP builds capacity for participatory 
regional development planning and for the absorption of pre-accession funds (PHARE); 
at local level, it builds social capital (i) across local administrations by providing 
incentives for joint sub-projects that two or more local administrations can implement 
and (ii) across ethnic groups, in particular through cooperatives, SMEs, and service 
providers that also promote the social inclusion of young people, women, and 
vulnerable individuals.  The main outcome indicators measuring progress towards the 
attainment of the Project Development Objective are the following: 
ƒ\03
percentage of social inclusion and cooperative subprojects with participation of 
inter-ethnic and war affected groups; 
ƒ\03
increase over time of inter-municipal and inter-county subprojects as defined by 
absolute numbers of projects. 
Page  2
The CSERP is a multisectoral project addressing sustainable development, poverty 
reduction and post-conflict reconstruction of Croatia's war-affected and disadvantaged 
areas.  The project will reflect, build upon, and enhance the Croatian institutional 
arrangement for the management of regional policy in line with EU requirements.  The 
project is strategically focused on the Areas of Special State Concern, consistent with 
the need to reduce regional disparities and enhance social cohesion and social inclusion 
in war-affected areas and therefore contribute to the GoC's goals as outlined in the 
PAAN.  
 
Sustainability of refugee return is affected by the relative lack of economic opportunities 
and the absence of social cohesion.  The project will emphasize a bottom-up approach to 
socioeconomic development in these Areas of Special State Concern so that the war-
affected population (including persons who remained, settlers, returnees and internally 
displaced persons) can be targeted for reintegration and other disadvantaged 
communities can be targeted for development in an integrated manner.  The CSERP will 
also strengthen the institutional capacities for participatory regional/local development 
planning at the central, local and regional levels.  De-mining supports these objectives.  
The presence of mines in the former confrontation areas is perceived by locals as one of 
the impediments to economic revitalization and to social cohesion. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project has four components: (i) Community Investment; (ii) Demining; (iii)

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project location is the Areas of Special State Concern. In Croatia, the Areas of 
Special State Concern (ASSC) were defined by law in 1996 as an effort to address 
damage, to stimulate economic development in areas that were war-damaged, and to 
enable the return of displaced persons and refugees. The initial law focused on areas that 
had been occupied, but it has been modified to include non-conflict areas encountering 
severe economic and social difficulties. A key defining feature of the ASSC is the extent 
of economic and social marginalization and deprivation.  
 
The ASSC are located in 13 of the 21 counties. The counties include a range of 
environmental characteristics and habitats, the most sensitive of which are designated 
protected areas. All counties have physical plans, approved by the government, that 
cover land use planning and management in the county.  All protected areas have 
physical plans, either completed or in progress, that also regulate land use and activities 
within the protected areas.  All subprojects will be consistent with the county physical 
plans and protected area management plans.  The environmental review of the 
subprojects will include assessments of subprojects' consistency with county level plans 
and environmental regulations.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project will finance possible investments including rehabilitation of schools and 
health facilities, water supply systems, rural roads, small bridges, irrigation and drainage 
systems. It may also finance agroprocessing, new farming technologies, development of 
rural tourism, reforestation, rubble clearing, and solid and liquid waste treatment.   
 
Each subproject will undergo environmental screening and receive a category rating 
following World Bank procedures; and a parallel screening to determine if an EIA is 
required under Croatian law.  Overall the assessment concluded that the Croatian systems 
are typically more stringent than the World Bank's in terms of the frequency of requiring 
an EIA.  No World Bank category A sub-projects are expected based on the small sub-
project sizes and a scoping of likely issues.  If an EIA is required by either system, the 
document would be developed to meet environmental requirements of both.  The 
recommended process combines World Bank and Croatian procedures and practices.   
 
Specific sites for investment under the Project are not known in advance. Rather, they 
will be determined during implementation, based on requests from municipalities, subject 
to financial, environmental and social assessment. It is possible, though not very likely 
that land may need to be expropriated for the renovation or rehabilitation of structures. 
The land acquisition and resettlement, if any, caused by the project will be carried out 
following well-established procedures specified in Croatian laws and Statutes relating to 
purchase and expropriation, and in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy (OP) 
4.12 and Bank Procedures (BP) 4.12. These procedures are specified in the Program 
Operational Manual, which also provides detailed instructions regarding documentation 
and impact assessment. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
No indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area are 
expected.
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not applicable 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Operational Manual includes a section on environmental and social safeguard 
screening and instructions for dealing with anticipated environmental mitigation to ensure 
compliance with World Bank policies.  Since specific sites for investment are not known 
in advance but will only be determined during implementation, the Government and the 
Bank have agreed on the principles and procedures that will be followed relating to land 
expropriation.  These principles and procedures follow from well
-
established Croatian 
Page  6
laws on land expropriation and the World Bank Operational Policy (O.P 4.12) and Bank 
Procedures (BP 4.12).  These are spelled out in a Resettlement Policy Framework and 
cover in text form the legal provisions, administrative framework including the 
operational, institutional and implementation arrangements for land acquisition, 
coordination between responsible authorities, procedures for valuation and negotiated 
purchase of property, issues of public participation, and mechanisms for monitoring.  The 
provisions that are spelt out in the Policy Framework are developed into procedural steps 
in the Operation Manual for subprojects to follow prior to application and during 
preparation and implementation when land acquisition is involved.  The Policy 
Framework and the Operational Manual explicitly state that the following investment 
activities are ineligible for funding: (i) subproject proposals that would involve acquiring 
land on which there are illegal encroachers (who have constructed buildings or are 
carrying out agricultural or commercial activities) and the encroachers may be displaced 
by the land acquisition process, (ii) subproject proposals that would involve multiple 
(competing) claims to land where the subproject seeks to invest and (iii) subproject 
proposals that involve land where either of the above situations occurred within the 
previous two years.  The Operational Manual also incorporates procedures for addressing 
chance finds (OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property). 
 
The applicability of the International Waters Safeguard measure will be determined on a 
sub-project basis following the Environmental Safeguard procedures detailed in the 
operations manual.  In these cases, the PCU will assess the requirement for an 
International Notification, seek the no-objection by the World Bank, and an allowance 
would be made for the necessary time to invoke this process. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders are disadvantaged and war affected groups within the different ethnic 
communities living in the Areas of Special State Concern.  Specifically, stakeholders 
include small-scale producers, families of residents and returnees, youth suffering from 
the consequences of war and displacement, other vulnerable groups (i.e., disabled, 
battered women, families of war veterans, etc.), and local governments. Because the 
project is an FI, mechanisms for consultation on environmental impact are specified in 
the Operational Manual. Stakeholder workshops were held prior to appraisal in key 
project counties.
