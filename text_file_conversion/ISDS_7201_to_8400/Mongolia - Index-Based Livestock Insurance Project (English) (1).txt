B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the proposed project would be to enhance livelihood security of 
livestock-owning households by reducing their vulnerability from catastrophic livestock 
mortality events.  
 
The principal outcome for the target group of livestock-owning households would be the 
reduction in their financial exposure to the shocks associated with catastrophic livestock 
mortality events. This would be achieved by providing access to an appropriate insurance 
product that is affordable for herders and provides an adequate level of protection, while at the 
same time is sustainable and profitable for participating private insurance companies. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project would introduce index-based mortality insurance in several aimags 
(provinces) on a pilot basis. Following the implementation of the proposed project, it would be 
Page  2
expected that the insurance scheme would be principally implemented by private companies on a 
full commercial basis. Moreover, this insurance product could be blended with other financing 
instruments (i.e. savings, credit) in order to provide an integrated risk financing strategy to the 
herders.  The key components of the proposed project would be as follows:  
i) 
Implementation and refinement of pilots
.
based upon risk assessments, alternative index 
products will be evaluated and implemented during the life of the pilot.  Adjustments will 
be made based upon market assessments and pragmatic concerns to create relatively 
simple and easily understood insurance products. Throughout the life of the pilot, 
modifications will be made based upon research and feedback from end-users to design 
the most appropriate. 
ii) 
Establishing the Necessary Institutional Infrastructure: 
while there is experience with 
index-based insurance for crops (most notably in the U.S.), applying this approach to 
livestock is new. Therefore, various activities must be supported to establish the 
necessary institutional infrastructure for the implementation and management of the 
scheme, including: strengthening the capacity for collecting, auditing, and analyzing 
relevant data, and serving insurance products (e.g. delivery). 
iii) 
Regulatory Framework: 
 following the new Law on insurance adopted in April 2004, the 
regulatory and supervisory framework needs to be developed, including: establishing 
requirements for participating financial institutions, and supporting the preparation of 
livestock insurance legislation.  
iv) 
Catastrophic risk hedging mechanism:
 
it is envisaged that support will be provided for 
the establishment of a contingent debt facility to provide the necessary financial backing 
for the scheme until such time as it can become self-supporting. 
v) 
Promotion/Public Awareness:
 
a
wide range of stakeholders must be educated on the 
products that would be offered under the proposed scheme, which include: herders, 
government officials, insurance companies, banks and other microfinance institutions, 
herder groups, NGOs and donor organizations. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The location of the pilot schemes that would be implemented under the proposed project have 
not yet been identified. It is expected that several 
sums
 in at least 3 or 4 
aimags
 will be selected 
for the pilot schemes. The selection of the pilot 
aimags
 would be finalized during project 
preparation and would be conducted with the participation of implementing agencies, including 
insurance companies and financial institutions.
