A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of this project is to improve SME access to finance (including term finance) and 
business development services, thereby fostering SME growth, competitiveness and employment creation, 
which are key
 to achieving the GoI’s overall objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction.  The 
project is designed to achieve this objective through a multi-pronged approach that will address key 
bottlenecks to SME financing and development in India, by focusing on: (a) improving the policy/regulatory 
and institutional framework for SME financing to create a more conducive environment for market-based 
financing to SMEs by banks (the primary target group for this project), (b) helping banks gain better access to 
longer term financing for lending to the SMEs sector, thereby facilitating capital formation and technological 
up-gradation (c) mitigating banks’ risks related to SME lending and reducing transactions costs of such 
lending while, at the same time, ensuring that banks enhance the quality of their SME loan portfolios, and (d) 
strengthening business development services and market linkage programs for SMEs (the secondary target 
group), thereby  helping them to improve profitability and competitiveness, and become more creditworthy.   
 
If the project is successful, the principal outcomes will be as follows:  
(i) Increased lending (including term lending) to SMEs by all participating banks on 
market-based terms; (ii) reduced NPL ratio on the SME loan portfolios of participating 
banks; (iii) Improved credit information on SMEs, organized in a format that can provide 
the necessary guidance to banks in making credit decisions, and can be shared easily with 
the credit bureau; (iv) Participating banks improve credit assessment as well as risk 
monitoring and management techniques and practices; (v) Improved profitability of SME 
business in all participating banks; (vi) A more efficient policy framework underpinning 
SME financing is developed, including greater ease in enforcing NPL recovery and 
bankruptcy, improved mortgage registration system to make it more customer friendly and 
address the problem of delayed payments, streamlined tax and accounting framework to 
foster the development of leasing finance, and the establishment of a  supportive financial 
environment that can offer SMEs with better access to equity financing; (vii) improved 
Page  2
access to demand-oriented financial and non-financial business services to SMEs; (viii) 
SMEs record growth in investment, productivity and turnover, as well as in employment, 
and become more creditworthy clients.  
 
Progress towards achieving the principal project outcomes will be measured through 
carefully selected project monitoring indicators (both quantitative and qualitative), for 
which data will be gathered through baseline studies/surveys, updated on a regular basis.  
By improving the access of SMEs to the much-needed financing and business development services, 
the proposed project hopes to foster
 SME development and growth, which are key to  achieving the GoI’s 
overall objectives of spurring economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction. The project’s objectives 
are consistent with the Bank Group’s India Country Assistance Strategy, which has been approved recently. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will include: (i) an 
IBRD-financed
 
lending component
;
and (ii) a 
multi
 
donor grant-funded
 
technical assistance program for policy and institutional development. 
i) IBRD- financed Lending component (US$120 million) 
The envisaged lending component would include: (a) a Credit Facility; and (b) a 
Risk Sharing Facility (RSF).  
 
(a) Credit facility (US$100 million): 
 
The credit facility (CF) will primarily address the term financing constraints faced 
by commercial banks, and hence, enable SME clients to access longer term funds needed 
for capital formation and technological up-gradation.  The CF will be financed through 
funds from IBRD (US$100 million), KfW (US$52.2 million) and a counterparty 
contribution from SIDBI (US$17.8 million). While 60% of the IBRD, KfW and 
counterparty funds  allocated to the CF will be utilized by SIDBI for on-lending to 
“eligible” commercial banks (Tier 2 FIs) to refinance (new) lending to commercially viable 
SMEs, an amount of up to (but not exceeding) 40% of IBRD,  KfW and counterparty funds 
will be used by SIDBI for direct financing of commercially viable SMEs. This upfront 
agreement mitigates any potential conflicts of interest between SIDBI’s roles as direct 
financier of SMEs and re-financier of commercial banks; moreover, all lending to SMEs 
under the project will be priced at market-determined interest rates.  Funds will be 
provided to banks/SMEs in the form of a dollar and/or rupee credit. Dollar financing will 
be available only for SMEs with export-based businesses. As the funds provided by IBRD 
will be in US Dollars, and those provided by KfW will be in Euros, SIDBI will manage the 
foreign exchange risk in line with the institutional policy of managing the FX risk.  
Hedging arrangements will be decided by SIDBI on a case-by-case basis. SIDBI will 
mitigate the credit risk related to this project component through a well-designed risk 
management strategy  
 
A
due diligence exercise conducted by the Bank in accordance with OP8.30 and OP10.02 has 
confirmed: (a) SIDBI’s eligibility to act as the Tier 1 FI for the project and (b) the robustness of SIDBI’s 
S
ME loan appraisal criteria and procedures in providing direct financing to SMEs under the CF. For its direct 
Page  3
financing to SMEs, SIDBI will use SME loan appraisal criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank and 
detailed in the OM; these criteria are robust
 and mitigate SIDBI’s credit risk. 
 
Commercial banks’ eligibility to receive refinancing support under the CF will be determined 
through a due diligence of each interested bank  for which the refinancing is requested. The due diligence 
will be  conducted according to a set of criteria and procedures that have been agreed by SIDBI and IBRD, 
and based on OP 8.30 and 10.02 (detailed in the OM).  SIDBI will enter into a Participation Agreement with 
each eligible bank, an important condition for which will be an upfront commitment by the bank to an action 
plan covering such areas as improved credit assessment, risk management and better credit information and 
its sharing,  to be supported by the TA component (paragraphs 3.9-3.10).. Where necessary, SIDBI has 
agreed to adopt, as required, improved procedures for bank appraisal and SME loan appraisal, supported by 
the TA program. (Annexes 4, 6).    
 
(b) Risk Sharing Facility (RSF) (US$20 million): 
 
The objective of the pilot risk sharing facility (RSF) is to immediately accelerate commercial bank 
financing to SMEs. The RSF is designed to achieve a maximum leverage impact: the entity is expected to 
guarantee liabilities amounting to at least eight times its net worth by the end of the fifth year of its operation; 
by sharing up to 50% of the credit risk (principal only) with participating banks on a pari passu basis, the 
RSF will leverage lending from banks to SMEs amounting to at least 16 times the net worth of the entity. 
IBRD funds (US$20 million) and donor funds (approximately US$7.5 million equivalent)
1
to SIDBI  will be 
used to capitalize a risk sharing entity (henceforth referred to as the RSF entity) that will be created by SIDBI 
off-balance sheet. The IBRD/donor proceeds will serve as guarantee reserves to underwrite partial credit 
guarantees issued by the RSF for commercial bank loans to SMEs. The guarantees will be issued on a 
portfolio basis, and the loan portfolios eligible for guarantees will include commercial banks’ loans to viable 
SMEs across sectors.  
Commercial banks’ eligibility to participate in the RSF, and the eligibility of the 
loan portfolios submitted for guarantee cover,  will be determined through a due diligence 
of prospective participating banks (based on OP 8.30 and 10.02) The due diligence will be 
conducted according to a set of agreed criteria and procedures (detailed in the OM). The 
RSF entity (as Guarantor) will enter into a Guarantee Framework Agreement (GFA) with 
eligible participating banks; transaction-specific risk sharing agreements will be annexed to 
the GFA. Any GFA will require a prior “no objection” from IBRD during the first two 
years of the RSF’s operations. The GFA will guide the risk sharing transaction. (Annex 4, 
6). 
 
Reporting arrangements will enable a regular monitoring of the use of the RSF so as to track aspects 
such as the quantum of finance being extended to different sectors/regions and also map the size and profile 
of SMEs being financed using the facility. SIDBI will certify that the participating banks continue to meet the 
eligibility criteria throughout the guarantee period.  
 
ii) Policy and Institutional Development TA Component (US$43.2 million) 
 
The TA component is a cornerstone of the proposed project.  It will help address the medium term 
policy, regulatory and institutional constraints that hamper the efficiency of the SME credit market in India.
The TA will be financed through proposed grants from DFID (total of GBP 20 million, approximating US 
$37 million equivalent) and GTZ (total approximating US$4.8 million equivalent), and cost sharing by local 
counterparties benefiting from the TA (US $1.4 million).  The TA will cover the following: 
 
1
Grant funds from SECO will be used to capitalize the facility; a small proportion of these funds will be set aside to 
cover initial operating costs/capacity building of RSF.  
Page  4
(a) Strengthening the policy/legal/regulatory framework and its enforcement: 
Assistance to 
GoI in preparing and implementing time bound action plans for key policy, legal and 
regulatory measures that are critical to establishing a more efficient framework 
underpinning SME financing and development, including: (i) strengthening the legal 
framework for the enforcement/implementation of collateral and loan recovery and 
improvements in land and property records (which currently hamper the use of land as 
collateral); (ii) streamlining the mortgage registration system to make the process more 
customer friendly and address the problem of delayed payments; (iii) improvements to the 
bankruptcy framework and its enforcement to facilitate the easy exit of small firms, given 
their relatively high mortality rate; (iv) reviving the NBFI sector, through measures to 
streamline the tax and accounting framework to foster the development of leasing finance, 
which can be an effective instrument for financing small business as it gets around the 
collateral constraint as well as equity capital shortages faced by small business; (v) creating 
a
supportive financial environment that can offer the full range of financial products  to 
SMEs; (vi) optimizing preferential purchase schemes for SMEs (vii) developing standards 
in subcontracting involving SMEs. ( viii) supporting effective sectoral articulation for 
enabling policy  through relevant industry associations. 
 
(b) Improving credit information (positive and negative information) on SMEs:
 (i) 
assistance to SIDBI and the participating commercial banks (together referred to as 
“banks”) to verify and collate historic data on SMEs, which would  be made available to 
CIBIL and also retained for use under the project (and potentially for use by other credit 
bureaus approved by RBI); (ii) building the capacity of CIBIL so that it can provide SME 
credit histories and develop credit scoring products; (iii)  support to CIBIL to enable 
interface between the Consumer and Commercial bureaus (iv) developing a dedicated 
rating agency for SMEs as well as a regulatory framework which encourages financial 
institutions to make use of ratings, and which sets standards for rating agencies; and (v) 
developing data requirements for access to the lending component. 
 
(c)  
Building institutional capacity within the participating  banks to reduce banks’ 
transactions costs and reduce/manage risks related to SME lending
:
(i) assisting banks 
(including SIDBI’s direct lending division) in implementing credit scoring systems  and 
cluster financing approaches (the assistance would extend to establishing processes for the 
ongoing monitoring of credits under the scoring system); (ii) training of bankers in using 
past data on SMEs and in using the credit scoring/appraisal systems and broad-basing 
knowledge; (iii) “train-the-trainer” facilities in the use of credit scoring/appraisal systems; 
(iv) delivering a targeted study to augment the current understanding of the participating 
banks with respect to SME clusters – including, defining parameters for an “attractive 
SME” within a cluster, cluster specific risk factors, prognosis on likely evolution of cluster 
etc.; (v) a knowledge transfer program for the participating banks with respect to global 
best-practices in servicing the SME segments on a commercial basis through lending, 
deposits and fee-based services, and the introduction of new and innovative products and 
delivery mechanisms, so that the participating banks can increase 
their overall business in 
2
Banks participating in the RSF will also be required to agree to action plans for specific improvements in these areas, 
but will not benefit from the TA, the assumption being that the institutional upgrading needs of these (private sector) 
banks would be less pressing.  
Page  5
the SME segment profitably. 
 
(d) Business Development Services(BDS) for SMEs: 
This is designed to strengthen SME 
access to BDS. The approach will encompass: (i) enabling policy makers design and 
implement strategies to foster BDS market development; (ii) selecting 25-30 SME clusters, 
and strengthening BDS within these clusters, so as to create “model” clusters that can have 
a
strong demonstration effect; and (iii) selecting a few SME sector with strong employment 
creation and poverty reduction impacts, and focus on all it takes to strengthen BDS within 
these sectors. This cluster and sector focused TA will include: (i) building the capacity of 
existing and potential BDS providers and financial institutions (lead banks) within each of 
the selected clusters and sectors to serve the SME market more effectively; (ii) facilitating 
networking between SME business associations and other BDS providers and similar 
associations in other countries; (iii) developing linkage programs between large 
corporations and SMEs, working through the major SME business associations; (iv) 
developing high quality, affordable management training for local SMEs; (v) 
entrepreneurship training programs to create new entrepreneurs; (vi) providing SMEs with 
better access to technology, for example, through technology transfer agents/supporting 
dedicated institutions to facilitate dissemination of information on technology transfer and 
match-making. 
 
(e) Institutional support to SIDBI: 
The TA will provide focused support to SIDBI’s Project 
Management Department to build up its capacity in the areas of project management, 
implementation and monitoring. (TA will also be provided separately to the RSF to support 
operating expenses and build institutional capacity). 
 
3.13 Banks participating in the CF will be required to agree upfront to an action plan covering such areas as 
improved credit assessment, risk management and better credit information and its sharing, which will be 
supported by the TA component, and monitored closely.
2
These banks will be required to submit annual 
performance reports on progress with the TA, as a condition for further funding under the CF.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not 
available, describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
 
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Social Safeguard Issues 
The proposed project will not finance a pre-identified set of sub-loans and no specific social safeguard 
issues have been identified at present. Sensitizing banks and SIDBI on issues related to land acquisition and 
on methods for social screening of sub-loans is seen as important.
 And, the process of sensitizing banks and 
SIDBI has already been put in place and an orientation program to orient banks and SIDBI on issues related 
to social safeguards and social screening has  already been organized.
 
This would help banks identify 
social safeguard issues related to sub-loans 
–
such as child labor, welfare support for working mothers and 
payment of minimum wages. Apart from training these institutions on such issues, wherever appropriate, 
industry associations will be used to help increase awareness on such social safeguards issues 
and the use 
of social screening process. 
 Studies as well as baseline and repeat surveys will be used as part of the 
project monitoring and evaluation framework to monitor and assess the 
use of social screening and
 social 
impact of the project, including on employment and poverty. 
The social screening tool being designed in 
collaboration with SIDBI as part of Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework is expected to 
provide the banks and SIDBI a framework to assess social impacts and to undertake mitigation measures in 
case there are any unexpected adverse social impacts. 
 These impacts can be assessed based on the sample 
of clusters of SMEs, which are a focal point for project TA interventions on the business development 
services side. Coordination with other project partners on social safeguards issues would be undertaken. 
 
Environmental Safeguard Issues 
For similar reasons stated above, the environmental issues associated with the sub-loans are expected to be 
varied in nature with complexities of such issues largely depending upon the specific sector. It is expected 
that there will be no issues related to cultural property, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, 
forests, safety of dams, projects in disputed areas, project in international waterways. On natural habitats 
and pest management, while no significant issues are foreseen, the possibility of they being applicable at a 
sub-loan level can not be totally ruled out.  
 
The environmental and social screening tool being designed in collaboration with SIDBI as part of the 
Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework is expected to capture such issues in such a 
manner so as to provide indicative guidelines for action that will take into account the environmental 
concerns related to the project/sector and also factor in the project size and what type of safeguard actions 
are practical to take.
 
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one 
safeguard policy or due to multiple project component.  
Not applicable 
II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
Not applicable 
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required) 
Not applicable. 
Page  8
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues 
 
Social 
 
The social safeguards framework for the project would center around adapting the 
approach used by IFC for Financial Intermediary Projects. This would include 
supervision and training/capacity building of SIDBI, the implementing agency and of the 
participating banks, using the training approach used by IFC. This would be undertaken 
in collaboration with the Bank and other project partners.  Involvement of those SME 
industry associations in helping build awareness on social safeguard issues will be 
considered. The cornerstone of the social safeguards framework for this project would be 
through the training and supervision of the implementing agency. Related issues will be 
incorporated into legal agreements and Operating Guidelines for the project. The 
guidelines related to these will be a part of the Project’s Social and Environmental 
Framework and will be cleared by SASES and placed in PIC and Info Shop soon after 
appraisal mission.  
 
Environment 
 
To help SIDBI and the participating banks manage environmental risks in their lending operations, a 
framework approach is being used, encompassing: i) creating awareness and capacity within SIDBI and the 
participating banks on potential environmental issues related to the sub-projects and sectors; ii) 
development of an environment management framework including simple screening and assessment 
templates to address environmental concerns in their financing operations; iii) assisting SIDBI and the 
participating Banks in the assessment of the first few environmentally sensitive projects (to be defined in 
the framework to be developed). To begin, a sensitization training program (by IFC in collaboration with 
the Bank and project partners) was held during appraisal. Similar such programs will be conducted through 
the TA component of the project. The required environmental risk management framework is being 
developed by SIDBI, with the help of external consultants. For both social and environmental safeguards, 
use of appropriate interventions as part of the TA to banks and to SMEs, would be used and wherever 
possible, involvement of appropriate industry associations would be encouraged. Consultations have 
commenced with industry associations that are likely to be involved in the project through the TA 
component.  
 
In summary, the safeguards framework for the project adapts the approach used by IFC for Financial 
Intermediary projects. The approach includes building the capacity of SIDBI and the participating banks 
involved in the lending component and help establish processes to better screen sub-projects for social and 
environmental issues.  Further, the BDS component of the project would also address these issues with 
select SME clusters and industry associations and would seek to sensitize the SMEs on social and 
environmental issues.
 
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The stakeholders of the project mainly include SIDBI, the financial institutions and the SMEs.  The SMEs, 
the individual enterprise sub-borrowers, can not be identified at this stage nor can the sub-project to be 
financed. As part of project preparation, preliminary discussions on conditions for on-lending have been 
initiated with a set of potential participating Banks and SIDBI. The Bank’s project team will meet these and 
other Banks and also with the Government on issues related to safeguards and corporate social 
responsibility and help develop the capacity and awareness of the implementing agency through training 
programs, knowledge and awareness workshops.
