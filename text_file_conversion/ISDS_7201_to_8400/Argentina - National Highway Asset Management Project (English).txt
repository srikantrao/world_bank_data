A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overall purpose of the project is to consolidate an efficient road network management strategy, 
bringing about the necessary resources to preserve the national road network in the long term. This is a key 
condition towards increasing the competitiveness of the economy and supporting a sustainable path of 
economic growth and poverty reduction. The proposed project builds on the achievements of the ongoing 
Bank-assisted 4295-AR 
National Highways Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
 and would have the 
following specific objectives:  
 
a. 
Preserve the condition of vital road assets, through the gradual expansion of 
performance-based contracts for the rehabilitation and maintenance of the non-
concessioned primary paved network;  
b. 
Strengthen road sector management through carrying out a renewal program of DNV 
to revitalize its role in the sector by: (i) reinforcing its human resource base; and (iii) 
consolidating its transformation into a results-oriented organization accountable for 
specific outputs (e.g. preserving transitability and adequate road conditions, 
enhancing road safety, promoting integration, etc.). 
 
Achievement of Project Development Objectives will be confirmed through the following key indicators: 
(i) percentage of paved non-concessioned network under CREMA system; (ii) roughness of paved non-
concessioned netwok will not exceed IRI of 3.8; (iii) DNV having effectively implemented the Institutional 
Renewal Action Plan.  
 
Expanding the CREMA program to other regions of the country would help to decrease disparities in terms 
of transport investment, in favor of poorer areas that are less economically active, fostering regional 
productivity via the reduction of logistic costs between potentially productive areas, consumption areas and 
main ports (facilitating access to markets).
 
  In particular, the proposed project would benefit people in rural 
and low-income areas through: (i) the reduction of time and travel costs, (ii) new employment opportunities 
(4,000 new jobs in 5 years) as many of the rehabilitation and maintenance activities require unskilled labor 
for carrying out the works and for the production of materials (cement, asphalt), (iii) increased 
competitiveness and development of labor generating productive activities (e.g SMEs) and (iv) improved 
access to basic services.

The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) seeks to reduce the extent and severity of poverty in Argentina by 
focusing on: (i) promoting sustained economic growth with equity; (ii) social inclusion; and (iii) improved 
governance.  It emphasizes that one of the building blocks for sustained economic growth is maintaining 
and improving key infrastructure assets that facilitate regional development and the inclusion of Argentina 
in a globalized economy.  
 
The overall and specific objectives of this project are consistent with the above pillars since as was 
mentioned before, maintaining and improving the road network is a means to foster regional productivity 
and competitiveness, and hence supporting the path towards sustained economic growth. At the same time, 
the project will seek to expand the CREMA system to those areas that have not been rehabilitated in the 
past years, thus targeting poorer regions that are not well integrated into the national economy. Finally, 
initiatives to increase governance, accountability and transparency in the road sector are being considered 
in the project through the institutional renewal component.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 – Rehabilitation and Maintenance (Estimated cost US$760 million of which US$350 
million would be financed by the Bank Loan).
 Through this component, the Bank would support the 
expansion of DNV’s CREMA Program, which aims to expand the use of performance-based contracts to 
maintain its entire paved non-concessioned network. In particular, this component would finance the 
execution of works under the CREMA system on about 9.936 km, which are being designed so as to 
include important rehabilitation and maintenance works (on average 82% of total costs correspond to 
capital investment expenditures for rehabilitation works) particularly in those segments that did not receive 
adequate maintenance recently due to fiscal restrictions, to overcome a backlog of deferred maintenance 
and bring the infrastructure back to full productivity(approximately 65% of these roads are entering the 
CREMA program for the first time). Most of these networks have been/are being procured under Loan 
4295-AR.  DNV will continue financing CREMA contracts on some additional 6,740 Km and will also 
finance two-year ad-measurement type contracts on the remaining 4.388 Km. Overall, during project 
implementation a total of 16,676 km (out of 22,000 km) are to be maintained through performance-based 
contracts.  
 
Component 2 – Bridge Restoration (Estimated cost US$33 million of which US$25 million would be 
financed by the Bank Loan). 
Given recent budgetary restrictions, DNV has not been able to properly take 
care of its bridges and has only performed emergency interventions on specific points. So far, DNV has 
slated about 65 bridges for attention in the next five years, some of which are in critical condition and need 
to be urgently repaired under the project. Works would include construction, reconstruction, replacement, 
widening and rehabilitation activities, to be carried out within the existing right-of-way. A comprehensive 
bridge management tool to systematically prioritize bridge interventions and identify cost-effective 
solutions would also be financed. 
 
Component 3- Road Safety (Estimated cost US$27 million of which US$20 million would be financed by 
the Bank Loan). 
This component would support the implementation of recommended actions that evolved 
from a Road Safety Technical Assistance financed by the Bank (under Loan 3611-AR). Two sub-
components are being considered: (i)
 
a large-scale pilot initiative integrating 
engineering
, 
enforcement
 and 
education
 measures over 4 pilot corridors, with an overarching objective of demonstrating the effectiveness 
of an integrated, results-focused road safety program and help create the knowledge, experience and 
commitment required to roll it out successfully throughout the rest of the country; and (ii) road safety 
engineering interventions on identified black spots of the road network across the country, targeting areas 
with high concentrations of crash fatalities, mainly near urban centers.  
 
Component 4- Institutional Renewal (Estimated cost US$5 million). 
The project would provide technical 
assistance to: (i) develop and implement a human resources plan to rebuild DNV’s technical and 
institutional ca

under a results-oriented framework; (ii) facilitate DNV’s technological modernization to increase its 
productivity and strengthen its planning, supervision, and monitoring capabilities; (iii) streamline time 
consuming administrative processes to achieve efficiency gains in the internal management of the entity; 
(iv) design transparency mechanisms to disseminate DNV’s administrative, operational and financial 
performance, generalizing the use of performance indicators to enhance accountability, utilizing external 
agents to monitor performance and control results, and constructing performance and user satisfaction 
indicators that help visualize the achieved results; (v) strengthen DNV’s capacity for addressing 
environmental issues throughout the project cycles; (vi) analyze options for ensuring long term financial 
sustainability in the road sector and  stable flows of funds for road maintenance and (v) the development 
and implementation of the Strategic Plan for Territorial Development. The project is preparing twinning 
arrangements with road agencies from other countries as a vehicle to providing key technical assistance.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The project supports rehabilitation and maintenance works to be carried out within existing right-of-way on 
Argentina’s primary road network, mainly in rural areas of the country. No significant adverse 
environmental or social impacts are expected.

Comments: 
The project has been qualified as 
“Category B”,
 following the Operational Guidelines of the 
World Bank [OP 4.01]. This category is justified by the fact that works will be developed along existing 
roads, implying no significant physical changes. Potential risks can be easily identified and mitigation 
measures are available. The project’s executing agency (DNV) has in place an adequate Environmental 
Unit, which guarantees high standard environmental management. An 
Environmental Management and 
Evaluation Manual
 prepared for use under the 3611-AR and 4295-AR Loans is currently being applied 
through out the project cycle.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
 
Given the rehabilitation and maintenance works being considered, no significant environmental and social 
impacts that could endanger the natural surroundings of the area under influence are expected. Therefore 
has anticipate temporal and directs impact that will be prevent, mitigate and compensate the environmental 
impacts, to ensure the environmental and social sustainability of the Program.  
Potential impacts arising from bridge construction and reconditioning works can be prevented or mitigated 
through adequate environmental management. Potentially impact are related to: (i) selection of areas for 
placing camping, equipment and materials; (ii) combustible and lubricant transportation; (iii) atmospheric 
contamination; (iv) interfering with the flow of vehicles; (v) inadequate elimination of solid waste from 
construction camping and work sites; (vi) inadequate management of material or waste deposition sites. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area.
 
 
No long-term impacts are expected. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
 
 
DNV has integrated the environmental and social dimensions within the project’s cycle to assure 
environmental and social sustainability. CREMA bidding documents include the obligation to reflect in the 
final designs Environmental Management Plans (EMP), based on guidelines provided in the 
Environmental 
Management and Evaluation Manual
 and on the authorization conditions set by provincial or municipal 
authorities, as well as by the authorities of natural protected areas, when applicable. Contractors are 
required to comply with legislation imposed by the relevant Environmental Authority within the 
corresponding jurisdiction.  An Institutional Strengthening Plan for the Environmental Management 
Division was prepared, and the 
Environmental Management and Evaluation Manual
 is going to be updated 
to strengthen DNV’s environmental capacities. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
