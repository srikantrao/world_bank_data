A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed Project is 
to improve market access and increase 
agricultural output 
for rural communities in selected areas of Bhutan. To achieve this, 
the Project will finance rural access sub-projects (i.e. farm roads, and upgraded mule 
tracks), irrigation, agricultural productivity-enhancing activities, and capacity-building 
for sustainable natural resource management. This will be combined with institutional 
strengthening to ensure efficient financial flows, reporting, and environmental 
assessment. Attainment of the above objectives is guided by the RNR Sector’s “Triple 
Gems of Development”: enhancing productivity, promoting accessibility, and improving 
marketing. 
 
The proposed project will support the above programs in six dzongkhags: Trongsa, 
Zhemgang, Dagana, Tsirang, Wangduephodrang and Chhukha, which cover about 11,801 
km
2
of the geographical area with 62 geogs (approximately one third of the country). The 
project will mainly concentrate on gap financing of the plans and programs of the 9
th
 FYP 
that are not covered under either RGoB or other donor agencies. 
 
The project is expected to contribute to RNR sector goals of higher rural incomes, 
increased employment, improved food security, and sustainable natural resource 
management. In addition, the project will support Bhutan’s ambitious plans for 
decentralization by empowering local governments, strengthening fiscal management at 
the local level, and undertaking capacity-building of the field-level staff in the Ministry 
of Agriculture. In both ways this project supports the broader goals of the 9
th
 FYP. 
A.3. Project Description 
Page  2
Component #1: Rural Infrastructure
 
The output of this component will be local public goods, i.e. farm roads, power tiller 
roads, and irrigation channels. The majority of these have already been identified at the 
local level as priorities for rural communities as part of the 9
th
 FYP. There are two sub-
components. 
 
a) 
Rural access
:
Geogs across the country have expressed high demand for access to 
markets, inputs, and public services. This subcomponent will focus on farm roads 
(both new construction and rehabilitation) and will upgrade mule tracks to permit 
passage of power tillers. These will be screened and implemented in accordance with 
MoA’s Farm Road Guidelines, and according to rules for “environmentally friendly 
road construction” (EFRC) practices which already apply to the larger feeder roads. 
Several small suspension bridges would also be constructed. Dzongkhags would 
contract out construction to private service providers to expedite completion and 
ensure consistent quality. Community members are expected to benefit as hired 
labourers. In accordance with the guidelines, GYTs will be expected to own the asset 
upon completion and will be in charge of covering maintenance with tax revenue and 
labour contributions. 
 
b) 
Irrigation
:
Irrigated agriculture is an important source of growth in the RNR 
sector, contributing to increased and diversified farm incomes. Both new irrigation 
channels and rehabilitated channels are proposed for financing under this project. 
These will be implemented in accordance with the National Irrigation Policy and the 
existing procedural manuals. Water users’ associations at the Geog level would be 
expected to be the key implementing agency, as these are farmer-managed schemes 
with simple infrastructure needs. 
 
Component #2: RNR Centres 
 
The output of this component is ability among farmers to take advantage of productivity 
and income gains through demonstration, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. 
Geog-based extension staff, backstopped from the dzongkhag level, will play the central 
role. MoA proposes RNR centres as the front-line institution in its efforts to improve 
productivity and sustainability of crop, livestock, and forest production. In addition to 
providing training and demonstration of new technologies, these Centres can provide a 
meeting place for communities and limited office space for GYTs. These Centres will 
also improve living and working conditions to the extension staff who are already located 
in Geogs. This component will finance both hardware and software in two sub-
components. 
 
a) 
RNR construction
:
This subcomponent will finance approximately 16 RNR 
centres in as many geogs. These Centres occupy approximately one half acre of space 
and include a building and demonstration plots. Prototype designs already exist. 
Many, if not most, of these geogs are also demanding Geog offices as working space 
for the “gup” (Geog head) and clerk, and RNR centres can accommodate this office 
Page  3
space at a low marginal cost. Although this strictly falls outside of the mandate of 
MoA, they see this as a way to promote the Centres as the focal point of communities, 
and to strengthen ties between local government and MoA at the grass-roots level. 
The Engineering Division of MoA will implement this sub-component. 
 
b) 
RNR capacity-building
:
This subcomponent will finance applied training, 
demonstrations, and farmer-to-farmer field visits, corresponding to demand expressed 
by geogs and consistent with the Field Programs and National Programs of the MoA. 
There will be special emphasis on high-value crops and livestock products. The 
Extension Division of MoA will implement this sub-component. 
 
Component #3: Institutional Strengthening 
 
One output of this small but important component is timely submission of accurate 
financial and physical reporting of project implementation performance to ensure a 
smooth transfer of funds to the local level for implementation. To implement geog 
priorities, there is a critical need for capacity-building at several levels, and there is 
concern (and evidence from other projects) that current capacity may be exceeded as 
plans are implemented. Institutional strengthening involves training of finance personnel 
from the selected geogs, dzongkhags and the Adminstration and Finance Department 
(AFD) of the MOA on the Budget and Administration System (BAS) and provision of 
training to geog administrators on planning, administration, community mobilization, and 
reporting. A secondary output of this component is improved capacity in MoA and at the 
dzongkhag level for environmental assessment of sub-projects, particularly for farm 
roads, irrigation works, and RNR centres.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The six 
dzongkhags
 proposed for the project have a total area of approximately 11,801 
km
2
,
covering most of the central part of the country. There are altogether 62 
geogs 
in 
these 
dzongkhags
,
with a total population of 15,065 rural households. Area under arable 
agriculture land ranges from a low of 2.3 per cent in Wangduephodrang to a high of 21.7 
per cent in Tsirang. The total livestock population is approximately 130,800, with cattle 
being by far the most predominant. All 
dzongkhags
 have a true forest coverage that is 
higher than the national average of 64.4 per cent. Major forest types are subtropical 
broadleaf, warm broadleaf, cool broadleaf and coniferous forests. Average annual rainfall 
ranges from about 750 mm (in some parts of Dagana and Wangduephodrang) to 5,000 
mm (in southern parts of Zhemgang). Major rivers that run through the area. Jigme 
Singye Wangchuck, Royal Manas and Thrumshingla National Parks are the protected 
areas that transcend into the project area. These protected areas are known to be rich in 
wildlife, including some globally threatened species such as tiger, golden langur, 
Himalayan black bear, red panda, musk deer, rufous-
necked hornbill, and Pallas’s fish 
eagle. Barring Chhukha and Dagana, all 
dzongkhags 
have areas that fall inside protected 
areas or their buffer zones. In all, 12 
geogs
 fall inside protected areas or their buffer 
zones. 
Dzongkhag
-wise statistics on area under forest cover, area under arable 
agriculture, livestock population, livestock population density, and number of 
geogs

Comments: 
The DRDP is expected to have moderate to low environmental risks so that, 
as a whole, the Project can be identified as a “Category B” project. The subcomponents 
that are likely to have adverse environmental impacts include farm roads, irrigation 
schemes, and upgradation of existing mule tracks to power tiller roads (if the upgradation 
entails major widening and realignment).  Other subcomponents – construction of RNR 
Centers and rehabilitation of existing irrigation schemes – are expected to have very low 
adverse environmental impacts. In general, basic Environmental Assessment (equivalent 
to Initial Environmental Examination) will be adequate for aforesaid activities.  However, 
full-blown Environmental Assessment will be necessary under a limited set of cases.

Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
·
Environmental Assessment
:
This is applicable give the project’s emphasis of rural 
infrastructure development, and the need to assess the risk this poses to land, water, 
vegetation, and cultural property. Accordingly, an Environment Assessment and 
Environment Management Framework have been developed. 
·
Natural Habitats
:
This is applicable because there are twelve geogs that are partially 
or fully inside protected areas or their buffer zone. However, given that infrastructure 
activities and the project will be small-scale, they are highly unlikely to cause 
significant conversion or degradation of natural habitats.  Activities within the 
protected areas will not be funded under this project. 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  5
·
Pest Management
:
This safeguard has limited applicability. Irrigation schemes may 
indirectly induce use of pesticides and some demonstration activities at the RNR 
Centres may involve use of pesticides. This will be mitigated by the existing Pesticide 
Act which promotes Integrated Pest Management and ensures that only appropriate 
types and qualities of pesticides are introduced into Bhutan (pesticide distribution is 
centrally controlled). The project will promote Integrated Pest Management through 
the RNR Centres.  
·
Cultural Property
:
Very limited applicability. The protection of cultural properties 
is under the purview of the Ministry of Home and Cultural Affairs and is built in the 
mandate of the DYTs and GYTs. No development activities that may have impact on 
cultural resources can be implemented without clearance from this ministry.  This 
project will avoid any activity that will negatively impact cultural property. 
·
Involuntary Resettlement
:
Most of the subprojects to be financed under the project 
are expected to be small, and cause minimal negative social impacts. To the extent 
possible, alternative designs and locations will be considered to avoid land acquisition 
and minimize adverse social impacts.  Where subproject interventions require minor 
small scale land acquisition, land will be acquired on a voluntary basis.  In the event 
that minor land acquisition is unavoidable, the subproject will be designed to cause 
the least amount of social, cultural and economic disruption.  A Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) has been prepared to ensure that project affected families will be 
compensated, relocated and rehabilitated, if required, so as to improve their standard 
of living, income earning capacity or at least to restore them to a living standard they 
are likely to have achieved if the project had not taken place.  Special measures will 
be taken to protect socially and economically vulnerable groups such as women 
headed households and people living in extreme poverty. 
·
Indigenous Peoples
:
There are no separate disadvantaged groups different from the 
dominant population who will be adversely affected by the project and the project 
will benefit all local people. This is supported by the fact that all geogs took part in 
the highly participatory planning process that underpins the 9
th
 Five-year Plan and 
which is expected to continue into implementation. 
·
Forests
:
Very limited applicability. No forestry activities are envisaged in the project 
but farm roads, irrigation schemes, and power tiller roads may involve some clearing 
of vegetation. The EMF is adequate to address protection of forest areas. 
 
·
Other: 
The project does not involve dams, international waters, or disputed areas. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
One indirect impact of roads is demographic pressure on resources hitherto isolated from 
human settlement. The EMF  covers the mitigation of any cumulative negative impacts 
that will arise from project activities such as slope destabilization and increased resource 
use. 
 
Page  6
Considering the type of subprojects eligible for financing under the project, and the screening criteria 
(agreed with IDA) used to identify subprojects, it is anticipated that there will be no cumulative social 
adverse impacts, since the screening process eliminates sites that may result in any serious social impacts.
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Rural road construction in the current IDA-funded Rural Access Project is based on the 
concept of “environmentally-friendly construction” (EFRC) methods. While this took 
time to be understood and adopted, it now applies to all feeder roads in Bhutan. Evidence 
suggests that compliance with EFRC increases up-front costs of investment, but 
minimizes environmental damage and decreases maintenance costs significantly. The 
DRDP will adopt EFRC for farm road construction and higher construction costs are built 
into project costing. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
·
Environmental Screening
:
As part of the Environmental Assessment, each sub-
project will require screening and, if required, preparation of the an Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) and Memorandum of Understanding which will be agreed 
upon by each of the stakeholders – Community representatives (i.e. Water User 
Committee), Geog and Dzongkhag representatives and the contractor.  The 
implementation of the EMP and the Memorandum of Understanding will be 
periodically monitored by the community and Geog/dzongkhag representatives. A 
project's EMP consists of the set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures 
to be taken during implementation and operation to eliminate adverse environmental 
and social impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable levels. The plan also 
includes the actions needed to implement these measures. To prepare a management 
plan, the RGoB and its Environmental Assessment design team will (a) identify the 
set of responses to potentially adverse impacts; (b) determine requirements for 
ensuring that those responses are made effectively and in a timely manner; and (c) 
describe the means for meeting those requirements.   
·
Resettlement Policy Framework:  
To facilitate the assessment and management of 
potential adverse social impacts, the borrower has prepared a Social Assessment (SA) 
based on RGOB’s relevant legislation and guidelines and the World Bank’s 
Operational Policy 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.  The SA details the key social 
issues and potential impacts of the project and defines the modalities for profiling 
socio-economic conditions, identifying stakeholder groups, conducting social 
screening to assess potential impacts, voluntary land donations, the institutional 
structure to support social impact management, including capacity building 
requirements and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, as well as measures to 
protect and ensure the ongoing inclusion of economically vulnerable groups in project 
implementation.  Although no involuntary resettlement is anticipated, a Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared and is detailed in the SA, in the event 
that minor land acquisition is unavoidable, or if project activities result in loss of 
privately owned assets/
structures or the displacement of people.  The RPF defines the 
Page  7
legal, institutional and implementation framework to guide the compensation for lost 
assets, livelihoods, community property, and resettlement and rehabilitation of people 
in accordance with th
e
World Bank’s OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and 
RGOB guidelines and legislation. The RPF will be applicable to all subprojects 
funded under DRDP.    
·
Social Inclusion
:
There are no separate disadvantaged groups different from the 
dominant population who will be adversely affected by the project and the project 
will benefit all local people. The RNR activities in the 9th FYP are based on local 
demands and were identified through a highly participative and inclusive process that 
will continue into the implementation phase. Therefore the requirements of OD 4.20 
are addressed by the design of the project itself and there is no need for a separate 
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan for any particular group. The project will have 
a
monitoring and evaluation system that closely monitors impacts on potentially 
vulnerable groups (female headed households, marginal land holders) and their 
participation in project implementation. 
 
Despite obvious concerns for environmental sustainability and social equity, Borrower 
capacity for environmental and social assessment is found to be quite weak in Bhutan. 
Environmental 
 
assessment capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture is weak and limited to 
irrigation. There is a proposal for establishing a unit in MoA and expanding its mandate.  
 
MOA in coordination with the dzongkhags will be responsible for implementing the 
resettlement/land acquisition activities. The project will rely on existing institutional 
arrangements within MOA and dzongkhag administrations for project preparation and 
implementation activities. MOA currently does not have a social unit or any focal staff or 
procedures for providing oversight on social issues.  In view of this,  MOA may need to 
increase the number of staff with technical expertise in social development at the central 
and dzongkhag level and develop adequate institutional arrangements and mechanisms 
specifically related to the social aspects of the project.  However, it must be recognized 
that the number of professionals in the MoA is very small (consistent with the population 
size) and additional staffing will be a problem. 
 
While the project will not fund staff salaries, the Institutional Strengthening component 
will include training to build capacity in MOA and at the dzongkhag levels on social 
assessment and  social impact management.. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
·
Geog level (local communities and their elected governments)
:
Consistent with the 
RNR sector strategy, at the geog level, the GYT will be the implementing agency 
with the Gup as the chief executive. The RNR Extension agents in the geogs will be 
responsible for facilitating the implementation of the project through technical advice, 
demonstrations, and delivery of technical inputs. All 201 Geogs (of which this project 
will work in 62) were consulted in the extensive planning process that made up the 9
th
 
FYP and the RNR strategy which is a component of the FYP. A sample of 
communities were consulted in the course of preparing the SA and EA. 
Page  8
·
Dzongkhag level
:
The dzongkhag activities will be as usual implemented by the DYT 
with the Dzongdag (district head) as the chief executive. The RNR sector officials 
(i.e. the District Finance Officer, District Agricultural Officer, District Livestock 
Officer, and others) will be responsible for facilitating implementation and have been 
consulted in the course of preparation in their respective dzongkhags and at a 
workshop in Thimphu. 
 
·
Central level
:
MoA will as usual supply inputs and technical backstopping to field 
programmes at the dzongkhag and geog levels and has led preparation. The Ministry 
of Finance has also been closely involved in project preparation. The National 
Environment Commission (NEC) is responsible for implementing the Environmental 
Assessment Act (2000) which establishes procedures for the assessment of potential 
effects of strategic plans, programs and projects, to determine measures to reduce 
potential adverse effects and to promote environmental benefits. They have been 
closely consulted during DRDP preparation. 
 
The project is based on a strong participatory approach in the selection, implementation, monitoring and 
operation and maintenance of project facilities through the direct participation of beneficiary communities.  
The SA (developed on the basis of consultation with affected communities) provides guidance on the 
overall consultation strategy and mechanisms to ensure community awareness and involvement in the 
project, as well as participatory monitoring and evaluation modalities.   
 
The project documentation will be disclosed on November 20, 2004
