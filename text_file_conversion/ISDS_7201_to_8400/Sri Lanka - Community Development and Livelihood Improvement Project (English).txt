A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed project would be to enable the rural poor to improve their 
livelihood and quality of life.  The objective would be achieved through: (a) empowering  
communities to manage sustainable investments and build accountable and self-governing local 
institutions; (b) working with local governments which have proved to be more responsive and 
accountable to increase the size and quality of public expenditures that would be delivered in a 
community driven and accountable manner; and (c) working with federations of village 
organizations, private sector and NGOs on economic empowerment to increase size and diversity 
of livelihood, increased-credit flow, private sector investment in community activities and value 
added agriculture.
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project would include the following components: 
 
Component A: Village Development (about 80% of total cost)
:
 This component would include 
the following sub-components: 
 
(i) 
Formation, Development and Strengthening Community-Based Organizations.
 The 
objective would be to develop self reliant, self managed and sustainable people’s organizations 
for community development and livelihood improvement;  
 
(ii) Community 
Subprojects. 
This sub-component will finance four main activities: (i) 
Capacity Building Fund; (ii) Community and Social Infrastructure Activities and Services; (iii) 
Income Generating Activities; and (iv) Incentive Fund; and 
 
Page  3
 
 
(iii)
 
Inter-village Roads
.  The objective is to improve the network of inter-village roads to 
secure better access of project villages to main roads and market places.  The outcome of this 
component is community managed sustainable infrastructure which is maintained by the 
community from its own resources. 
 
Component B: Institutional Strengthening (about 10% of total cost)
:
  This component would 
include the following sub-components: 
(i) 
Capacity Building of National, District and Divisional Project Teams
:  The objective of 
this sub-component is to develop a shared vision and build required competences among project 
teams at national, district and divisional levels to enable them to perform their respective roles; 
 
(ii)  
Capacity Building of Support Organizations and Services Providers
: The objective of 
this sub-component is to facilitate the active participation of support organizations and the private 
sector to expand livelihood options of the poor; and 
 
(iii)  
Monitoring and Learning:  
The objective of this sub-component is to monitor 
performance and progress of the project and to disseminate it among all stakeholders to enable 
them to effectively address project implementation issues. 
 
Component C: Innovation Seed Fund (about 3% of total cost):
  This component aims to 
conduct and possibly replicate pilots on innovative ideas with the potential to expand livelihood 
options of the rural poor. This would include improving information technology and market 
centers to promote public and private sector partnerships, joint ventures to enable community 
organizations and federations to increase value added from existing products and develop new 
enterprises; and undertake activities of commercial nature.  
 
Component D: Project Management (about 9% of total cost)
:
  This component would consist 
of overall coordination and management of the project at national and divisional levels. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The proposed project will be implemented initially in the Uva and Southern Provinces.  As part of 
the environmental and social assessments, protected areas, critical ecosystems and natural 
habitats and socially sensitive groups that might be present in the project areas have been 
identified.
 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A [
 
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
The proposed project is classified as category B as the project is expected to be beneficial from an 
environmental and social perspective.  Further,  investments are expected to be small, very 
localized, labor intensive and largely of a rehabilitation or small rural enterprise development 
nature. No significant impacts are expected on any critical ecosystems or culturally or socially 
sensitive areas.  A screening framework has been developed as part of the Environmental 
Assessment to ensure that GOSL and Bank safeguards are in compliance.  Any potential impacts 
are expected to be readily manageable with proper planning and monitoring arrangements.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will support several small sub-projects or investments at the village-level. Because of 
the relative small size of the investments, most investments are not expected to have a significant 
impact on the environment and any potential impacts, if any are expected to be readily 
manageable with proper planning and oversight. As specific project investments will be 
determined through a village planning process on a rolling basis after the commencement of the 
project, a simple management system has been established to enable effective screening of the 
evolving plans for their environmental and social conformity and application.  The intention of 
this management system is to: (i) prevent the execution of a sub-project that might cause 
significant and irreversible negative impacts; (ii) decrease or manage potential adverse impacts 
through modifications to sub-project design, location or execution; (iii) prevent or mitigate 
cumulative impacts of small scale investments; (iv) enhance positive environmental and social 
impacts of sub-projects; and (v) prevent additional stress on environmentally sensitive areas. 
 
As part of project preparation, GOSL carried out an Environmental Assessment (EA) of possible 
activities that may be included in the proposed project and undertook a study to assess impact of 
human-elephant conflict in the project areas and management options for their mitigation. As part 
of the EA, an Environmental Management Framework has also been developed, which will serve 
as a template for undertaking sub-project specific environmental assessments. The framework 
includes: (a) tools for screening of activities at the village level, including negative lists of 
characteristics that would preclude project funding for such activities; (b) screening and clearance 
procedures for village level activities at three levels; viz, village, district, provincial; and (c) 
capacity building to ensure effective implementation of the framework.  A pest management plan 
and dam safety plan have been developed as part of the environmental management framework. 
The pest management plan will, as far as practical, attempt to strengthen linkages with existing 
programs of the Department of Agriculture, Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Divisional 
Secretaries and NGOs.  The dam safety plan has been included as a technical annex to the 
operational manual that has been developed for the project.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  5
 
 
 
The design of environmental framework has been built on lessons learned under Village Self-
Help Learning Initiative (VSHLI) and other similar projects in the country and region, and 
incorporates a participatory process involving local beneficiaries and other key stakeholder 
groups. As part of the environmental assessment, training and capacity building plans for 
implementation of the environmental framework at the village, district, provincial and national 
levels have been prepared. Training on environmental and social aspects has been integrated with 
the general training at the four administrative levels of the project and has been initiated prior to 
the commencement of the project. The framework also defines staffing, oversight and monitoring 
needs for their implementation. 
 
Given the nature of proposed project activities, no significant adverse cumulative impacts are 
anticipated. Any potential cumulative impacts would be recognized by detailed monitoring that 
would be carried out to monitor any potential concerns and changing conditions, especially in the 
initial villages to evaluate the impacts and design any additional mitigation measures. 
 
The proposed project is developing a new approach to development at the village level. It 
envisages the communities to take a more active role in the identification, development, operation 
and management of village-level infrastructure developments and other activities. The role of the 
government is therefore expected to progressively decline.  Local institutions will take a greater 
role in the future in the management of natural resources at the local level and to improve 
collaboration between local community institutions and line agencies. The institutional 
arrangements for decentralized management of natural resources will involve community groups 
and local governmental institutions.  These institutions will develop capacity and improved skills 
to address environmental and social issues that will have a long term positive impact on natural 
resource management at a decentralized level.  The project treatment of environmental issues, 
especially approaches to address natural resource use and management, pest management, water 
conservation and protection, etc. may set an important precedent for non-project areas now and in 
the future. In addition, it is anticipated that project preparation will identify some critical natural 
resource policy issues that impact the livelihoods of the poor that have been pursued strategically 
as part of project implementation. 
 
Involuntary land acquisition (OP 4.12):
  The subprojects to be undertaken as part of the project 
include (i) Skill building; (ii) Micro enterprises (such as, agri processing units and service 
centers); (iii) Community infrastructure (drinking water); (iv) Private facilities (equipment, 
domestic latrines); (v) Productivity improvement; and (vi) Marketing linkages etc.  Most of these 
activities need very little or no land acquisition.  Land needed for income generation through 
private enterprise would be procured at market rates.  Social Assessment has indicated that minor 
land needed for up-gradation of common infrastructure is already available. Other private 
facilities do not need involuntary land acquisition.  Whenever land is acquired through voluntary 
donations, assurances will be sought from Government of Sri Lanka that: (a) the project will not 
resort to involuntary land acquisition; (b) in the case of voluntary land donations: (i) the land 
should be free of squatters, encroachments and encumbrances; and (ii) the legal rights will be 
transferred to the appropriate institutions (Village Associations) through a registered deed or 
Memorandum of Understanding; (c) all land donations would be documented; and (d) provision 
will be made for redressing grievances before commencement of construction activities. Based on 
these considerations, OP 4.12 is not triggered. 
 
Indigenous people (OD 4.20):
  A detailed social assessment carried out in the project area (Uva 
and Southern province) indicates that there is negligible population of tribes and they do not meet 
the definition laid out in the OD.  The indi

Program
. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
The project process considered various project alternatives.  On the institutional level, the project 
replaces a top-down or centralized decision-making process in favor of a decentralized decision-
making process on the community-based management of natural resources in which the 
government acts as a facilitator.
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
All sub-projects would be subject to an environmental screening at an appropriate level of 
assessment based on the tools to be included in the Environmental Management Framework and 
referenced in the Operations Manual. The screening process will distinguish sub-projects 
requiring a environmental review at the village level using the standard mitigation measures that 
are referenced in the guidelines, to those requiring a limited environmental assessment using 
expertise at the district level, and to those that might need a full fledged environmental 
assessment.  The latter category of sub-projects are not largely expected to emerge under the 
project, if they do, then these have been subjected to a full environmental assessment using 
technical expertise available at the central level. Counterpart staff members have been identified 
to participate with the consultants in the preparation of the environmental management 
framework.  These counterpart staff have been subsequently and primarily responsible for 
implementation of the environmental and social management frameworks. Capacity building 
exercises for implementation of the environmental framework at all levels will be initiated prior 
to project negotiations.
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The stakeholders include rural communities (women, youth, rural poor and others), government 
departments (at village, district, provincial and central levels), elected representatives, private 
sector and public sector institutions, voluntary sector and community-based organizations at the 
different administrative levels. The project design and implementation will involve consultation 
and participation of all stakeholders at different levels based on detailed stakeholder analysis. 
Significant experience is already available based on implementation of similar projects. All key 
stakeholders would be actively engaged through participatory processes. The institutional 
arrangements at local levels have been formed after extensive information, education and 
communication activities and participatory processes. The Environmental Management 
Framework (EMF), including pest management and dam safety plans have been shared with a 
representative sample of stakeholders at the village, district, province and central levels, and their 
comments incorporated in the final version to be publicly available before project appraisal. The 
planning of sub-projects, decision making and resource management by local institutions and 
monitoring would again involve participatory and transparent processes.
