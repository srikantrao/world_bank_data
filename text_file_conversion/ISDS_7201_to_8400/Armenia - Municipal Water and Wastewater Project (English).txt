A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project objective is to improve (i) the quality of services provided to customers in 
Armenia Water and Sanitation Company's (AWSC) service area and (ii) the sustainability 
of AWSC. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project has three components.  The first, Armenia Water Supply Company (AWSC) 
Management Strengthening, includes financing the management contract and general 
expenses for the contract monitoring unit (CMU),  refunding the project preparation 
facility (PPF) advance.  The second component, AWSC Investments, assists AWSC at 
the national level, providing training for its staff, compensation for redundant employees, 
water meter installation and testing, condominium support and payment of company 
operations and maintenance expenses.  The third component, Investments in Branch 
Systems, supports priority reconstruction and rehabilitation works in the branches 
managed by AWSC. 
 
Component A  AWSC MANAGEMENT STRENGTHENING 
 
This component includes three parts: 
Management of AWSC by an international firm
.  The project will finance the fixed fee 
an
d
 performance incentive for a fou
r
-year management contract to improve AWSC 
Page  3
 
 
administration, operations and maintenance, and to ensure optimal use of MWWP 
investment funds. 
Project Management and Supervision by the CMU
.  Project supervision will be done by 
SCWE's Water Sector Development and Institutional Improvements PIU, which also was 
responsible for project preparation under the PPF and currently is implementing the 
Bank-financed Dam Safety and Irrigation Development projects.  For the current project, 
the PIU will act as a contract monitoring unit. 
Funds provided by the PPF
.  Costs of project preparation during 2002-2004. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Component B  AWSC INVESTMENTS  
 
Six subcomponents are included: 
 
General Assistance 
 
 
Amounts are provided for procurement of office and communications equipment, 
instruments, hardware, software, spare parts and annual audits. 
 
Redundancy Program
  
 
Reduction of personnel is needed to increase AWSC labor productivity.  A redundancy 
program will start after the first year of the management contract.  During the first year 
the management contractor will undertake a staff assessment and identify redundant staff 
who will be offered a termination package.  The package will consist of three months 
salary, an additional benefit based on years of service and three months salary arrears.  
The total number of estimated redundant employees is about 700 (30 percent of the 
current workforce).  This program is expected to improve AWSC labor productivity from 
around 70 to 105 subscribers per employee.   
 
Training and Re-qualification
  
 
This subcomponent provides for establishment of a central training and re-qualification facility and 
development of training programs to familiarize AWSC staff (and Armenian contractors) with operations 
requirements, and new technologies, materials, equipment and methods used in well-managed water and 
wastewater utilities.  Training expenses will be shared with the planned second phase of the Yerevan 
Municipal Development Project. 
 
Chemical and Bacteriological Laboratories
 
 
The project will finance a central national laboratory for analyzing water abstracted and 
distributed to consumers and effluents discharged into the environment.  It also will 
finance e
q
ui
p
ment for safe collection and trans
p
ortation of sam
p
les from local sites to 
Page  4
 
 
Yerevan and refurbishment and renewal of local laboratories. 
 
Water Meter Testing Laboratory
  
 
A water meter testing laboratory with relevant equipment will support the metering 
program. 
 
Water Meter Revolving Fund and Installation 
 
 
This subcomponent will finance a revolving fund for the credit sale of water meters.  
Funds returned from credit sales (in two to three years) will finance additional meters 
and, at conclusion of the program, will be used for other project purposes.  The revolving 
fund includes operating costs and bad debt to be written off (about 10 percent of 
subcomponent costs).  Water meters will be provided free of charge or with subsidized 
installation for poor customers (about 20 percent of all subscribers).  
 
Assistance to Condominiums
  
 
Building on the experience of a Japanese Social Development Fund grant supporting 
condominiums in the Yerevan MDP, this subcomponent will support condominiums in 
AWSC's service area, where about 50 percent of the population live in apartment blocks.  
The assistance will be two-fold--installation of block meters and partial repair of internal 
networks, and survey of internal networks to develop an investment program for 
subsequent GoA and condominium financing. 
 
 
 
Incremental AWSC Operating Expenses
  
 
This subcomponent will finance materials, spare parts, consumables (e.g. chlorine and 
chemicals for water treatment plants) and other O&M expenses to improve operational 
performance and service quality (particularly bacteriological safety). 
 
Project Component C  INVESTMENTS IN BRANCH SYSTEMS  
 
Municipal water distribution networks are critically deteriorated and about 70 percent of 
investments under this component will be for water network rehabilitation, 20-25 percent 
for improvement of other branch assets and 5-10 percent for wastewater network 
rehabilitation. 
 
This component has two parts: 
 
Immediate Investment Program
  
To enable the management contractor to begin work quickly an Immediate Investment 
Program (IIP), based on detailed engineering studies prepared by the CMU, will be 
approved by the company management board before initialization of the management 
contract.  The management contractor will be free to amend the IIP as deemed necessary. 
Page  5
 
 
 
Investments in AWSC Branches 
 
Funds provided under this subcomponent will finance the design, implementation and 
supervision of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of water and wastewater systems in 
AWSC branches.  The investments will be determined by the management contractor 
during contract implementation. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Project will focus on the medium and small sized cites in AWSC's existing service area, 
that initially covers about 45 percent of the national population and 300 communities.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project triggers OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. Although no major environmental issues are 
anticipated, since most of investments will concentrate on rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, certain 
investment items to be funded under the project (which are expected to fall under Environmental 
Categories B and C) may require special mitigation measures to protect the environment and enhance 
health safety. Any subproject determined to be under Environmental Category A would be ineligible for 
financing under the project. During project preparation a Environmental Management Plan Framework 
(EMPF) has been prepared specifying procedures to be followed during project implementation to address 
environmental concerns of sub-projects. 
 
The project also triggers draft OP 4.11. Although at present no impacts on cultural and historical assets are 
expected, there is a possibility for chance finds during constructions. The EMPF and civil works contracts 
will include provisions to deal with chance finds.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The potential environmental impacts will vary depending on specific features of each 
subproject. In general, the environmental issues that may need to be addressed during 
different stages of subprojects’ development will be related to: 
 
Potential Positive Impacts
 :  
• 
Improvement of the public health:  The project will increase water availability and improve the 
physiological and microbiological quality of water supplied to consumers, which should lead to a 
reduction of the water-borne diseases and a general improvement in public health;  
• 
Improvement of the public socio-economic situation: The project will improve socio-economic 
situation of population of 306 inhabited settlements;     
• 
Repair and improved operation of water supply system will ensure water savings, higher quality of 
drinking water thus reducing pollution threat: A possible reduction in the amount of raw water used 
could potentially improve the sustainability of water resource use, as well as leak correction and 
control will prevent water contamination and activation of land sliding and erosion processes;  
• 
Rehabilitation of pumping stations and conversion to gravity water supply will allow reducing amount 
of produced energy; 
• 
Repair and improvement of wastewater collection will reduce risk of sewerage blockage and allow to 
discharge treated wastewater of higher quality to nature environment. 
 
Potential Negative Impacts:
 
• 
Impacts from improper disposal of excavated materials and construction waste; 
• 
Possibility for chance finds during construction, although at present no impacts on 
cultural and historical assets are expected; 
• 
Degradation of landscapes and soil erosion; 
• 
Loss of fertile top soil due to temporary access roads and work areas; 
• 
Pollution of water and soil by fuel and oil products;  
• 
Pollution of water sources by domestic animal; 
• 
Increased number of accidents related to heavier traffic; 
• 
Noise and vibration disturbances; 
• 
Landslides and landslips resulting from construction works ; 
Page  7
 
 
• 
Temporary interruption of water supply; 
• 
Temporary air pollution (dust) related to the transportation of construction materials 
and truck traffic; 
• 
Safety hazards from chlorination processes; 
• 
Soil and water contamination by water treatment sludge (well, spring, catchments); 
• 
Pollution of water and soil by disposal of residual solid products from mechanical and 
biological treatment of wastewater; 
• 
Disturbance to rivers water quality by discharged wastewater; 
• 
Soil and groundwater contamination by extraction run-off; 
• 
Impacts on flora/fauna. 
 
Impacts are expected to be minor given the nature of the works – mostly rehabilitation of existing 
infrastructure. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower is committed to implement the EMPF. As specified in the EMPF, environmental screening 
will be undertaken to determine mitigation requirements.  RoA environmental legislation does not classify 
projects according potential environmental impact and therefore project investments will be classified by 
assessment categories specified in OP 4.01. 
 
The Contract Monitoring Unit will screen investment programs, assign environmental categories and 
inform the management contractor about the type and scope of environmental documentation (e.g., 
environmental assessment, environmental management plan) required, consultation and disclosure 
requirements, and any other requirements under the RoA law.  The management contractor will be 
responsible for carrying out appropriate environmental assessments for annual investment programs, 
fulfilling environmental requirements and obtaining all necessary permits.  The CMU's environmental 
specialist, trained in environmental assessment work and familiar with OP 4.01 and RoA environmental 
legislation, will review environmental reports prepared by the operator and ensure proposed mitigation 
measures are adequate.  The CMU will submit environmental screening assessments to the Bank and to the 
CMB that include justification of environmental category assigned to project investments. 
 
Environmental management plans based on results of environmental screening will include four sections: 
(1) mitigation measures and institutional responsibilities for implementation; (2) environmental monitoring; 
(3) capacity building and training; and (4) capital and recurrent costs.  These plans will guide the 
management contractor's preparation and implementation of annual work programs and will reflect RoA 
environmental guidelines and standards.  Funds for implementing these plans has been included in project 
costs. 
 
If during construction, cultural and historical assets are found, the works must be stopped and the agency 
responsible for prevention of cultural heritage must be notified by the Contract Monitoring Unit. Works can 
resume only after permit from the respective authorities has been issued. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

e has been held on June 26, 2002 in the 
Page  8
 
 
National Academy of Sciences. The objectives of the workshop were to: 
 
• 
present the activities to be conducted under the EMP to the concerned parties and the 
public; 
• 
present conditions for identification and evaluation of environmental impacts 
anticipated from water supply and wastewater disposal; 
• 
present potential environmental influence on water supply and wastewater disposal; 
• 
seek opinions and advise from parties concerned and experts with respect to methods 
and ways to reduce or prevent potential environmental impacts;  
 
• 
clarify, as much as possible, the information sources and data required for the 
implementation of the EMP; and  
• 
keep concerned parties, experts and the public, informed about directions the project 
implementation will follow.  
 
As stated in the EMPF, the Ministry of Nature Protection  according to existing 
legislation is responsible for ensuring public awareness on sub-projects of all EA 
Categories (A, B and C) through mass media (TV, radio, newspapers), as well as for 
notifying local authorities and concerned NGOs about environmental aspects of a project 
with further consideration of their views during project preparation and implementation 
phases. 
 
Taking into consideration requirements of the above listed legislation, as well as World Bank guidelines for 
all Category B subprojects, during the EA process, management contractor will consult project-affected 
groups and local NGOs about the project’s environmental aspects.  Management contractor will provide 
relevant material in a timely manner prior to consultation with project-affected groups and local NGOs in a 
form and language understandable and accessible to the group being consulted. Management contractor 
should inform population about EA conclusion accepted by the Ministry of Nature Protection. 
Any separate Environmental Assessment report for environmental category B project will 
be made available to project-affected groups and local NGOs.
