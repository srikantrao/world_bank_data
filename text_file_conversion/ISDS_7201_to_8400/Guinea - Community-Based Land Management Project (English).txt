B.  Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the GEF Project is to pilot improved land management practices in 
selected sub-watersheds, thereby increasing the productive potential of arable lands and reducing 
negative impacts caused by land degradation in these sub-watersheds. The GEF funded project 
broadens the scope of the multi-donor supported Village Community Support Program (VCSP) 
by including the land degradation dimension in the development planning process of 
communities. 
 
The global objective of the GEF Project is to pilot an integrated cross-sectoral approach in 
selected sub-watersheds aimed at preventing and where necessary mitigating the causes and 
negative impacts of land degradation on their structure and functional integrity. This approach 
will be facilitated by linking up with the VCSP, and by using sub-watersheds as a planning basis.  
 
C.  Project Description 
 
In support of the above objectives, the project is adopting an integrated cross-sectoral approach 
facilitated by linking up with the Second Phase of the VCSP, and by using watersheds as a 
Page  2
planning basis.  The proposed GEF Project will work to integrate the ecological, social and 
economic dimensions of land degradation. Supported activities are fully compatible with OP 15 
(sustainable land management) and corresponds to GEF strategic priorities for capacity building 
and the on-the-ground application of innovative approaches and technologies. 
 
The project includes the following components: (i) capacity building of communities and 
decentralized agents of relevant technical ministries as appropriate to promote new land 
management techniques, (ii) support to the realization of micro-projects aimed at preventing 
and/or mitigating the impact of land degradation, and (iii) coordination and monitoring and 
evaluation 
 
D.  Project location 
 
The project is national in scope, but will be piloted in all natural regions. To date, two 
watersheds have been identified as part of project preparation, these are: Kakrima (Plateau) and 
Fatala (Coastal).  Within these watershed, pilot sub-watersheds will be identified based on clear 
criteria. Two additional sites in other water basins elsewhere in Middle Guinea will be identified 
prior to project appraisal. 
 
E.  Beneficiary’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Beneficiary has limited institutional capacity through its existing institutions. VCSP has, 
however, in the past, through its coordination unit, been able to develop and implement 
appropriate safeguard policies.  These have been adapted and strengthened over time and are 
satisfactory to the Bank.

An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment will be carried out in conjunction with 
the baseline Project as part of project preparation.  On the basis of the assessment, an 
environmental management framework will be developed to address any unexpected 
negative environmental and social impacts during project implementation.

Natural Habitats

To ensure that an appropriate framework is present up-front, the potential impact of the 
project on protected areas (or areas of significance) will be reviewed as part of the 
Environmental and Social Impact Assessment and an appropriate framework designed.

Environmental Assessment
.
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment will be carried 
out in conjunction with the baseline Project as part of project preparation. No potential large 
scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are expected as a consequence of the project. In 
contrary, by its very nature, this project aims to mitigate environmental degradation (in particular 
land degradation) in Guinea, and as such is intended to improve the state of environment in the 
country, and not to cause any environmental or social harm. On the basis of the assessment, an 
environmental management framework will be developed to address any unexpected negative 
environmental impacts during project implementation. 
 
Natural Habitats
.
The project will not support activities negatively affecting critical natural 
habitats.  Given the potential for indirect impacts through activities in the watershed, this aspect 
would be reviewed as part of the overall Environmental and Social Impact Assessment 
 
Forestry
.
The project’s focus is on promoting agro-forestry in farmers’ fields. Therefore, OP/GP 
4.36 will not be triggered. 
 
Pest Management
.
The project does not involve the direct promotion or support the use of 
pesticides.  At any rate, these are too costly in the Guinean context to be used economically in 
the project areas. 
 
Indigenous People
.
This policy is not applicable. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement
.
The project is not expected to lead to any involuntary resettlement of 
people, because of the participatory processes put in place to ensure that consensual and win-win 
decisions are reached to satisfy all parties concerned. There is a risk, however, that some 
individuals may be forced by dominant groups to relocate or have diminished or no longer access 
to resources following the implementation of the local development plans. In order to ensure a 
proper consultation on any such decision a Process Framework will be prepared prior to 
appraisal of the project. It is important to understand here, that people that will have their access 
to natural resources reduced will be eligible to benefit from support under Component 3.  
 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  4
Safety of Dams
.
The project does not support the construction of any dams. 
 
Projects in International Waters
.
The project will not divert or obstruct the free flow of 
international waters. 
 
Projects in Disputed Areas
.
The project area does not include any disputed territories as defined 
in BP/GP/OP 7.60.
