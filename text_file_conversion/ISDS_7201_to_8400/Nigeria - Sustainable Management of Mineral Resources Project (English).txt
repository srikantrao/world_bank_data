A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objectives of the proposed project are to: 
 
(i) Increase the Government's long-term institutional and technical capacity to manage Nigeria's 
mineral resources in a sustainable way; 
(ii) Establish a basis for poverty reduction and rural economic renewal in selected areas of the 
country via the development of non-farm income generating opportunities through small-scale 
and artisanal mining and to diversify away from oil sources of income. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project consists of four main components: 
 
Component A - Economic Development and livelihood diversification in Artisanal and 
Small-scale Mining Areas.  (
61.46 million) 
This component aims at improving the sustainability of small-scale mining through pilot 
demonstration projects, extension of services and improved access to financing. The component 
will also support the development of the private sector and its institutions, as well as 
strengthening of the Jos School of Mines to form a regional and national pole of excellence for 
in-the-field training of small-scale miners. The project will support activities aiming to: i) define 
small-scale mining and gender issues in mining through baseline studies; ii) improve technical, 
environmental and social conditions of small-scale mining operations through community-driven
 
pilot projects;
 
iii) Strengthen the Jos School of Mines; iv) establish of a SSM Unit at the Federal level with 
satellite offices in the six geo-political zones; v) improve access to credit and financing in the 
mining sector, in particular for medium and small-scale mining; vi) support of the private sector 
institutions; and vii) foster development of mining for specific commodities with emphasis on 
import substitutions and sector development. This component aims at empowering small-scale 
miners and surrounding communities to ensure their sustainability and to promote the 
development of a well-functioning national mining sector.   
 
Component B - Strengthening Governance and Transparency in Mining.
 (30.90 million) 
 
The main objective of this component will be the revision and actualization of the legal and fiscal 
frameworks for mining to bring Nigeria’s solid minerals sector up to international standards in 
terms of best practice and competitiveness.  The activities supported by the Project include: i) 
Revision and modernization of the legal and fiscal frameworks for mining; ii) Institutional 
capacity building to provide for efficient public mining institutions and transparent management 
of the sector; iii) Development of a computerized registry and Mining Cadastre system in 
accordance with international best practice; and iv) Development of the environmental and social 
management within the mining sector. The main objectives of the component are to improve 
Nigeria’s competitiveness to attract private investment in mining, and the administration of 
mining rights and activities. 
 
Page  3
Component C - Private Sector Development
.
(19.72 million) The component will support the 
efforts of the Government to facilitate the development of a national mining industry led by the 
efficient private sector and the restructuring of the State-owned mining enterprises. Within this 
framework, the Project will support: i) Restructuring of State-owned mining corporations (NMC 
and NCC); ii) Strengthening of the geological infrastructure (geophysical, geological mapping 
and mineral assessments) as well as development of the national solid minerals information 
system in support to investment promotion in the mining sector. The present component, besides 
restructuring of the state owned mining corporations, will mainly allow the compilation, 
actualisation of the large amount of data detained by GSNA and ensure its diffusion in support of 
the promotion of investments.  
Component D - Project Coordination and Management. 
(8.69 million) MSMD shall establish 
and maintain, during the execution of the program, a Project Management Unit (PMU) to 
coordinate project implementation, and to manage the following activities: (a) procurement, 
including all contracting for works and purchases, and the hiring of consultants, (b) project 
monitoring, reporting and evaluation, (c) the contractual relationship with IDA, and (d) financial 
record keeping, the Special Account and disbursements. The PMU shall ensure the coordination 
among the different agencies participating in the Project 
–
i.e. other ministries and institutions at 
the Federal and States levels, stakeholders from the public and private sectors, and civil 
society.  
The PMU shall also be the direct contact with the World Bank Abuja office and the project task 
team in Washington to coordinate project implementation issues on a regular basis.  The PMU 
shall be headed by a Project Coordinator and shall include specialized personnel for accounting, 
procurement, environment, financial management, and evaluation and monitoring. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
All over the country, with no specific locations targeted (All 36 States of the Federation 
have informal mining activities). Specific components like the pilot artisanal and small-
scale projects will be located to cover the six geopolitical zones of the Country.

[
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
Comments:
 
The project is classified as Category B, as the potential negative environmental and 
social impacts are minor and are being mitigated through appropriate measures contained in the 
environmental management plan, resettlement policy framework and process framework agreed 
and prepared by the borrower in line with Bank safeguard policies.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project, generally a capacity building effort, is considered benign given that all activities are  
designed to have no significant environmental or social impacts. The SESA, RPF and the PF 
carried out during project preparation has provided mechanisms to identify impacts beyond the 
generic ones for which standard mitigation measures are built  and to be applied during the  
implementation phase. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
The project will have long-term positive impacts in the mining sector in Nigeria, due to 
anticipated future activities, especially in the artisanal and small-scale mining sub-sector. No 
cumulative and/or long-
term impacts are anticipated at this point. However, the EMP in the SESA  
document gives full details of the anticipated impacts and takes into consideration appropriate 
mitigation measures, including those related to longer-term impacts. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not Applicable 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The PMU will be responsible for the implementation of the EMP. Consultants will be engaged to 
prepare RAPs and Plan of Action as and when necessary. The PMU is staffed with one 
Environmentalist (who participated in the just concluded involuntary resettlement workshop in 
Lagos) and will be complemented with short-term national social/environmental safeguards 
consultants as and when the need arises. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
One of the key principles of this project from the outset has been to foster participation of all 
relevant stakeholders. Consultations and workshops where held during the preparation of the 
project, two prominent ones were the solid minerals forum and the national mining policy 
dialogue held in Abuja in July 2004. The following groups are the key stakeholders: artisanal and 
small-scale miners, mining communities, NGOs/CBOs, the academic community, the 
government (federal, state and local), the mining professional societies, financial institutions, 
private mining companies and consultants. These stakeholder groups have been systematically 
consulted throughout project preparation in order to foster awareness, and ownership on their 
part. 
 
The PCN stage ISDS was disclosed through the Infoshop according to the standard World Bank 
procedures.  In-country disclosure was done through the PMU, with the assistance from the Abuja 
WB office.
