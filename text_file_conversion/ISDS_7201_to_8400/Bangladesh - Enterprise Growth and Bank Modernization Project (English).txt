A.2. Project Objectives 
 
Project development objective: 
The objectives of the project are: (i) to trigger 
employment generation through private sector enterprise growth and urgently needed 
reforms within the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)– as part of a wider reform of rolling 
back state ownership and control within the economy; and (ii) to help Bangladesh 
implement its banking sector reform program aimed at achieving a competitive private 
banking system by a staged withdrawal  through corporatization leading to divestment of 
a substantial shareholding in Rupali, Agrani, and Janata, and to divestment of a minority 
shareholding in Sonali. 
 
This project contributes to the higher level objective of reducing poverty through 
reducing and ultimately stopping the hemorrhaging of fiscal resources through the 
ultimate privatization and closure of most of these loss making financial and non-
financial public enterprises.  The saved fiscal resources could then be devoted to 
expanding public services in education, health, and infrastructure – to the poor.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project has seven main sub-components – in three main areas of support for 
Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization.  These include (a) an Enterprise Growth

economic growth; and (c) a program of banking reform.   
 
By Component: 
 
Enterprise Growth Support Component 
 
(a) Small Enterprise Development.  
This component seeks to support the development 
of the small enterprise sector by addressing  the constrains that hinder access to finance 
by this sector of entrepreneurs. There are clearly other constraints to small enterprise 
development including the legal framework, availability of skilled manpower, access to 
uninterrupted power and business development services. However, this project focuses on 
what one recent survey identifies as the top constraint - access to finance - while 
providing linkages to other Government and donor interventions that address the other 
impediments to small enterprise development. Having reviewed various options, that 
included setting up a credit guarantee fund and integrating a credit line within the micro-
finance wholesaler PKSF, it was decided during the project preparation stage that it 
would be preferable to establish a Small Enterprise Fund (SEF) at the Bangladesh Bank. 
The SEF would be a refinancing facility where funds will be on-lent to SME- focused 
banks to help scale up their small enterprise portfolio. Financial institutions interested to 
avail of this facility include BRAC Bank, BASIC bank, MIDAS Financing, Prime Bank 
and Dhaka Bank and specifically the smaller end of their small enterprise portfolio. 
 
(b)     Refurbishment of  some Strategic Remaining Assets of Loss Making SOE’s. 
This will help in converting some of the key closed assets into productive uses will be 
crucially important in meeting the Government’s objectives of increased investment and 
employment creation over the short to medium term.  This component will cover costs of 
refurbishment of these assets.  Two prominent sites – Adamjee Jute Mills and Chittagong 
Steel Mills have already been identified. Two more sites have been proposed for support 
under the proposed operation –  including Chittagong Chemical Complex and Khulna 
Newsprint Mill. 
 
(c)   Institutional Strengthening
.  The project supports capacity building within the 
Privatization Commission (PC), the Board of Investment (BOI), and the Bangladesh 
Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA). 
 
The Longer Term Program of Adjustment in Support of Sustained Economic 
Growth
.  
 
(d) 
Support to Voluntary Retirement Schemes.  
It is designed to cover the VRS 
costs to the Government of a second tranche of about 96 enterprises slated for closure/ 
privatization over the period 2002-03 to 2007-08.  The proposed project will cover the 
retrenchment costs of workers – but is not intended to cover other long-term and short- 
term liabilities such as utility bills, outstanding amounts owed to suppliers, and unpaid 
bank loans.

SOEs.  
Undertaking social tracking and providing adequate counseling and re-training 
support to retrenched workers are also important social priorities under the project.  This 
part of the project will be funded out of the DFID part project funding for which $10 
million has been earmarked.  DFID has also undertaken exit surveys of retrenched 
workers from two Jute Mills, and will continue to fund tracking survey in future under 
this project.  To ensure that the retraining schemes and counseling services have the 
desired impact, the proposed project intends to apply innovative methods to support 
transitioning these workers into alternative jobs or self employment.  The experience of 
different institutions such as BRAC, MIDAS, the Bureau of Manpower and Training 
(BMET), is being used.  The Safety Net and Social Tracking program will be coordinated 
by the Privatization Commission (PC) and implemented by experienced NGOs, certified 
training institutions and research organizations, with a proven track-record and capacity 
to deliver the required services. 
 
A Program of Banking Reform 
 
Resolution of the Problems of the Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCB’s).
 
Reforms in the NCBs have been identified by both Government studies and the FSAP as 
being particularly urgent.  The proposed project is designed to support the government’s 
initial reforms envisaged in these Nationalized Commercial Banks.  These include:  the 
privatization of Rupali Bank; hiring an external management team at Agrani Bank to 
contain losses; and the introduction of management experts at Sonali and Janata Banks to 
improve operational performance.  The “end-game” for Rupali, Agrani, and Janata is a 
fundamental change in their existing governance arrangements through the 
implementation of the Resolution Plans – and their movement out of the public sector. In 
the case of Sonali, the “end-game” is to  bring it to the point where a minority 
shareholding can be divested over the medium-term. 
   
Additional Support 
 
(g)     Public Awareness, Monitoring and Evaluation.
  The Government will need to 
develop an improved information campaign to convince the public of the overall benefits 
of its ongoing reform efforts.  In addition, this component of the project will support 
monitoring and evaluation of the costs and benefits of the reform agenda – including the, 
already commenced, social tracking exercise, so as to be able to adjust and adapt the 
program appropriately in response to overall indications of the program’s direction.

Comments:  
 
One safeguard operational policies is triggered for this project: Environment (OP 4.01).  
The impacts related to this project are site-specific and not irreversible but require 
adequately managed measures to compensate for any adverse impacts and to improve 
project performance. 
 
 
The project will provide support to strengthen the Government's capacity to manage its 
program of privatization of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs).  As part of this support, the 
project will assist the Government in the development and implementation of a set of 
principles and procedures to manage the environmental liabilities associated with the past 
operation of these facilities and the future use of these sites.  In addition, the project will 
help address some of the factors constraining the growth of Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs), and in doing so will help ensure that the development of this sector 
is consistent with national environmental requirements and relevant World Bank 
guidelines.  
 
There will not be any construction/ civil works in this project, therefore no land 
acquisition, so the OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement  is not triggered. The project is 
not located in tribal areas, so the OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples is also not triggered.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
No new impacts are anticipated as a result of the project.  However, environmental 
liabilities may arise as a result of either past damage caused by the SOEs to be privatized, 
or their continued operation in a condition of non-compliance with environmental 
legislation.  Failure to identify and assign liability for past or continuing environmental 
impacts, and to address such concerns during the privatization process, can introduce 
uncertainty, potentially deterring investors and extending any associated damage. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
None 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
During preparation of the project, the report “Bangladesh Privatization Program: Policies 
and Procedures for Environmental Liability and Compliance Assessment” was completed 
and its recommendations were accepted by the Government.  In particular, it was agreed 
that (i) the Planning Commission (PC) will adopt the environmental policies and 
procedures specified in the report, and (ii) BEPZA will contract an environmental audit 
of the Chittagong Steel Mills site based on the Terms of Reference included in the report, 
which will serve as a model for further environmental audits under the privatization 
program. 
 
A component of the Project will help address some of the factors constraining SME 
growth.  This component will include a small credit line to SME-focused banks to 
promote the scaling-up of their SME portfolio, and support for SME business 
development services.  As part of this assistance, the Project will support the provision of 
training to participating institutions to help ensure that the growth of the SME sector is 
consistent with national environmental requirements and relevant World Bank guidelines. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders include the agencies involved (PC, BEPZA), potential buyers of the 
SOEs to be 
p
rivatized, and the communities affected b
y
 the o
p
eration of these facilities. 
Page  7
 
 
In completing environmental audits and examinations of these facilities and sites, PC and 
BEPZA will require that affected communities are consulted, and both they and potential 
buyers are informed of the results of such analyses.
