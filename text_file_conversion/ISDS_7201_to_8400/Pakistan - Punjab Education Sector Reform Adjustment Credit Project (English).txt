A.2. Project Objectives
The purpose of this sector adjustment operation is to provide core budget support for the
attainment of the MDG targets in basic education. The project would be the first part of a long-
term program to support sector wide development through a series of single tranche adjustment
programs that would be linked to achieving specific qualitative and quantitative targets in the
education sector. By starting with Pakistan's largest province with a population of over 56%, the
project targets a major part of the challenge to meeting MDG goals in the country.
A.3. Project Description
The Govemment in Punjab has developed a reform program which strongly places govemance
issues at center stage. The government proposes to take advantage of the opportunity offered by
Pakistan's decentralization which transfers responsibility for education to elected district
governments and proposes to take this up in partnerships with the elected district govemments
who have the responsibility for delivering education and health services. The Govemment is
putting in place policies and programs which will be difficult to reverse such as transparent
recruitment criteria, restructuring public private partnerships through its Education Foundation,
reinvigorating teacher training programs, and establishing performance based agreements with
District Governments. The Bank support would be channeled though the provincial budget and
would represent an additional increase in resources for the sector over and above increases funded
from the provincial government's own resources. The reform agenda is very wide ranging and
will be implemented over a three year period. During this period, the Government expects to
almost double total expenditures on education from the current base of 33 billion rupees. The
agenda covers improvements in access particularly among the poor through provision of mission
facilities, scholarships for girls, free text books and elimination of school fees. The reform
agenda also targets qualitative issues such as teacher training, teacher entry qualifications and
support for teachers through appropriate provision of teacher aids. Governance issues are
addressed by tackling teacher absenteeism, system management and strengthening the role of
community based school committees.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The Program will cover the entire province, wherever, government schools are located.
