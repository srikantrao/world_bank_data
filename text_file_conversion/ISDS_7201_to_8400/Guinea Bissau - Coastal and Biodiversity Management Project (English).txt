I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
  The Government of Guinea Bissau (GOGB) has long recognized the importance of its coastal and marine
  natural resources to both the local and national economy, and is aware of the importance of these resources to
  the sub-region's economy. GOBG has requested the Bank's assistance in its efforts to manage the coastal zone
  and related biodiversity.

  The aim of the project is to facilitate responsible management of natural resources in and around five protected
  areas and in three reserved fishing zones, and to assist the country in setting up a process of environmental and
  social screening of development projects in the country.

  The development objective of the proposed Coastal and Biodiversity Management Project is articulated the
  following way: Government agencies and natural resources users collaboratively manage coastal
  environment and biodiversity for both conservation and sustainable development ends.

  The project will create a new institution, the Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP), for
  managing the network of protected areas. The creation of IBAP is a natural extension of past park
  management efforts led by IUCN-The World Conservation Union, in which models for participatory park
  management has shown to be successful. In addition, the project will implement community development
  activities funded by a micro-finance mechanism (the FIAL), and it will strengthen the community-based
  management of reserved fishing zones. The project will seek to have a private foundation created to take over
  the continuation FIAL and with establishing an endowment for future financing of the IBAP. Finally, the
  project will create a unit for environmental and social safeguards screening of development projects in the
  country, which is a function that does not currently exist within any existing government agencies.


I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project aims to strengthen the institutional framework and build human resource capacity to protect
and sustainably use Guinea Bissau's coastal biological resources. It comprises of three inter-related
components plus one component for program management.

Component I - Protected Areas and Endangered Species Management

Through this component, the project will establish a financially and administratively autonomous institution

                                                       2
                                                                                                          ISDS


- The Institute for Biodiversity and Protected Areas (IBAP) - for managing the country's network of
protected areas. By engaging with local communities inside and outside of the parks, IBAP will ensure that
parks are effectively protected. The network of protected areas includes four existing PAs and one to be
created during the project.

The project will also support IBAP in developing and implementing species action plans for threatened
species.

Component II ­ Natural Resource Management

This component will establish a financing mechanism for community development initiatives, the Fund for
Local Environmental Initiatives (FIAL). The fund will target local communities and natural resources
users in and around the five protected areas by assisting communities in identifying and implementing
biodiversity-friendly approaches to natural resource management and local development.

Once the FIAL is operating successfully, the project will undertake activities to have a private foundation
established, the Foundation for Biodiversity in Guinea Bissau (FBGB) for which it is anticipated that
one funding windows will be a formalized FIAL financing mechanism, and the other being a funding
mechanism for supporting the cost of operating the protected areas system of IBAP.

The project will also implement participatory management and sustainable use of of three Reserved
Fishing Zones (RFZ) that are critical fish breeding and nursery areas for the coastal ecosystem. Of
importance here is the monitoring, control and surveillance of artisanal and industrial fisheries having an
impact on the reserved fishing zones. The project will support the government agencies responsible for
monitoring, control and surveillancce with capital investments for equipments and it will subsidize the
operating cost while a more durable solution is found through the process of a national discussion of
fisheries which the project also will support.

Component III ­ Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework

This component will establish and implement an environmental and social safeguard framework. The
project will support development of policies and procedures needed to ensure that environmental and social
concerns are taken into account in the development decision-making process.

It will build national capacity to evaluate and monitor the environmental and social implications of
development proposals, with a particular emphasis on understanding the opportunities and constraints
associated with petroleum exploitation and industrial fisheries.

In addition, it will support the mainstreaming of environmental law through harmonization of the national
legislation to meet internal commitments to biodiversity-related international conventions (Biodiversity,
Ramsar, CITES, Bonn).

Component IV ­ Program management and M&E

A Project Management Unit will secure the daily management and tracking of implementation, be
responsible for monitoring and evaluation of both progress and impact, and facilitating working
relationships between the implementing agencies.

A Project Management Group comprised of all key implementing agencies will ensure coordination of
project activities,

An inter-disciplinary Steering Committee will further promote coordination and synergies between
players.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project intervention areas are five protected areas in the coastal zone of Guinea-Bissau including Orango
National Park, Joao Vieira & Poilao National Park, Cacheu National Park, Cufada Lagoon Natural Park, and
the new Cantanhez protected area. The project will also intervene in three reserved fishing zones in the
archipelago related to the protected areas. The three areas are Joao Vieira, Orango-Buba River, and Formosa.

The population that may be affected by the project are primarily those living in and around of protected areas.
By Guinea-Bissau's laws, people are permitted to live within park boundaries so no re-location of people is
required.

No land acquisitions will be made by the project.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The project is aimed at protecting the environment and is not expected to generate any severe
environmental or social impact beyond the physical locations mentioned above. Nevertheless, because the
project could possibly touch on potentially serious issues such as petroleum and the fate of the Bijagos people,
a comprehensive environmental and social assessment has been carried out.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has been carried out. No potential large scale, significant
and/or irreversible impacts are expected as a consequence of the project. In contrary, by its very nature,
this project aims to mitigate environmental degradation in Guinea-Bissau, and as such is intended to
improve the state of environment in the country, and not to cause any environmental or social harm.

                                                                                                               ISDS




However, threats outside of the control of the project exist. While petroleum exploration is underway it is
not expected that oil production will be undertaken within the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, because
exploratory drilling is taking place in concessions offshore, there is a risk of oil spills that could potentially
impact the areas in which the project exists. In order to mitigate this risk, the project will prepare an oil
spill response plan for each protected area and rerserved fishing zone, even though it has been shown that
the impacts on natural resources from oil spills would not be as long term as once thought, but the short
term impacts on natural resources and communities might be severe. Commercial fishing could potentially
also be a risk outside of the control of the project if illegal fishing occurs in areas set aside for benefiting
people associated with this project. In order to mitigate this risk, the project will as an integral part fo the
design of management schemes implement surveillance plan.

Some people may as a result of the project have a limited access to resources following the implementation of
the participatory natural resource management plans. In order to ensure a proposer consultation on any such
decision a Process Framework will be prepared prior to appraisal of the project. It important to understand
here, that people that may have a limited access to natural resources will be eligible to become part of those
benefiting from the social development fund described above (FIAL)

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No such cumulative impacts are anticipated.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No such long term impacts are anticipated.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The no-project alternative would have significant negative impacts on the environment. If no adequate
action is taken through protection of the area, biodiversity would severely be damaged in the decades to
come, because of increasing external social and economic pressure in the area. Further, the no-project
alternative would leave the country without an environmental and social safeguards framework--a
foundation for sustainable development in Guinea-Bissau.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

   An Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared and will be implemented by
   the client.

   A Process Framework (PF) has been prepared and will be used to determine how people who are affected by a
   restriction of access to natural resources will be consulted. A micro-finance mechanism (FIAL) will in part be
   dedicated to compensate those people who have been affected.

   The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been disclosed in the country on 3/11/2004.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultation have taken place through the project Steering Committee, as well as the local level Park
Management Committees.

Framework (ESMF) have been disclosed through radio broadcasts in each of the regions in which the
project will operate. In addition, a full page announcement has been printed in the national newspaper
indicating the major activivities of the project and the safeguards policies of the World Bank which have
been triggered and subsequenlt addressed in the Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) The ESMF has been disclosed at the World Bank Infoshop.

The Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will pertain to communities where resident may have to
relocate, in whole or in part, from core areas of national or natural parks. The Process Framework (PF)
covers a broader set of circumstances, namely, where resident communities in the parks, whether in core or
in buffer areas, impose additional restrictions on natural resource use within the park area. The RPF and
PF together are intended to provide guidelines for the management of legally defined conservation areas by
all parties concerned -- the local communities, the park's management, government agencies, NGOs and the
private sector.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
