A.3. Project Description 
 
The MSD projects foresees three components:  
 
(i) 
A component for Azeri Post 
for modernization and commercialization of the Azeri Post to build 
the financial service capacity in rural areas that are presently undeserved or not served by 
Azerbaijan’s banking and for delivery of Government services.  This includes operational 
management, accounting, financial and risk management, operational functions, marketing and 
enlarged product and services structure. 
The interconnectivity of the Azeri Post system (with currently about 1200 postal offices) will be 
accomplished by employing satellite based interconnectivity platform supported by the project.   
(ii) 
A component for the NBA
, to finalize the development of the National Payment System 
Architecture, including introduction of electronic payment services and management of payment 
risks, interface with the large billing systems and integration of rural areas (including the capacity 
to use electronic payment instruments and card-systems). 
(iii)  
A component for the Agency for Standardization, Measurements and Patents 
to modernize the 
AZS, including its management functions and information capacity, to improve its quality related 
services and its capacity to participate in international work, to protect intellectual property and to 
modernize its measurement and testing capacity. 
The three project components in particular will entail:   
Component 1 - Azeri Post Platform.  
In general, the type of institutional capacity and 
business management and the level of IT support needed in the new Azeri Post, with 
stronger orientation on the provision of financial services, is comparable to that in a small 
bank providing simpler financial services (but, no
 lending).  Once the systems are 
modernized and the network is interconnected, new services would be introduced, 
including:  (i)
 financial services
, such as payments including electronic payments (e.g., 
pensions, social security, remittances) and collections (e.g. of utility bills, taxes, sales) 
deposits (sight and time deposits), selling other savings products, upgrading the money 
order and transfer systems, issuing cards backed by customer deposits, etc.; (ii) 
electronic-based Government services
, such as issuance of various certificates and 
business and personal documents by the local and central Government, payment of taxes, 
fees and other dues to the central and local government authorities, etc; and (iii) 
electronic-based business services
, such as electronic-commerce, cyber-post and E-Mail 
address, Internet access, access to information, as well as to electronic markets (known as 
B2B and B2C portals).  It is expected that the new Azeri Post platform will be deployed 
in a number of phases.   
(i) 
The first phase will include building the service and data processing and 
management capacity for all new functions and services in headquarters.  This 
phase is covered by the IDA credit. 
(ii) 
The second phase will extend the new services and functions to the 40 regional 
offices that are already interconnected via optical fiber network.  This phase will 
also serve for pilot testing of new functions and services in regions and to help 
plan and build a large scale deployment capacity.  It will include defining and 
developing capacity for training, technical assistance and maintenance functions 
needs for deployment in local post offices.  This phase is covered by the IDA 
credit. 
Page  6
 
 
   
6
(iii) 
The third phase comprises installation of the interconnectivity hub in headquarters 
and deployment of the new technology, functions and services to about 200 local 
postal offices.  This phase is covered by the IDA credit. 
(iv) 
The fourth and fifth phase will each include interconnectivity for additional 500 
local postal offices and deployment of the new technology, functions and 
services.  At the end of the fourth phase, the platform will include 700 points-of-
service in local postal offices.  At the end of the fifth phase, the platform will 
include all 1,200 currently existing local postal offices. 
 
 
 
The phase four and phase five of the deployment are included in the total cost of the 
project, as the project covers the entire Azeri Post network, but are not covered by the 
IDA credit.  The Government or Azeri Post would attempt to find additional sources of 
funding for these 1,000 postal offices.  If this is not successful, the Bank may be asked to 
extend a follow-up project to finance the deployment of the last 1,000 locations. 
Table 1 summarizes the planned investments for headquarters, including technical assistance and training, 
software systems, hardware, and office automation investments, and for the branch offices.

Component 1.A. - Interconnectivity for the Azeri Post Platform.  
Azeri Post system 
currently comprises 67 regional offices and 1,291 local post offices.  The existing optical 
fiber backbone provides an adequate connectivity platform for about 40 regional offices.  
Of the 1,291 local post office, about 1,200 are not connected in a way that would allow 
introduction of financial services.  The main reason for this is inadequacy of the domestic 
“last mile” network, which is poorly developed outside the few main routes.  Adequate 
connectivity is also the key prerequisite to interface the NBA’s payment system 
infrastructure and for financial risk management.    
 
Adequate interconnectivity is the critical requirement to be able to provide access to 
financial services and to im
p
rove infrastructure in rural areas.  Therefore, the 
p
ro
j
ect also 
Page  7

includes a solution that will provide adequate interconnectivity for the entire Azeri Post 
network, allow growth and be able to accommodate other potentially interested functions, 
such as introduction of e-Government.  The solution for fast and cost effective 
interconnectivity will be provided by 
VSAT- satellite based IP broadband overlay 
network
.   
 
Technically,  the VSAT solution will be based on DVB (Digital Video Broadcast) 
satellite network with broadband outbound TDM (Time Division Multiplex) carrier and 
multiple inbound TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) carriers. This network can be 
implemented with symmetrical or asymmetrical configuration (that are easily 
interchangeable) over 
Ku Band
.  The network services will be integrated over the 
Internet-based 
IP platform
.  The network will be configured as a “
Star Network
”.  This 
solution is able to accommodate up to 20,000 locations.   
 
The VSAT system will be deployed over 
three phases,
 which will cover 200, plus 
additional 500, plus additional 500 point-of-services (i.e., postal offices),  respectively. It 
is estimated that monthly operational costs per remote postal office in the phase one will 
be USD85, in the phase two USD49 and in the phase three USD41
1
.  Due to economies 
of scale, the best-cost efficiency would be achieved if the 1,200 terminal network is 
deployed in a short time period.

 This difference is mostly determined by fixed operational costs, which are not dependant on a number of 
operational VSAT terminals. These services are related to the central hub operational services and remote 
terminals maintenance.

The cost of the 
broadband hub 
in Azeri Post headquarters is estimated to be 
USD930,000.
  The rural access capacity will include full provision of all financial 
services, plus converged data, facsimile and voice (on a broadband platform). 
 
Communications equipment cost
 (including communication equipment, fax and telephone 
needed to support provision of financial services and basic business infrastructure) is 
estimated to 
USD3,500 per postal office
.  The office automation investment for postal 
offices includes a PC computer (with needed software to inter-relate to headquarters 
functions) and office productivity enhancement tools (high speed printer, scanner, copy-
machine
).  Office
 
automation cost
 is estimated to 
USD2,500 per postal office
.  It is 
estimated that the 
site preparation cost
 will be about 
USD3,000 per location
.  This 
includes improvements of physical sites of the individual postal offices (floor, paint, 
windows, doors, furniture, locks) and will be funded by Azeri sources.  
 
Component 2 – National Payment System Architecture.  
The total funding needed for 
this component is 
USD850,000
 
as summarized in Table 3.  Modules of the national 
payment system infrastructure to be completed under the project include:  
(i) 
Payment Risk Management System
 (PRMS) would include risk management 
software, such as to store information regarding rejection of payments due to the lack 
of funds. The information on delinquent payees will be provided to banks and 
merchants to enable them to avoid acceptance of payment instruments (cards) that 
might not be honored. 
(ii) Interface to Large Non-bank Systems
 will support direct system-to-system interfaces 
of the BCSS to large sources of small value payments (e.g., large utility companies 
such as telephone, electricity, water, gas, etc). Also, interfaces will be developed for 
Government and quasi-government entities that create large number of payment 
transactions, such as central and local tax payments, custom payments, pension and 
social security payments.  Once this module is completed, banks and Azeri Post (once 
its new systems have been installed) will be able to directly interconnect to the 
systems of large creators of small value payments and be able to exchange 
information on bills to be collected, and amounts collected.  This will facilitate 
collections and improve the quality of billing services.  
Page  9

(iii)
Azeri Post Interface 
will provide direct interface of the Azeri Post system to the 
BCSS, thereby integrating the platform for provision of payment services in the rural 
areas with the national payment system architecture. The precondition for this 
interface is that the Azeri Post internal processing and transaction management 
systems be able to meet the technical criteria established by the NBA.

Component 3 – Agency for Standardization, Metrology and Patents 
(
AZS
).  AZS 
provides a large number of services, including standardization, type approvals, metrology 
and verification, accreditation and certification and patents and intellectual property 
protection.  In addition, AZS information services, related to standards and intellectual 
property protection, are important.  The field of activity of AZS is critical for the 
development of both oil and non-oil industry, as well as for the development of exports, 
import substitution and consumer protection. Standardization, metrology, testing, and 
quality related services 
(SMTQ)
 are complex and technology-intensive.  While AZS 
appears to be a fairly well developed organization with generally good technical skills 
and management, its capabilities in the core SMTQ are low, and its equipment obsolete 
and unsuitable to perform efficiently or reliably most of the assigned tasks. Also, AZS 
systems are still mainly paper based.  
 
The project includes three main areas of focus.  A detailed description of this component 
is provided in 
Annex 4, Component 3.  
In the areas of standardization, the project includes 
technical assistance, training and investments in information technology necessary to 
improve the AZS capacity to provide information to exporters, importers and all other 
interested parties in its related fields.  Technical assistance and training will also be 
provided to establish an effective system for protection of intellectual property, as not to 
deter foreign investments related to products with higher knowledge content and access 
to modern technology.  The measurement, testing and quality-related services require 
large investments, and the challenge here was to establish priorities that could be covered 
by the project.  It was agreed to start from on 
agriculture and foodstuff, chemicals, 
mechanical and electrical products, and textiles
—the major non-oil sectors of the Azeri 
economy.  Table 4 summarizes AZS component.

Technical Assistance 
is needed
 
to improve general management skills (including 
financial management and marketing) and some TA related to project implementation, 
such as for preparation of technical specifications, testing, inspection and calibration of 
equipment, new equipment, training for the usage of the equipment, and preparation of 
necessary documentation, including quality systems and operational procedures.  In 
addition, TA may be required for execution of AZS strategy to strengthen the key 
functions.   
Training
.  
The training program objectives are to:  (i) improve AZS functional and 
technical skills such as development of local standards and adaptation of international 
standards, certification procedures, registration of trademarks, registration of patents, etc; 
(ii) strengthen management skills, such as general management, marketing and outreach, 
business and financial management, development of internal procedures, improvement of 
service delivery, etc.; (iii) learn to efficiently and safely operate the new equipment in 
performing its metrics and testing services; and (iv) IT related training.  
Information Technology (IT) Modernization
.
 The objective of the IT component is to 
allow AZS to: (i) effectively support its key functions (e.g., standardization); (ii) improve 
office productivity of AZS management and technical staff; and (iii) improve access to 
information.   Improved access to information for outside clients is important, including 
information related to standards, certification, intellectual property and quality control 
and quality assurance.  New IT should also result in significant efficiency improvements 
for all their functional areas.  This component amounts to about USD343,500
, 
in addition 
to the donation to improve the IT made by UNDP.   
Modernization of Technical Infrastructure of Testing and Metrology Laboratories
.  
This is the most urgent need, as many tests cannot be done on obsolete equipment that are 
at least two or more technology cycles behind equipment used in modern laboratories.  It 
will include a rehabilitation 
p
ro
g
ram for measurement, calibration and testin
g
 facilities of 
Page  11
 
 
   
11
the selected laboratories and measurement/calibration centers for selected key non-oil 
sub-sectors. The equipment required by the metrology department is basic.  The total 
estimated cost of equipment in this phase is about USD2,350,000. 
Component 4 – Project Management.  
This component will cover incremental 
operation cost related to project management.  The project management structure 
includes a Project Coordination Unit in the NBA and a Technical Implementation Unit in 
AZS and Azeri Post.  The staff of the PCU includes a manager, a financial management 
specialist and two procurement specialists.  In addition, advise of a person specialized in 
information technology procurements will be available, as needed.  The staff of TIU will 
include a manager and a procurement specialist.  Table 5 summarizes the costs associated 
with this component.

USD380,000 will cover external audit and training and technical assistance necessary to build the technical 
skills necessary for project implementation management. The operating cost, which are estimated at 
USD468,700 over a period of four years until the project implementation is completed will be covered by 
the implementing agencies.
