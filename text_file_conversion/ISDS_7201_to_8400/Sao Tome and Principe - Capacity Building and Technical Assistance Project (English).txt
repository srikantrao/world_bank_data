A.2. Project Objectives
The project will help to modernize and to strenghten capacity in economic (financial and
budgetary) management and supervision; and to build up basic institutional and legal infrastructure
in the finance and the natural resources and enviromnent ministries to cope with a more complex
economic and social environment arising from the onset of petroleum era and the nascent market
economy. The project will help strengthen the corresponding human capacity of the civil service.
The selection of the following key performance indicators mirrors the objectives of the project
components:
1. The government budget preparation and execution is strengthened as reflected by improvements
overtime in the HIPC AAP scores (currently 5) by using modem harmonized nomenclatures and
modem accounting framework and plan; yearly internal and external audits of the budget are
undertaken, published promptly, and reviewed by the National Assembly.
2. A public accounting system is created and implemented, staff have basic expertise to produce and
analyze necessary - internationally acceptable - budgetary accounting information and tables. Audits
of accounts are produced annually, published promptly and reviewed by the National Assembly
3. A National Petroleum Agency is created with staff having basic sector expertise to analyze and
follow-up on petroleum contracts, elaborate policies for the sector, and supervise and regulate the
industry.
4. The legal and institutional structure to implement and follow up is the PRSP is created and functional;
PRSP output and outcome indicators are regularly produced; PRSP document is revised to incorporate
the petroleum economy and the revised PRSP is adopted by the government and promulgated by the
President by June 2007.
A.3. Project Description
The project will consist of three components: (i) a petroleum sector component; (ii) a public finance
component and (iii) support for the PRSP implementation. More details about each component are in
Annex 4.
1.     Component I: Petroleum sector
The current PRMC-TA, closing in June 2004, has supported some of the nascent petroleum sector activities



in the past eighteen months in a number of ways: (i) international expertise were hired to assist the
government in re-negotiating four contracts; (ii) international experts also assisted the government in the
process of launching a bid round for bids from petroleum companies for the joint development zone (JDZ)
with Nigeria in April 2003 and for analyzing the bids subsequently received during October 2003-April
2004; (iii) a kernel of the National Petroleum Agency (NPA) is already active, and has received technical
assistance and funding and engaged an international expert to help the Sao Tomeans fully develop the NPA
in its sectoral supervisory and analytical capacities; (iv) technical assistance was provided to the
government which is developing a petroleum revenue management law. The law is expected to be
submitted to the National Assembly in June 2004. The government has also passed a decree law officially
creating the NPA in January 2004. The decree law is to be promulgated by the President shortly. The
government and the Presidency have also publicized their desire for transparency, by announcing that they
are interested in signing up to the "Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative" (EITI). The Bank is
supporting this transparency effort.
The new project will continue critical technical assistance and capacity building in this nascent sector. It
will build an institutional and legal framework to formulate policies, and supervise and regulate the
petroleum sector. This will entail: (i) strengthening of the National Petroleum Agency in material and
human capacity terms (develop agency structure, hire appropriate staff, equip agency, adopt a training
program and the like); (ii) strengthening of the legal framework, including sector related environmental
issues; (iii) help the government in preparing and promoting the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the
country (iv) setting up a functional information system that is transparent; (v) undertaking studies and
seminars that would help the govermnent develop an economic model of the EEZ, study the opportunities
for local content in the sector development, and study the opportunities for job creation.
II.    Component II: In public finance
The project will assist the government to improve public finance management (expenditure and revenue
sides) in light of the future petroleum era. Many of the actions proposed for this component are
recommendations from the analytical and technical assistance work undertaken since 2002 in the
framework of the PRMC/PRMC-TA and the 2001-2003 HIPC-AAP analyses. The specific actions to
improve budgetary process (harmonization of budget nomenclature; identification of expenditures for
poverty reduction, development and adoption of a new accounting framework) were identified in the HIPC-
AAP December 2003 report and the output/outcome indicators from HIPC-AAP have been adopted to
assess developments in the context of this component properly. Also, the government and the World Bank
team identified other actions to improve governance and transparence of public and private financial
dealings. To start with, the Govermnent wishes to have assistance to develop a macro-economic model to
help improve formulation of economic policies. On the expenditure side, the actions to be taken are
summarized under the following headings: (i) strengthen petroleum revenue management supervision
across national institutions (government, Central Bank, National Assembly, Tribunal Des Comptes); (ii)
harmonize budget nomenclatures and identify expenditures for poverty reduction; (iii) update the public
procurement, and treasury and public patrimony laws and procedures; (iv) install a simple Information
System among specific government entities in the country as deemed necessary to facilitate the PEM; (v)
improve budget oversight and public finance management training; (vi) develop and implement an
accounting framework (cadre comptable) and accounting plan (plan comptable). On the revenue side, the
Government wishes to: (i) improve accounting and tax reporting practices of enterprises; and (ii)
increase MoPF capacity to collect tax revenue.
III.   Component III: PRSP
The new credit will help facilitate the implementation of the PRSP goals. The credit will support this effort
by helping (i) facilitate the implementation of the PRSP by supporting the directorate to become functional
- capable to fully supervise and follow-up on the implementation of the PRSP goals, with regular provision
of indicators; and (ii) update the PRSP document with analysis and forecasts and a strategy for the
petroleum economy (revenues and expenditures) and adopting the updated PRSP.
