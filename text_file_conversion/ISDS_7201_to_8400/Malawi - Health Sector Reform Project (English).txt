A. 2  Project Objectives 
 
Development Objective:
 
As noted, the overall objective of the government’s SWAp program for 
the sector is to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and equity of the essential health care 
delivery system in Malawi.  Within this general context, three key aspects of the sector stand out 
as requiring particular attention if the SWAp is to succeed.  These are:  a) human resources, 
where there is a danger of the human resource situation slipping into an emergency crisis if 
substantial steps are not taken, b) ensuring the provision of the essential package of services – the 
minimum required – throughout the country, and c) strengthening the support and referral 
systems relevant to this package of services. 
Principal outputs and outcomes: 
 The principal outputs expected are:  (a) Improved availability 
of quality health care and EHP for the poor and vulnerable populations; (b) Improved human 
resources, especially skilled personnel; (c) Strengthened health systems through equitable health 
financing, increased human resources, reliable pharmaceutical and supplies logistics and effective 
monitoring and evaluation; (d) Enhanced capacity of MOH for stewardship and policy 
development; (e) Strengthened District Health Management systems for planning, budgeting and 
delivery of  quality health services; and (f) Community participation in the delivery of essential 
health interventions. 
It is anticipated that these outputs would contribute to the ultimate goal of the health sector in 
Malawi, which is to address the three MDGs of reducing child mortality, improving maternal 
health and - linking with MASAF - contribute to the reduction of poverty by protecting the 
poorest and the vulnerable from economic loss due to ill health and disability.  The project would 
also contribute to the achievement of a fourth MDGs 
-
that of combating HIV/AIDS 
-
by
working 
Page  2
in concert with the Bank’s MAP project grant (P073821) and related initiatives, such as the 
support being provided by the Global Fund. 
 
Agreed upon outcome indicators for assessing the long-term impact of the HSSP are as follows 
(to be measured in aggregate and disaggregated by income, gender and geography): 
 
x
Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) 
x
Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) 
x
Contraceptive Prevalence Rate/Total Fertility Rate (CPR/TFR) 
x
Prevalence of HIV in Ante-Natal Clinic Clients and among the youth 
x
%
of low birth weight (LBW) newborns 
 
The following output indicators are proposed to monitor the Bank project components: 
 
·
Overall: Proportion of GOM budget allocated to/received by the health sector at the 
national and district levels; Trends in per capita government allocations to the health sector; 
%
of health facilities with ability to effectively provide EHP; Proportion of population 
within easy reach of EHP. 
 
·
Delivery of EHP:  % facilities without 7-day stockouts of essential EHP drugs; % fully 
immunized at 1year; % births attended by skilled attendant; TB cure rates. 
 
·
Human Resource and Management: Comprehensive HRM plan; % facilities with minimum 
staffing norms; % established positions filled; % new graduates from training colleges 
employed in the health sector in Malawi. 
 
·
Health Support and Referral Systems:  % facilities offering EmOC ; Proportion of MOH 
budget allocated to districts; Proportion of budget allocated to health centers; % facilities 
regularly supervised by DHMT; No. of VHCs established and functioning as evidence of 
community participation in delivery of EHP. 
 
Poverty focus:
 
Delivery of the EHP to each citizen is at the core of the Government of Malawi’s 
health strategy and therefore of the SWAp. Consistent with international best practice, the EHP 
targets the most important health problems of the poor. It fits within the policy and strategy 
framework contained in the National Health Plan, the “Vision 2020” document, and the Malawi 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).  Importantly, while the objectives of these policy 
documents are relatively broad, they do include the intention to adapt the MOH’s role to that of 
“steward” of the sector rather than direct service provider, in the context of decentralization. 
 
Efficient and equitable access:
 
The design of the EHP as both a rationing and targeting strategy 
for health interventions provides an opportunity for the efficient and equitable utilization of 
health resources.  Furthermore, it is possible to identify a poverty-focused hierarchy of objectives 
in the national policy and strategies.  Thus, 
improved access to, and quantity, quality and cost-
effectiveness of EHP-related services 
contributes to 
improved health status for all Malawians
,
which in turn supports 
sustainable reduction in poverty 
 –
where the italics are national objectives 
as expressed in GOM’s own wording.  This structure is explicitly focused on poverty reduction 
and equity.    
 
Relevance to objectives of CAS, Bank HNP strategy, and Africa HNP Strategic Priorities: 
 The 
Bank
’s 2003 Malawi Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), building on the PRSP, makes improved 
Page  3
health status in Malawi a priority for poverty reduction.  The CAS identified the need for renewed 
engagement of the Bank in the health sector and provided for a US$15 million IDA grant to 
support a new health project, supported by a modest allocation for analytical work.  The project, 
as described below, is also in conformity with the Bank’s Health, Nutrition and Population (HNP) 
strategy and the HNP Strategic Priorities outlined by the African region.   
A.3.  Project Description 
 
The HSSP is expected to achieve the stated development objective over the next three years and, 
based on the foregoing, would strategically have three components, exclusively drawn from the 
PoW
1
:
(a) Support extension of quality health care coverage through delivery of EHP; (b) 
Support human resource development and management; and (c) Strengthen health sector 
support and referral systems
 (see details in Annex 4). In order to maximize its impact, every 
effort will also be made to strengthen the linkages of the HSSP (and the broader SWAp) with the 
ongoing Bank-supported HIV/AIDS program (through the Malawi MAP) and MASAF project. 
 
During the first year of the HSSP, a gradual build up of the joint PoW is expected and the usual 
problems of transition envisaged as the EHP concept is rolled out.  Year two would be used to 
remedy any deficiencies and shortcomings observed during the first year leading to the all 
important Mid-term review (MTR).  The recommendations of the MTR, which shall include 
assessment of the progress against performance indicators, would be used to consolidate the gains 
and ensure that the project is on course during the second half of its life.  
 
Component 1 - Delivery of the EHP:
 
The objective of this component is to improve the health 
status of the Malawian population by increasing access to quality essential health services.  The 
main mechanism for delivering quality care would be by making the already-defined EHP 
accessible to all, but especially in the most rural and disadvantaged districts and to the poorest 
and vulnerable populations.  The component would support community sensitization and 
mobilization as well as establishment of standards and packages of care to be delivered at each 
level – community, health center, district and central hospitals.  In addition, the component will 
also support in-service update of health worker and management skills as a way of improving 
staff performance and strengthening service provision.  Efficient logistics and sustained 
availability of pharmaceuticals, medical and laboratory equipment and supplies, so critical for 
effective delivery of the EHP will also be supported by this component.  The EHP will be 
introduced in an incremental manner by adapting and strengthening existing services to co-opt the 
EHP concept.  It is understood that infrastructural improvement (in the form of rehabilitation, 
refurbishment, etc.) will be needed  to ensure that all health facilities can support the delivery of 
the EHP; however, it is not the intention of this component to rapidly expand the infrastructure 
through the construction of new freestanding health facilities.  Instead, the emphasis will be on 
balancing infrastructural development with ensuring the availability of, 
inter alia
,
adequate staff, 
equipment and supplies. 
 
Component 2 - Human Resources Development and Management:
 
The major thrust of this 
component, in the short term, is on increasing the number of staff available through continuation 
of 
the six
-
year emergency training plan, a concerted recruitment campaign, financing and then 
1
The six programs of the six-year PoW, which are largely focused on inputs, have been re-aggregated to a 
different presentation which links inputs more closely to the activities, i.e. the delivery of the essential 
health package, human resources development, and support systems. This re-aggregation does not affect 
the integrity of the PoW. 
Page  4
filling current vacancies, the use of volunteers and contract staff and other stop-gap staffing 
strategies.  The component will look comprehensively at the government and the NGO sectors.  
Greater attraction and retention of staff will be achieved by ensuring salaries are paid promptly 
and in full and by increasing the overall remuneration package, though interim measures may be 
required.  In addition, effective implementation of the existing measures for effective HR 
management will be ensured.  Personnel policies will be reviewed to improve working 
conditions.  Staff will be used more effectively by matching posts to workload, developing 
performance management systems and by streamlining the provision of in-service training.  
Support systems will be improved including HR information systems, HR planning (including 
coordination with training institutes), and a review of the current structures managing the HR 
systems.  Technical assistance will be needed to support the strengthening of the HR systems.  
Longer-term Human Resources (HR) strategies include the development of improved career 
structures, and improving recruitment and deployment systems. 
 
Component 3 - Health Sector Support and Referral Systems: 
 
The objective of this component 
is to improve the effectiveness  and  efficiency of both the health system and the referral network 
to support delivery of the EHP.  It will be divided into two subcomponents: 
 (a) Support for 
central operations
 and, 
(b) Support to district operations
.
Greater emphasis will be placed on 
support to operations at district and lower levels.  
 
The sub-component for central operations will strengthen institutional processes aimed at 
enhancing central support to implement the SWAp in delivery of the EHP and for the 
decentralization of the health sector.  The aim is to put in place the policies, coordination and 
regulatory frameworks, organizational structures, procurement and financial instruments, training 
programs, and information, monitoring and evaluation systems that would enable the MOH to 
effectively steward the PoW.  The central operations would focus on managing the process of 
decentralization and be geared towards effective support of the devolved district health system.  
Specific output areas for the subcomponent include:  (i) Policies and planning systems to support 
EHP; (ii) Health financing and financial management systems; (iii) Procurement policy and 
logistical system for drugs, equipment and supplies; (iv) Equitable distribution of financial and 
human resources; (v) Development of standards and quality assurance systems; (vi) Supervision, 
including Zonal support; and (vii) Health information systems for monitoring and evaluation. 
 
The sub-component on district operations in the devolved health system will strengthen 
coordination and planning to ensure uninterrupted availability and maintenance of adequate 
financial, material and human resources to deliver effectively the EHP in the districts for both 
MOH and NGO services.  Specific output areas include:  (i) orientation of staff and other 
stakeholders on SWAp and the concept of EHP; (ii) Timely preparation of high quality District 
Implementation Plans (DIPS); (iii) Financial management; (iv) Procurement, storage and 
distribution of adequate drugs equipment and supplies; (v) Effective communication and referral 
framework; (vi) Effective execution of other routine operations by DHMTs; (vii) Strengthening 
community participation and delivery of EHP, including intersectoral linkages; (viii) Effective 
linkages with MASAF; and (ix) Quality technical advice to District Assemblies.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Potential environmental and social concerns are limited to two areas: (a) the management of 
medical waste and (b) the construction and rehabilitation of health care facilities. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
No indirect and/or long term impacts anticipated. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
In light of the project's objectives, a discussion of alternatives was not relevant. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
It was agreed with the GOM that an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 
and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were best suited to identify and mitigate potential 
impacts of the SWAp, because the exact number and locations of the new health centers are not 
known at this time.  The ESMF constitutes an environmental and social screening process which 
will be implemented at the time the construction and rehabilitation activities are planned.  The 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  6
ESMF includes Malawi's Medical Waste Management Plan as an annex to ensure that the 
appropriate measures in this regard are taken at the new and rehabilitated health centers.  The 
draft ESMF and the draft RPF have been disclosed in Malawi on June 10, 2004, and at the Bank's 
Infoshop on June 15, 2004. The final versions of these safeguard documents have been disclosed 
in Malawi on October 27, 2004, and at the Bank's Infoshop on November 15, 2004, thus 
replacing the earlier drafts. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Stakeholders include MOH, private and public service providers, development partners (donors), 
parliamentary committees (in their oversight role), district officials (health management teams), 
VHCs, civil society representatives (non-service providers) and poor people.   
 
During SWAp preparation, in collaboration with the MOH, information was shared and 
consultations were carried out with other stakeholders through one day stakeholder workshop 
(September 2003) on the SWAp objectives, approach and implementation plan.  In addition, the 
stakeholders were consulted through the above listed series of participatory studies, namely the: 
(i) Malawi: Poverty Reduction Strategy; (ii) Malawi: Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy;  and 
(iii) Health Sector Wide Approach Situational Analysis 
 
During implementation of SWAp, in collaboration with the MOH, participation of other 
stakeholders will be facilitated by periodic stakeholder workshops and other participatory 
mechanisms such as beneficiary impact assessments to share information and support 
consultative processes.  The beneficiary impact assessment, to be undertaken during the early 
stages of implementation will help to develop an integrated strategy to address social impacts of 
the proposed SWAp and to create a framework to incorporate participation of various categories 
of stakeholders during the following stages of SWAp cycle.  
 
As part of implementation, it is also envisaged that 
citizen report cards
 will be used as one of the 
monitoring techniques aimed at mainstreaming the established rigor of participation of the 
stakeholders within the monitoring and evaluation process.  These report cards will collect the 
views of male and female beneficiaries with regards to the quality, efficiency and adequacy of the 
programs.  The insights derived from report cards, provide information whether the issues raised 
are continuously addressed, services are reaching the target populations, the extent of leakages 
and factors that contribute to such misdirection of resources and services.  
 
The safeguard documents were prepared in consultation with various stakeholders, including 
communities and the general public; field visits, feasibility studies and other technical 
assessments were also undertaken.  They have been disclosed in-country in locations accessible to 
the affected population.
