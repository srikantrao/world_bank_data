A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project objectives are to support the efforts of the Government of Sri Lanka to: 
(i) 
Reduce the immediate suffering resulting from the effects of the tsunami and restore 
livelihoods destroyed by the tsunami; 
(ii) 
Restore basic services to the population; and 
(iii)  
Start the recovery and reconstruction process. 
A.3. Project Description 
The areas most urgently in need of financing have been identified.  However, the 
indicated amounts at this stage are notional, and the financing available for different 
sectors is changing every day.  IDA, along with ADB, stands as an agency ready to be 
flexible about the areas of need that we finance, since our primary concern is that the 
overall needs should be met, and met on the most favorable terms possible.  The notional 
allocations will be reviewed regularly with the GOSL and adapted to the changing 
financing pattern.  Thus, although notional allocations are indicated, IDA resources 
would be available to address any of the needs described in the Needs and Damage 
Assessment.  Based on current analysis, the likely project sub-components are:  
 
Component 1: Livelihood Support (US$30 million).  
Addressing the objective of 
rebuilding
 livelihoods 
and 
reviving
 the local economies of affected areas necessitates a multi-pronged approach that rebuilds 
assets to generate income and employment and at the same time protects the most vulnerable members of 
the community.  
The first sub-component
 
–
namely, pure cash transfers – will focus on the most vulnerable 
(defined in the first phase as all who are displaced or have lost their main earning family member) who 
Page  2
have lost their capacity to earn a livelihood.  These two sub-components will be carried out in a coordinated 
fashion, since both programs are a form of direct income support to affected communities. 
The second sub-
component
 
–
namely, public works to build community infrastructure – is intended to provide income to 
those who are able and willing to work, but are unable to find employment in affected areas. The 
third sub-
component
–
financial support to micro-enterprises – would provide resources to tsunami-affected self-
employed and family businesses, helping them to resume their operations interrupted by the disaster. 
 
Component 2: Housing
 (US$25 million).  This component will have three sub-
components: (i) housing support cash grants for reconstruction; (ii) capacity building that 
will include training of construction workers, the design and implementation of a 
communications initiative, establishment of a grievance redressal mechanism at the local, 
divisional and district levels, land-related management, and, social and environmental 
monitoring; and (iii) technical assistance. 
 
Component 3: Roads and Infrastructure
 (US$8 million).  This component would finance the 
repair/reconstruction of priority infrastructure systems – including roads and water supply.   
 
Component 4: Health
 (US$6 million).  This component consists of three sub-
components: (i) strengthening existing undamaged health care delivery services; (ii) 
supporting additional preventive, promotive and rehabilitative health needs; and (iii) 
repair, reconstruction and re-equipping partially or fully damaged institutions. 
 
Component 5: Education 
(US$2 million).  This component would assist the GOSL to 
rebuild, equip and upgrade the quality of schools affected by the tsunami either through 
damage caused by the tidal waves or through their use as shelters for displaced persons.    
 
Component 6: Support for Implementation Capacity Building
 (US$4 million). This 
component would include: (i) the provision of human resources and consultancy inputs at 
the central, provincial and district levels; (ii) a continuous social impact assessment; (iii) 
the design and delivery of training programs for district administrators on financial 
management and streamlined implementation processes; (iv) the provision of information 
technology connectivity and the establishment of management information systems 
(MIS); and (v) the supply of basic office supplies and infrastructure and urgently needed.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Recognizing the emergency nature of the proposed recovery and reconstruction operations and the related 
need for providing immediate assistance, while also ensuring due diligence in managing potential 
environmental and social risks, an Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework 
(ESSAF) has been prepared since detailed sub-projects have not been identified as yet.  The ESSAF has 
been developed to ensure compliance with the World Bank’s safeguard policies under current conditions in 
Sri Lanka and is applicable to Phase I and Phase II of the Tsunami Emergency Recovery Program.  The 
intention of this framework is to: (i) prevent the execution of sub-project that might cause significant and 
irreversible negative impacts; (ii) decrease or manage potential adverse impacts through modifications to 
sub-project design, location or execution; (iii) prevent or mitigate cumulative impacts of small scale 
investments; (iv) enhance positive environmental and social impacts of sub-projects; and (v) prevent 
additional stress on environmentally sensitive areas.  
 
The ESSAF includes: (a) tools for screening of sub-projects, including negative lists of 
characteristics that would preclude project funding for these activities; (b) screening, 
assessment and clearance procedures; (c) capacity building to ensure effective 
implementation of the ESSAF at the various implementation levels; and (d) requirements 
of supervision of implementation, monitoring of environmental and social conditions, and 
independent audits of performance. Given the nature of proposed project activities, no 
significant adverse cumulative impacts are anticipated. Any potential cumulative impacts 
would be recognized by detailed monitoring that would be carried out to monitor any 
potential concerns and changing conditions, especially in the initial set of activities to 
evaluate the impacts and design any additional mitigation measures. 
 
Indigenous People and Minorities
:
While OD 4.20 does apply to a number of reasonably 
well-defined groups in the interior, the issue of ethnic and religious affiliation is a larger 
factor in determining vulnerability at the national and local levels. Special attention 
should be paid to avoid confounding inter-group conflict and animosities. Sub-project 
preparation will assess the vulnerability of different ethnic and religious groups in 
particular project contexts (in terms of potential exclusion from project benefits, negative 
project impacts, and the need for specific culturally compatible mechanisms for 
participation), and will incorporate adequate measures to address such vulnerability in 
project design.  
 
Land ownership and land acquisition
:
The need for involuntary resettlement or land 
acquisition in specific sub-project areas will only be known during project 
implementation and sub-projects will be screened for applicability of the resettlement 
policy. In view of the emergency nature of the operations, IDA will, in applicable 
instances, require a draft resettlement plan
 
within two months of the identification of sub-
projects and implement the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in advance of sub-project 
implementation.  
 
Archeological and historical sites, incl. unrecorded graveyards and burial sites
:
No 
Page  5
direct impact on
 
archeological, burial or historical sites are expected.  The project 
includes a list of negative sub-project attributes that will render sub-projects ineligible for 
support under the proposed emergency reconstruction operations. However, the project 
will institute “chance find” procedures to ensure protection of such sites if found when 
opening borrow pits and material sites. 
 
Political Sensitivity
:
The multiple conflicts which have plagued Sri Lanka over the last 
decades makes it urgent to ensure equity between regions and ethnic groups to avoid 
resumption of armed conflict. The operation will adopt an inclusive and decentralized 
decision-making process and design a risk mitigation plan and exit strategy.  Many 
communities in the North East are both conflict and tsunami-affected, but there is a risk 
of resources and attention being diverted from the on-going support required for the non-
tsunami, conflict-affected communities. Therefore, it will be necessary to ensure that 
post-conflict reconstruction efforts continue concurrently. 
 
Local Employment
:
Employment opportunities within the projects will be available on 
the basis of equal opportunity and professional competence, irrespective of gender or 
ethnic or religious group. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
It is not anticipated that there will be any potential long term impacts due to 
reconstruction activities since the developments already existed prior to the tsunami, and 
the project will be financing reconstruction activities.  Indirect impacts may arise due to 
the demand for raw material for construction activities, particularly with regard to sand 
and timber for reconstruction.  The ESSAF has provisions for analysis of any potential 
indirect or long term adverse impacts and for taking necessary mitigation measures to 
ensure minimal impacts.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
All sub-projects will be subject to an environmental screening at an appropriate level of 
assessment based on the ESSAF.  The screening process will distinguish sub-projects 
requiring a environmental review and the implementation of a code of practice with 
standard mitigation measures that are referenced ESSAF and more detailed 
environmental assessments if the environmental impacts are significant.  The latter 
category of sub-projects are not largely expected to emerge under the project, if they do, 
then these will be subjected to an environmental assessment using technical expertise 
available under the project.  These sub-projects will undergo an analysis of alternatives as 
required under standard EIA practice. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Governments environmental clearance process, in principle, is consistent with World Bank safeguard 
and public disclosure requirements.  The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) will ensure that the 
implementing agencies of sub-projects will adhere to the Environmental and Social Screening and 
Assessment Framework (ESSAF), which has been agreed with IDA.  The CEA will be responsible for the 
Page  6
Government review and clearance of the ESSAF.  Although the GOSL’s clearance procedure is adequate, 
IDA will still review a samples of the EA/EMPs prepared under each sub-component and provide 
necessary concurrence for the approval of disbursements of funds. 
 
The Government plans to transform the current Task Force to Rebuild the Nation into a 
Statutory Authority (ARN).  This Authority would be the policy formulation and 
regulatory institution for all future disaster risk mitigation and response activities.  As a 
policy, this Authority will require the ESSAF to be adopted by all implementing 
agencies.  Reconstruction efforts in each district will be overseen by District Task Forces.  
Each District Task Force (9 districts) will be supported by full time Environmental and 
Social Specialists whose main responsibility will be to ensure sub-project adhere to 
conditions of the ESSAF.  Technical Assistance will be provided under the project for 
training of environmental and social development specialists, as required.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The ESSAF requires consultation with the tsunami affected community, government 
officials/agencies and NGO’s as well as local communities during the preparation of 
EAs.  Once the sub-project specific EAs are conducted, it will be placed for public 
consultation at the affected Divisional Secretariat Office.  A continuous social impact 
assessment (CSIA) will facilitate the articulation of community perceptions, grievances 
and feed-back vis-à-vis identification of beneficiaries for the housing and livelihood 
components and the mobilization of resources. Through direct interaction with 
beneficiary communities it will carry out an independent evaluation of program 
implementation and distribution of program benefits.
