B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The key objective is to improve the business environment in the Kyrgyz Republic and enhance 
competitiveness of the en
terprise sector.   The project’s expected outcomes would include: 
·
Improvements in testing and metrology services; 
·
Improvements in ISO certification for industry through implementation of technical regulation 
reform;  
·
Reductions in administrative and bureaucratic hurdles that impose a cost on enterprises and the 
business sector overall through implementation of a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) system; 
·
Elimination or reduction of duplicative functions of inspection and regulatory agencies through 
restructuring and streamlining of activities;  
·
Improvements in transparency and reduction of uncertainty in the application of business 
regulations, through increasing accountability for introducing regulatory acts/legislation, thus 
reducing opportunities for arbitrary decision making, rent seeking and corruption. 
 
Primary beneficiaries of the project would be the business sector, especially small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs).  The MEDIT and the NISM are also expected to be major beneficiaries. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
 
The project activities have not yet been defined but the project is expected to provide technical assistance 
and investment resources to support the development and implementation of the Government’s agenda for 
improving the environment for investment and PSD in two areas:  
(i) 
Enhancing quality standards for improving the competitiveness of Kyrgyz businesses (estimated 
$3.6 million):  
helping to refine and implement the Government’s program to reform the 
technical regulation system (metrology, testing, standards, quality – MTSQ), through a multi-
Page  2
pronged approach to ensure consistency in implementation of the reforms.  The project would 
support the development of the institutional structures needed to implement the Technical 
Regulation Law, and could include: assistance in developing the appropriate policies and 
procedures for accreditation, testing and certification; development of the newly structured 
NISM to help local producers meet national and international quality standards; and 
formulation and implementation of a strategy to privatize the certification and testing 
functions.  In addition, it could include assistance in: establishing and maintaining a 
repository of international standards applicable to the Kyrgyz environment; improving 
sources for and dissemination of information on quality standards; and assessing the 
feasibility of developing a national metrology institute.  Opportunities would also be explored 
for regional and multinational cooperation, such as accepting international accreditation and 
conformity assessment procedures, or supporting development of a regional arrangement for 
policies on standards, metrology and certification. 
 
(ii) 
Streamlining and enforcement of business regulations (estimated $1.2 million):
 
supporting the 
institutionalization and roll out of a system to assess the impact of regulatory acts on the 
private sector.  The use of RIA would provide the means to assess whether draft legislation is 
in compliance with existing legislation and whether it could have a negative impact on the 
economy.  The same process could also be applied to existing legislation. An effective RIA 
system would rationalize procedures and contribute to reducing opportunities for arbitrary 
decision-making and rent seeking. The project could include capacity building for the 
establishment and operation of an oversight body that would be responsible for enforcement 
and monitoring of the program; training for regulators to implement the system; capacity 
building and training for various government institutions; outreach and dissemination 
activities; and establishment and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system.   
 
Project administration and management support would also be provided (
estimated $0.2 million)
.
Main institution
s
involved: Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), MEDIT, Ministry of Justice, NISM.   
Alternative Approaches.
 
A
combined financial and business sector operation had previously been 
envisaged.  This included direct support to entrepreneurs and enterprise managers to improve governance 
and management practices, and a line of credit.  In 2003 a decision was made to proceed with separate 
projects and to narrow the focus of the business sector operation.  Thus, the project has been limited to 
developing a proper regulatory/ administrative framework and adequate institutional capacity to support 
the growth of a dynamic business sector, both identified as major constraints to PSD.  This has the 
advantage of keeping the project simple and focused, and likely to have a broader positive impact on the 
business community as a whole.  Consideration was also given to a LIL but the nature of the proposed 
project does not lend itself to this approach as it is neither a pilot nor an experimental-type operation that 
would lead to a larger-scale intervention.  Finally, at the Government’s request, the possibility of 
accessing the IDA Grant Facility was also explored but these funds are available only for the social 
sectors.  Alternative grant funding is not available on the scale needed for the proposed operation.   
Possible Partnerships and Co-financing.  
The team is exploring opportunities for cofinancing, 
especially with USAID, as well as collaboration with local business organizations.
