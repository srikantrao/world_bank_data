A.2. Project Objectives 
The project aims to bring together donors and lenders to help GON implement its 
National Education Policy, including the Education For All (EFA) goals. Project 
objectives aim to: a) increase enrollment for Primary and Secondary education; b) 
improve quality and relevance of learning; c) improve systems of governance and 
accountability, including measures to strengthen community participation in the 
education sector; and d) harmonize donor assistance in the sector.  
 
Page  3
 
 
It is expected that by project completion, the number of children who enroll and stay on 
in school would increase; there would also be an improvement in the quality and 
relevance of the learning acquired throughout the educational system, and the school 
autonomy program would have been applied throughout the educational system, with 
local communities playing a central role in making providers accountable for the quality 
of results. As education plays such a central role in the productive capacity of an 
economy and in improving social equity, the project would make an important 
contribution to the goals of economic growth and poverty reduction. Progress would be 
measured through the audited enrollment and attendance figures of schools and test 
scores from standardized national assessments of students in Spanish and Mathematics. 
Progress would also be measured by the execution of the CWP of the education sector 
with donor financing and the extent of the integration of the CWP with the budget for the 
education sector. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
Component 1: Strengthening the Ministry of Education Stewardship Capacity 
 
The sector assessment has indicated the imperative to improve governance and accountability in the 
education sector. The task of improving governance and accountability would be sought simultaneously at 
the three nodes of the educational system, at the central, municipal, and school levels. 
 
Sub-component 1.1: Stewardship at the Central Level (US$1.8 million): At the central level, the project 
would seek to have a more professional functioning of the MECD, with a process of rationalization of the 
structures and internal processes. This would be achieved by: a) a strengthening of the policy making, 
planning and budget formulation process of MECD, at the same time that there is a clear definition of the 
roles and responsibilities of the central, municipal, and local levels of the educational system; b) a 
professionalization of the civil service, so that the jobs of MECD officials are clearly defined, and hiring, 
promotion and firing decisions are made on the basis of merit rather than the personal connections of 
individual officials; and c) sequenced process of reducing the size of the central unit of MECD as functions 
are handed over to municipalities and autonomous schools. It is very difficult to imagine that any of the 
project objectives would be met if the three measures mentioned above were not seriously implemented. 
 
Sub-component 1.2: Stewardship at the Municipal Level (US$ 0.9 million): This subcomponent would seek 
to ensure that donor financing for municipal level interventions should go beyond the financing of inputs 
for municipal governments, and lead to the improvement in the quality of educational service provision for 
the poor. Special attention would be paid to the strengthening of municipal capacities to provide 
administrative and pedagogical support to schools. The objective of this sub-component would be met by 
the requirement of signed performance agreements between MECD and the municipalities in the 
municipalities where PASEN would be providing financing for implementation of the school autonomy 
program. These performance agreements would require the municipality to utilize its superior local 
knowledge to commit itself to helping the schools meet the educational goals of coverage and quality.  
 
Component 2: Program Monitoring, Evaluation, and Continuous Auditing Systems 
 
The monitoring and evaluation function of MECD is currently weak, and the lack of accurate and timely 
information about the learning of students constitutes a significant part of the constraint regarding 
accountability. It is of vital interest to civil society in Nicaragua to be well informed about the quality of 
education being provided with the use of scarce public resources. Within the framework of the CWP, the 
strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation function requires even greater attention. With significant 
amount of resources being managed at decentralized municipal and local levels on the basis of per-capita 
financing of students, a rigorous process of continuous auditing of student and enrollment would aid in the 
process of setting municipal and school level targets and reduce the risk of misallocation of resources 
because of faulty data. 
Page  4
 
 
 
Sub-component 2.1: Compilation, Analysis and Dissemination of Educational Statistics (US$ 0.8 million): 
A key lesson from the previous project has been that the financing of computers and an odd consultancy 
assignment here and there does not lead to a sustainable installment of institutional capacity. We would 
include disbursement conditions for the strengthening of the educational statistical unit of MECD, and 
further financing would be conditional on the preparation and dissemination of agreed educational 
indicators in specifically determined outputs.  
 
Subcomponent 2.2: Evaluation of Competencies in Spanish and Mathematics for Primary 
and Secondary School students (US$ 3.3 million): There has been a considerable 
reluctance regarding student testing in the past, which is understandable because the one 
instance that standardized testing was carried out (in 2002), the outcome was very poor 
results in terms of basic competencies of students in Spanish and Mathematics. There is 
now an understanding with MECD that it is a desirable policy goal to have a sound 
strategy of evaluation included in the government’s CWP. This understanding is aided by 
the growing concern of donors to see their aid being used to provide successful outcomes. 
In the case of aid for education, the objective is to improve the learning achievement of 
students, especially those from disadvantage backgrounds, because a good quality of 
education provides a pathway out of poverty. 
 
Component 3: Implementation of the School Autonomy Program (US$ 8.2 million) 
 
Nicaragua has an established program of school autonomy that transfers resources directly to schools, to be 
managed by an elected school council and a principal accountable to the local community. The 
empowerment of the community in the administration of the school provides tremendous benefits in terms 
of service provision that have been well researched and documented in Nicaragua as well as in a number of 
other countries.  Centrally planned and administered schools suffer from problems regarding the 
asymmetry of information between the central authorities and the effort made by frontline providers. 
Oversight by the beneficiaries of the school provides a means to overcome this barrier of asymmetry. 
Locally managed schools are also more responsive to diversified local contexts of schools. In addition to 
financing, central authorities need to continue providing support and guidance to schools, such as through 
the standardized evaluation of student learning and capacity building and pedagogical assistance to schools. 
 
The international donor community has long recognized the importance of Nicaragua’s school autonomy 
reform, and the  HIPC completion point for Nicaragua required the passage of a school autonomy law. The 
Law of the Regime of Participative Education was passed in 2002 after a long period of debate that allowed 
for stakeholder inclusion in formalizing various ad hoc norms and regulations being used in the past. A 
non-discretionary, formula based per-capita financing mechanism for schools provides incentives for 
frontline providers to enroll more children in school, which is an important policy instrument for a country 
where significant numbers of children are excluded from the educational system. The ongoing PRSC 
provides further support to the school autonomy reform, by supporting a full implementation of the law.  
 
In practice, the government has faced huge problems in financing the increased enrollment in autonomous 
schools. The fiscal restrictions have caused the powerful incentive mechanism of formula financing to 
become a disincentive to schools to enroll more students.  Schools, in the face of continued arrears and 
indebtedness from MECD, find it better not
 to enroll more students.  Meanwhile, there has been 
considerable investment by the government in setting up the basic administrative procedures to run 
autonomous schools and in the training of school communities to successfully run the schools. The 
Government has recently launched a process of municipalization of administrative functions that would 
provide more timely and efficient assistance to autonomous schools, and has committed to the conversion 
of the remaining centrally managed schools to autonomous schools by the year 2006, as required by the 
law. 
 
In view of the context 
p
resented above, the 
p
ro
j
ect would directl
y
 tackle one of the main constraints to 
Page  5
 
 
educational results in Nicaragua, by providing financing for the implementation of the autonomy program. 
The government budget for each year is committed to providing resources for school transfers on the basis 
of last year’s budget (an amount of approximately 65 Córdobas per student per month or US$ 4.20 per 
student per month). However, currently there is no budget provision nor external financing available for the 
new students that would enroll in the autonomous schools. The project would help fill this important gap in 
the CWP that has far ranging systemic ramifications about the contribution of education to economic 
growth and poverty reduction. 
 
Two types of financing would be provided by the project:- a) financing of the capitation transfer for the 
increment in the effective enrollment of the school; and b) financing for the incorporation of  1800 schools 
into the autonomy regime in the year 2006. As a link to strengthen the municipalization component of the 
decentralization policy of government, for transfers to be made to autonomous schools in decentralized 
municipalities, there would need to be a performance agreement signed between MECD and the 
municipality. The current Law 413 specifies the respective responsibilities of the autonomous schools, and 
the Decree 46-2002 provides the regulatory norms for the implementation of the said law.  
 
 
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project will support autonomous schools throughout the country, including 
indigenous areas on Nicaragua’s Atlantic Coast.  The Indigenous Peoples Development 
Plan developed for this project underlines activities to be financed under the project. This 
plan will be agreed with the GON, donors and stakeholders during the appraisal mission.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project does not finance any construction activity and there are no environmental 
safeguard issues. The improvement in educational outcomes that is the objective of the 
project does have eventual positive implications regarding the environment because of 
the beneficial impact of education on poverty reduction, and also by the value of 
education in generating environmental awareness amongst the children who would grow 
up to be better educated adults. 
 
The project also supports the stewardship role of the MECD to pursue decentralization of 
the administrative and pedagogical functions to the Autonomous Regions of RAAN and 
RAAS on the Atlantic Coast. The plan includes the implementation of the Regional 
Autonomous Education System (SEAR) starting in 2004. Annex No. 10 provides a social 
assessment of the status of intercultural education (indigenous, Afro-Caribbean and 
mestizo
) on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua in light of the NDP agreed by the Regional 
Autonomous Government (its Education Councils), the Central Government, and the 
International Cooperation. The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) concludes 
with an indicative Participation Plan to be implemented in the framework of the SWAp. 
 
Parallel to the above effort, the Government has committed to continue to support the 
strategy for improving culturally adequate educational services to ethnic minorities 
promoted mostly under the IPDP of IDA-financed Second Basic Education Project 
(2000-2004), by the Government of Finland (FOREIBCA), and by the European Union. 
Those services include on-the-job teacher training programs, capacity building for 
principals and autonomous school councils, and the review, editing and distribution of 
bilingual texts and materials in Miskito, Sumu/ Mayangna, and Creole English to schools 
on the Atlantic Coast and Jinotega 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
None have been identified. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A social assessment was carried out between March 20 and April 20, 2004. It included 
informed consultations with the Regional Autonomous Education Councils of the North 
and South Atlantic Autonomous Regions (RAAN and RAAS), the Intercultural Bilingual

 at the central level and in 
Page  7
 
 
RAAN, the National Preschool and Primary Education Directorates, and the RAAN 
MECD Delegation. Consultations were also carried out with the international donors, i.e. 
Government of Finland financing the Intercultural Bilingual Project for the Atlantic 
Coast (FOREIBCA); and the European Union (Euros 7.8 million) contributing to the 
SWAp.  
 
The assessment reviewed the existing data on the education sector in indigenous and 
Afro-Caribbean territories. Some of these documents included  the Proposal for a 
National Development Plan (2003), a Draft of MECD Workplan within the Context of 
the SWAp (2004-2006), the Strategy for the Development of the Autonomous Regions of 
the Atlantic North and South (2003), the Baseline Study of FOREIBCA,  The latter was 
carried out in 2001-2002 in coordination with the Institute of Linguistic Promotion, 
Research and Cultural Heritage of the University of URACCAN (IPILC). The analysis 
also benefited from the Social Assessment (Traa et al, 1999) prepared for the Bank-
financed Second Basic Education Project APRENDE II, and from the results of the 
implementation of the corresponding Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).   
 
The assessment also reviewed the Statutes of Autonomy of RAAN and RAAS (Law No. 28) approved by 
the National Assembly in October 1987; the Autonomous Regional Education Plan 2003-2013, and other 
documents pertaining to the Regional Autonomous Education System (SEAR) which explain in great detail 
the foundations of education for indigenous peoples and the ethnic groups Sumu-Mayangna, Miskitu, 
Creole, Rama, Garífuna and Mestizo.
 
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
As described above, the Social Assessment benefited from the input and collaboration of 
key stakeholders, including the Regional Autonomous Education Councils of the North 
and South Atlantic Autonomous Regions (RAAN and RAAS), the Intercultural Bilingual 
Program (PEBI) Coordination (infrastructure, texts, curriculum) at the central level and in 
RAAN, the National Preschool and Primary Education Directorates, and the RAAN 
MECD Delegation. Consultations were also carried out with the relevant international 
donors.
