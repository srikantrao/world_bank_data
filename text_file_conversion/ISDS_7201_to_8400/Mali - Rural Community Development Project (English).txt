A.2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the project is to improve the living conditions of project-
supported rural communities in terms of access to basic socio-economic services, 
sustainable income increase, and improved natural resource management practices.  The 
project would achieve its objective through community empowerment, capacity building 
(targeting rural communities, rural communes and suppliers of support services to 
communities), and investments in social, socio-economic, environmental, and economic, 
sub-projects implemented by these communities.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Project activities will be undertaken in four regions (Mopti, Timbuktu, Segou and 
Sikasso).  The project will ensure that the protected areas are not affected by project 
activities.  
 
Although there are culturally sensitive areas in Mali such as ancient burial sites and 
sacred groves, the proposed activities of the project will have no impact on cultural 
property.  Where there is a possibility that project activities will encroach on these areas, 
project activities will be diverted to ensure that these culturally and socially sensitive 
areas are avoided.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The RCDP is not expected to have a significant negative environmental and social 
impact.  The possibility still exists of some environmental impact and because neither the 
beneficiaries nor the activities are not yet been identified.  The Borrower prepared an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for the project.  It includes 
the following: (i) systematization of environmental and social impact assessment for all 
identified sub-projects before entering into a funding agreement with communities; (ii) 
training of staff and partners of the national and regional coordination units; (iii) 
establishment and implementation of an intersect consultation framework for the 
environmental control and monitoring; (iv) reinforcement of coordination meetings of 
harmonization and consultation at all levels among stakeholders; and (vi) concerted 
efforts of NGOs and mass media for the execution of an Information-Education-
Communication program aimed at improving environmental management.  The 
recommendations of the safeguard documents will be reflected in the Project 
Implementation Manual (PIM). 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No such long term impacts are anticipated. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N.A. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The ESMF was disclosed in-country on February 1
st
,
2005.  Radio broadcasts and 
newspapers announcements informed the population of the availability of the Report at 
the following ministries:  Economy and Finances; Social Development, Solidarity  and 
Senior Citizens; Agriculture; Livestock and Fisheries; Environment and the National 
Archives.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Stakeholders include farmers, herders, small rural enterprises, service providers, involved 
at the various levels of the rural economy.   
Page  4
Support will be provided to the targeted local communities and communes in the 
implementation of environmental and social mitigation plans, and the integration of 
safeguard issues in the local/communal development plans.
