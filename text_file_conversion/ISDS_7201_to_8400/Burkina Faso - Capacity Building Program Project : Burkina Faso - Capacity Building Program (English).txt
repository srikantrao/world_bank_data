A.2. Project Objectives
The development goal of the project is to irnprove administration structures and processes in light of the
decentralization policy, in order to yield measurable impact on provision of services to the citizens of
Burkina. This would be achieved by establishing a refonn process that will improve human and financial
management systems and entrench a culture of capacity building in the administration. Activities financed
under the Credit will focus on cross-cutting issues (decentralization, human resources management, public
expenditure management, policy cycle) and on ownership and sustainability of the activities (reliance on
local training institutes, linkages between capacity building activities financed by external financing and
national budget through coordination with PRSCs and organization of budget requests from ministries
including institutional development component).
A.3. Project Description
The instrument is a five-year technical assistance project.
The project supports the implementation of the reform program in five ministries: the four cross-
cutting central ministries (Finances and Budget, Economy and Development, Civil Service, and
Territorial Administration and Decentralization); and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of
Health is targeted since it has undertaken substantial institutional reforms and has a key role in
the attainment of the objectives of the PRSP'. Each of the five ministries has adopted crucial
reform measures or sector programs, but implementation remains a challenge. This is the case for
the Ministry of Finance and Budget and the Ministry of Economy and Development - Budget
Management Strengthening Action Plan (PRGB) -, for the Ministry of Civil Service and State
Reform (MFPRE) - Comprehensive Reform of Public Administration (RGAP) -, for the Ministry
of Territorial Administration and Decentralization - Framework Laws on Decentralization
(TODs), and for the Health Ministry (MH) - National Program of Health Development (PNDS)- .
These five ministries requested the support of IDA and they were assisted in the design of an
institutional action plan during the preparation of the project. The goal of the project is thus to
focus on the implementation aspects of these reforms and programs.     Implementation of
institutional plans of the ministries will be coordinated with support to the two main local public
sector training institutes, the Public Administration School (ENAM) and the Financial
Administration School (ENAREF). The project will also support the Prime Minister's office to
' The Ministry of Education is supported by a program which includes a substantial institutional
component, and will thus not be assisted through this project.
