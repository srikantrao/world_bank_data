B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The objectives of the project are to: 
·
Change the current unfavorable investment and incentive conditions and create an 
enabling environment in Macedonia that fosters the development of sustainable 
energy utilization (in this context defined as efficient use of energy and use of 
renewable energy sources) through providing financial, methodological, 
informational, and institutional support; 
·
Support a large increase in 
energy efficiency
 (EE) investment in Macedonia through 
development of a self-sustaining, market-based financing mechanism based on a 
principle of commercial co-
financing.  The project’s goal is focused on the 
development and implementation of financially profitable EE projects, which can 
provide sustainable and increasing reductions in GHG emissions without relying on 
public subsidy; and 
Page  2
-2- 
·
Increase the availability of financing for 
renewable energy
 (RE) investments, 
enterprises and intermediaries through the establishment of a financial facility with a 
long-term time horizon, which will provide seed capital for equity or debt co-
financing of RE development projects. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
A
Macedonia Sustainable Energy Program (MSEP) will be established. The MSEP would seek 
to promote investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy by removing institutional and 
financial barriers. The program will financed via a GEF grant with contributions from the 
Government of Macedonia (GoM), other donors (e.g. the European Commission and the 
USAID), debt financing from local banks and equity investments from local project developers. 
At present the following components are foreseen: 
 
1. 
Technical assistance to capacity building, policy and strategy advice and 
administration of a financial facility. The TA will focus on project identification, 
training, study tours, information campaigns, dissemination of best practice 
guidelines, and other efforts to facilitate the emergence of a market place for 
EE/RE investments. It will also include support to the establishment of a utility 
based ESCO; 
 
2. 
Investments in EE/RE project facilitated by capitalization of a Sustainable 
Energy Financial Facility (SEFF). The SEFF will provide support to: 
(a) EE projects through co-financing on commercial terms and provision of 
guarantees;  
(b) RE projects through providing equity finance and debt co-financing.  
 
Component 1 - Technical Assistance (US$ 2.0 million of which US$1.5 million from GEF 
grant and the remainder from GoM’s own sources and other donors)
.
This component 
covers the following areas: 
·
Capacity Building Strategic/Legislative/Institutional: 
Support to a the MoE’s Department 
of Energy (or a new Energy Agency). Technical asssistance will include policy and 
strategy advice regarding promotion of EE/RE through training and consultancy support 
to the MoE. 
·
Capacity Building, Technical/Advisory
:
Funding activities in initial project development 
and evaluation through a Project Development Assistance Facility (PDAF). The PDAF 
will provide financial and technical support for project preparation; organize workhsops 
and seminars for potential co-financiers and clients; market and disseminate information; 
and train the staff of consultants, ESCOs, etc. in project development and financing 
techniques. 
·
Fund Administration
:
Financing of incremental set-up and running costs of the SEFF.

·
Support to utility based ESCO:
 E.g. an ESCO owned by ESM Transmission, ESM 
Distribution and the Skopje Heating Company 
–
Toplifikajie.      
 
The GEF support will mainly finance the SEFF administration, the PDAF and the support 
to a utility based ESCO. It is envisaged that the GoM would finance staff time, rent and 
operating costs of an expanded Department of Energy (or a new Energy Agency) while the 
European Commission/EAR and the USAID are expected to provide most of the capacity 
building on the strategic/legislative/institutional level.    
 
Component 2a 
–
Investment in Energy Efficiency Projects (US$ 11 million facilitated by 
loan financing or guarantees through SEFF initially capitalized by US$2.0 million from 
GEF grant and the remainder from local banks and private investors)
.
Loans for EE 
investments would be made on a commercial basis to creditworthy customers that will revolve 
with interest and principal payments into it for additional loans.  As alternative to lending, SEFF 
could offer a partial guarantee facility.  The initial GEF capitalization is proposed to be US$2.0 
million, the USAID and the GoM is expected to contribute US$0.5 million, commercial co-
finance and equity is expected to amount to US$6.5 million and re-investment of returned capital 
is expected to amount to US$2.0 million.    
Component 2b – Investment in Renewable Energy Project (US$7.5 million Financial 
Support through the SEFF initially capitalized by US$1.5 million from GEF grant and the 
remainder from local banks and private investors)
.
RE investments would either be made as 
equity stakes in well researched, financially viable projects or as commercial loans and 
guarantees where appropriate.  As alternative to lending, SEFF could offer a partial guarantee 
facility.  The initial GEF capitalization is proposed to be US$1.5 million, the Austrian 
Development Corporation and the GoM is expected to contribute US$0.5 million, commercial 
co-finance and equity is expected to amount to US$4.0 million and re-investment of returned 
capital is expected to amount to US$1.5 million. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project is going to be implemented nation-wide in FYR Macedonia. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Prior to appraisal the Task Team should document the capacity
 of the Government’s experience, 
legislation and staffing in order to review EA Reports related to the future investment projects to 
be financed.  Furthermore, the Task Team should describe in the Operational Manual (OM) what 
kind of screening procedures will be applied by the financial intermediary.

4.01) 
The project would finance small investments in order to increase energy 
efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources (hydro, biomass, solar, 
geothermal, etc.).  The activities to be financially supported under the Project 
have not yet been identified, the investment operations will be selected upon 
request by a financial intermediary in Macedonia, upon evaluation of the impacts 
and benefits resulting of the investment.  The Operational Manuel (OM) will 
document the capacity
 of
the Government’s experience, legislation and staffing in 
order to review EA Reports related to the future investment projects to be 
financed.  Furthermore, the OM will describe what kind of screening procedures 
will be applied by the financial intermediary.  
 
The environment section of the OM and policy framework will be disclosed in 
country (in local language) and at the Bank’s Infoshop (in English) prior to 
Appraisal. Since the project is likely to include subprojects in environmental 
category A, ECSSD determined that the project will not be delegated to the TTL’s 
sector manager for safeguards clearance at this time.

The Involuntary Resettlement safeguard (OP 4.12) is triggered for the project. As 
some of the developers may be municipalities, it is possible that land acquisition 
through eminent domain could be involved, or that civil works on land already 
held by the municipality could result in restricting people's access to livelihood-
related resources. The Operational Manual will contain language describing the 
screening mechanisms that apply in such cases, to ensure compliance with 
national law and with OP 4.12.

FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
The project is rated as environmental category FI because the Project would finance small 
investments in order to increase energy efficiency and utilization of renewable energy sources 
(hydro, biomass, solar, geothermal, etc.).  The activities to be financially supported under the 
Project have not yet been identified.  The investment operations will be selected upon request by 
a
financial intermediary in Macedonia, EA/EMP should be prepared for the investment projects 
if rated A or B 
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

would be prepared.  March 2005 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS: n/a 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
