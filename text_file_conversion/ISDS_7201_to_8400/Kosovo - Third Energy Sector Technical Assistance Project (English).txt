A.2. Project Objectives 
The project’s primary objectives are (i) to support Kosovo’s integration with the regional 
energy market through assistance with implementation of its immediate obligations under 
the Athens Memorandum namely the establishment of an independent Transmission and 
System Operator (TSO), development of a Grid Code, development of transmission and 
retail tariffs including subsidy mechanism, and institutional strengthening to participate 
in the market, and (ii) to develop a policy framework, guidelines, and institutional 
capacity for the utilization of Kosovo’s mineral resources. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
Main Components
.
The project will focus on two key sectors, energy and mining. 
 
Component 1:  Energy Sector 
The energy sector component will comprise the 
following two subcomponents: 
 
Subcomponent 1- Transmission and System Operator
:
This includes the development of 
a
Grid Code for the transmission system, drafting of a transmission policy framework 
clearly defining the role of the TSO within the Kosovo electricity industry and the 
regional ESCEE market, and development of the TSO organizational design and 
structure. 
 
Subcomponent 2- Tariff Framework
:
Development of electricity transmission and retail 
tariffs including a lifeline tariff that is consistent with EU Directives, and improve 
targeting of subsidy for the poor.

Component 2:  Mining Sector 
The mining sector component will comprise of the 
following three subcomponents: 
 
Subcomponent 1- Mining Sector Plan
:
Development of a mining sector plan and building 
capacity within PISG to implement the plan for both large and small mines. 
 
Subcomponent 2- Mining Sector Community Participation and Development Plan:
 
Development of a policy framework and detailed guidelines for communication, 
participation, and preparation of development plans for communities that may be affected 
by future mining projects. 
 
Subcomponent 3- Mining Sector SME Capacity Development
:
Technical assistance to 
small scale mining operations (SME) to improve their financial, operational, and 
environmental performance. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
This is a technical assistance project.  The consultants will work with several institutions 
in Pristina.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Social 
Although the technical assistance provided by the project will deal with tariff issues and 
that may have different social impacts, the project itself does not present significant 
social issues.  The terms of reference for consultancies will highlight relevant social 
issues, if any, and offer guidance on how they are to be handled.  The mining component 
will include assistance on developing a framework for consultation, participation, and 
community development plans and review any gaps in policies and procedures for 
mitigating social impacts that may need to be addressed to ensure sustainability for 
communities affected by mining.  This will ensure that communities that may be affected 
by future mining projects would benefit from transparent policies and guidelines for 
communication and participation in preparation of community development plans, and 
land-use decisions according to Bank and international standards. Further, the mining 
sector component will help create capacity in the Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM)
 
and
 
the Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals (ICMM) in Kosovo to (a) 
integrate environmental and social
 
issues in their mining sector strategy and the mining 
sector plan to be prepared by the consultants, funded through the proposed IDA Grant, 
and (b) strengthen the capacity of the ICMM to provide technical advice to the SMEs  
(small mining operators, e.g., sand quarrying and stone crushing etc.) to improve 
inter-
alia
 
their environmental performance and environmental compliance.  The specific 
consultant contracts will include requirements that assistance will be guided by Bank 
Safeguard policies and procedures.  Compliance will be supervised closely.  
 
Environment
In accordance with World Bank safeguard policies on environment (OP/BP/GP 4.01 
Environmental Assessment) the project was assigned Category C, indicating that no 
environmental issues are anticipated. This was based upon the project design which is 
primarily technical assistance and does not include any physical construction activities. In 
fact, the project is likely to have future environmental benefits because technical 
assistance to ICMM is included for improvements in the environmental performance of 
small mining operations (SMEs).  
 
Although the project will not finance any investments, it will provide technical assistance 
in community development and social impact mitigation matters, and integration of 
environmental issues in sector strategy.  Dissemination of information and consultation 
with multiple stakeholders, in particular with the civic society, is included in the scope of 
work of consultants.  Consultant contracts will require the assistance rendered to be 
consistent with Bank Safeguard Policies.  Compliance will be supervised closely. 
 
Page  5
The Bank’s supervision of both social and environmental aspects will ensure that the 
advice provided by the consultants to Kosovo authorities is consistent with the Bank’s 
safeguards policies and with the Bank’s position on the Extractive Industries Review.
