B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
Within the Government sector-wide approach program, the proposed IDA credit will support two 
specific objectives: 
(i)
 To strengthen Government’s inter-institutional and technical capacity to coordinate a sector-wide 
approach (SWAp) to the agriculture and forestry sector with a focus on MTEF monitoring and 
evaluation, fiduciary mechanisms, and safeguards policies (for the period 2005-2009).  
(ii) To support a strategic portion of the Government’s MTEF’s first two years (2005-2006) by 
promoting enhanced agricultural/forestry technology innovation and adoption, with a focus on 
smallholders. 
At the end of the project, it is expected that technology innovation and adoption will have contributed to 
the increased livelihood of rural households, enhanced community-level approaches will have contributed 
to protected area management and sustainability, and under the Government’s leadership a significant 
portion of Government and foreign resources will be channeled through a common approach across the 
sector, relying on strengthened national procedures to disburse and account for all funds. 
Subject to Government interest, project performance, and IDA availability under the new CAS for 
Nicaragua, the Task Team will consider preparing and submitting for Board’s approval a supplemental 
Page  2
credit at the end of the second year of implementation to further support the MTEF. Specific indicators, 
including trigger indicators for warranting the preparation of a supplemental credit, will be elaborated 
once the Government proposes its target indicators for the MTEF.
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The proposed Project will finance consultants, training, operating costs and grants to carry out activities 
within the following two components:   
(1) Institutional Modernization and Strengthening
:
Activities will focus on technical assistance for 
strengthening the capacity of the Government in sector strategy formulation and sector-wide coordination, 
monitoring, and evaluation for the whole period of the MTEF (2005-2009). Technical assistance will be 
provided to improve the fiduciary and safeguard country systems for relevant agencies (Ministry of 
Finance, MAGFOR, SECEP, MIFIC, and MARENA). The Task Team will prepare a co-financing PHRD 
request that, if accepted, would provide additional financing for this component. The component will be 
coordinated by MIFIC through its Productivity and Competitiveness Cabinet’s Secretariat of the 
Mesa de 
Producción y Competitividad
,
and implemented by MAG-FOR, which will enter through specific inter-
institutional arrangements to provide technical assistance, mostly through consultants. 
(2) Sustainable Agricultural Technology Innovation and Adoption
:
Activities under this component will 
complete the INTA reform promoted under the Agricultural Technology APL I, which include: (i) 
downsizing, repositioning and outsourcing of INTA; and (ii) management of competitive funds for 
research and TA (through FUNICA, a foundation for research and TA in agriculture and forestry); and 
support INTA and MARENA to carry out Community-level management of natural resources of 
protected areas
through enhanced community driven approaches to protected areas management, 
information management, and monitoring of forest resources in the Bosawas Reserve. This approach 
draws and follows up on the successful experiences of the recently completed PROFOR (FY04). The 
component will be partially blended with a bi-national GEF operation in Nicaragua and Honduras 
(Consolidation of the Corazón Trans-frontier Biosphere Reserve Project). 
INTA would be directly implementing the component, while special arrangements will be done with 
FUNICA and MARENA, mostly to manage competitive funds and to carry out community-based 
activities. The component will be financed through a pooled financing mechanism (IDA, SDC, IFAD 
and possibly additional co-financiers, but likely not including the GEF funds) stressing a “results-based” 
approach and use of the GON budgetary, fiduciary and safeguard procedures to the extent possible. 
Piloting and demonstrating innovative implementation and financial arrangements will gradually attract 
other partners and expand the portion of the MTEF being covered by a pooling fund mechanism.  
The specific performance indicators for the above objectives and components for IDA support are being 
formulated as a part of an on-going project preparation process.
