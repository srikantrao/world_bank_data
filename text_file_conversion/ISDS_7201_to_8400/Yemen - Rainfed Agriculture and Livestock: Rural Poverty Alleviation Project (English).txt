B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
Higher level objective
:
Contribute to poverty alleviation through promoting farmers’ incomes from 
agriculture and livestock activities and related activities, in traditional rainfed systems, including small
spate irrigation.  
 
Project development objectives
:
(i) 
Improve the MAI’s regulatory functions and the capacity of service providers (well targeted 
companies, cooperatives and NGOs) to serve farmers in the traditional rainfed and spate 
irrigation systems, in the area of input supply (improved seeds, in particular) and market 
access,  animal health, food safety and plant protection.  
(ii)

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Specific objectives under Component 1: Regulatory functions and service supply  
Sub-component 1.1
:
Diffusion  of improved seed technology 
 
The main objectives
are to:  
 
(i) 
Promote the adoption of appropriate crop and seed technology for rainfed crops, including 
forages, with a view to increase crop yields and stability; 
(ii) 
Create a sustainable and participatory system of variety improvement for rainfed crops and 
forages by  encouraging a diversity of stakeholders to be involved in these activities. In 
particular, encourage farmer groups to develop seed p
roducers’ associations in order to 
improve the availability of seed of adapted varieties. 
 
Activities supported
:
(i) variety introduction/collection, variety screening, on station testing, variety 
release and maintenance; (ii) farmer-based initiatives to improve seed supply and adoption; seed 
marketing in rainfed areas.  
Sub-component 1.2
:
Livestock services and R&D 
The main objectives are: (i) to improve livestock-related public regulatory services  (sanitary and quality 
control for enhancing productivity, food safety and trade); (ii) make livestock-related private goods and 
services such as veterinary treatments and  husbandry advice accessible to  livestock owners.  
 
Under the first objective, the project would construct/refurbish and equip district veterinary epidemiology 
centers, regional laboratories, two quarantine stations and provide communications (data management, 
office, lab networks) as required.  It would also provide technical assistance for staff training and capacity 
building.  Funding would be provided to initiate public-private partnerships, in particular for the delivery 
of public functions on a part-time basis, with livestock owners and para-veterinarians. 
 
Under the second objective, the project would: (i)  train and monitor district/village level community 
animal health and production workers (paraveterinarians), men and women selected by villagers, and 
provide them with a start-up pharmacy and basic equipment as initial capital; (ii) identify and test  
innovations in husbandry methods, feed supplements and fodders for improving livestock productivity  in 
collaboration with interested farmer groups and district/village level animal health and production 
workers (see component 2).
 
Specific objectives under Component 2. Organized farmer
s’ capacity building and investments 
 
Sub-component 2.1
Support to primary cooperatives and other farmer organizations in  rainfed 
areas   
 
The objective is: (i)  to develop technical and entrepreneurial capacity of primary cooperatives to help 
them extend their services to farmers in rainfed areas; (ii) to capacitate leaders and members of the 
different committees of cooperative and other farmer organizations in organizational management, as well 
Page  3
as in activity planning, implementation and monitoring, with a view to empower them, with a special 
attention to women groups.  
 
The project would finance: (i) technical assistance and capacity-building; (ii) improve office and storage 
facilities and equipment; (iii) seed money for market intelligence (market research and communicating 
market requirements to farmers (packaging, quality requirement, periods of delivery, prices) and to 
facilitate small-scale farmers access to agricultural inputs, services, market information and market 
outlets; (iv) financial resources to mobilize demand-driven R&D on behalf of cooperatives to support 
partnership arrangements between research, cooperatives or farmer organizations and 
traders/processors/exporters; (v) the design and development of a cooperative intranet network that could 
include information on cooperative’s activities, market information, prices and availability of inputs, etc;    
 
Sub Component 2.2
Support to FO to implement small-scale farmer-demanded sub-projects  
 
The specific objectives are to enable farmer organizations/groups and village communities to access 
funding to: (i) improve their agricultural production base (land and water management); (ii) better access 
market opportunities; and (iii) upgrade and diversify their agricultural and livestock activities
.
Sub-projects would qualify for funding if proposed by farmer organizations/groups or village 
communities on the basis of the following (tentative) menu of options: (i) training of village animal health 
and/or crop advisors (workers); (ii) seed money for start up activities: including new technologies and 
farm experiments such as seed selection, forage growing trials, establishing village/district veterinary 
pharmacies, village seed banks or agricultural and livestock input outlets at village shops; (iii) financing 
of community labor-saving devices, especially for women; (iv) support for small scale soil and water 
harvesting facilities (spate secondary and tertiary irrigation channels, water reservoirs/cisterns/tanks to 
catch surface water (possibly combined with drip irrigation systems), terrace rehabilitation, and erosion 
control infrastructure and upper catchments revegetation; and (v)  agro-processing facilities. Specific 
allocation would be made for supporting women activities. 
 
The project would provide support  for sub-project formulation and consolidated activity 
planning process of farmer organizations/groups or village communities.  The Project would 
set 
up and operate a monitoring system for capacity building activities, including small sub-projects 
implementation.  Under this sub-component, linkages between FO planning process and Local Council 
district planning will be promoted. 
 
4. 
Preliminary implementation arrangements  
 
Project Support Unit (PSU).
To insure timely and efficient implementation, the Government will create a 
Project Support Unit (PSU).  The PSU will not be an implementing entity but will support the project 
executing agencies by: handling all procurement and disbursement activities, maintaining project 
accounts and consolidating project monitoring and evaluation reports and serving as the liaison between 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the 
Ministry of Finance and IDA. The PSU will be based in Sana’a.  It will be headed by a manager, and 
include one or two  procurement officers, a certified accountant, one bilingual secretary.  The PSU would 
be staffed either by civil servants seconded from MAI and MOF and financed from the national budget, or 
by consultants recruited under IDA guidelines and financed from the proceeds of the Credit.

Implementing agencies
Sub-component 1.1
The activities of this sub-component will be conducted by stakeholders interested 
and competent in their fields, such as the Agriculture Research and Extension Agency, existing seed 
companies, universities or NGOs, on a competitive and contractual basis. 
 
Sub-component 1.2
will be implemented by the General Directorate of Animal Resources (GDAR).     
 
Sub-component 2.1
This sub-component would be business/market-driven.  It could be implemented 
by ACU within the framework of an agreed upon Project Agreement.  The project would support a small 
technical unit within ACU.  .    
 
Sub-component 2.2
 
The Social Fund for Development (SFD) could be a partner of the MAI for this sub-
component, under a separate Project Agreement of the Credit Agreement.  The SFD has a comparative 
advantage as partner for capacity-building purposes since it has already accumulated experience in 
capacity building of farmer groups and associations as well as facilitator for the technical aspects 
addressed by this sub-component.  The implementation of the sub-component activities would be 
facilitated by its nationwide institutional infrastructure.  This arrangement would also contribute to 
increase consistency of organizational capacity-building approaches within Yemen and ensure some 
degree of sustainability for capacity building for farmer organizations once the Project is over.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project  would be implemented in five governorates (Al-
Mahweet, Hajja, Hodeida, Sana’a and Lahej) 
and in a total of 22 districts. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The GOY institutional capacity for safeguards is weak.  However, on the basis of a request from 
the Ministry of Water & Environment, the WB is presently working with the Environment 
Protection Authority to build their capacity.
