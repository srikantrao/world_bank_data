B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
To improve access to, and utilization of, quality essential health care package (preventive and 
curative) for the population in targeted geographical areas. This will be achieved by 
strengthening the existing public health system at all levels, with special attention paid to the 
health zone.  Improving geographical access, reducing financial barriers to utilization, and 
improving the quality and effectiveness of care are priorities for the project. The project Key 
performance indicators (KPIs) will be in line with the MDGs. The project will be in the amount 
of US$100 million over a period of 4 years (IDA amount is US$60 million). 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Although some donors had chosen to provide support to self-contained disease control programs, 
e.g., onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis control, this project proposes to strengthen the ability of 
the health system to address a sizeable proportion of the primary health care needs of its target 
groups, at the same time as supporting implementation of specific disease control interventions 
in an integrated fashion in targeted areas.  In line with the expectations of the Government, and 
current modalities of donor coordination, the project has chosen a geographic targeting approach. 
Co-financing will be explored, particularly with regard to implementation of disease control 
interventions in the project’s targeted areas and with regard to continuation of support to areas

currently assisted by bilateral and international donor humanitarian programs that are scheduled 
to end during the course of the proposed project.

OBJECTIVE 
1:
 
I
NCREASE 
ACCESS
 TO AND 
UTILIZATION
 OF HEALTH SERVICES
The following strategies are proposed: 
Integrated support to targeted geographical areas
:
This project will provide integrated assistance 
principally to the health zone (which incorporates public and private facilities), with necessary 
financial and technical assistance to other levels in the health system pyramid.  The following 
objectives will guide the selection of health zones:  i) build on the investments and progress 
achieved in zones currently assisted by the EMRRP; ii) continue assistance to health zones where 
current donors are withdrawing; and iii) establish, improve and extend basic health services in 
poor, isolated, and under-served areas not being assisted by other donors. 
Move services to lower levels of the health system
:
The project will work at increasing the 
availability of services as close as possible to households 
–
policy changes,  such as allowing 
antibiotic treatment for childhood pneumonia by non-physicians, and emergency obstetric care at 
the health center level, will be encouraged. 
Reduce financial barriers to care
:
Due to minimal Government funding, health services are 
largely financed by household expenditures.  This cost represents a considerable barrier to 
utilization, especially for the poorest. The project will support a program of operational research 
and policy dialogue focused on the question of how to reduce this barrier, with the aim of 
changing policies and programs. 
Public financing of private health service delivery
:
The project will build on the Government’s 
experience in contracting with NGOs to manage and, in some cases, to provide services on the 
basis of performance and results.

OBJECTIVE 
2:
 
I
NCREASE THE 
QUALITY
,
APPROPRIATENESS
,
AND EFFECTIVENESS
 OF 
HEALTH SERVICES
,
IN ORDER TO REDUCE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY
The following strategies are proposed: 
Improve child health services
:
In accordance with the Government’s minimum package of 
activities, the project will improve the quality of preventive and curative interventions aimed at 
reducing neo-natal and childhood morbidity and mortality due to pneumonia, malaria, diarrhea, 
malnutrition, and vaccine-preventable diseases.  The promotion of community-based 
interventions such as exclusive breastfeeding and family planning will be particular areas of 
focus.  This will be achieved by increasing the capacity of all levels of the health system to 
promote appropriate preventive health behaviors, to detect and treat episodes of illness, and to 
effectively administer and manage public health programs. 
Improve women’s health services
:
The project will improve the quality of safe motherhood 
interventions, including prevention of malaria in pregnancy, improved nutrition, delivery by a 
skilled attendant, and emergency obstetrical care.  Also important to women’s health are family 
planning and the prevention and treatment of gender-based violence.  In general, the project will 
promote the primary role of women in decisions affecting the health and well-being of 
themselves and their children. 
Address important endemic and epidemic diseases
:
In the targeted zones, the project will 
improve the ability of health authorities to detect and to respond to important endemic diseases 
Page  3
and diseases of epidemic potential.  To do so, it will collaborate with other donors to strengthen 
the health information system and to provide technical and material assistance in accordance 
with national policies and strategies. 
Improve the capacity of the Ministry of Health
:
The project will provide support to improve the 
capacity of the MoH to fulfill its supervisory, regulatory, and stewardship capacities at all levels 
–
national, provincial, district, and zonal. 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project activities will take place in health zones (defined as a well defined geographical area of 
around 100,000 inhabitants comprising a referral hospital, some 20 satellite health centers and 
200 communities) chosen on the basis of needs and poverty level.  Number and location of 
covered urban and rural health zones have yet to be decided. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
In 2004, the Ministry of Health developed a National Plan for Medical Waste Management 
(Rapport E844 
–
December 2003 – Plan de Gestion des Déchets Biomédicaux) which, when 
submitted* in the context of the MAP project, was found satisfactory to the IDA ISG group.   
 
Government will start implementing this plan in the upcoming months and the MAP will 
contribute to the financing of the Plan.   
 
*
The MWP has been disclosed in the Democratic Republic of Congo on December 23, 2003 and 
at the Bank's Infoshop on December 30, 2003.
