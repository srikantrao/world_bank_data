B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
ƒ
Government health expenditure is sufficient to fully fund an agreed package of basic 
health services of acceptable quality at primary, secondary and tertiary levels.  Indicator: 
Government health expenditure vs. MTBF targets.  Source: MOH/MOF reports and 
MTBF. 
 
ƒ
The relative share of primary health care and outpatient drugs in overall government 
health spending increases to target levels agreed in the MTBF.  Indicator: MOH and 
MHIF expenditure on PHC as a proportion of total MOH and MHIF expenditure.  
Source: MOH/MOF and MTBF. 
 
ƒ
Health reform efforts continue to focus on efficiency, equity and quality in the health 
sector.  (Sector-wide indicators to be developed during Preparation.) 
 
ƒ
Social and health benefits are rationalized and targeted more effectively at poor and 
vulnerable groups.  (Specific indicators to be identified during Preparation.)

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Component 1.  Support for the Manas II Health Reform Program and associated Program of 
Work.
This Component (US$13 million) would support implementation of the Manas II Health 
Reform Program through a Sector-Wide Approach.  Preparations for the SWAp (as an 
approach
,
not a project) will involve developing a comprehensive sector strategy (The Manas II Health 
Reform Program); a medium-
term work program (a “Program of Work”) that reflects and is 
designed to realize the priorities from this strategy; a medium-term expenditure framework and 
investment plan, both tightly linked to the Program of Work (POW); and efforts to coordinate 
donor-supported activities around both the sector strategy and the resulting Program of Work.  
These activities will be led by MOH as part of SWAp development but will also contribute 
directly to the design of the new Bank project, whose principal objective would be to support the 
Program of Work thus developed.  This Component would therefore finance a 3 or 4-year 
Program of Work (POW) designed around the objectives of the Manas II Health Reform 
Program (which is expected to include 
inter alia
 a focus on health care quality, on reforms in 
public health and the Sanitary Epidemiological System, on continued efforts to restructure 
hospital services in Bishkek and Osh, and on financing of high-cost tertiary care).  Expenditures 
will not be defined in detail 
ex ante
 as in a traditional World Bank investment project: instead 
they will be agreed in general terms against the objectives and activities laid out in the Manas 
program and POW, and might involve an agreement to finance an agreed percentage of the total 
resource envelope for the sector, either reimbursing expenditures already incurred or by tranches 
released upon receipt of acceptable MOH financial statements.  These would be adjusted 
annually based on sector performance, absorptive capacity and identified needs.  Project 
monitoring will therefore be carried out against indicators of sector performance rather than 
specific disbursement or procurement targets.  “Gap” financing could also be contemplated: for 
example, financing an expansion in the outpatient drug benefit package on a declining basis 
while government expenditure increases to levels agreed in the MTBF, or expanding the range of 
services covered in the Program of State Guarantees.  Annual work-plans based on the Program 
of Work will facilitate this process, as will the regular donor round-tables, monitoring systems 
and joint missions associated with a SWAp arrangement.  Also of critical importance will be to 
monitor indicators of sector financing, for which purpose a MTBF is currently in preparation and 
will define the expected level of budgetary contributions to the health sector.   
 
Component 2:  Improving the Targeting of Social and Health Benefits
.
This Component ($2 
million) would help implement policy reforms and strengthen administrative systems to enable 
the social protection and health systems to more effectively target assistance and subsidies to 
poor or disadvantaged households.  It would streamline coordination between the health and 
social protection systems by clarifying through the SP system those households eligible for 
reduced co-payments when they need health care.  The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection 
(MOLSP), supported by the social protection component of a PRSC now in preparation and a 
related PHRD grant, is developing proposals to (a) consolidate and restructure cash social 
assistance benefits, (b) specify refined eligibility conditions for the consolidated benefit structure 
based on a more comprehensive definition of resources available, and (c) build a more efficient 
administrative system for implementing associated benefits.  This Component would support the 
implementation of these proposals and related institutional strengthening.  This would require 
investments in enhancing MOLSP processes and tools for making and reviewing policy, revising 
Page  3
its administrative procedures and systems, and strengthening its information systems.  MOLSP 
staff are planning to develop and implement a strategy on information management and the use 
of information technology that would enable MOLSP to use information efficiently at each level 
of administration, transfer information appropriately between levels, establish links with other 
databases electronically, and support overall administration and policy-making effectively.  Key 
questions to be addressed during preparation include: (i) How best (and through which 
institutions) to structure procurement and financial-/component-management activities; (ii) 
Whether donor co-financing could augment funding for this component; and (iii) Whether the 
timetables for preparation, related TA (including through the PRSC PHRD), implementation and 
disbursement can be coordinated with those of Component 1.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
The only safeguard policies expected to apply are those concerning Environmental Assessment.  
As such, an Abbreviated Health Care Waste Management Plan will be prepared and disclosed 
before Appraisal and would include a rapid assessment of sectoral conditions regarding heath 
care waste management and mitigation from construction/operation, urgent recommendations for 
near-term management improvements, and a workplan for refining and supporting the 
management plan (with other SWAp partners) during project implementation.  A policy 
framework for OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) will be prepared as needed.
