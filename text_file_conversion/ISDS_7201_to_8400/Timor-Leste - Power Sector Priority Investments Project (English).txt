A.2. Project Objectives
The project development objective is the delivery of 
least
-
cost, high
-
quality electricity 
service with minimum dependence on the government’s budget. This objective will be 
achieved 
through 
improvements 
in 
EDTL’s 
generation 
capacity, 
generation 
and 
distribution efficiency, and through savings achieved by red
uction in demand with the 
use of energy efficient light bulbs.
The  key  indicators  of  progress  on  this  development  objective  are:  system  reliability, 
generation and distribution efficiency, and reduction in Government subsidy to EDTL. 
The Government
’s vision till 2020, as stated in the May 2002 National Development Plan 
(NDP), includes that “people will no longer be isolated because there will be good roads, 
transport, electricity and communications in the towns and villages in all the regions of 
the
 country”.  Further, the NDP recognizes that “an effective system of infrastructure and 
services is crucial for agricultural productivity and poverty reduction, a determinant of 
business investment, instrumental to human development, and the foundation for
 private 
sector  development”,  and  the  need    “to  plan  for,  provide  and  manage  physical 
infrastructure  that  is  efficient,  cost
-
effective,  and  financially  sustainable,  and  which 
supports the social and economic development priorities of the people Timor
-
Leste
.” 
Page  2
This Vision sets the following requirements for the power se
c
tor:
(a)
The power sector will create and maintain reliable and affordable power supplies 
which  meet  the  needs  of  immediate  areas 
served,  to  support  economic 
produ
c
ti
v
ity and quality of life, t
hroughout Timor
-
Leste.
(b)
Supplies  will  be  developed  to  achieve  lowest  possible  costs  in  the  long  run, 
ta
p
ping  the  ec
o
nomic  potential  of  indigenous  resources  to  displace  costly 
imported fuels; indigenous resources to be developed may include natural gas, 
hydr
opower, s
o
lar, and ot
h
ers.
Each of the proposed components is in line with the Government’s vision of reliable and 
affordable power supplies which displace costly imported fuels.
A.3. Project Description
(i)  Replacement  of  engine  at  Unit  No.  5  (MAK
  4)  at  Comoro  Power  Station. 
The 
objective is to enhance base load generation capacity and reduce fuel costs by replacing 
the MAK 4 unit engine by a new 2.8 MW unit at Comoro power station. The estimated 
cost is $1.0 million.
(ii) Distribution system reha
bilitation in Dili. 
The objective is to improve service quality 
and  reduce  losses  through  reinforcement  and  rehabilitation  of  the  Dili  system.  The 
estimated cost is $320,000.
(iii)  Distribution  of  energy  efficient  light  bulbs/tubes. 
The  objective  is  to  ac
hieve 
reductions in fuel costs incurred by EDTL through greater efficiency in energy end
-
use 
for lighting. The estimated cost is $90,000.
1.
Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
Experience in the preparation of the TFET Petroleum Technical As
sistance project, SEPs 
and other IDA projects and lessons learned from projects and studies financed by JICA 
and  the  Norwegian  Development  Agency  (NORAD)  (see  Annex  2)  underscore  the 
importance of the following as the key factors to the success of the proj
ect:
a.
Full commitment from the Recipient counterpart: 
the Government has led 
the  development  of  the  power  SEP  (which  includes  each  proposed 
component) and is fully committed to implementing reductions in its fuel 
costs. The decision for the allocation of s
urplus TFET funds for the five 
SEP short
-
term priorities was fully supported by relevant ministries and 
ultimately made by the Prime Minister. 
b.
access to high
-
quality international consultant expertise: 
The  management 
contractor, CEM of Macao, an internati
onally recognized utility management company, 
Page  3
will take direct responsibility for this project. CEM has very experienced international 
staff backed up by home office expertise in Macao. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics releva
nt to the safeguard 
analysis
:
The engine to be replaced is in Comoro power station located on the outskirts of the city 
of Dili

 Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management 
D. Summary of Key Safeguard 
Issues
. 
D.1. Describe any safeguard 
issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The new diesel engine in Comoro power station will have atmospheric emissions; 
however these will be within l
imits recommended in World Bank Pollution Prevention 
and Abatement Handbook.  Moreover, generation of repaired generating unit will replace 
generation of high speed diesels which are less fuel efficient and have higher emissions.  
Overall emissions of the 
power station will therefore reduce. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives 
(if relevant)
Replacement and short term augment
ation of diesel capacity in Comoro power station is 
in line with the recommendations of the AsDB financed Power System Development 
Plan.  In the medium to long term, the  PSDP recommends development of hydropower 
generation so that the Comoro diesels will 
move from base to peak load duty
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower 
to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of 
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) acceptable to the Bank has been prepared 
and the Borrower has agreed to implement 
this EMP.
A number of measures will be taken during project implementation and operations to 
ensure that the intended environmental benefits are realized and any adverse effects 
minimized.  Required atmospheric emission standards will be set out in technic
al 
specifications.  During installation guidelines will be issued for retrieval of usable parts 
from the old engine and disposal of the remaining components.  There will be no need for 
excavations and concrete work as the existing foundations are to be use
d for the new 
engine.  The peripheral systems will also need only minimal cleaning and flushing as 
done regularly during engine overhauls.  On completion of installation work, the plant 
operational characteristics will be confirmed with site tests during c
ommissioning to 
ensure compliance with the specified standards.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are r
esidents of Dili.  The EMP will be disclosed in the offices of 
Electricite de Timor Leste and in World Bank Public Information Center in Dili.
