strengthening of institutional capacity to train well qualified family doctors and family medicine nurses as
first line PHC providers using internationally peer reviewed curriculum; provide incremental support to
train and retrain 980 family doctors and 980 family medicine nurses (estimated 60% of country's needs),
expand the Primary Health Care Development Program to improve the PHC ifiwaucur beyond the 81
communities supported under the first health project, and, further development of family medicine relevant
PHC guidelines, including primary and secondary prevention of avoidable mortality. The program will also
help to strengthen commnities' participation in addressing local health issues tbrough a small grant
programnL The project wilL- renovate and equip academic and clinical training facilities; tain the trainers;
provide technical assistance to curriculum evaluation and improvement; finance tuition and stipends for the
staff to be retrained as family doctors and family medicine mwses; develop and publish practice guidelines;.
medical equipment and supplies for PHC teams; rehabilitation of PHC infiwatucture; vehicles for PHC in
remote communities.
Component B: Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization (USS 15.0 million). The project
would support the development and implementation of strategic restructuring plans for selected hospital
network organizations (up to four in Yerevan and one per region, subject to resource constraints) which 
will include: consolidation of. infiastructure and services; modxenization of management structures and
improving management capacity; strengthen accountability arrangements; introducing quality assurance
systems; help to mitigate social consequences from staff retrenchment, and, improving nmnagement of
health care waste. The project wil: finance relocation of services due to internal reorgnization of hospital



networks; medical equipment, technical assistance for managerial functions and quality assmance; training
of management teams; IT equipment for basic financial management systems; training and supplies for

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
\ .    D. Summary ofKey Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and imnpacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The inimediate impact of the project activities on the enviromnent is limited. The main physical investment
comnponents for the proposed project are minor rehabilitation of family medicine training centers and
family medicine practices, construction of five new family medicine practices in rural communities,
rehabilitation and refurbishment of selected space in pilot hospital networks to accommodate re-location of
existing departments under the restructuing process and medical equipment provided by the project, and
minor rehabilitation of project implementation unit facilities.  The project will also support the
imnprovement of management systems of pilot hospitals, including updating guidelines and provision of
training for handling health care waste.
There are no potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible environmental or health impact expected
from small scale civil works supported by the Project. The Project is expected to have beneficial impact to
access and quality of health services. However, the following issues are being addressed during project
preparation to ensure proper handling of safeguards: selection of proper construction materials, proper
handling of construction debris and safe management of health care waste. These issues are described in
more detail below.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
No potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area is
expected.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
During project preparation, an expert supported by the PHRD project preparation grant carried out an
assessment of environmental issues pertinent to the project Also, earlier studies by Carelift International
(2002) and Medical Waste Management Audit by the US Centers of Disease Control and Armenian
Sanitary-Epidemiology Service (2003) were used. An Environmental Management Plan was prepared in
consultations with the main stakeholders, i.e. Ministry of Health, municipality of Yerevan, hospital
managers, Ministry of Nature Protection, State Hygiene and Anti-Epidemic Inspection (former San Epid)
and ECOTECHARD, a private waste management company. The EMP would support: (i) establishment
of environmental expertise within the PIU and inclusion of environment issues in the Project Operational

Manual; (ii) environmental capacity building and training program; (iii) site-specific  environrmental
screening concerning all project supported activities for the rehabilitation of PHC centers and hospitals; (iv)
monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures identified in the site-specific reviews; (v) developing
Environmental Guidelines for ecological planning and design of health care facilities and for waste
handling (including demolition and construction debris); (vi) developing capacity and operational
guidelines for health care waste management on national level and in the health care facilities supported by
the project.
One staff member in the PIU will combine civil works and environmental specialist responsibilities. The
EMP follow-up responsibility will be defined in the Terms of Reference. The staff member will be
environmentally trained technical staff assisted on short-term basis of local or international experts during
the initial preparation of the project He/she will be responsible for coordination and supervision of the
environmental work undertaken in the project and work in close coordination with Ministry of Nature
Protection and MOH. He/she will: (a) coordinate environmental training for staff, designers and local
contractors; (b) develop envionental guidelines in line with Bank standards for implementation,
monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures; (c) coordinate environmental reviews of micro-projects;
and (d) conduct periodic site visits to review progress. The responsible staff member will also be
responsible for the preparation of the Environmental management guidelines of the PIU Operational
Manual and training of stafi International technical assistance and training will provided under the project
in health care waste management issues.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders with regard to the safeguard issues are: Ministry of Health, municipality of Yerevan
and selected local communities, management and staff of participating health care providers, patients
served by pilot providers and contractors for civil works. Consultations were held during the project
preparation by an environmental specialist in the project team with the main stakeholders, i.e. Ministry of
Health, municipality of Yerevan, hospital managers, Ministry of Nature Protection, State Hygiene an2d
Anti-Epidemic Inspection (former San Epid) and ECOTECHARD, a private waste management company. 
Consultation and advice on health care waste issues commenced during project preparation and will
continue during project implementation. Development of national guidelines for medical waste
management will go through public consultation process at the draft regulation phase that would entail
distribution of relevant materials to the main stakeholders and having a series of consultation workshops
(these activities are included in the project).
