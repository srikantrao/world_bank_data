A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project objective is to improve learning and learning conditions in primary and 
secondary schools, with priority attention to rural areas.  To promote this objective, the 
Project would support: a) development of an improved performance management system 
for teachers and principals and a related revised salary scale, the application of the 
revised salary scale in Issykul and Talas oblasts, and development and implementation of 
a
targeted, nationwide teacher incentive scheme to help attract and retain teachers in rural 
schools in subjects with particular teacher shortages; (ii) development and 
implementation of Learning Improvement Projects by school boards of trustees in 
schools in Issykul and Talas oblasts; (iii)  introduction of an improved process of 
textbook authorship, selection, and production, introduction of an improved textbook 
rental scheme, and provision of textbooks and learning materials to primary and 
secondary schools nationally; (iv) strengthened student assessment and strategic planning 
by the Ministry of Education (MOE); and (v) strengthened project management capacity.

A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project comprises five components:  
Component I: Improving Teacher Incentives.  
This activity would support the 
development of an improved performance management system for teachers and 
principals and a related revised salary scale.  Starting in September 2006, it would also 
support the application of the revised scale in Issykul and Talas oblasts, where the grant 
would finance the incremental salary costs of applying the new performance-based 
evaluation system. This component comprises four subcomponents: (i) improvement of 
existing school-based self-appraisal procedures through development of model 
performance management arrangements; (ii) development of improved national 
guidelines and criteria for progression to higher salary categories; (iii) revision of the 
teacher salary scale to provide improved performance incentives, and pilot 
implementation of the scheme in Issykul and Talas oblasts; and (iv) support for a targeted 
program of fellowships for rural teachers in shortage subject areas.  
Component II: School grants for improved learning.  
This activity would support 
improvement of learning in basic education schools in Issykul and Talas oblasts through 
the implementation of learning improvement plans.  Schools in the two pilot oblasts will 
be assisted to prepare learning improvement projects which describe their most urgent 
learning needs and propose action programs to address those needs.  The average 
amounts of the grants will be about $4,000 per school.  
 
Component III: Textbooks and learning materials.  
This component will finance the 
provision of textbooks and learning materials for primary and secondary schools 
throughout the country, under competitive procurement procedures conforming with the 
World Bank’s new guidelines for textbooks.  It will also support development and 
implementation of an improved textbook rental scheme, and will promote improved 
textbook content through author training and a transparent, competitive textbook 
selection process.  There are three subcomponents: (i) textbook provision, which will 
fund development of new textbooks and teachers’ manuals, and may also finance reprints 
of existing textbooks and teachers’ manuals; (ii) improvement of the textbook rental 
scheme, which will provide financing to improve the rental scheme to ensure adequate 
financing of textbook replacement, and to establish a Textbook Rental Fund as an 
autonomous entity; (iii) provision of learning materials, such as teachers’ guides, 
supplementary reading materials, library books, maps, globes, mathematical and other 
scientific instruments, and laboratory equipment.  This sub-component will finance the 
supply of such materials to all schools.   
Component IV:  Student assessment
 
and strategic planning.  
This component will 
strengthen student assessment and strategic planning by the MOE.  To do so, it will:
 
a)
 
establish a valid, reliable, and internationally recognized system for student assessment 
and examinations, b) develop a mechanism to monitor school performance and 
accountability, and c) improve the MEC’s strategic planning capacity in the collection, 
analysis and use of education data for strategic planning and improved  evidence-based 
policy decision-making.  It comprises two sub-components:  (i) student assessment, 
which will support participation in the next cycle of OECD’s PISA international student 
assessment (in 2006) and the development and implementation of four annual cycles of 
sample-based national assessment for primary and secondary education, designed to 
establish baseline levels of student performance against which teachers can evaluate the 
progress of their students for purposes of performance management; and (ii) strategic 
planning, which
 
will support technical assistance, training, commissioned studies and 
workshops to strengthen data collection and strategic planning in the MOE and with key 
partners outside the Ministry.  It will also support the provision of modest supplementary 
hardware and software for the MOE to permit effective use of the installed EMIS

Comments:    
There are no significant environment issues in this project.  Except for 
provision of grants to schools which in part might finance the replacement of windows 
and doors, paint and repair of flooring, there will be no other construction activity 
supported by the project.  The project will not finance any lead paint, asbestos material or 
otherwise dangerous/hazardous material in conducting these repairs, such prohibitions 
will be specified in the contract bidding documents.
