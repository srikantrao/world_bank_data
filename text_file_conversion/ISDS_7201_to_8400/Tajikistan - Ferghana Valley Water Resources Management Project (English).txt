A.3. Project Description 
The four project components that have been formulated to meet the project objectives are as 
outlined below; further details are given in Annex 4. 
 
Component 1. Irrigation and Drainage System Rehabilitation and Improvements
.
This 
component finances design and works for rehabilitation or improvement of (i) main off-farm 
irrigation and drainage gravity and/or pumped water supply, conveyance, delivery, removal, 
evacuation infrastructure systems, and (ii) selected inter-farm and on-farm irrigation and 
drainage distribution and collection systems related to the irrigation of some 30,000 ha of farm 
land in the Kaniboddom and Bobojon Gufarov raions not in immediate proximity and 
operating independently from the Kayrakum reservoir and dam structures.  These include both 
surface and subsurface water control and usage systems.   
 
Component 2. Strengthening Kayrakum Reservoir Dykes and Related Drainage Control 
Works. 
 
This component finances design and works related to limited rehabilitation of the 
Kayrakum reservoir structures so as to increase operational performance and improve 
management of reservoir related water issues.  Investment include works for rehabilitation of 
dykes at the upper end of the reservoir, repairing, replacing and installation of tube well pumps 
along the dykes that reduce water logging of land area in proximity of dykes, including 
electromechanical controls and necessary pipelines and canals.    
 
Component 3.  Institutional Development and Technical Assistance.  
This component will 
fund the necessary institutional capacity building for (i) establishment of water users 
associations, (ii) improving agricultural productivity and more efficient water use patterns, (iii) 
ensuring proper environmental mitigating activities, and most importantly, (iv) provide the 
necessary TA to improve reservoir and dam operations as well as developing effective safety 
and emergency procedures for the Kayrakum dam.  Activities will include training, 
demonstration activities as well as information dissemination exercises and technical 
assistance from international and local specialists.  
 
Component 4. Project Management
.
This component will fund assistance to the CPMU and 
RPIU established for project implementation.  Items to be covered include (i) establishment 
and support of two project implementation entities, namely a Central Project Management Unit 
(CPMU) in Dushanbe within the MMWRM and a Regional Project Implementation Unit 
(RPIU) in Khujand, (ii) local and international technical assistance for managerial, technical, 
financial and administrative supervision of implementation activities, (iii) setup and operation 
of a project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system, and (iv) a supportive institutional 
strengthening program including relevant training and study tours.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
This project, focused on the northern region (Suhgd Oblast) of Tajikistan, the eastern most 
portion of the multi-national Ferghana Valley, aims to combine purely national benefits in 
terms of improving local irrigation and drainage systems, while simultaneously reestablishing 
the safety  and improve operations of Kayrakum Dam and Reservoir, thereby, benefiting 
riparian, as well as Tajikistan herself.  The area covered under the project includes a fairly 
narrow strip of land of between the reservoir levies and the mountain foothills.   The soil 
composed of accumulated sedimentation in this natural basin is highly fertile and allows for 
some of the highest crop yields in Tajikistan.  Due to its proximity to the reservoir and the high 
water table, it is crucial to maintain extraction pumps operating, especially in the spring when 
snow melts are raising the water levels in the reservoir and generating floods on the land in 
proximity to the reservoir levies.  
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A
[
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
Comments: 
The environmental effects of the project, if any will be minor and indirect. The 
civil works consist mostly of earth moving, concrete works, laying of under ground pipes, 
rehabilitation of existing canal structures, all of which are fairly small scale works for which 
environmental mitigation measures will be part of the contractor quality manual that will be 
part of each contract award. Adequate measures will be taken to ensure minimum dust 
generation and soil losses as well as ensuring proper regeneration of vegetative cover once 
works are completed.  The improved water management will reduce flooding thus significantly 
improve water quality for residents themselves as well as for populations residing downstream 
of the reservoir and who depend on the water from Kayrakum for irrigation as well as drinking 
water. The project will not affect or degrade any critical natural habitats in the region.

An Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were prepared during project 
preparation, financed from the PHRD funds.  These documents will be available from the Bank’s InfoShop and 
also in the Borrower’s MM&WRM) in early March 2005.   
The EA report describes the necessary environmental management procedures and technical prerequisites for 
maintaining good environmental practice regarding the proposed interventions at the project sites.  Each major 
technical design will be subject to the applicable environmental procedures of Tajikistan, which currently includes 
an environmental permit procedure and, for most activities, an environmental impact assessment (known as State 
Environmental Review, or SER).  The EMP establishes a framework for the identification and implementation of 
environmental protection, mitigation, and monitoring and institutional strengthening measures to be taken during 
project implementation to avoid or eliminate negative environmental and social impacts. 
The EMP is considered part of overall project implementation and will be annexed to the Project Implementation 
Plan.  The Development Grant Agreement has a covenant requiring execution of the EMP by the Borrower, which 
has been fully budgeted.  Oversight of the implementation of the EMP will be the responsibility of the Borrower.  
The CPMU will act on behalf of the Borrower and will have an environmental specialist as part of their staff for the 
duration of the project.  Monitoring of environmental and social indicators will allow the RPIU to determine the 
direct and indirect environmental and social impacts of project activities and, where necessary, take appropriate 
actions or make corrections to project activities in order to prevent or lessen any adverse impacts detected.  The 
PIU will report on EMP implementation in its regular semi-annual project reporting to government and IDA, and 
supervision missions will evaluate progress in its implementation.   
 
Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
/
GP
4.01) 
A
draft EA has been prepared and is has had an initial review by the safeguards team.  The 
overall impact of the project will have a positive impact upon the environment due to better 
control of water flows and reduction in water pollution as yearly floods in residential areas will 
be greatly reduced. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
The team confirmed that no new tube wells will be established under the project. The Rapid 
Social Assessment confirmed that there will be no new restriction of access for grazing as a 
result of project activities, and access to drinking water of acceptable quality will be greatly 
improved with the rehabilitation of  tube well pumps and facilities.  
 
Safety of Dams
(
OP
/
BP
4.37) 
While this OP is automatically triggered by the works to be undertaken on the levies and dykes 
along the reservoir, general dam safety and the flood risk from breaches in the levies will be 
diminished by the rehabi
litation works
and improved operating procedures
.
The team has 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
furthermore been consulting a dam safety specialist on actions related to dam safety issues.  The 
planned project activities include updating the dam safety studies; providing provisional funds to 
deal with critical issues of dam safety; establishing a panel consisting of local and international 
experts in the country to conduct yearly inspection and monitoring of the dam, all of which are 
deemed satisfactory to fulfill the requirements of OP/BP4.37.    
 
Projects on International Waterways
(
OP
/
BP
/GP 7.50) 
Since the project involves irrigation rehabilitation works and is on the Syr Darya river, which is 
an international waterway for the purposes of the Bank OP/BP 7.50, the ISDS triggered the OP 
7.50. The project team has obtained an exemption from the Bank, since the main works will 
involve rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigation and drainage systems, and no new 
schemes will be developed
.
The rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes will not 
involve any adverse impacts on the quality and quantity of water in the international waters, but 
rather it will lead to more effective irrigation and drainage of the water, and maximization of the 
reservoir volume available to riparian countries.  
Any development in upstream countries’ water 
use regimes will not have adverse effects on the areas to be rehabilitated.   
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area. 
 
No long term negative impacts are expected as a result of the project. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
(a) 
Piecemeal major infrastructure investments
.
The GOT has considered that its priority 
investments should be in repair and rehabilitation of major disparate water system infrastructure 
components (mainly pumping station systems), and not necessarily in needed improvements to 
the overall irrigated agriculture systems and services in the corresponding command areas.  
However, this approach has not been favored because such investments on their own would not 
be expected to (i) provide sufficient protection and security of operation of the major system 
components, (ii) allow for sustainable long-term O&M of the installations, and (iii) generate the 
agricultural and socio-economic benefits to render the investments viable over the long-
term.  
Hence the project comprises a full range of physical, socio-institutional and agricultural 
improvements for selected command areas.    
 
(b) 
Gravity system improvements with no dam and reservoir improvements
.
Because of the 
relatively modest resources available for the first project of the program, and because the GOT 
had not favored investments to improve Kayrakkum dam and reservoir safety and operations, a 
project that focused on gravity system improvements was outlined.  Such a project would have 
resulted in physical and operational improvements primarily to gravity surface irrigation and 
drainage systems, aimed at improving efficiencies and generating water savings, and hence at 
reducing the dependency on pumped systems.  Financially and economically less attractive 
investments in pumping station systems rehabilitation would have been postponed.  Also, since 
such a project would have no dependency on the dam and reservoir, investments for those would 
also have been postponed.  However, the strategic importance of the reservoir-based pumped 
irrigation systems led to this approach not being adopted.  Nevertheless, some elements of this 
al
ternative approach have been retained.  Improvements to high
-
lift pumping systems not based 
Page  6
on the reservoir are not being included at this stage, while efficiency improvements continue as 
an important feature.   
 
(c) 
Development of new lands
.
Some potential for the development of new lands for 
irrigated agriculture may exist, and there have been suggestions that such development could be 
effected under the project.  The potential for such development remains to be established through 
project-related water resource studies.  In any event, the inclusion of new lands development into 
the project has been rejected primarily because of the higher priority to be given to proper 
physical and operational restoration of existing systems. 
 
(d) 
Full command area developments
.
The principle of complete and integrated command 
area development would require that all needed improvements both physical and non-physical be 
completed under the project for any given command area.  Although considered desirable, a full 
adherence to this has not been allowed for.  This is because of the only partial progress and 
success to date of the land reform process.  Primary (off-farm) and some key secondary (inter-
farm) physical system improvements are to be implemented on a command-area basis, while full 
completion of other secondary (inter-farm) and all tertiary and lower-order (on-farm) physical 
improvements, and corresponding socio-institutional and agricultural development programs, are 
to be implemented only for selected systems and areas corresponding to predominantly 
privatized lands. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A
Social Assessment as well as an Environmental Assessment have been contracted as part of 
the  preparation  of  this project.   Work on the EA began with a first mission (11-23 November 
2004) by the FAO environment officer, who worked with the EAMP team of specialists, 
gathering the baseline information for the EA, visiting the proposed project areas, viewing 
various irrigation and drainage sites, and meeting with national and local officials, 
representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), farmers and other beneficiaries of 
the proposed project. Working with the FAO environment officer, the PPU contracted a larger 
group of national environmental specialists to gather and analyze additional information for the 
EA in the areas of biodiversity and natural habitat, soil and water quality, and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements. 
 
During a second EA mission (14-17 December 2004) the EAMP team held public consultations 
workshop in Khojand where it presented the preliminary work of the national specialists. The 
workshop was attended by local government officials, international experts and project 
beneficiaries. The project workshop allowed the EAMP team to exchange ideas on the technical, 
social and environmental aspects of the project. Further consultations will held in the project area 
in early March 2005, where the EAMP team will present the final draft EAMP for discussion and 
comment by local officials and project beneficiaries. 
 
A
Rapid Social Assessment has been completed in the area that and has not found any significant 
s
ocial issues that need to be addressed under the project.   Overall the implementation of the 
Page  7
project will have a largely positive impact over the population of the region without any negative 
aspects for the population or individual groups. There are no resettlements, and since no new 
structures will be added, to the system currently in place, access to people, livestock or farm 
animals will in no way be impeded.  Overall improvements in water management will have 
significant health benefits since water contamination from floods will be reduced and many 
water born diseases eliminated.    
 
Overall the borrower’s institutional capacity for safeguards is weak and needs strengthening. 
During the project preparation this process was started, however, it will be continued during 
project implementation.  The PMU staff will include an environmental specialist who will work 
in close cooperation with the SCNP.  During the course of the project, small informal surveys 
will be undertaken among the populations of towns in the project areas to assess the population’s 
impressions of project impacts.   Although there is weak capacity at the borrower’s level, 
supporting TA, extensive training at the level of the PPU personnel who will be transferred to the 
PMU, ensure adequate knowledge of  Bank safeguards on the ground.  Further more, the Bank 
has funded several projects in the region each handling the safeguards issues to satisfaction. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders for this project include the national and local institutions directly involved 
in water management (i.e. MMWRM and the Soghd Oblast WRMD), as well as the Ministry of 
Agriculture, State Committee for Nature Protection , as well as the Ministries responsible for 
Energy and Health, local government institutions (i.e. raions and jamoats), local associations (i.e. 
WUAs) and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the project areas, and the beneficiaries 
themselves.   The EAMP as well as the SAR teams met with representatives of most of these 
stakeholders and discussed the project intent, the rehabilitation plans and works to be undertaken 
as well as the environmental and social aspects of the project. Through formation of WUAs that 
will participate in identifying areas and systems that need rehabilitation, local stakeholder have a 
direct input on how the works will be undertaken.  Similarly WUAs will play a direct role in 
acceptance of the works at the end of a contract to ensue that all the necessary environmental 
mitigation measures have been undertaken by the contractors responsible for that portion of the 
work.
