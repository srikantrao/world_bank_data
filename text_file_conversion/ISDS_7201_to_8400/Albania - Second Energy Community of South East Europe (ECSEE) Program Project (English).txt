A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Athens process aims at creating a functioning regional energy market in South East 
Europe, covering both electricity and gas.  The Energy Community of South East Europe 
(ECSEE) APL program supports the countries of South East Europe and Kosovo in the 
implementation of their electric power sector commitments under the Athens process.  
The World Bank may propose a separate APL program for the gas part of ECSEE once 
the proposed electricity APL program is underway.  
 
The key objectives of the ECSEE are: 
 
ƒ
Create a stable regulatory and market framework capable of attracting investment to the region 
in gas networks and power system so that all states in the region have access to the stable and 
continuous energy supply that is essential for economic development and social stability;  
ƒ
Establish integrated regional markets in South East Europe, closely linked to the internal energy 
market of the European Union, and fully complying with the rules applicable within the European 
Union; 
ƒ
Enhance the energy security of supply of South East Europe and the European Union by 
providing incentives to connect the Balkans to Caspian and North African gas reserves; and 
Page  2
ƒ
Improve the environmental situation in relation to energy in the region. 
 
The APL program would be considered successful if the countries in the region are able to fulfill their 
obligations under the Athens process and improve power supply in the region.  The countries will have to 
continue ongoing restructuring and reform measures, build up their institutions and improve their power 
systems including interconnections so that regional trade can increase.   
The APL #3 - 
Albania project would facilitate Albania’s participation in ECSEE by 
providing relevant investment support and technical assistance for Albania.  The 
objective of the investment is to extend the lifetime and improve the quality, reliability, 
safety and efficiency of the bulk power transmission system by replacing ageing existing 
facilities with new ones.  The technical assistance would serve to facilitate project 
implementation, strengthen the TSO, and improve both the tariff structure and the 
procurement procedures applicable to electricity imports.  The key performance 
indicators that would be used to assess the fulfillment of the project’s development 
objectives in terms of outcomes and outputs are given in Annex 3 of the PAD.
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
ECSEE is a regional program and the Bank investment support is being provided on a 
regional basis using the adaptable program lending (APL) instrument, horizontally to 
support ECSEE’s Regional Members (up to eight countries and Kosovo) and vertically 
(each Regional Member can in principle receive support from more than one APL 
installment over the APL program period).  The APL instrument enables the Bank to 
provide support in a flexible manner - when individual countries have met the policy 
triggers (country criteria under the Athens process) and when individual projects are 
ready to receive Bank support.  All ECSEE Regional Members might not actually borrow 
under the APL program.  However, countries would know up-front that they can rely on 
the Bank to support them in achieving the goals of the ECSEE if they meet specific 
eligibility criteria and if they need Bank support.  The approved size of the APL lending 
facility is US$1,000 million, of which US$ 24 million equivalent is proposed for Albania 
under APL #3
.
The key policy and institutional elements for the APL program have been defined and 
established in the Athens process.  ECSEE is a regional program, with strong country 
commitment and with well-established coordination mechanisms at the highest political 
level (a Ministerial Council), at the level of regulators and transmission companies in the 
region, as well as among donors supporting the program, plus a the South East Europe 
Energy Regulation Forum (the Athens Forum) which brings them all together with other 
stakeholders.  The APL program will enable the Bank to provide regional financial 
support, yet financing can be tailored to the needs of individual countries to help them 
meet their commitments to ECSEE.   
Page  3
The Bank’s March 2004 framework paper 
1
highlights that significant investments are 
required in power generation, transmission and distribution for a well-functioning power 
market.  The Bank would therefore be prepared to consider a broad range of investments 
for support under the APL program.   
 
The ECSEE APL #3 - Albania project will consist of: 
ƒ
replacement of high-voltage equipment in the transmission substations at Burreli, Elbasan 1, 
Elbasan 2, Fier, Fierza, and Tirana 1, and replacement of control and protection equipment in the 
transmission substations at Burreli, Elbasan 2, Fier, Fierza, Komani and Vau Dejes; and  
ƒ
technical assistance for: 
ƒ
procurement activities and supervision of project implementation; 
ƒ
strengthening the Transmission System Operator (TSO); 
ƒ
an electricity tariff study; and 
ƒ
improving procurement procedures for electricity imports. 
Most of the equipment in the existing transmission substations is more than 30 years old and based on 
outdated technology, with the result that many needed spare parts are not available in world markets.  The 
transformers and some other equipment are being replaced by KESH, EBRD and EIB.  The proposed 
project covers the remaining equipment requirements in these transmission substations.

Comments: 
 
The classification of the overall ECSEE APL program is FI.  The APL #3 - Albania 
project consists entirely of replacement of existing equipment in the existing locations.  
There would be no land acquisition.  The environmental issues to be addressed are 
expected to be: avoidance of PCBs in equipment purchased under the project; ensuring 
that sewage water from substations is properly disposed of; movement of men, materials 
and equipment during construction/erection (noise, dust); and minimizing noise and 
communication interferences during operation.  Although the environmental impact is 
expected to be minimal, a Category B is being assigned to the project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
As stated above, the APL #3 - Albania project consists entirely of replacement of existing 
equipment in the existing locations.  There would be no land acquisition.  As such, the 
environmental impact is expected to be minimal.  An Environmental Management Plan 
acceptable to the Bank was prepared by KESH.  It has been disclosed in Albania, 
submitted to the Bank and submitted to the InfoShop prior to appraisal. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not relevant. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Su
bstantial institutional capacity to implement the Bank’s safeguard policies has been 
developed by KESH through the implementation of five previous projects.  KESH has 
established and is strengthening an environmental cell with technical assistance financed 
under the Power Sector Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. 
 
The Bank’s standard environmental requirements will apply to the APL #3 – Albania project. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
KESH has carried out public consultations in the preparation of the EMP, and the EMP 
has been disclosed in Albania.
