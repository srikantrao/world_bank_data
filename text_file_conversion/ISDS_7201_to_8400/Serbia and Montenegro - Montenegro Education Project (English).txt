A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed Project would be to build the capacity of the education 
system to make continuous improvements, especially in the area of the quality of 
teaching and learning in schools and the efficient use of budgetary resources.  The target 
beneficiaries are therefore teachers, principals and central ministry/agency staff.  Changes 
in their behavior during the project will lead to improvements in services provided to 
students and, in due course, increases in learning outcomes. 
 
Key indicators will be: 
 
·
Teachers engaging in behavior known to lead to increases in student learning and 
students using new learning materials in the classroom (measured through 
classroom observations under the new school quality assurance model and 
periodic surveys). 
 
·
Reduction in education arrears and increases in non-salary current expenditure as 
a
proportion of the government budget on primary and secondary education 
(measured through figures from the Ministry of Finance). 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The Project has two components which target key priorities for effectively implementing the Government’s 
education reform program and which are complementary to activities supported by other donors. 
 
Component 1:  Reform Implementation 
(approximately $3.4 million from the Credit). 
Page  2
Under this component, support would be provided to extend the number of primary and 
general secondary schools included in the Government’s reform program.  About 50 
additional schools, additional to those being funded by the Government, would be 
supported from the Credit.  The Project would pay for the various parts of the package of 
interventions that reform schools receive, such as textbooks and learning materials, staff 
professional development, school equipment, and minor renovations.  The existing 
institutions would be used: the BES would be used to organize teacher and school 
director training, the MOES would be responsible for determining and meeting the 
equipment and renovation needs of schools, the Textbook Department would oversee 
textbook development and, when established, the Examination Centre would develop the 
assessments. 
 
Component 2.  Education Planning and Finance
(approximately $1.1 million from the 
Credit). 
 
The Project would: 
a. 
Build capacity to prepare, execute and monitor a program budget; 
b.  Promote the collection and use of up-do-date data, by making the school 
management information system electronic, and by creating a Strategy and 
Planning Unit which would use this data as part of policy analysis and 
planning; 
c. 
Support the rationalization of the school network and staffing levels to 
restructure the budget; and 
d.  Assist the Government to determine and implement an effective plan for 
decentralization of education finance. 
 
Unallocated
.
In addition to these planned project components, approximately $0.5 million of the Credit 
will be unallocated to be able to respond to new needs that arise during the implementation of the reform 
that cannot now be anticipated.  These funds would be allocated during the annual project planning process. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
National scope, with specific locations for different activities to be identified during 
project preparation and implementation.  No physical characteristics relevant to the 
safeguard analysis.
