B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project has as its main development objective to assist Congo in the mitigation of 
the current crisis of the education sector, and to establish the grounds for a solid development of 
a medium and long term sector program. To achieve this objective the proposed project will 
support the improvement of the quality of the education services offered in primary and lower 
secondary by supporting a national school improvement program;  and will build the capacity of 
the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to Monitor, Plan and Evaluate the Provision of 
Education services. The capacity building component of the project will provide elements for the 
preparation of a Sector Wide Program, that will provide a coherent vision of the sector, and will 
state the short medium and long term goals for each of the sub-sectors. To complement the 
capacity building project activities, the support of a PHRD grant will also be sought.   
 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project would build from the current strengths found in the sector, and 
would help mitigate the current crisis and establish the grounds for the future development 
of the sector. The proposed project will have four components 1) Capacity Building for 
Education Planning and Management; 2) Rehabilitation of the school infrastructure; 3) 
Page  2
 
 
Support to Improvement of Quality of Education; and 4) Support to out of school youth 
and vulnerable populations. 
  
Component 1 
Capacity Building of the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education. (Estimated cost 
including operating costs US$1,5 M).
 
 The objective of this component would be to reinforce 
the capacity of the Planning Unit of the MEPS (DEP). In particular this intervention will build 
the capacity to establish and manage and Education Management Information System, that will 
help to develop a coherent and efficient Education Sector Program with a medium and long term 
vision. This component will provide technical assistance to enable the DEP to produce on an 
annual basis, education sector reports containing relevant information related to the performance 
of the sector and the policy options available to introduce modifications to improve the quality of 
the education system. The EMIS will share the data bases among the 3 Ministries concerned in 
the sector, as well as the institutions such as INRAP, ENI, ENS and the Ministry of Finance.  
 
Component 2  
Rehabilitation of the School Infrastructure. (Estimated cost US$ 9M) 
The objective of this component will be to rehabilitate the school buildings that have been 
damaged during the war, and or deteriorated by the lack of maintenance. Also it will provide 
school furniture to those schools were the needs are more intensified. In order to strengthen the 
existing school management infrastructures, and the community-based organizations, this 
component will be managed in a decentralized approach and on a demand- driven basis. It is 
proposed that the rehabilitation of the schools be made based on School Plans prepared by the 
School Management Committees, and that the Management of the civil works component be 
done by the Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement of Living Conditions Project Unit 
(PURICV). 
 
Component 3 
Support to the improvement of quality of education (Estimated costs US$ 5,5M)
 
This component will consolidate the experience initiated by  MEPS, and INRAP with support 
from the French Cooperation. The project will provide support to continue the adaptation of the 
textbooks and teaching guides for primary and junior secondary, and will provide support to 
guarantee access to textbooks in the 4 core subjects to all students enrolled in primary and junior 
secondary. This component will also support in-service training for all teachers currently in the 
classroom, and training for all primary and Junior secondary school Directors.  
 
Component 4 
Support to out of school youth, and children in special needs (orphans, pygmies)(Estimated costs US$ 
1M)
 
The objective of this component will be to provide support to the expansion of programs for out of school 
children that have been initiated by the Division of Alphabetization of MEPS with support from the 
French Cooperation and UNICEF. These programs are targeting the young aged 14-18 who have never 
been to school, and are providing literacy and numeracy programs for them, using the formal schools 
infrastructure. This component will also explore the possibility of providing grants to children from poor 
families who can not afford to go to secondary school. The current expansion of private schools, and the 
crisis of human resources trained in the system call for an alternative for expansion of the system in 
particular in secondary education.  The objective of the grants will be to provide support for students with 
good achievement records and lack of resources to attend private schools. This component will be a pilot

test to evaluate the capacity of expansion of the private school system using financial resources provided 
by the state. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will have national coverage 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Republic of Congo has several Bank Projects in implementation, with satisfactory capacity 
for safeguard policies implementation.
