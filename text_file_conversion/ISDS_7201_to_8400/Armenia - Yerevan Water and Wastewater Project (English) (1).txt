B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project development objective is to improve the efficiency, management, operation, delivery 
and financial sustainability of water and wastewater services for the Yerevan service area. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Detailed project preparation is currently underway. US$2 million project preparation facility 
(PPF) finances study on investment strategy for Yerevan Water Supply Company (YWSC), 
recommendation for future private sector involvement in managing and operating the company 
upon planned expiration of the existing management contract, preparation of future operator 
contract documentation, and social and environmental analyses. 
 
The project will have three components: Strengthening of Management of YWSC,  Technical 
Assistance and Training, and Investment Fund.

Component 1  STRENGTHENING OF MANAGEMENT OF YWSC 
 
Study on the solution and form of the future private sector involvement in managing and 
operating the company upon expiration of the existing management contract (May 2005) is 
underway.  This component will finance YWSC management strengthening, including any 
management contract fees. 
 
Component 2  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING  
 
Incremental Operating Expenses of the MDPMU:
Component will cover general expenses for the Municipal Development Fund Management Unit 
(MDPMU), as well as refunding the PPF advance. 
 
General Expenses of YWSC:
Amounts will be provided for procurement of necessary office and communications equipment 
for the YWSC, as well as annual financial and technical audits. 
 
Training and Re-qualification
:
This subcomponent provides training expenses to be shared with Municipal Water and 
Wastewater Project (MWWP) for establishment of a central training and re-qualification facility 
and development of training programs to familiarize water utilities staff and Armenian 
contractors with operations requirements, and new technologies, materials, equipment and 
methods used in well-managed water and wastewater utilities. 
 
Chemical/Bacteriological and Water Meter Testing Laboratories:
Subcomponent will provide funds to co-finance with MWWP a central national laboratory for 
analyzing water abstracted and distributed to consumers and effluents discharged into the 
environment, as well as water meter testing laboratory. 
 
Component 3  INVESTMENT FUND  
 
Sectorization of three Yerevan districts is expected to be completed before the closing date of the 
MDP.  However due to limited funds, it will only be possible to implement part of the works and 
partial procurement of goods necessary for first stage sectorization of remaining districts within 
the existing project. 
 
Thus, this component will finance : 
 
·
network sectorization
in the remaining five of Yerevan's eight districts; 
·
provision of 24-hour water supply
throughout the city; 
·
metering
all remaining unmetered customers. 
 
Pending results of project preparation studies now underway, this component also is expected to 
finance investments to convert water transmission lines from pumping to gravity, and for 
wastewater collection system improvements.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. 
 
Regional Review Panel meeting was held on 19 March 2004.  As for repeater project no special 
QER is necessary. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
PAD-stage ISDS will be prepared by September 2004. 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
A
draft environmental assessment report has been submitted to the Bank and the final report is 
scheduled to be completed by July 2004.  The report contains environmental management plan 
framework (EMPF), incorporating experience gained under the first project (MDP), and 
providing comprehensive screening mechanism of the sub-projects under the new credit. 
 
The project will be mostly rehabilitating existing infrastructure, not extending service to new 
areas, therefore the project presents no land acquisition or resettlement issues.
