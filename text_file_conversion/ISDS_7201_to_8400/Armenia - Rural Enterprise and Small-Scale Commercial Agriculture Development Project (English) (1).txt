B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 3 of PCN]
To improve the ability of Armenia’s farmers and rural entrepreneurs
 to access markets and increase 
employment opportunities by stimulating market
-
oriented private and public investments in rural areas.
C.  Project Description 
[from section 4 of PCN]
The major focus of the project would be to support the continued develo
pment of commercial activities in 
the rural areas by improving market linkages, product quality, competitiveness and capacity of Armenian 
rural entrepreneurs and producers.  The project will have a four
-
tiered approach by addressing critical 
gaps at the fa
rm level, at the community (village) level, at the rural business and agro
-
processor level, and 
at the government level.  The project will also build on the experience of the previous World Bank funded 
Agricultural Reform Support Project (ARSP). 
a) Small
 Rural Business and Agro
-
Processor Support
.  An increasing number of small and medium 
businesses are being established in rural areas for processing, service provision and production activities.  
These activities are both agricultural and non
-
agricultural 
in their scope, and, to a large extent, represent 
the engines of growth and a key source of rural employment.  Many of these emerging businesses have 
been supported during their establishment phases by various donor programs.  However, their continuing 
Page  2
dev
elopment is limited by an insufficient range of financial and business management services and poor 
access to technological improvements to improve their competitiveness.  Accordingly, the component 
would  provide  support  to  the  further  development  of  small
  rural  businesses  and  agro
-
processors, 
including: (a) improved financial services such as credit for working capital requirements, long
-
term 
credit  for  investment  purposes,  development  of  leasing  programs  for  processing  and  agricultural 
equipment, and deve
lopment of improved insurance products; (b) small grants provided on a competitive 
basis to test and disseminate technological improvements that could improve market access; (c) provision 
of management and business advice and market studies by local busine
ss development centers.  The 
project would work primarily with existing finance and business institutions to provide these services, and 
with developing and start
-
up rural businesses, registered associations and other legal entities.
b) Farm
-
Focused Devel
opment Support
.  There is a substantial need to improve both the productivity 
and efficiency of rural producers and the quality of production in order to better serve the emerging 
markets.  To accomplish this goal, three main areas have been identified, in
cluding strengthening the 
decentralized advisory services system, improving livestock services, and improving access to planting 
material.  An extension system covering each Marz has been established with support through the present 
ARSP, but there is a ne
ed to streamline the service to improve efficiency and to expand outreach.  The 
veterinary system has been re
-
structured in 2004 to allow private veterinarians at the village level to be 
contracted to carry out government programs for the control of notifi
able animal diseases including those 
that pose a public health risk as well as to provide paid services for animal health problems at the farm 
level.  As a result, the time is now ripe to support this welcome development as well as other livestock 
services
.  There is also a substantial need to improve farmers’ access to quality seeds and seedlings, 
including introduction of varieties that may better provide for the needs of the developing agro
-
processing 
sector.  Accordingly, three main sub
-
components have 
been identified, including: (a) strengthening the 
decentralized agricultural extension system to improve linkages with village
-
level authorities; to increase 
the  effectiveness  of  the  flow  of  information  on  technological  improvements;  to  further  develop  the
technology assessment program and on
-
farm demonstration activities, especially with topics likely to 
improve production quality and farm
-
level storage and processing; and to improve links with the research 
system; (b) improving delivery of livestock servi
ces to the farm level such as improved veterinary health 
care, improved feeding systems, artificial insemination and breeding improvements; (c) strengthening 
seed and seedling production capability of Armenian producers.
c) Community
-
Focused Economic Deve
lopment
.  The component objective is to create a replicable 
model for a community
-
driven revitalization process in rural areas focusing on market linkage.  
The 
project would work through existing or newly formed village organizations or other community gro
ups 
that have been democratically elected and represent the interests of a broad constituency.  The project 
support would include training, with the aim of increasing the capacity of the community groups to 
develop,  implement  and  monitor  their  action  plans
,  to  engender  a  sense  of  self
-
help  and  mutual 
responsibility, and to empower the communities to take control of their own resources.  The community 
group would prepare a Community Development Plan (CDP), which would be the basis for delivery of 
project int
erventions to rural communities.  The component would support
 three broad categories: a) 
improved  resource  management;  b)  rural  market  access  infrastructure  improvement;  and  c)  income
-
generating activities.  
The project would support an initial investment 
program for the first two to three 
years of implementation of each approved CD.  
Choices of sub
-
projects would have to be determined 
mostly by the economic viability and the local community’s ability to contribute to improvement works 
and to sustain the in
vestment over the long term including covering of operation and maintenance.  
The 
component would be implemented in selected communities in one or two Marzes where the regional 
development process has being initiated.  Investments financed by the project w
ould be limited to an 
established  ceiling  per  inhabitant.    Investments  would  be  focused  on  public  goods,  although  private 
activities providing benefits for a large number of villagers may be financed if the community decides 
that the proposed activity is a
 priority.

d) Project Management
.  While the exact structure and location of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) 
would  be  determined  during  project  preparation,  the  project  would  support  the  establishment  and 
operations of a PIU in close linkage with the 
Ministry of Agriculture building on the experience of the 
present PIU of the ARSP, including financial management and procurement.
D.  Project location (if known)
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternativ
e locations 
under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation]
The project location is not yet known.  Some project activities will be carried out country wide (advisory 
services, financial services), while others will
 be limited to selected communities or regions (community 
driven development, agro
-
business support).  Project locations would be selected during project 
preparation.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
[Guideline: Bas
ed on past experience and other available information]
The borrower has set up three experienced well functioning project coordination centers that are dealing 
with rural development and natural resource issues and are implementing ongoing projects.  The 
proposed 
project would make use of their experienced staff.

The environmental assessment will identify categories of activities that are likely to be 
implemented under the project components based on experience and data from the 
ongoing Bank project in the rural area on research,
 extension and rural finance activities.  
This will allow the development of an environmental management plan for the project 
activities.

The project will support activities to test and disseminate technological improvements; small grants for 
income  generating  ac
tivities  in  the  production  and  processing  functions;  and  rehabilitation  of 
infrastructure supporting rural markets, e.g. roads.  At this early stage of preparation, the activities that 
will be supported, and the infrastructure to be rehabilitated have not 
been identified.  It is anticipated, 
however,  that  following  the  next  preparation  mission  in  October  2004,  there  will  be  more  clarity 
regarding the general types of activities that could be financed under the project.  With this information 
and the experie
nce from activities under the ongoing agricultural project, an environmental management 
plan (EMP) will be prepared.
