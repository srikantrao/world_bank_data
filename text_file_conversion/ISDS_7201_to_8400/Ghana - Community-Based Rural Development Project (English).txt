Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Although OP 4.01; 4.12 and 4.36 could be triggered, no major environmental and social 
impacts are likely to occur:  Most potential impacts are either likely to be neutral 
(construction of a village marketplace) or positive or  provide environmental services 
(e.g. storage of rainwater in shallow dams, rehabilitation of degraded landscapes for 
carbon sequestration and protection of watersheds and water catchment areas). The only 
sub-project that may cause OP 4.36 to trigger may be the construction of feeder roads 
through forest reserves or protected areas. As indicated in the ESMF, in such instances 
the district assemblies, in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
will first undertake a screening to determine the potential magnitude of the threats and 
then commission and supervise the conduct of an environmental and social impact 
assessment and preparation of an environmental and social management plan. For the 
implementation of other sub-projects, forest reserves and protected areas will be avoided 
and sites outside these areas will be the preferred options.  With regard to the questions 
raised at Section III of the ISDS and related to OP 4.36, the Borrower has taken steps to 
resolve issues around (i) weak forestry sector policy, legal and institutional frameworks; 
(ii) weak forestry sector capacities; and (iii) inadequate local community and private 
sector engagement. These include the completion of revisions and reviews of old policies, 
legal and institutional frameworks related to forestry and natural resources management 
and implementing the revised frameworks to ensure transparency in resource allocation, 
conservation and sustainable management of existing forests and protected areas and 
promotion of active participation of local people and the private sector in the long-term 
sustainable management of forests.  Government of Ghana is also implementing a 
comprehensive and envir
onmentally sound biodiversity, forestry conservation and

claims on the disputed areas

development plan. Great emphasis has been placed by government in establishing 
institutional capacity to implement and enforce these commitments. Natural resource and 
agricultural projects under the ongoing VIP show that environmental aspects were taken 
into consideration and potential impacts monitored (deforestation did not occur at 
irrigation sites). Thus it can be said that this project, being a continuation of the VIP, will 
have overall positive impacts on the environment. It is unlikely that the implementation 
of project activities would result in land take, loss of shelter or loss of assets or source of 
income and means of livelihoods. Contrarily, it is expected that the livelihoods and 
income levels of rural people and other project-affected persons would be enhanced 
through the project. However, the Borrower has prepared for the unforeseen and has 
established a contingency arrangement and process by formulating in a consultative and 
participatory fashion an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and 
a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which while responding to WB and 
Government of Ghana requirements will provide the framework for dealing with any 
potential threats that may emanate during the implementation phase of project activities. 
It has been agreed with the Borrower and this is contained in the ESMF and RPF that in 
cases where implementation of project activities are likely to cause adverse social and 
environmental concerns/impacts (also where OP 4.36 is likely to trigger) project-related 
Environmental Impact Assessments and Resettlement Plans will be prepared, disclosed 
widely and implemented in a participatory manner prior to commencement of these sub-
projects. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Main results of safeguards policy-related studies: no major impacts; those impacts that 
pertain to the project are given in sections 4 and 5 of the PAD. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The Borrower has developed an ESMF and RPF to reflect any concerns that may be 
raised under OP 4.01; 4.12 and 4.36. The Borrower’s capacity to implement and monitor 
the implementation of frameworks and to conduct impact assessments is adequate and 
satisfactory.  The Borrower’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is present in every 
administrative region and beside their other functions are tasked to provide technical 
support to the district assemblies (DA) through the DAs’ own subcommittee called the 
District Environmental management Committees (DEMC). DEMCs have been trained 
under a number of projects and initiatives including the World Bank-supported 
Environmental Resource Management Project, Community Water and Sanitation Project 
and Village Infrastructure Project,  the UNDP-financed Capacity Building in 
Environmental Management Project and the GTZ-financed Building Capacities of 
District Capitals Project.  The EPA together with the DAs, Rural Infrastructure 
Coordinating Units (RICU), Area Councils (AC) will be screening all sub-projects 
submitted to the DAs, develop terms of references and advise on the need to undertake 
Page  4
EIAs and supervise implementation of environmental and social management plans 
(ESMP) and resettlement plans (RP) any time the need arises. EPA will ensure 
compliance monitoring and exercise of due diligence. There are a lot more non-
governmental organizations, research and academic institutions  present locally that can 
be trusted with undertaking social and environmental impact assessments and also 
implementing, monitoring and evaluating ESMPs and RPs.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Essentially the proposed project is a capacity building project targeted at local 
administration ( District Assemblies) and communities to enable them use the 
infrastructure and services delivered to them in a sustainable manner. Under the proposed 
project, beneficiary communities will be assisted through appropriate training programs 
and other capacity enhancement procedures to identify need, develop community and 
district plans in a participatory process, access development funds through the project and 
other sources to implement priority programs in a sustainable manner.  
Public consultation and participation were deemed essential as it contributed both to the 
design and implementation of micro-projects. The public consultations will take place at 
the inception of the micro-project at the level of local communities assisted by local 
NGOs, leaders, elders and service providers. Consultations will occur throughout the 
entire project cycle (a) socio-economic study, (b) the resettlement plan, (c) the 
environmental impact assessment, and (d) during the drafting and reading of the 
compensation contract. This is compliant with the primary objective of the CBRDP, 
which is to ensure a participatory approach towards community driven development. 
 
The ESMF and RPF were done by local and international consultants who worked 
closely with all sections of stakeholder and project-affected groups. These reports have 
been disclosed widely through deposition at public libraries and repositories including 
state ministries and their departments and agencies, regional administration offices and 
district assemblies as well as EPA national and regional offices. The Borrower has 
conducted public hearings and workshops for various communities in participating 
district assemblies to collate views and comments and to disseminate the project and the 
ESMF and RPF.  The Borrower’s EPA has approved the ESMF and the RPF and has 
committed to ensure the full role out in the field during the implementation phase of the 
project.
