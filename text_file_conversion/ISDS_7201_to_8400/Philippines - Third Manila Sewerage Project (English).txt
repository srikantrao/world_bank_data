B. Project Objective

The main project development objective is to improve and expand sewerage and sanitation
services in the East Zone concession of the MWSS service area by providing cost-effective
investments. The project is expected to reduce the further pollution of Pasig River, Manila Bay,
Laguna Lake and other tributaries in and around Metro Manila. Also, the project is expected to
have a significant impact on improving the living conditions of mostly low-income urban poor
who live in densely populated areas and along inland waterways.

Beneficiaries. The project will benefit directly an estimated 250,000 households with sewer
and sanitation services. Beneficiary communities will be selected using the following criteria:
(a) low to middle income level families; (b) availability of land for a sewage treatment plant;
and (c) willingness and capacity to pay of households for sewerage/sanitation services.



C. Project Description

The project will follow the same lending structure under Water Districts Development Project
(WDDP). IBRD loan will be lent to Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) that will on-lend to

MWCI (with guarantee from GOP). MWCI will implement the project and undertake loan
repayment responsibility. The project will be consistent with ADB's Pasig River Rehabilitation
Project which is financing the construction of a US$10 million sanitation facility and tankers.
The project will have the following major components:

Sewerage systems and treatment. This component will involve the construction of sewage
pipelines and treatment plants (STPs) in several locations in the MWCI concession area. Some
of the STPs will treat combined sewage and drainage flows. Existing primary treatments would
also be upgraded to secondary level of treatment.

Septage management. This component would include the construction of septage treatment
plants to process septage from domestic septic tanks. This component would allow full coverage
of the East Zone concession area in terms of sanitation services.

Implementation. LBP has a Project Management Office with extensive experience in the
preparation and implementation of similar projects. Through the implementation of the ongoing
WDDP, LBP and MWCI have developed an effective working relationship. As this project is a
follow-up to the ongoing WDDP, it will basically follow the existing arrangements in terms of
Bank lending and institutional arrangements of WDDP.
