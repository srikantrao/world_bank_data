B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The main development objective is to create an efficient enabling environment for a competitive 
and sustainable mortgage market in which market-based, residential mortgage lenders (viz., 
banks and non-bank, real estate lending companies) can compete effectively on a level playing 
field to serve Egyptian households with longer-term mortgage loans that will improve the 
affordability of housing.  A complementary development objective is to reduce lending and 
funding risks for mortgage lenders and the investors in mortgage securities that will fund the 
mortgage market.  This will help to lower the costs of funds and mortgage lending rates in the 
market, thereby further improving housing affordability while also deepening capital market 
activity in the economy.  Project outputs would include an operational, secondary market 
liquidity facility, an improved regulatory framework for the mortgage market, and an improved 
property registration and titling system.  The project outputs would complement USAID support 
to strengthen the capacity of retail mortgage lenders and a new regulatory institution for non-
bank mortgage lenders.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project would help to establish a market-based liquidity facility, strengthen the regulatory 
framework, and modernize property rights registration.  The liquidity facility is expected to serve 
as a market mechanism for mobilizing medium-term funding from the capital market for 
residential mortgage lending.  It would extend refinancing loans of medium-term duration to 
eligible primary mortgage lenders which it would fund by issuing private bonds of similar 
duration.  This would help mortgage lenders such as banks to defray the liquidity and market 
risks imposed by the potential mismatching of maturities between their sources of funds and their 
uses of funds for longer-term mortgage loans.  The regulatory component would help to 
strengthen the Government’s capacity to regulate and oversee the mortgage market and the 
issuance of mortgage securities.  The property registration component would help to improve the 
efficiency of property rights registration in a portion of urban jurisdictions where mortgage 
demand is expected to be high.

The project is not expected to have any direct or adverse impact on the environment.  It would 
focus on improving the efficiency of the housing finance market and the property registration 
system.  The proposed liquidity facility would be a second-tier financial institution that would 
not lend directly to the retail housing market.  In combination, the project components should 
have a beneficial impact on the environment by helping to alleviate sub-standard housing 
conditions and to contribute to more orderly development of land.
