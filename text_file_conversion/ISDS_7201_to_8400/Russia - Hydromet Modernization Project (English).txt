A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The main development objective of the project is to improve RosHydromet’s capacity to 
provide weather and hydrological services and assure their effective and timely delivery 
to the Government and the public, by modernizing key elements of the technical base and 
strengthening RosHydromet’s institutional arrangements. All Russian citizens would then 
receive weather forecasts of higher quality.  This would enable enterprise and household 
adjustments to protect lives and support economic growth. 
 
The success of the proposed project would be measured in terms of improvements in the 
accuracy and precision of forecasting: more-timely emergency alerts to mitigate weather 
damage, improved seasonal forecasts accompanied by probabilistic information for 
decision support, renewal of RosHydromet's capacity to fulfill its role in worldwide 
meteorology as specified in international agreements, and development of a modernized 
concept of operations.  The latter should comprise compliance with national mandates 
and global treaties, growth in technical capacity, progress toward financial sustainability 
(including infrastructure maintenance and ongoing re-investment) and a sustainable 
approach to human resources issues.   
 
The project supports the higher-level objective of reducing the risk to life and the 
economy from unfavorable weather conditions.
 
The total annual direct losses in Russia 
associated with dangerous weather and hydrological events is estimated to be USD 1-2 
Page  2
billion
.
Recent massive economic losses and human casualties resulting from floods, 
avalanches and torrential storms in the North Caucasus, Siberia and the Far East have 
showed how vulnerable the Russian Federation is today with respect to weather hazards. 
The project also is intended to diminish damage to the economy that arises not only from 
avoidable weather damage but also from the high degree of uncertainty about weather 
risk that adds to the cost of doing business, limiting the competitiveness of Russian 
agriculture and other enterprises. The proposed project would build RosHydromet's 
capacity, strengthen it as an institution, and in this way strengthen the ability of the public 
sector to meet public needs. 
 
The proposed project supports t
wo strategic pillars of Russia’s 2002 CAS.  (i) It will 
strengthen public sector management
 by improving the efficiency and quality of public 
service delivery critical for improving the investment climate and supporting long-term 
growth. Improved efficiency and quality in weather forecasting will reduce risks to the 
economy and support investment, mitigating the risks of natural disaster that currently 
affect important infrastructure, agricultural and industrial areas. (ii) It will 
mitigate 
environmental risks
 by addressing environmental hazards and improving environmental 
management. A stronger hydrometeorological agency will mitigate the risks of floods, 
drought and fire, winds and extreme weather events and will support emergency 
preparedness associated with the potential damage resulting from industrial and other 
accidents. As well, the project will reduce social risk, by improving  security through 
measures to improve emergency warnings to the population. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The investments RosHydromet has proposed address priority needs that are indicated 
under all reasonable strategies for the agency's future development. Investments have 
been selected according to several  principles: (1) RosHydromet's core functions should 
not be compromised; (2) RosHydromet's capacity to forecast hazardous weather events in 
a
timely manner should be restored and improved; (3) RosHydromet's institutional and 
economic viability should be strengthened; (4) RosHydromet should ensure that Russia is 
able to comply with its national obligations to WMO. 
 
Component A. Modernization of 
Modernization of Computing, Archiving and 
Telecommunications 
 Facilities (US45.7 million baseline excluding contingencies and 
taxes, US$ 62.7 million estimated project costs)
 aims to upgrade computing capacity 
and capacity for transmission, archiving and retrieval of data through three 
subcomponents. The first subcomponent will support RosHydromet’s Moscow 
headquarters through the procurement of a supercomputer, and the archiving facilities at 
Obninsk through the modernization and upgrading of existing archiving facilities, with 
support for data rescue of data currently stored on about 50,000 magnetic tapes and other 
media.  In the second subcomponent, computing facilities will be upgraded at the two 
principal regional WMO centers, those at Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk, with the 
Page  3
procurement of two smaller supercomputers.  The third subcomponent will address 
RosHydromet’s communications system as a whole.  This will include the modernization 
of communications among RosHydromet’s principal facilities and also communications 
with selected high-priority measurement stations.  Communications and infrastructure 
required to support the modernized computer centers will be financed, including 
equipment to assure continuous power supply, investments in local and wide area 
networks and the supply of required peripheral equipment. Taken together, investments 
under this component are expected to significantly improve the timeliness and 
effectiveness of weather forecasts and to support data availability and sharing both within 
Russia and globally.  
 
Component B. Upgrading of the Observational Networks (US$42.0 million baseline 
excluding contingencies and taxes, US$58.9 million estimated project costs) 
is 
intended to modernize key components of RosHydromet’s meteorological and 
hydrological observational networks. There are five sub-components. 
 Upgrading of the 
surface network of meteorological stations
 will provide equipment for up to 900-1000 
surface meteorological stations which are important for regional and local forecasts. 
Upgrading of the aerological network 
will re-equip selected upper-air sounding stations. 
While the aerological network is important locally and regionally, it is the most important 
network investment in support of global forecasting:  these stations collect the three-
dimensional datasets of key meteorological variables that constitute the principal input to 
global weather models. 
Upgrading of weather radars
 will improve storm warning to the 
most important urban areas and to vulnerable coastal zones. 
Upgrading of selected 
regional hydrometeorological centers
 in the country will equip regional centers  with 
hardware and software to improve weather and flood forecasts.  It will provide equipment 
for visualization of data, for downloading of satellite data and improvement of 
communications capacity. These upgrades will improve prediction at every level, and 
will also support forest fire identification and environmental monitoring. 
Upgrading of 
selected parts of the hydrological network
 will upgrade about 300 priority hydrological 
posts nationally, and will upgrade the entire hydrological network in three high priority 
river basins with automatic and semi-automatic stations. Hydrological data complements 
meteorological forecasts to enable flood warnings and water resources management. 
 
Component C. Institutional Strengthening, Improvement in Information 
Dissemination and Emergency Preparedness (US$5.0 million baseline excluding 
contingencies and taxes, US$7.2 million estimated project costs) 
is intended to 
formulate, develop and test new operational principles drawn from worldwide 
experience, improve emergency warnings and improve provision of information to the 
clients. The work will be undertaken under three subcomponents: 
Institutional 
Strengthening 
would support development and testing of new principles and approaches 
aimed at institutional strengthening to make RosHydromet a viable, modern and client-
oriented agency. This subcomponent will formulate new requirements for the modernized 
RosHydromet system, undertake detailed design and test it in selected regional 
RosHydromet branches. This would help to modify the agency’s current planning and 
budgeting techniques, and operational and maintenance procedures.  It would help define 
proper configuration of the main elements of the system; including, for example, 
Page  4
automated monitoring, new forecast techniques, and modernization of management. The 
Client Service System
 will include design of a system (databases, networks and software) 
that will improve data availability, presentation and dissemination to ensure that 
information is supplied in useful formats to RosHydromet’s clients. Finally, 
Emergency 
Preparedness/Response
,
will undertake development of improved emergency warning 
procedures. This subcomponent would examine how information from RosHydromet is 
used for emergency preparedness, aiming to improve cooperation with local and regional 
authorities, the Ministry of Emergency and other concerned agencies during emergencies 
and for emergency preparedness planning. Principal investments would include technical 
assistance to define gaps in the system, procurement of equipment for emergency 
preparedness and resources for pilot testing in a few areas.  
 
Component D. Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$2.5 million 
baseline excluding contingencies and taxes, US$3.6 million estimated project costs)
 
will finance project management, supervision, and monitoring and evaluation of project 
impact. Progress monitoring will include periodic surveys tracking achievement of 
project development objectives and identifying improvements or actions necessary for the 
project’s success. Implementation arrangements for the project have been discussed with 
RosHydromet and the Ministry of Finance, and it was agreed that RosHydromet staff will 
be responsible for overall and technical project implementation issues. A small PIU will 
provide assistance to RosHydromet in such areas as procurement, financial management 
and disbursement. A key Consultant, the Design Integrator would assist RosHydromet 
during detailed project preparation and then later during implementation to ensure that a 
fully integrated national weather service is maintained. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Main project activities will be concentrated within the Roshydromet premises located in 
Moscow, Obninsk, Novosibirsk, and Khabarovsk. These activities will be primarily 
refurbishment of those sections in the buildings where new equipment will be placed. No 
land acquisition is expected. Renovation will be conducted within the existing 
Roshydromet buildings.    
 
Additional minor activities dealing primarily with the replacement of 
hydrometeorological instrumentation will be undertaken in many dozens sites elsewhere 
on the territory of Russia. Seven or eight weather radars located in various regions will be 
installed on the existing buildings which are used now for the similar purposes.
