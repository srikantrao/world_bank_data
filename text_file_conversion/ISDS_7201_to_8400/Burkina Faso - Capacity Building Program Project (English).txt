A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development goal of the project is to improve administration structures and processes 
in light of the decentralization policy, in order to yield measurable impact on provision of 
services to the citizens of Burkina. This would be achieved by establishing a reform 
process that will improve human and financial management systems and entrench a 
culture of capacity building in the administration. Activities financed under the Grant will 
focus on cross-cutting issues (decentralization, human resources management, public 
expenditure management, policy cycle) and on ownership and sustainability of the 
activities (reliance on local training institutes, linkages between capacity building 
activities financed by external financing and national budget through coordination with 
PRSCs and organization of budget requests from ministries including institutional 
development component).
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The instrument is a five-year technical assistance project. 
 
The project supports the implementation of the reform program in five ministries: the four cross-
cutting central ministries (Finances and Budget, Economy and Development, Civil Service, and 
Territorial Administration and Decentralization); and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of 
Health is targeted since it has undertaken substantial institutional reforms and has a key role in 
the attainment of the objectives of the PRSP
1
.
Each of the five ministries has adopted crucial 
reform measures or sector programs, but implementation remains a challenge. This is the case for 
the Ministry of Financ
e
and Budget and the Ministry of Economy and Development 
-
Budget

The Ministry of Education is supported by a program which includes a substantial institutional 
component, and will thus not be assisted through this project.

Management Strengthening Action Plan (PRGB) -, for the Ministry of Civil Service and State 
Reform (MFPRE) - Comprehensive Reform of Public Administration (RGAP) - , for the Ministry 
of Territorial Administration and Decentralization - Framework Laws on Decentralization 
(TODs), and for the Health Ministry (MH) - National Program of Health Development (PNDS)-
.
These five ministries requested the support of IDA and they were assisted in the design of an 
institutional action plan during the preparation of the project. The goal of the project is thus to 
focus on the implementation aspects of these reforms and programs. Implementation of 
institutional plans of the ministries will be coordinated with support to the two main local public 
sector training institutes, the Public Administration School (ENAM) and the Financial 
Administration School (ENAREF). The project will also support the Prime Minister’s office to 
strengthen its key role of inter-ministerial coordination, starting with an analysis of its current 
capacity to fulfill its mission.
