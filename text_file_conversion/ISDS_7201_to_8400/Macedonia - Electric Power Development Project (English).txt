Republic of 
Project ID: P082337 
Project Name: Electric Power Development
Task Team Leader: David Kennedy

2004 
Estimated Board Date: Dec., 2005 
Managing Unit: ECSIE 
Lending Instrument: Specific Investment 
Loan 
Sector: Power (100%) 
Theme: Infrastructure services for private 
sector development (P)

Loan/Credit amount ($m.):  
IBRD: 25 
Other financing amounts by source ($m):  
private sector: 125 (should the CHP component of the project proceed 
[see below]) 
 
B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The main objectives of the project are to: 
 
·
Support provision of secure and affordable power 
·
Support commercialization of the power sector 
 
These objectives have been agreed with the Government of Macedonia in the context of the 
Bank’s Macedonia Energy Strategy. 
 
If successful, the project would support GDP growth through provision of reliable and 
competitively priced power to industry and business. In addition, the project would minimize 
affordability impacts of necessary investments on residential consumers. 
 
Regarding the first objective, the project would be deemed successful if losses in the power 
distribution network are reduced, energy balance is maintained, and power remains 
competitively priced; performance indicators will be designed accordingly. 
 
Page  2
Regarding the second objective, the project will be deemed successful if reforms outlined in the 
Bank’s energy strategy are implemented. These reforms include ESM restructuring and 
commercialization, which would be manifest in increased labor productivity and strengthening of 
payments discipline. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project will finance investments to maintain energy balance. Investments will be selected on 
the basis of (i) potential economic returns (ii) availability of other finance sources. 
 
On the basis of these criteria, and existing technical studies, the proposal is that around $20 
million be used to finance of investments in power transmission and distribution networks 
(around $10 million in each) for rehabilitation and upgrade of substations, rehabilitation of 
protection systems, and possible introduction of control systems to complement existing control 
systems in the transmission network. 
 
The project may include a small component to finance equipment required for exploitation of the 
lower seam of the existing (Suvodol) lignite mine in order that there is continued fuel supply for 
power generation. Depending on the results of a feasibility study currently being carried out 
under a PHRD grant to the Government of Macedonia, the project could include $3 million for 
necessary investments in this area. 
 
The project may also include a Bank guarantee of revenue streams for a private CHP generation 
project in Skopje. Depending on the results of a feasibility study currently being carried out 
under the PHRD grant, and subject to there being private sector appetite (both for the CHP 
project and for the guarantee), the project could include a $5 million guarantee facility.  
 
The project would support commercialization of ESM through financing the introduction of a 
Financial Management System (FMS); this would improve information flows within the 
company, and provide the basis for strengthening of management incentives. The expected cost 
of this component is around $3 million. 
 
More generally, the project would support the energy sector reform process to be elaborated in 
the Bank’s strategy, and focusing on regulatory development and ESM unbundling (restructuring 
of ESM through separation of generation, transmission and distribution businesses). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Existing power transmission and distribution networks in Macedonia. The proposed coal 
component is at an existing mine. The proposed CHP component is at an existing district heat 
generation site. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Page  3
There are no safeguards issues in the context of the Bank’s current project with ESM (due to 
close in mid 2005).

Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[X] Environmental 
Assessment
(OP
/BP
4.01) 
A
Category A Environmental Impact Assessment would be required for the CHP 
component if this component were to proceed.  
 
For the transmission / distribution project components, it is envisaged that a 
Category B Environment Management Plan (EMP) would be required.  
 
For the mining equipment to be supplied, the environmental specialist would visit 
the Suvodol mine and ascertain the quality of current environmental management 
practices. If satisfactory, no further documentation (beyond proof of valid 
operating permits and no outstanding environmental liabilities) would suffice. If 
there are certain environmental issues, these would be addressed in a Category B 
EMP.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared.   September 2004. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
For the transmission/distribution and coal mining equipment components, all necessary EA 
documentation, consultation and documentation requirements will be met prior to appraisal.  
 
For the CHP component, a description of the environmental review and approval procedures 
to be adopted will be presented in the PAD. These procedures will be consistent with both  
EA policies and procedures of the Government of Macedonia and the World Bank. A key 
element of these procedures will be the requirement for the World Bank to independently 
review and approve any EA documentation  for this project component.
