B.  Project Objectives 
 
The proposed project development objective is to reduce the rate of serious injuries and deaths associated 
with road transport, through: (a) enhanced capacity and 
accountability for road safety outcomes;  (b) 
increased knowledge and awareness on road safety issues and near term solutions; and (c) establishment 
of a framework for long-term achievement of road safety performance targets. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project will consisting of three inter-linked components: (A) Institutional and Capacity Building 
Program; (B) Road Safety Demonstration and Awareness Program; and (C) Road Safety Monitoring and 
Evaluation Program.  
 
 
A. 
Institutional and Capacity Building Program (ICBP) 
 
11. 
The ICBP will support technical assistance and project implementation to strengthen the 
management and technical capacity of the NTSC and prepare a national roll-out program for subsequent 
phases of the national road safety program/strategy.  It will also support the management and evaluation 
of component B, the Road Safety Demonstration and Awareness Program.  In the first phase of the  long 
term public management of drivers and vehicles, the ICBP will also evaluate and improve existing driver 
training, testing and licensing, as well as vehicle testing processes. 
 
B. 
Road Safety Demonstration and Awareness Program (RSDABP) 
 
12. 
The objective of the RSDAP is to develop and implement comprehensive, integrated safety 
programs along three high risk national road corridors, which can then be scaled up for a nationwide 
program under subsequent phases of the Government’s strategy.  The RSDAP will also support  the 
improved safety of road infrastructure and operations with the enhancement of road safety auditing 
processes and funding of blackspot improvements.  It also includes a program of coordinated road user 
education and awareness building and traffic safety enforcement—which will initially be tested along the 
Page  2
 
 
above corridors. The RSDAP will improve the state of readiness, awareness and co-ordinated response of 
emergency services along the demonstration corridors, and improve and expand pre-school and school-
based road safety education through testing in these areas—with national level expansion as warranted. 
 
C. 
Road Safety Monitoring and Evaluation Program (RSMEP) 
 
13. 
The RSMEP will support development of a  nationwide traffic accident monitoring and analysis 
database. The outputs will be made available through NTSC to all relevant Government agencies. The 
database will be used initially by the Vietnam Road Administration to enhance the identification of and 
response to accident blackspots and by the Ministry of Police to improve its enforcement strategies and 
priorities.  In combination with other data sources, the accident monitoring system will serve as an 
essential tool to monitor and evaluate the impact of the NPTS and other Government Strategies related to 
road safety, such as the Government’s National Injury Prevention Strategy.
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The three designated “safe highway” corridors that have been identified for inclusion under the project 
are: (1) National Highway 1:  (281 km between Hanoi and Vinh); (2) National Highway 1:  (151 km 
between HCMC and Can Tho); and (3) Highway 51:  (80 km, HCMC to the coast).  These will constitute 
the main project areas. 
 
Depending on funding availability, project activities in subsequent years of the project may be expanded 
outside the above demonstration corridors.  The project area would thus include, other national highways 
(for blackspot improvements) and a building site yet to be identified around Hanoi (for construction of a 
model driver training and testing center). 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Ministry of Transport has assigned Project Management Unit No. 1 (PMU1) to undertake project 
implementation, with the National Traffic Safety Committee providing coordinating and oversight.  
PMU1 would be responsible for ensure effective preparation and implementation of the relevant 
safeguard policies.  An independent monitoring agency would be used to monitor compliance during 
implementation.

:  A project-level Environmental Assessment is underway based on World Bank 
Operational Policy (OP) 4.01, 
Environmental Assessment.  
A Social Assessment is also being prepared to 
examine potential social impacts of project activities.  These documents will undertake a detailed 
examination of proposed project investments to determine which World Bank safeguard polices and 
Government policies will apply.  An project environmental management plan, resettlement action plans, 
and/or relevant policy frameworks will be prepared accordingly.  The first round of public consultation 
and disclosure of these documents is expected in January-February 2004.
