B. Project Objectives

According to the overall concept of the RAP, each phase has a distinct development objective.

The development objective of the ongoing Phase I of the Program is to establish a sustainable
foundation for large-scale improvements to rural accessibility in areas severely affected by
poverty which at the same time have good prospects for rural development. Phase I is putting in
place   effective  institutional  arrangements    and   appropriate  technical  standards   and
implementation procedures for these large-scale improvements to be achieved during subsequent
phases of the Program. Through the pilot projects, it brings rural access improvements to some
Governorates, covering less than 15% of the rural population.

The development objective of Phase II of the RAP (the proposed project) has been defined as
follows: Isolation is reduced for the Yemen's rural population, enabling them to better market
their products and access services (social and administrative). Phase II of the Program will
focus on (i) physical rural access improvements to many more areas with widespread poverty,
poor accessibility and latent rural development potential, utilizing the planning process being

developed in Phase I; and (ii) capacity-building for the management and maintenance of the
intermediary rural road network, the monitoring of key indicators, the implementation of
environmental management plans, and the management of local participatory processes, with an
emphasis on local poverty and gender issues. The PAD for Phase I has defined a series of
triggers for going into Phase II. These triggers have in part already been met, and there is much
progress towards meeting the remaining triggers. It seems likely that almost all triggers will be
met before appraisal.

Phase III will then further increase the coverage of access improvement. It will expand rural
access improvements and capacity building to tertiary roads at the district level and critical
intermediary access roads not yet covered under Phase II. It will continue to support village
access road development.          Capacity building to achieve sustainable management and
maintenance of rural roads, using the demand-driven and poverty-based approach for
identification and prioritization of rural road subprojects as initiated in Phases I and II would also
continue under Phase III.


C. Project Description

The project is the second phase of an Adaptable Lending Program. It will have three components
which are briefly outlined below.
    · Component One:           Rural Access Roads.        This component will mainly consist in
        planning, executing and supervising works contracts to upgrade rural roads. The result of
        this component would be that rural access roads throughout Yemen are improved to
        ensure year round access. The main result indicators for this component would be that at
        least xx km of intermediate rural roads and yy km of village access roads are improved.
        This component will absorb most of the project funding. Similar to Phase I, almost all
        works will be carried out by local small and medium-sized contractors, and design and
        supervision will be done by a mixture of local and foreign consultants.
    · Component Two: Institutional Support and Capacity Building. This component will
        mainly consist in training and technical support services carried out by consultants. The
        result of this component would be that institutional and technical capacity for road
        planning, management and engineering is strengthened at the central and decentralized
        levels. The main result indicators would be that (i) at least six decentralized rural road
        management offices are functional, (ii) at least xx local professionals from the private and
        public sector have received an average yy days of training, and (iii) the implementation
        of the Rural Access Program is managed professionally and in conformance with legal
        and fiduciary requirements as stated in the Credit Agreement.
    · Component Three:          Road Maintenance.         This component will mainly consist in
        planning, executing and supervising performance-based contracts for management and
        maintenance of roads. The result of this component would be that the Road Maintenance
        Fund maintains identified road sub-networks to pre-defined service levels. The main
        result indicator would be that at least xx km of roads are maintained by the Road
        Maintenance Fund through performance-based road maintenance and management
        contracts.

D. Project location (if known)

Program interventions will be nation-wide.       Governorate-level rural accessibility plans will
provide a method for selecting priority rural roads to be improved.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies

The Environment and Social Management Unit at the CMO will be responsible for the overall
implementation of the safeguards policies. During Phase I, this two-person unit has built up a
good knowledge and capacity in environment and social management, through field application
of the environmental review process on the pilot roads. However, because of the sheer volume
of work, the Unit has found itself stretched to the limit as it completes Phase I projects and
prepares for Phase II. The Unit is also responsible for the monitoring of socio-economic impact
indicators. It will therefore need to rapidly convert its role from one of "doing" to one of
"managing and supervising" local consultants. It is envisioned that the Unit will retain its role of
initial screening and categorization, but then utilize consultants to in the carrying out of
subproject environmental assessments, environmental management plans and social framework
agreements. In any case, the Unit should be increased by one person, so as to assure adequate
screening and follow up monitoring of the numerous subprojects. To increase the pool of
capable consultants, the Unit will recruit and train several local consultants in the completion of
EMP documentation for Phase I roads. For Phase II and III roads, environmental assessments,
EMP and SFA will be completed by consulting firms selected to do the preliminary designs and
construction supervision, who may select among the individuals trained by the Unit. The Unit
will carry out training and refresher courses for interested consultants at the central and
decentralized levels.

*Since not all program roads are known at this time, a Sectoral Environmental Assessment is
being carried out, which will include Policy Frameworks for Natural Habitats, Involuntary
Resettlement and Cultural Property. The standard environmental and social review process
defined in the Sectoral EA will provide for individual project screening, which will indicate
whether these policy frameworks will be triggered for any individual road project.
