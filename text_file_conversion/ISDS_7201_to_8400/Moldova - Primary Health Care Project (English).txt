component would support two types of activities: (i) communication activities to inform policy
makers, providers and the public about the reform, and (ii) technical assistance for project
coordination and fiduciary tasks of procurement and financial management, including capacity
building in MOH.

 Component 2: Health System Development. This component would support the Ministry's
ongoing efforts to further restructure the hospital sector and develop PHC, with emphasis in the
rural areas. The later would be done through the well-functioning competitive mechanisms
established under the HIF Project to allocate resources to improve PHC services. In this manner,
the Health Investment Fund would continue to finance proposals received from the rayons for
development of PHC. As under HIF, the criteria for sub-project selection will be based on
indicators to promote greater equity and effective implementation of sectoral restructuring at the
rayon level, as well as acceptable progress in managing financial resources and developing
training programs. The component would enable development of an effective interface among
PHC, specialist outpatient care and inpatient care and the introduction of new performance-based
payment mechanisms to provide incentives for quality and efficiency and consolidation at the
provider level (both at the hospital and PHC levels). To this end, the project would strengthen
capacities (through component 3) of the HIC to become an effective purchaser of health services.

 Component 3: Improvement of Health Sector Capacity. This component would strengthen the
capacity of providers to implement essential changes in service delivery at different levels of the
health system. It would support the review of the curriculum and continuation of training of: (i)
general practitioners and nurses, (ii) health managers of hospitals and PHC, as well as (iii)
training of health insurance staff. In addition, it would support further development and
implementation of guidelines and protocols for use in hospitals and PHC centers, including
training of staff in the use of improved protocols and guidelines, with the aim of increasing
equitable access of the population to evidence-based health services.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
    would be prepared: N/A

B. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage
    ISDS: 05/01/2006

C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
    The project has been rated "C" as it does not raise concerns of major health orenvironmental
    impacts since refurbishment is minimal and blood and urine samples are for minor outpatient
    diagnostics only. Although an environmental assessment is not required, certain
    environmental issues need to be taken into account during project implementation and are
    summarized below. Other safeguards policies are not applicable.

     The Health Systems Development Component would include minor rehabilitation of
    existing health centers. These works will require proper handling of construction debris and
    safe management of sharps (syringes, blades). This project will follow up on good measures
    practiced in Moldova for safe practice of safe management of sharps (syringes and blades).
    Minor rehabilitation of facilities would include repairs and will not include structural changes
    and therefore minor quantities of debris will be generated. The Project Implementation
    Manual (PIM) will guide the implementing agencies on workers safety, dust and noise
    pollution, proper handling, transportation and disposal of construction waste materials. The
    PIM will have provisions for and guidance on the safeguards for preventing health impacts
    from direct and indirect exposure of human to health care waste during implementation. The


1Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the

InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected
persons.

   Bank will monitor that such provisions are in place in the bidding documents and follow-up
   contracts.
