A.2. Project Objectives
The main development objective of the Project would be to foster post-privatization growth in the
agricultural sector by improving the access of new private farmers and rural businesses to what they need to
succeed - knowledge, markets, and finance. While pursing this objective, the Project would help reduce
poverty by creating income earning opportunities and improving productivity through complementary
technical assistance and investment support, hence profitability of the investments supported under the
Project could be materialized through effective implementation of the non-credit line components.

A.3. Project Description
The proposed Supplemental Credit provides additional financing to restore the Rural Finance Component
of Phase I of the Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP) to the pre-negotiation amount, thereby
increasing the access of new private farmers and rural business to financial services. This Supplement will
only refer to the Rural Finance Component of the RISP.

The proposed Project would have four main components: (a) Rural Business Development Component; (b)
Rural Advisory Services Component; (c) Rural Finance Component; and (d) Project Management
Component.      The first three components are closely linked, with each dependent on the others for
successful outcome. The first component focuses on creating viable farm and agribusiness clients, the
second component aims to provide post-creation support services, and the third component would finance
and transform business concepts into reality. The first two components would provide combined public
investment with technical assistance while the third component would provide predominantly private
investment support with the necessary technical assistance to participating financial institutions.

Component A: Rural Business Development Component (financing continuing under RISP).
This component would provide technical and financial assistance and guidance to promote the formation of
viable farmer organizations (FOs) and agribusiness. The purpose of the FO component is to assist farmers
in developing effective, self-owned and sustainable FOs as a means to achieve some of their objectives,
including the designing and implementation of successful Projects. FOs are considered to be an efficient
and democratic tool to enhance rural businesses and services which otherwise would not be accessible to
individual farmers. The Savings and Credit Associations (SCAs) system which started in 1997 is a good
example of a successful FO movement. Associated support for the component would include enactment
and implementation of a cooperative law, establishment of their legal status, operational modalities, and
management and financial responsibilities of these groups. Support for agribusiness development would
include providing full information and required documents for registering enterprises, confirmation of the
legal status of newly privatized agribusinesses, and other legal and institutional support for new
agribusiness enterprises.

Component B: Rural Advisory Services Component (financing continuing under RISP).
This component would provide post-creation, business development support to new, private, farmer
organizations and agricultural and rural entrepreneurs by establishing a business advisory and marketing
support service infrastructure. Rather than creating new entities, this would be done through tapping into
the already existing network of service providers and augmenting their capacity through capacity building
support and competitive contracting.

Component C: Rural Finance Component (IDA financing US$ 5.0 million).
The Rural Finance Component would provide post-privatization support to Moldova's agricultural and
rural sectors through a variety of credit instruments, channeled through the commercial banks and other
eligible participating financial institutions (PFIs). This component would provide investment and working
capital credits at commercial terms to support a broad range of private agricultural and rural enterprises
owned by joint stock companies, limited liability companies, cooperatives, and individuals.

There would be three credit line facilities under this component:(a) a general commercial credit line; (b) a
special credit line with a "matching grant"; and (c) a micro-finance credit line. In parallel, the Project would
strengthen capacity in commercial banks, and Rural Finance Corporation (RFC) which are willing to lend
to the rural population, but lack experience in doing so. Support would also be provided to Savings and
Credit Associations (SCAs), State Supervisory Body (SSB), and National Federation of SCAs (NFSCAs).

Component 4: Project Management Component (financing continuing under RISP)
This component would provide technical and financial support for Project management.                     Project
implementation and supervision would be the responsibility of the Consolidated Agricultural Projects
Management Unit (CAPMU), which has demonstrated its capability to manage the implementation and
preparation of Bank-funded projects in Moldova's rural sector (First Agriculture Project, Rural Finance

Project and Rural Investment and Services Project (RISP)).               CAPMU staff would handle common
administrative functions and help develop the necessary administrative and financial management skills in
the various agencies and field units that would implement the different project components. The budget for
the Project management component would include funding for project monitoring and evaluation activities
as well as for the annual audits of the project accounts.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The Project will be implemented countrywide based on demand for services and credit. Project activities
would not be located in protected areas. Where potential micro-projects are proposed in the vicinity of
protected areas or critical habitat, a specific environmental assessment would be required.

In south-eastern Moldova, the Project will co-finance a GEF MSP - Dniester Biodiversity Conservation
Project that will support creation of a Lower Dniester National Park and promote sustainable natural
resource management practices for rural population surrounding the proposed Park. Also, the GEF funded
Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP) will be implemented in conjunction with the Project, to
reduce potential nutrient pollution of investments financed under it.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. No major environmental impact is anticipated under the proposed Project, given the relatively small
size of most of the sub-projects to be supported. Certain project types may require special environmental
mitigation measures to protect environment and quality of the natural resources. Environmental Guidelines
establish mechanisms for identifying such sub-projects, and mitigation measures to be carried out as part of
the EIA. Most of the potential impacts will be avoided or minimized through applying a set of good
practices that can be directed to farmers through the Advisory Component. Advisors will include topics on
environmental and agricultural sustainability matters when advising on agricultural production matters to
their clients. In addition, general environmentally friendly behavior of the rural population will also be
promoted and encouraged through the above-mentioned parallel GEF Projects for mainstreaming
environmental considerations into agricultural practices, leveraged by RISP and to be implemented under
the RISP framework. These projects will also provide an incentive structure for farmers and supporting
extension service to enhance agricultural productivity in an environmentally friendly manner.




D.2 Cumulative impacts are not expected to be significant. However, since there are about 6,000 small
loans anticipated to be issued under the Project, potentially it is possible that many loans could be
concentrated in a small region and produce a minor cumulative effect on environment from increased
agricultural activity. Prevention and mitigation mechanisms for individual credits established under the
Project, as described in this document, will diminish these potential impacts. Arrangements for addressing
Environmental Safeguards are described in Section 5 of the RISP PAD on Environment.



D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)


D.4. Since preventive measures are favored over mitigation or compensatory measures whenever feasible,
the Project will build capacity in CAPMU, supported by the parallel GEF funded APCP, to avoid or
minimize potential environmental impacts. For the majority of the sub-projects, an EIA will not be required
by Moldovan law because of the small size of investments (micro-credits), however the Project has
established mechanisms allowing for an EIA to be conducted, where required, in order to meet World Bank
guidelines and Moldovan law.

It will be the responsibility of the CAPMU and the lending institutions to environmentally screen each
proposed activity. Environmental concerns will be mitigated in the selection and implementation of sub-
Projects. Environmental Review that has been carried out describes exiting environmental regulations and
standards for enforcing environmental standards. The Rural Credit Guidelines, finalized based on the
Review, describe procedures and implementation arrangements for ensuring full consideration of
environmental safeguards, in accordance with the Bank environmental safeguard guidelines, and provide
detailed guidelines on environmental screening, appraisal and monitoring applied to micro-projects. Each
sub-project will be individually screened and reviewed by PFIs, and if needed by CAPMU, for any
negative impacts, and mitigation measures (a sample screening check-list and EMP is attached to the Rural
Credit Guidelines). Training will be provided to CAPMU specialists to carry out the evaluation and
monitoring of sub-Projects according to environmental safeguards.

D.5. During RISP preparation, a series of workshops were held with a number of NGO representatives and
government specialists to identify major issues and problems, including environmental, facing rural people
and how these problems would be best addressed. Results from the workshop were supplemented with a
background description of agricultural and rural conditions, and current activities in Moldova. These

initiatives provided a base upon which a number of assumptions in terms of probable agricultural and rural
activities to be supported through the Project were made. Also, the Environmental Review was carried out
on the basis of discussions with the Ministry of Environment Construction and Territorial Development
(MECTD).

Stakeholders will be consulted, depending upon the nature of the proposed Project, during the screening
process, during the development of plans to address potential environmental impact, and during sub-project
supervision to assess environmental aspects. Borrowers will be informed and consulted with if a need for
EIA is determined by a lending institution and CAPMU, at which point the borrower will choose whether
to proceed with EIA or cancel its application. When possible, experts within municipalities and local
offices of the Ministry of Environment will participate directly in the preparation of environmental
assessments and plans. During Project implementation, sub-projects will be assessed for implementation of
environmental standards.

Based on local regulations, MECTD is obliged to provide draft laws, statements and programs to the
public. In the case of new economic activities, the proponent must inform the local authorities (Prefectura
and Primaria) of his/her intentions and ensure the presentation of all required Project documentation. Local
authorities are obliged to inform the public, guarantee public access to the materials and provide any public
feed back to the proponent. Public input is obligatory for a range of activities, including construction of
irrigation schemes, soil erosion protection systems, vineyards and orchards established within watercourse
protection zones, and Projects requiring formal EIA. MECTD or local authorities should inform the general
public on the decision made and approval of Project's documentation.
