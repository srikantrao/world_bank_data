B.  Project Objectives  
 
The Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (GoNCTD) recognizes the need for 
comprehensive reforms in the WSS sector to make the capital city a healthier and more attractive place to 
live, able to achieve its full economic potential in a competitive international environment.   The 
Government’s Vision for the sector is 
‘Provision of universal continuous (24/7) safe water supply and 
sewerage services in an equitable, efficient and sustainable manner by a customer oriented and 
accountable service provider’
.
The strategy to achieve this Vision includes a phased program towards full 
service coverage in an efficient and financially sustainable manner by 2015. The Government proposes to 
launch immediately a comprehensive reform process with the objective of achieving visible and 
replicable improvements in various aspects of the WSS services in Delhi, including reliability, 
sustainability and affordability of the services. 
 
·
Reliability
:
providing a 24 hours a day/seven days a week (24/7) water supply service and adequate 
sewerage services through a combination of improvement of O&M of existing infrastructure before 
an extension of its capacity; 
·
Sustainability
:
(i) setting user charges to a level sufficient to cover “efficient” O&M costs, 
depreciation and financing charges; and (ii) using pricing as a demand management tool to conserve 
scarce water resources;  
·
Affordability
:
(i) eliminating the need for substitutes to the public WSS service and their prohibitive 
coping costs; (ii) increasing DJB efficiency to reduce O&M costs; and (iii) designing targeted subsidy 
schemes to enable the poor access to and adequate consumption of quality WSS services. 
 
C. Project 
Description 
 
The proposed project would include the following components: 
Page  2
·
Component 1: First Phase of Water Distribution and Waste Water Collection Improvement 
(i) 
implementation of two six
–year ‘Management Contracts’ with two professional Operators
 
in two 
operational zones (OZ) serving a total of about 1.8 million people through 165,000 water connections 
(or 12% of DJB’s total operation); and (ii) rehabilitation of existing WSS facilities in the two OZ 
including pumping equipment, mains, water connections (where most of the leaks are likely to be 
located), bulk and individual meters, sewers and connections.   
·
Component 2: Trunk Water
1
and Sewerage Infrastructure Improvement
 including the rehabilitation 
of selected WSS infrastructure city-wide to address priority bottlenecks, improve energy efficiency, 
and promote environmental sustainability.  
·
Component 3: Organizational Strengthening Measures
 including: (i) staffing rationalization 
through instituting a staff performance appraisal system and training in the field modern utility 
management techniques; (ii) implementation of computerized Customer Service Centers (CSC),  
Management Information System (MIS) and Information Technology (IT) plan; (iii)  implementation 
of external and internal change communication strategy; and (iv) assistance to the supervision of the 
Management Contracts.
 
·
Component 4
:
UWSS Services to the Poor
,
including implementation of WSS sub-projects for low 
income communities in the two OZ associated with the Management Contracts
2
.
·
Component 5: Roll-Out Plan
,
including preparation of: (i) a City-wide restructuring of trunk WSS 
infrastructure and distribution systems, to support changeover to a 24/7 water supply regime ; (ii) 
institutional restructuring of WSS functions for the entire NCTD area; and (iii) a long-term strategic 
plan for water resource management and trunk WSS infrastructure for the NCTD and its satellite 
cities (total population of about 25 million). The roll-out plan would be implemented under a future 
project (starting in 2007/8), for which DJB has already expressed interest in Bank financing.
 
D. 
Project location (if known) 
 
The National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCTD) covers a total area of about 1,500 km2; about one third 
of it is urban, and represents a population of about 16 million in 2004.  Altogether, 80% of the NCTD 
population is connected to the piped water system and 75% to sewers.  Unconnected population, a large 
share of which lives in informal settlements, rely on public standpipes, tankers and boreholes fitted with 
handpumps.  While some households not connected to sewers rely on pit latrines,  about 15% of the 
population has no access to sanitation facilities. 
 
Altogether, the production capacity of the five existing and one soon to be commissioned drinking water 
treatment plants (2.90 and 0.80 million m3/day respectively) and existing groundwater resources (0.30 
million m3/day) translate in an allocation of about 250 lpcd (liter per capita and per day), on the basis of a 
total population of 16 million: a fairly generous allocation by Indian standards.  But, because of 
inadequate management of the distribution system, residents receive water only a few hours per day.  
Intermittent supply leads to contamination of the water distributed and the need for households to 
complement a deficient public service at prohibitive ‘coping’ costs; the poor suffer most.  It is estimated 
that physical and commercial losses are about 40 and 15% of the water produced respectively and that 
Non Revenue Water (NRW) is close to 60%, once water legally supplied free of charge is taken into 
account.  The sewerage network has lacked maintenance over the years and overflow of raw sewage in 
open drains is common, due to blockage, settlements and inadequate pumping capacities.  The capacity of 
the 17 existing wastewater treatment plants, a combined 2,35 million m3/day, is adequate to cater an

Most, if not all trunk water supply infrastructure would be 100% financed by DJB and would thus not be part of 
the Bank-financed project

The project would support the preparation of a program to scale up improved services to the poor in the entire DJB 
area. DJB would also finance pilot WSS projects for low-income communities outside the two OZ.

estimated daily production of wastewater of 1,85 million m3/day (less than 50% of the water produced), 
to which about 0.50 million m3/day of infiltration have to be added.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Delhi Water Board (DJB) is the main provider of piped water supply and sewerage (WSS) in NCTD 
and would be the project implementing agency.  Altogether, DJB serves a total of 1.5 million water 
connections and an estimated 1.3 million sewer connections.  DJB, a parastatal under the Chief Minister 
of the Government of NCTD, employs about 27,000 staff (18 staff per 1,000 water connections), 
distributes 60% of the water produced, generates revenues from 40% of the water produced and collects 
80% of the bills issued: all very low performance indicators, by international standards.   
·
DJB has established an Environmental Cell which has already been actively involved in the 
preparation of EA for the project; the capacity of the Environmental Cell would be further 
strengthened to ensure proper implementation and monitoring of the EMP during implementation 
phase of the project.
 
·
DJB proposes to set-up and adequately staff a Social Development cum Communication Cell to 
manage implementation of the action plan addressing safeguard concerns and the communication
 
strategy.

WSS infrastructure.  Due to significant construction activities envisaged in the project, environmental 
impacts associated with construction will be identified and addressed in the Environmental Assessment 
(EA), currently underway. The EA and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) are expected to bring out 
the exact site specific and sub-projects specific issues and ways of mitigating them. 
 
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
 is not triggered. However, the application of this policy will be 
reviewed during project preparation.  A Social Assessment (SA) was carried out to identify adverse 
impacts and prepare a policy framework for future investments under the roll-out plan (Component 5 of 
the project). The study indicated that adverse impacts have been minimized during route selection of 
pipes.  Land will not have to be acquired; no one will be displaced or partly affected.  There may be 
temporary impacts on mobile vendors for whom specific measures will be provided.  Baseline surveys 
will be carried out for subsequent sub-projects to be identified under the roll-out plan and the policy 
framework applied as needed. 
 
Communication Strategy
.
An enabling environment to support the reform process would be facilitated 
by a constant communication with external and internal stakeholders.  Communication strategies are 
being developed and communication with internal and external stakeholders has already begun.
