A.2. Project Objectives
The proposed project would help Government implement its strategy of producing qualified
graduates with the skills needed for increased productivity and diversification of its economy.
The project will (i) improve the quality of the learning environment and the relevance of courses
to the labor market and (ii) establish pedagogic, administrative and financial management
systems in Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).

Development Objective Indicators:
    ·    Proportion of students in professional programs increases from 7% in 2003/4 to 12% in
         2008/2009
    ·    Pedagogic, administrative and financial management systems are operational by 2008

(See Annex 1)

A.3. Project Description
Component 1: Quality and relevance of higher education :

This component contributes to the government's strategy of modernizing university instruction,
making it more relevant to the needs of the economy by facilitating a shift from classic supply
driven programs to greater on science, technology and demand-driven occupationally-oriented
courses and from traditional lecture-based instruction to more emphasis on individual study and
applied research through the modernization of course offerings, faculty upgrading and
accreditation.

Program renewal, faculty upgrading and accreditation
In order to ensure the relevance of new short courses to the market place, the university and the
IHEs will develop professional links with key employers in the different sectors of the economy
(sector councils) who will identify priorities and advise on course content and objectives.
Emphasis would be on strengthening the applied aspects of academic subjects, allowing more

time for laboratory, field work in enterprises, and group projects. An estimated total of 17
programs would be either developed or renovated, including at least 8 "professional" programs.
Faculty will have access to professional development programs designed to help them upgrade
their instructional and research skills through the creation of a higher education instructional
support unit which will provide hands-on assistance in instructional techniques, course design and
evaluation, strengthening the accreditation process. By 2008, all faculty would have participated
in professional development programs while an estimated 100 core faculty and technical staff
would receive further training in their fields of specialization at overseas partner universities.
The development and introduction of new courses and degree programs and faculty training
would be assisted by a consortium of universities, research and training institutions under
"twinning" arrangements, designed to facilitate the transfer of skills, programs and to foster inter-
faculty cooperation and mentoring. The consortium would also train faculty in self evaluation
techniques and assist them in implementing the accreditation process.

Modern central library and distance learning center
Under the new university master plan, the Credit will finance the construction and equipment of a
new central library and distance learning center, to serve as the focal points for internet access
and for the university-wide distribution of information. For the central library the Credit would
finance (i) civil works; (ii) goods and equipment, including books, electronic periodicals, work
stations, servers and satellite connection equipment; and (iii) professional training in information
sciences for the chief executive of the library and the library's managers of printed and electronic
resources and training for library technicians. All faculty and students would receive training in
the utilization of library and electronic resources, including search engines and the use of data
bases. The Credit would finance: (i) civil works and equipment for the distance learning center;
and (ii) training of the distance learning manager and support technicians

Use of ICT in teaching, learning and research
The Credit would finance the equipment, software and systems upgrading for the development of
high speed internet access and for a system-wide intranet, giving faculty and students access to
the latest knowledge in their fields, to accredited course materials including distance learning
modules, and to electronic periodicals in wide range of academic and research fields. The Credit
would also finance the training of faculty and students in basic IT skills

Component 2. Institutional Development.

This component will help implement the new policy framework for higher education as outlined
in the ESDP. The main thrust of the reform is the transfer of autonomy to the university and other
IHEs in terms of strategic goal setting, budgets, instructional programs, and personnel
management. The university and the IHEs would operate under performance contracts negotiated
with the government which would establish institutional objectives under a multi-year
institutional development plan, with performance indicators and agreed levels of public subsidy.
The institutions would also be assessed annually on the basis of academic results, internal and
external efficiency and financial management targets. The university and the IHEs would be
permitted to generate their own financial resources through the provision of training and
consulting services to the public and private sectors. Additionally, tuition fees for occupationally-
oriented course would be introduced progressively in fields such as business management,
information technology and others to be determined. Successful implementation of the reform
will depend on the training of a new cadre of leaders, managers and planners and the introduction
of new management systems.

Staff development (managerial and administrative

The Credit would finance the training and upgrading of administrative and managerial staff of
the IHEs, in the areas of academic planning, student services, finance, personnel management as
well as in campus planning and the management of physical plant. High priority will be given to
the development of new leaders at the rector and vice-rector level (academic programs;
institutional development, finance and research) and to the training of deans of faculty in
academic planning and human resource management, with an emphasis on collaborative team
work.

Pedagogic, administrative and financial management systems.
This component would establish an integrated management information system (MIS) for higher
education. The integrated MIS would include admissions and financial aid, student records,
financial management together with inventories for physical plant and equipment. The Credit
will finance the adaptation or design and development of systems, related technical support
services and the training of users. A quality assurance system covering the pedagogic, financial
and administrative functions of the University will be established. The selection of a quality
assurance system capable of meeting the reform objectives (pedagogic, financial and
administrative) and coherent with international norms would be defined including the different
mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation of the activities.

University administrative Center
In order to create a focal point for the management of institutional reform and campus
development, the Credit would finance the construction and equipment of a new university
administration center, housing the offices of the university rector and vice-rector responsible for
academic planning, student services, budget and administration and university development and
comprising managerial and support staff work space, video conferencing and training facilities,
together with a high volume copy center. The center would also house the servers, data storage
and transmission facilities required for the campus "intranet" (electronic mail and document
dissemination). The video conferencing, training facilities and copying facilities would be
operated as a "profit centers", with charge back to other government users.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Under the proposed project, potential safeguard issues relate to soil and water pollution,
the choice of borrow pits as sources for construction materials, particularly sand taken
from dunes, the generation of toxic wastes at the laboratories, and an increase in water
supplies and waste waters to meet the future needs of approximately 7,500 students and
faculty.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.
No indirect and/or long-term impacts are anticipated under the project.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
Since the proposed campus is a critical part of the Government's education sector
program, alternatives to this particular investment were not discussed.

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has carried out an environmental analysis (EA). A key recommendation is
that the future architectural studies for the campus include environmental impact
assessments as necessary to ensure that the designs take into consideration, for example,
potential impacts on water resources or the need for integrating waste management at the
campus with waste management processes in Nouakchott to avoid water and soil
pollution. Thus, the borrower will have the required support to implement the
recommendations of the EA report.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders include representatives of the technical ministries, including those
responsible for environment. Since the future campus site is currently used as a waste
dump, it is not inhabited, and the land is not used for any agricultural activities. Hence,
no consultations with potentially affected people were carried out. The EA report has
been disclosed at various ministries in Mauritania and at the Bank's Infoshop.
