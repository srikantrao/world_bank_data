A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is 
to increase access to urban infrastructure and 
services in Kigali and 5 secondary cities (
Butare, Ruhengeri, Kibuye, Kabuga and 
Nyanza) 
by improving urban management practices.  
 
This objective will be achieved through the combined impacts of the anticipated results 
of  two main interventions:  (i) Physical investment programs defined through 
participatory process are implemented in targeted cities and in poor areas and accessible 
to the local and low-income population, and (ii) the local and national stakeholders have 
the capacity to (a) apply appropriate programming, financing, and implementation 
mechanisms to improve service delivery, (b) improve local resource mobilization, (c) set 
up simple urban planning tools, and (d) rationalize municipal management and 
maintenance. 
 
The project would entail: (i) developing programming and financing mechanisms of 
priority urban investments through programmatic and participatory approaches; (ii) 
assisting GoR in operationalizing intergovernmental transfer mechanisms for 
infrastructure investments; (iii) upgrading infrastructure and service delivery in urban 
setting; (iv) assisting urban local governments to improve local revenue mobilization, 
financial management, and urban planning skills; and (v) building the capacity of cities, 
local stakeholders, and government to develop, implement, and monitor pro-poor urban 
strategies and programs.

A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1: Urban Infrastructure  
Objective: To improve the level of infrastructure and urban services in project targeted cities  
 
This component will provide resources for urban infrastructure and facilities at two 
levels: (i) district level investments identified in a participatory way through Local 
Development Plans (LDP) prepared by Local Community Development Committees 
(CDC) and screened through Urban Audits, and (ii) structuring investments, in particular 
for Kigali, which will benefit several districts, support economic development, improve 
the urban environment, and contribute to improve the functioning of the City as a wh
ole.  
The city investment programs will therefore contribute to develop the strategic vision of 
city while integrating district interventions.  Both types of investments are identified 
through Medium Term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEF) and more systematically 
through the urban audits methodology carried out by beneficiary cities with the support 
of trained local consultants.  The resulting three-year city Priority Investment Program 
(PIP) is then included in a City Contract. The investment programs will be executed 
through a Contract Management Agency (CMA) to rationalize and optimize 
implementation process and increase involvement and capacity of local SMEs. A 
Delegated Contract Management Agreement (DCMA) between the CMA, the beneficiary 
cities, and the GOR will be signed. The Nordic Development Fund will support the 
financing for an amount of about 6 US million dollars, of drainage and anti-erosion 
strategic plan and the execution of a priority investments program at the city level. 
 
A
catalogue of eligible investments (roads, pathways, school, health facilities, city halls, sports, recreational 
facilities, sanitation, drainage, environmental improvement, markets, stations, and other economic 
investments) has been prepared and is included in the project implementation manual.  
 
To be eligible, all investment projects must: (i) respond to the demand of the beneficiary 
communities and to the priority of the district identified through Local Development 
Plans (LDP) and urban audits; (ii) require a financial contribution of 5% of the 
investment costs through CDF allocation; (iii) conform with the financial capacity of the 
city or district (the city or district should be able to maintain and manage these 
investments and/or take necessary measures to improve maintenance capacity); (iv) be 
economically justified; (v)  be designed to reflect the most appropriate and beneficial 
solution specifically toward the poorest households and avoid resettlement as much as 
possible); and (vi) be respectful of the environment and avoid any negative impact, or at 
least adopt corrective measures to limit or compensate this impact.  
 
Component 2: Slum upgrading and low-income development areas pilot interventions  
Objective:  Initiate pro-poor urban upgrading and land development programs  
 
Sub-Component 2.1 Upgrading programs in precarious areas in Kigali 
 
This sub-component will finance a program to upgrade precarious neighborhoods in Kigali. The component 
includes the potential resettlement compensation costs to be covered by GOR funding. During project 
preparation, a citywide upgrading strategy has been developed with MVK. It highlights a tremendous 
positive evolution in the way MVK is perceiving the issues of precarious areas and is willing to deal with 
upgrading programs. Three neighborhoods have been selected for interventions to be supported by the 
project.  
Page  4
The first basic interventions will essentially focus on improving access (secondary and tertiary roads, 
pedestrian pathways), drainage and run-off control, and public space improvements. A mechanism to 
ensure that people will not be evicted once the physical improvements are made is being developed with 
the Municipality of the City of Kigali (MVK). Street Addressing will also be carried out in one of the 
neighborhoods to test its replicability to the other. (The implementation strategy will favor labor-intensive 
methods, appropriate standards to reduce resettlement needs, community involvement in design, 
implementation, monitoring, and social intermediation). 
 
Sub-Component 2.2.  Pilot development zones for low-income dwellers  
This sub-component aims at defining and testing new practices to help control urban sprawl and provide 
serviced plots to low income households. The project will finance (i) a pilot project that will define and 
implement new standards for serviced land for low-
income dwellers and/or for households to be resettled;  
(ii) the preparation of a pilot improved housing scheme (plan de lotissement amélioré) that will include 
existing constructions and infrastructure.  
 
Component 3: Institutional Capacity Building  
Objective: to develop the capacity to use a number of improved urban management tools, 
to prepare pro-poor urban strategies, and to deliver better infrastructure projects. 
 
Sub-Component 3.1. Beneficiary Districts and Cities 
 
This sub-component will provide financing for carrying out programming studies, 
training, and implementing activities defined in the Municipal Support Program (PAM). 
(
i) Development of Programming Tools. (local development plans, municipal audits, 
maintenance programs, etc.,) 
(ii) Implementation of Municipal Support Program (PAM). This focuses on a few operational actions 
aiming at improving selected areas, critical for the management of decentralized entities, specifically in the 
field of resource mobilization, city management, and urban planning tools
.
These priority areas will be 
addressed along three lines: (i) logistical support (provision of basic equipment and computers), (ii) 
training, and (iii) timely technical assistance. This component will also finance specific district-level 
activities aiming to help fight the spread or alleviate the effects of HIV/AID, targeting the most affected 
groups such as youth and women. This will be done in close collaboration with the MAP project. 
(iii) Improving Maintenance Capacity. Maintenance efforts will essentially focus on 
roads and drainage network maintenance.  
 
Sub- Component 3.2. GOR Agencies 
 
This sub-component will support (i) sector studies and activities aiming at supporting selected reforms in 
the field of decentralization, urban planning, land management, urban environment, and infrastructure 
delivery, (ii) capacity building and training activities for GOR Agencies’ staff, and (iii) targeted logistic 
support to MININFRA.
 
Sub-Component 3.3 Local Construction Private sector  
The sub-component will finance a number of capacity building activities for local consultants and 
contractors of the construction sector. The training will target (i) technical execution and financial 
management of infrastructure projects, (ii) integration of environmental issues in design and project 
execution, and (iii) capacity building for implementing new urban strategies in poor areas. 
 
Sub-Component 3.4  Support to Project Implementation
 
This sub-component will provide financing for the effective functioning of the Project 
Coordination Unit (PCU), including staff, operating costs, technical assistance, 
evaluation and audits costs to implement UICMP.

A.4. 
Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis
:
The Project will target the capital city Kigali and five secondary towns: Ruhengeri, Kibuye, Butare, 
Nyanza, and Kabuga. All areas are still affected by the consequences of the genocide and have a population 
structure with a high proportion of widow-headed households. Because rural areas have experienced 
destocking of livestock and declining soil fertility, and with the return of refugees, the urban population 
growth is very high, close to 6%, which brings a new pressure on urban land and services.  
 
There are important differences between provinces. Some, like Ruhengeri and Gisenyi, 
are of high agricultural potential but have been badly affected by insecurity and have 
many people without housing. In Ruhengeri, large inflows of population contribute to the 
infrastructure deficit and put additional environmental pressure.  Other provinces, such as 
Kigali-Ngali and Butare have chronically low incomes arising from dense population, 
relative aridity, soil acidity, compounded by a high number of vulnerable households as a 
result of genocide, and aggravated by the current drought. 
 
(1) Butare province
.
This province has a lower agricultural potential and the high 
population density has reinforced declining soil fertility and interest in wetland 
reclamation. Deforestation also is a particular problem. City of Butare
,
the administrative 
capital of the region, is about 105 km south of Kigali, the capital. With a population of 
about 47,650 inhabitants, according to the 2001 census, Butare is the third largest city 
after Kigali and Ruhengeri. It hosts important health, cultural, commercial, and 
educational institutions, including University of Butare. The transient population of 
Butare town is estimated at about 70,000 people. City of  Nyanza
,
the seat of the King, is 
the ancient center of political, administrative, and business activities. Nyanza has a 
population of 50,000 inhabitants and an area of 129 m2. 
(2) Kibuye province. 
Despite its acid soils and high levels of erosion, it has a very high 
potential for agriculture, particularly coffee, and for tourism.  Parts of it are very poor, 
but the availability of lakes and wetlands presents an opportunity to increase agricultural 
production. City of Kibuye
,
the administrative seat of the province, is situated about 140 
km to the west of Kigali and has a population of about 42,000 inhabitants. The recently 
improved road between Kigali and Kibuye increased the level of housing and the 
commercial development in Kibuye. Located on the shores of lake Kivu, the town offers 
attractions to tourists. The challenge will be to encourage a sound development, taking 
into account harsh topography and preservation of the quality of the urban environment 
and lake waters. 
(3) Kigali-Ngali province.
 Despite its location close to the capital city, it includes some of 
the poorest areas in the country. It is densely populated, soil fertility is declining, coffee 
trees are old, access to water is poor, and the region has been affected by a period of poor 
rains. City of Kabuga
,
the administrative capital of the province, has a population of 
about 45,000 inhabitants.  Its close proximity to Kigali, 20km, and relatively flat 
topography, offers suitable sites for building and there is a burst of construction activities. 
Kabuga’s location makes the town open to the creation of informal settlements if 
relocation and spillovers from Kigali are not controlled. 
Page  6
(4) Kigali-urban
 has experienced a sharp increase in population since 1994. Like other 
capital cities in the region, it has lower child mortality than the rest of the country, but 
higher HIV prevalence. The large population influx has put a strain on urban 
infrastructure, especially for water and sanitation. There are pockets of severe poverty in 
Kigali; as a whole the urban-rural gap is very wide. Kigali City
,
the political, 
administrative, and commercial capital of Rwanda, is centrally located in the country.  
The population of Kigali is increasing at a very fast pace: the population in 2002 was 
reported as 670,000 inhabitants with an intercensal growth rate of approximately 9.2% 
between 1991 and 2002, putting pressure on local infrastructure and resources. A large 
part of the city is informal due to the large population flows. Kigali’s central location, 
with radial roads linking it with the provinces, has led to a lot of rural-urban migration 
particularly during the last 5 years. 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A
[
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
The project is categorized B. The environmental and social impacts will be site specific and minor, thus 
easily mitigated. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) are 
applicable under the project. An environmental assessment has been prepared in the form of an ESMF for 
the various towns already mentioned, since specific interventions are not known or defined at this stage. In 
addition, the interventions could result in the loss of land or restriction of access to source of livelihoods. 
To this end, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared. These safeguards instruments i.e. 
ESMF and RPF were prepared in accordance to national environmental policies, and the World Bank 
environmental and social guidelines and safeguard policies. On completion and approval by ASPEN, these 
instruments were disclosed in-country and at the Bank's Infoshop. 
 
Given that this is a Category B project, AFTU2 wishes to request transfer of safeguards review and 
clearance responsibility once the Final ISDS has been cleared by ASPEN.  The unit will further discuss this 
during the project’s Decision Meeting.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Potential large 
scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will have significant pos
itive impacts on the population’s health and quality 
of life through the improvement of roads, drainage, erosion and flooding prevention due 
to runoffs, and provision of social facilities to population in slums and under serviced 
areas. There are no foreseeable negative social or environmental issues implicated.  
 
During project preparation, the screening of infrastructure projects was carried out 
through the preparation of urban audits in the city of Kigali and three secondary cities. 
The choice was made to avoid to a great extent possible investments that could have a 
significant impact on a site. Environmental impact studies will be carried out on a case-
by-case basis, should a significant impact be identified. Alternative construction sites will 
be proposed as indicated in the ESMF. 
 
The Cultural Property (OPN 11.03) trigger was checked during ESMF preparation as the 
project team lacked information on a number of the sites to be covered.  The 
environmental and social analysis of the project which has subsequently been undertaken, 
showed that OPN 11.03 was not triggered and this is therefore marked accordingly in the 
present version of the ISDS. 
 
Potential specific impacts include:  
Measures to mitigate erosion and loss of vegetation must be provided in construction 
areas 
Individuals must be compensated for lost property and income as a result of the 
construction. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No adverse long-term impacts are anticipated. 
D.3. Treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Alternatives have been discussed in the ESMF. The “no action” alternative has been 
discarded since this would have aggravated the current living conditions of the population 
and the status of urban infrastructure. Asking communities to take charge of major 
investments goes beyond their financial capacities and would jeopardize the quality of 
works and their positive environmental impact. 
The financing provided through the current project will help the GOR and cities to 
implement urban infrastructure projects with specific mitigation measures, identified on a 
case-by-case basis.  
 
Page  9
D.4. Measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Prior to appraisal, the Borrower prepared an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) for civil works and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The 
two reports have been reviewed and final versions disclosed in the World Bank InfoShop 
and in the country.  An assessment of the Borrower’s capacity was made during the 
ESMF study. The PCU has been staffed with personnel qualified to supervise the 
preparation of EMPs and RAPs during project implementation with the support of the 
Rwanda Environment Management Authority. In cities, the Mayors will designate two 
staff (technical and financial) responsible for the follow-up of activities included in the 
City Contract. The newly created CMA (Contract Management Agency) will hire 
engineers, with proficiency in environmental management of urban works to oversee the 
implementation of civil work contracts. Additional training in environmental issues and 
assessment will be provided to the PCU, the CMA, cities, and GOR, on an ad hoc basis.  
In addition, the PCU and CMA will make sure that terms of reference for technical 
studies, as well as model contracts for works, include the necessary provisions in terms of 
environmental protection and mitigation of impacts. 
 
At the national level, the National Environment Policy (PNE) adopted in November 2003 
has lead to the creation of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA). 
This institution will be able to support the PCU with competent staff and advice as 
appropriate.   
 
D.5. Key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are; (i) the Ministry of Infrastructure (MININFRA), the PCU, and 
the CMA with the primary responsibility for the project implementation; (ii) the Ministry 
of Land, Environment, Forestry, Water, and Natural Resources (MINITERE); (iii) the 
Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) bearing responsibility for the 
implementation of the national environmental policy; and (iv) the participating cities and 
the beneficiary population. The City of Kigali and the 5 secondary cities will prepare 
their City Contracts in close collaboration with the PCU. The screening of infrastructure 
projects has been carried out during project preparation with preliminary consultation of 
district authorities and local communities (CDCs), through the preparation of 
urban 
audits
 in the city of Kigali and the secondary cities. The preparation methodology 
includes an environmental screening process and the preparation of environmental 
mitigation measures as identified in the ESMF and the RFP. Environmental mitigation 
measures and RAPs will be disclosed as appropriate at the city level through focus group 
discussions during the City Contract elaboration. 
A
social assessment has been carried out before designing investments and slum 
upgrading components. 
Safeguard documents (ESMF and RFP) have been disclosed according to Bank Policy in 
the country and through the World Bank Infoshop.
