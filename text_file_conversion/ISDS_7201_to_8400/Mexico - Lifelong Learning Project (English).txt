A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed investment is aligned with the current Country Partnership Strategy- CPS 
(Report 28141-ME of March 18,2004) and targets priority areas for the social and economic 
development of Mexico, focusing strongly on: (i) increasing the country’s competitiveness as a 
result of raising the skill and knowledge levels of the target population, particularly those in the 
formal labor market workforce; (ii) reducing poverty and inequality, as the target population 
belongs to the lowest income decile of society, including indigenous groups; and (iii) 
strengthening social capital and social cohesion as well as fomenting the participation and support 
of the private sector and civil society in addressing the attainment of the Program’s objectives.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed project aims at addressing the following four sector issues concerning the 
need to: (i) increasing the access to INEA’s services and improve its efficiency, as well as, 
responding to special groups within the 
Rezago Educativo
 (RE), like inter-alia, indigenous 
population and non-indigenous indigent adults; (ii) developing the necessary methodologies to 
increase the learning outcomes of the beneficiaries; (iii) thoroughly monitoring and evaluating the 
pedagogical model based on the premise of learning by doing; and (iv) strengthening the federal, 
state and civil society institutions to cope with an increase effective demand for adult education. 
 
An Adaptable Program Lending (APL) instrument is especially well suited for achieving 
program objectives that require long-term investments that transcend specific administrations 
governments, such as addressing the significant reduction of the RE
.
This APL proposes three 
loans of three years each, the first one covering the 2005-07 period, the second the 2008-10 
period and the third one, 2011-13. The MG considered the APL strategic in achieving the 
proposed long-term goals.

The institution responsible for the design and implementation of the IPDP has more than 
23 years experience in delivering education to adults in Mexico, including indigenous 
peoples. 
A
Social Assessment has been carried out and an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan 
(IPDP)  has been prepared.   
 
The project will implement the IPDP’s strategy for provision of intercultural bilingual 
services, which has already defined goals, phases and coverage.   
Major actions to be implemented: 
ƒ
The project considers the participation of 18 different ethnic groups which will 
join the program by phases. 
ƒ
Design of a model for bilingual intercultural secondary education 
ƒ
Design of intercultural bilingual didactic materials, including different 
dictionaries. 
ƒ
Teacher training. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The IPDP was prepared in consultation with some indigenous focus groups. 
The IPDP will be posted in the INEA’s web page. 
The plan has defined the full participation of indigenous peoples in the design and 
implementation of the intercultural bilingual proposal. 
They will also fully participate in the monitoring and evaluation process at the 
community level.
