B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The resilience against natural hazards of the infrastructure assets and the livelihoods of inhabitants impacted by 
Cyclone Heta will be recovered and improved to sustainable levels with due safeguards for the fragile coastal 
environment. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
A core program of recovery measures, focused mainly on the restoration and improvement of coastal resilience 
(through protection structures and drainage) plus some restoration and rehabilitation of roads, appears justified.  The 
core program is estimated to cost about WST 22 million, covering about 40% of the Government’s estimate and 
providing for necessary technical assistance to ensure quality in the complex tradeoff between performance and 
environmental safeguards.  This is equivalent to potential assistance of about US$ 6 million, if disbursing 100% net 
of taxes.  The following components are proposed: 
 
(i) Repair, rehabilitation and improvement of storm and flooding protection structures in areas damaged or 
threatened by erosion (approx. 12 km); 
 
(i)  Road repairs, rehabilitation or reconstruction, including culvert and drainage replacements, repair and 
improvement in affected areas (approx. 12 km); 
 
(iii)  Implementation support through specialist consulting services for the investigation, design, 
justification and supervision of the recovery of coastal protection measures (approx. 18 p-mths).

D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The civil works for road rehabilitation, coastal seawall repair and improvement will be located in various coastal 
areas of both Upolu and Savaii, as detailed in the IDA identification mission Back to Office report.  These include 
on Upolu: the eastern and western parts of the northern coast, the Apia foreshore, and western parts of the southern 
coast; and on Savaii: parts of the wester, northern and eastern coasts.  Coastal Infrastructure Management Plans 
(CIM Plans), which identify appropriate risk mitigation options in relation to mapped hazard zones, have been 
prepared for most of these areas and any specific gaps would need to be identified during preparation.
 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Significant capacity for assessing impacts and implementing environmental and social impact mitigation guidelines 
has been established in the MNRE under a previous IDA-assisted project (IAMP-1).  An MOU was established in 
2001 between MNRE and the predecessor of the Ministry of Works, Transport and Infrastructure (MWTI) on the 
application of a Code of Environmental Practice, which incorporates various mitigating measures, is now mandatory 
in all MWTI contracts.  The application of draft EIA guidelines, which require screening of all civil works projects 
for environmental impacts, is also required of all publicly financed works.  The proposed project would require 
evidence of both the COEPs and EIA guidelines being applied for works to be eligible for financing.
