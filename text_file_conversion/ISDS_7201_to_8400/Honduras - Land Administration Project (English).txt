A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project’s development objective is: An integrated and decentralized land administration system 
(composed of public and private entities) to provide users in the project area with accurate information on 
urban and rural land parcels and effective land administration services (purchase, mortgages, cadastral and 
registry certifications, etc.) in a timely and cost-effective manner. The system will help to increase land 
tenure security, facilitate land market transactions, develop national and municipal territorial plans, and 
develop management plans for protected areas, forests, and indigenous peoples lands. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will have three components: (i) Policy framework and institutional strengthening; (ii) Area-
based systematic land regularization, titling, and registration; and (iii) Project management and monitoring 
and evaluation.  
 
Component 1
 will be national in scope. It forms part of Government’s strategy to modernize a fragmented 
institutional framework and streamline the massive land registration process while increasing accessibility 
of land services at the local level. This component will support increased transparency and improved 
governance of the country’s main land administration institutions. The Component’s main output will be 
the establishment of a National Property Administration System (SINAP) through legal, regulatory, and 
institutional means. SINAP will include a National Territorial Information System (SINIT), a Registry of 
Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries System (SURE) and will be operated by public and private 
entities.  The project will finance preparation of policies and norms, technological development, and 
institutional strengthening.
 
 
Component 2
 will be area-specific. Activities under this component will directly benefit the populations 
residing in the project area by massive regularization and registration of an essential asset: land.  The 
project aims to cover different types of rural and urban land and a diverse cross-section of Honduran 
society including the rich and the poor; men and women; 
ladino,
 indigenous, and Afro-Honduran. The 
Component’s main output will be the incorporation of land parcels in the project area into SINAP. The

Component 3 
covers the administration costs of the Project Coordination Unit that will carry out 
monitoring and evaluation activities. The unit will be a critical instrument to ensure efficient administration 
of the project and effective coordination with other land-related projects in the country. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project's area of coverage includes lands within three departments of Honduras' central corridor: 
Comayagua (all), Cortés (all) and Francisco Morazán (urban only), select national forests, protected areas 
and indigenous and Garífuna communities on the Atlantic coast (in Colon, Atlántida and Gracias a Dios). 
Additionally, limited preparatory activities will be conducted in Choluteca. The three departments of the 
central corridor are largely urbanized, including Tegucigulpa and San Pedro Sula, the two largest cities in 
Honduras. These urban areas are connected by rural agricultural lands and 
areas de vocación forestal
 
(AVF), with protected areas (national parks, biological reserves, multiple use areas, and monuments) 
interspersed throughout, including five protected areas totaling 88,035 in Cortés that will be benefited 
through the project. Project activities target an additional seven protected areas in Atlántida and Colón 
(totalling 178,153 and 4,661 ha, respectively). Both the protected areas and AVF lands suffer from limited 
management capacity, and are for the most part protected on paper only.  
 
The project area is home to members of indigenous groups, including substantial Garífuna and Miskito 
populations, concentrated along the northern coast (Colon, Atlántida and Gracias a Dios), and pockets of 
Lenca and Tolupanes indigenous communities in the south-central part of the country (Francisco Morazán 
and Choluteca). The Social Assessment (SA) conducted as part of project preparation provides detailed 
descriptions of the location, socio-economic characteristics and legal status of these peoples. Additionally, 
the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) developed during project preparation provides more 
details regarding the legal framework and land tenancy characteristics for indigenous peoples who will be 
benefited through the project.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
ENVIRONMENTAL: In accordance with OP 4.01, an Environmental Assessment (EA) was conducted by 
ECOMAC, a Honduran consulting firm, and dated November 2003. This EA identifies potential direct and 
indirect environmental impacts associated with the project, develops mechanisms and measures to avoid, 
minimize and/or mitigate negative impacts, and presents an Environmental Management Plan with specific 
activities, budgets and responsibilities to ensure the implementation of these mitigating measures. In 
addition to OP 4.01, the EA and EMP address issues associated with Natural Habitats and Cultural 
Property. 
 
The EA found the range of potential environmental impacts (positive or negative) relate primarily to land 
use, including conservation versus deforestation or other land use changes. On balance, the proposed 
project is expected to be positive from an environmental standpoint. It would promote the conservation 
of forests and other natural habitats, both directly through the strengthening of existing protected areas 
and forest reserves in Comayagua, Cortes, and Colon, and indirectly, through the establishment and 
demarcation of indigenous reserves in Colon, Atlántida and Gracias a Dios. Land titling, cadastre, and 
registry services would induce a series of behavioral changes among rural landholders; many of these 
would be environmentally positive, although some could be negative. The environmental impacts 
(positive and negative) associated with induced changes in landholder behavior would be monitored 
under the project; nonetheless, any adverse impacts would be more than adequately compensated by the 
environmental benefits of strengthened protected areas, national forests and indigenous and Afro-
Honduran lands. 
 
Positive Environmental Impacts
: 
 
Demarcation of Existing Protected Areas
.  Under Component 2, the project will perform a physical 
cadastre (identifying residents of protected areas and their land use), survey and physically demarcate 
(through placement of limited boundary markers) approximately 12 existing protected areas with a 
combined land area of roughly 271,000 hectares (ha) (including Pico Bonito National Park (NP), Punta 
Sal (Jenet Kawas) NP, Punta Izopo NP, Texiguat Wildlife Refuge, Barras de Cuero y Salado Wildlife 
Refuge, and Lancetilla Botanical Garden in Atlántida; Capiro Calentura NP in Colon; and Cusuco NP, 
Meredón Reserve, Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa Monument, Laguna de Ticamaya Multiple Use 
Area, and Lago de Yojoa Multiple Use Area in Cortés). The physical cadastre will serve as the legal 
cut-off date (
fecha de corte) 
after which no settlers in protected areas would be eligible to receive 
(limited) use rights. All protected areas that will be demarcated through the project have existing 
management plans, the content of which will be disseminated through the project with the support of 
local NGOs. For each protected area, the assistance provided would be designed to ensure 
complementarily and avoid overlaps with other Bank-supported projects related to Honduran protected 
areas (GEF-funded Biodiversity in Priority Areas Project (PROBAP), Mesoamerican Barrier Reef 
Initiative, and the Forest and Rural Productivity Project) as well as bilateral and NGO-supported 
initiatives. 
Identification of Proposed Protected Areas
. There is one officially proposed protected area and/or site of 
known conservation value within the project coverage areas (Barras de Río Motagua in Cortes). This 
area will be physically cadastred like official protected areas, and no titles will be issued until the long-
term conservation status of the proposed protected area is determined by SERNA. In the case that 
national or municipal governments agree to establish new protected areas in the project area, the project 
would isolate for special consideration any proposed or unprotected sites of high conservation value in 
advance of systematic land regularization in those areas. Thus, the project will help ensure that their 
future conservation

new private land titles. 
Demarcation and Regularization of Indigenous and Afro-Honduran Lands
.  The project will survey 
and demarcate the lands of approximately 16 ethnic communities, out of which some 12 will be 
regularized and titled. In Honduras, the land use patterns characteristic of indigenous peoples are 
normally more forest-conserving and environmentally friendly than those of most non-indigenous rural 
peoples. While the land uses of most Honduran indigenous peoples are largely forest-based (including 
hunting, fishing, collection of forest products, and small-scale shifting agriculture), the predominant 
land use among non-indigenous rural people is often cattle ranching on deforested pastures. Thus, by 
securing the land claims of indigenous communities—both legally through titling, and on the ground 
through physical demarcation—the project will be instrumental in promoting more environmentally 
friendly land use over an extensive area. In the special case of ethnic communities which overlap with 
protected areas, the project will promote co-management agreements between the indigenous 
community, NGOs and the protected area management entity.  It is expected that the appropriate 
authority (SERNA) would recognize the ethnic community as a full reserve but subject to the 
environmental rules specified in the protected area management plan. 
Reduced Deforestation to Prove Use and Possession
.  In rural Honduras, the traditional means to 
demonstrate possession and use of a parcel of land is to remove the existing forest through cutting and 
burning. Conversely, much forested land (if not demarcated and actively protected) is perceived as 
being available for settlement and clearing. However, once they have obtained secure titles from INA 
(or the municipality if the parcel is located within an urban area), landowners would no longer need to 
clear their remaining forest to demonstrate their possession or productive use to others. They could 
maintain the forests on their lands without fear of losing them to new squatters or other claimant. 
Longer-term Land Management.
 Increased land tenure security resulting from project activities is 
expected to encourage some rural landowners to invest in reforestation, forest management, agro-
forestry, perennial crops, and other land uses with a relatively long-term payoff. These uses are almost 
always more environmentally friendly than with a short-term payoff, such as annual field crops or 
pastures on deforested lands. 
Appropriate Intensification of Agricultural Land Use
.  The project will improve land tenure security, as 
well as facilitate improved access to capital by landowners who receive clean, properly registered titles 
and/or use contracts. Both tenure security and increased access to capital by recently-titled landowners 
(all attributable to the project) will encourage more intensive utilization of those lands with decent 
agricultural potential. Such lands are presently often underutilized as cattle pastures, which provide 
relatively low employment and income per hectare. In the Honduran context, agricultural intensification 
on these (already deforested) lands would be environmentally beneficial by (a) reducing the land area 
needed to produce a given amount of food or income and (b) providing additional employment to the 
rural poor, some of whom might otherwise migrate to forested areas as new colonists.  
Limitation of Settling in Disaster-Prone Areas
. The project will limit the expansion of settlements in 
urban disaster-prone areas. Through linkages between PATH and the Bank-su
pported Natural Disasters 
Project, the project will delineate and prevent granting of property titles to parcels located in designated 
disaster-prone areas (slopes, floodplains, etc.) 
 
Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts
: The changes in landholder behavior attributable to increased 
land tenure security could be environmentally positive. At the same time, some of the project-induced 
behavioral changes resulting from more secure land titles and more dynamic land markets could be 
negative from an environmental standpoint. The combined effects of these environmentally positive and 
negative behavioral changes on the Honduran landscape are impossible to quantify a priori, since the 
number of landholders who would change their land use practices in different ways remains unknown. 
For this reason, the project will provide for substantial environmental monitoring and evaluation.  
Deforestation in Anticipation of Land Titling.
 A landholder's incentive to clear forest to demonstrate 
possession and use of a parcel of land should decline after receipt of a secure title made possible 
through project activities. However, it is possible that the landholder might accelerate land clearing 
activity in advance of the arrival of the project field teams who would measure, map, and register the 
land

)
.  The 
p
ro
j
ect 
Page  6
 
 
would seek to discourage this practice through a public information campaign which would emphasize, 
inter alia, that deforestation is neither necessary nor sufficient to claim possession of a parcel of land.  
Additionally, the project will establish official cut-off dates (fechas de corte) for forests, ethnic lands 
and protected areas, the physical conditions of which would be catalogued using data from aerial 
photos, after which no new deforestation would be acceptable as demonstrating “productive use”. 
Increased Land Clearing from Greater Access to Capital
. By receiving secure land titles, many 
landowners would enjoy increased access to capital, resulting from improved access to credit, because 
the titled land could be used as collateral, and from the "wealth effect" due to the greater value of titled 
versus untitled land. It is reasonable to expect that some landowners would use part of their increased 
access to capital for clearing the remaining forests on their property to expand their area of pasture or 
cropland.  
Increased Migration to Forest Frontier Areas
. Through greater land tenure security as well as improved 
registry and cadastre services, the project is expected to promote more dynamic land markets, through 
greater agility in the sale and purchase of lands. As a result of this dynamism, some rural landowners 
might be more inclined to sell their fully-titled land and use the proceeds to migrate and clear more land 
at the forest frontier. However, the available evidence on human migration in Honduras suggests most 
rural residents migrate to cities, rather than to new rural areas. Receiving a secure title is expected to 
encourage some project beneficiaries to remain on (and invest further in) their current landholdings, 
thereby reducing their tendency to migrate to new, forested lands. 
 
Environmental Management Plan
: The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) comprises the activities 
which promote environmental enhancement and mitigation under the project. These EMP activities are 
mainstreamed within the components of the project, rather than being supported by a stand-alone 
component; additional details on the timing, line item budgets, and specific institutional responsibilities 
will be in the Operational Manual for the project and the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). 
Protected Areas Demarcation
. Component 2 of the project includes support for the surveying and 
demarcation of 12 existing protected areas.  The Department of Protected Areas and Wildlife (DAPVS), 
within AFE-COHDEFOR would be responsible for implementing key project activities (provision of 
pre-field work geographical and legal information, commissioning studies, validation of field data) in 
national forest areas and protected areas.  The project will finance institutional strengthening activities 
at AFE-COHDEFOR, in the form of training and equipment.  
Areas of Cultural Importance
: The Project will support the conservation of Honduras’ cultural and 
archeological patrimony, thus helping to define other undeclared sites through project regularization 
activities. Specifically, so as to ensure that project activities do not result in unintentional titling of areas 
of high cultural value, if public or private lands are found, or suspected, to contain culturally valuable 
resources, information on these lands would be forwarded to IHAH and IHT and titling would only be 
allowed following an official finding from those agencies.  
Lands of Ethnic Communities
.  The project will support the surveying and physical demarcation of lands 
belonging to about 16 ethnic communities (either indigenous peoples or of Afro-Honduran descent) and 
the titling of about 12 of these, representing about XXXX ha, along the Atlantic Coast.  These activities 
will help conserve forests that would otherwise be vulnerable to settlement and deforestation by non-
indigenous Hondurans. 
Timing of Land Regularization
. The timing of land regularization activities would be carefully 
coordinated with protected area demarcation and consolidation activities to avoid prematurely and 
unconditionally titling lands within protected areas before the needed land management and 
environmental protection measures have been agreed between AFE-COHDEFOR, local residents, and 
other stakeholders. Specifically, the demarcation of protected areas is programmed to precede (not 
follow) normal land regularization activities, such that project field teams would be aware of the precise 
protected area limits.  There might be exceptional cases where the exact boundaries of a protected area 
would not be known on the ground (perhaps due to unforeseen delays in physical demarcation). In such 
cases, Regularization Areas (where field teams will systematically carry out surveying, regularization, 
titling, and registration activities) would be carefully pre-defined to include a sufficiently wide buffer

regularization of private land titles or claims would take place within or adjacent to any existing or 
proposed protected area prior to its physical demarcation 
Environmental Monitoring and Evaluation
. As noted above, many of the linkages between improved 
land tenure security, changed landholder behavior, and beneficial or adverse environmental effects are 
impossible to quantify a priori. Due to these uncertainties, good monitoring and evaluation of the 
project's environmental effects are all the more important. For the environmental monitoring and 
evaluation of this project, the key output indicators would include (i) the number and surface area of 
existing protected areas surveyed and demarcated; (ii) the number and area of lands of ethnic 
communities surveyed and demarcated; (iii) number and area of national forest lands surveyed; and (iv) 
whether key environmental agencies and NGOs are fully participating in project activities. 
 
SOCIAL:  
Indigenous Peoples
: The Social Assessment (SA) prepared by the borrower confirmed that the project 
would positively affect indigenous peoples, thereby triggering OD 4.20. Working with indigenous 
communities within the project area, the borrower prepared an IPDP that describes culturally 
compatible mechanisms for assuring those communities are benefited by the project. The IPDP includes 
specific activities, timeline, budget and responsibilities for ensuring these benefits are realized. 
Involuntary Resettlement
: The project will not result in any involuntary physical displacement or 
relocation of people. However, as the project demarcation activities will strengthen protected areas, the 
possibility exists that the current livelihoods of some Hondurans living within or adjacent to these and other 
special lands could be materially affected. As such, the borrower prepared a Process Framework to outline 
the criteria and procedures that PATH will follow in such cases, to ensure that eligible, affected persons are 
assisted in their efforts to restore or improve their livelihoods in a manner that maintains the environmental 
sustainability and territorial integrity of the relevant protected areas. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
The project design addresses potential cumulative and long-term impacts associated with the unconditional 
titling of land parcels within areas that qualify as critical natural habitats (existing and proposed protected 
areas) could substantially complicate efforts to ensure their long-term conservation. To address this issue, 
the project will support the surveying and demarcation of approximately 12 existing protected areas within 
the project's geographic area of influence and, importantly, will establish cut-off dates for settlement in 
those protected areas. Under Component 1, the project will develop policy to establish legal land tenure 
mechanisms that allow for legal land tenancy subject to limited, conservation-friendly management rules 
(such as conditional titles linked to protected area management plans). The project will also refrain from 
titling or registering private land claims within any identified ecologically important areas identified by the 
Government as high priorities for further study, to avoid jeopardizing their future conservation potential. 
Aside from these critical natural habitats, other natural habitats (mainly forests) might possibly be 
adversely affected by induced changes in landholder behavior resulting from PATH-supported activities.  
However, as noted above, these behavioral changes should, on balance, be more positive than negative 
from a forest conservation standpoint. Even under the most pessimistic scenario, the net deforestation 
attributable to such behavioral changes would be much less than the area of protected natural habitats that 
would be more effectively conserved as a result of the demarcation of about 271,000 ha of existing 
protected areas, along with the demarcation of approximately XX ha of (still largely forested) indigenous 
reserves.

describe the mechanisms to ensure project compliance with the Bank’s safeguard policies. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders for the project include members of civil society in urban and rural areas, public 
institutions at the national and municipal levels, specific social groups (including women, rural campesino 
and grassroots organizations, indigenous organizations), and NGOs working on environmental and 
indigenous issues. These stakeholders have been consulted during the preparation of the environmental and 
social assessments, the IPDP and the process framework, through a series of consultation workshops during 
project preparation, and a workshop on December 3, 2003, to disseminate the results of the revised EA, 
process framework, and IPDP. These stakeholders will also continue to be consulted during project 
implementation, through their involvement in key activities and components, as reflected in the Project 
Implementation Plan and annual work plans.
