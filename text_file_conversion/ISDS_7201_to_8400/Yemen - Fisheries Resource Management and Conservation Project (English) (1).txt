B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The objectives of the proposed project are to achieve sustainable use of marine resources and 
increase the household income of fishing communities through improved fish preservation, 
quality and marketing
.
The proposed project would also support the Government’s initiative  to 
strengthen its capacity in key public functions such as research and regulation in the fishery 
sector.  
To achieve these objectives, the project aims to: (i) provide policy and institutional support;  (ii) 
promote and strengthen local fishermen’s cooperatives to be engaged in the management of fish 
landing sites, marketing, monitoring, control and stock assessment; and (iii) raise quality 
standards to meet international criteria and as such promote fish exports and health safety.  
The development objectives would be monitored through: (i) increased fish exports value, (ii) 
recovery of critical fish populations, and (iii) increased income of fishermen in the project areas. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Page  2
The proposed project will be implemented over a 5-year period and will be the first phase of a 
two-phase 10-year lending activity. 
 
Project Components.
 The proposed project consists of the three following components: 
a) Strengthening of fisheries resources management
.
Under this component, the 
proposed project would support specific research activities such as trawl surveys and 
data collection from artisanal fisheries to enable early assessment of key fish 
resources. This component would also include the development of a monitoring, 
control and surveillance system (MCS) to help the country: (i) closely monitor and 
enforce industrial fishing activities; (ii) control and monitor artisanal and industrial 
fish landings; and (iii) control artisanal fishing gear and practices.
 
b) Fish quality improvement
.
This component would support the expansion or 
adjustment of fishing ports located in areas that currently export most fish and that 
have easy access to international air and surface transportation. The project would 
provide priority support to the development of appropriate coastal infrastructure and 
introduction of on-board fish preservation. In addition, support will be provided for 
training of Ministry of Fish Wealth (MOF) staff in enforcing quality control 
guidelines on board of fishing vessels and at fish landing places. The project will 
also promote the creation of a quality control system that would satisfy international 
requirements.
 
c) Institutional capacity development
.
This component would support the institutional 
arrangements and strengthening of fishing port management and cooperatives 
involvement in the management of fish landings and auctions, the collection of 
statistics, local quality control and the performance of all local MCS functions.
 
Institutional arrangements
.
MOF will be in charge of coordinating and following up the 
implementation of the Project. 
Alternative approaches considered.
 Due consideration was given to an alternative single 
project comprising both phases of the currently proposed project approach. Though this 
option could have been efficient in terms of economies of scale, the risk involved in the 
complex design of such a comprehensive and large-scale approach and the necessary 
institutional requirements is substantial. Hence, the two-phased approach was selected as it 
would consist in clearer and simpler design, immediately making available the urgently 
needed assistance while providing the opportunity to establish a favorable framework for a 
large investment to be undertaken.
