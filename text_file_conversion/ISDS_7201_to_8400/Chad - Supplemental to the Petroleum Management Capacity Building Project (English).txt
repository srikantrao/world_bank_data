B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The supplemental credit has the same DO than the initial credit, i.e., to strengthen Chad's 
capacity to: 
 
ƒ
manage the development of its petroleum resources in an environmentally and socially sound 
manner; 
ƒ
minimize & mitigate potential negative environmental and social impacts of the Doba 
Petroleum Project on the producing region, strengthen local capacity in the region, and 
provide opportunities for the region’s residents to improve their living conditions; and 
ƒ
establish an effective framework for further sound private investment in the petroleum sector, 
and engage effectively with investors. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Page  2
The proposed supplemental credit , in the amount of US$ 11.5  million, would retain the  
basic objectives and operating procedures of the Petroleum Sector Capacity-Building Project. It 
would consist of the following : 
(a) 
Environmental institutional Support ( US$ 3.0 million).
 The 
C
omité Technique 
National de Suivi et de Contrôle
 (CNTSC), and the 
Coordination Nationale
 have 
played the central role in the supervision and monitoring of the Doba Petroleum 
Export Project, and are expected to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. In 
order to secure the sustainability of these agencies, supplemental credit allocations are 
necessary to finance operating costs including salaries (US$ 1.4 million), training 
actions (US$ 0.7 million), technical assistance (US$ 0.7 million), and information and 
communication (US$ 0.3 million).  
(b) 
Doba Petroleum Project technical assistance (US$ 1.8 million
). Continued external 
support through consultants to support the Government in its contractual relationship 
with the private companies that operate the Chad/Cameroon Petroleum Development 
Project. 
(c) 
Reduction in Indirect Induced Impacts (US$ 0.5 million). 
Completion of five 
projects currently under implementation in the petroleum area, i.e. strengthening of 
the health sector, completion of the socio-demographic and health census, completion 
of a pilot project for sustainable forest management, completion of the installation of  
the Environment Management Information System, and building of municipal 
capacity for the delivery and management of public services for Doba and Bebedjia. 
(d) 
Line of Credit ( US$ 1.7 million ) 
for the Local Initiatives Fund 
(FACIL)
,
to 
continue the funding of community driven micro-projects. 
(e) 
Legal Framework for Petroleum Exploration and Development (US$ 1.1 million) 
drawing on the its experience with the implementation of the Chad/Cameroon 
Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project and on other countries experiences, the 
Government aims at preparing a regulatory framework that ensures the 
environmentally and socially sound development of Cha
d’s petroleum resources. 
(f) 
Strengthening of Petroleum Institutions (US$ 2.9 million) 
designed to enable the 
Government to improve its capacity to manage the further development of the 
petroleum sector as a whole. 
Contingencies (US$ 0.5 million). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Nationwide with a particular focus on areas with existing petroleum operation and areas where 
potential is well known or under exploration . 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
Page  3
The parent project had the following main components: 
(a) Technical assistance, training and institutional strengthening of the environmental aspects 
of the project; 
(b) Technical assistance, training and institutional strengthening for environmental 
management of the petroleum sector; and  
(c) Social infrastructure and rural development to mitigate social impacts of the project. 
 
The supplemental project has been designed to strengthen the first two components only. The 
country’s capacity in the area of environmental assessment and management is still weak. 
Therefore, this project is designed to build upon and strengthen what has already bee achieved 
under the financing of the parent project.  It will provide the mechanism for the government to 
properly monitor the current petroleum project, that has been designed to be compliant with WB 
safeguards, as well as address issues related to future petroleum sector development.
