A.2. Project Objectives 
 
1) Provision of employment services for an estimated 10,000 people  who are 
either recently retrenched and above 45 and/or those who actively seeking jobs for 
two or more years in RS and Federation  and 2) Further reform agenda to bring 
behavioral change and business change in the Employment services by focusing 
the PES on providing  effective   job brokerage services; providing employment 
assistance programs, including counseling services and programs to assistant the 
unemployed; and providing analytical and information services including 
disseminating labor market information. The SESP would use its  financial 
resources to leverage significant non financial outcomes of change in focus and 
approaches for the employment services. 
 
Key indicators would be (1)the successful delivery of ALMP and job brokerage 
services to an estimated 10,000 active job seekers and most vulnerable groups of 
unemployed (2)behavorial change in employment services through an increased 
focus on job brokerage and ALMPs and a reduction of activities unrelated to 
employment (3)cleaning of registered lists from those who have jobs to the 
registering and identification of active job seekers (4) effective mediation between 
employers and job seekers (5) establishment of procedures and processes for 
dissemination of timely job vacancies and labor market information (6) inclusion 
of private sector providers of ALMPs (8) formal inclusion of agricultural workers 
as employed. 
 
 
 
 
 
  
The project contributes to the PRSP objectives of improving livelihood opportunitie for the citizens of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the strengthening institutional capacity for this purpose including the reform

of social services and the pubic sector. 
 
 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
1. 
 
 
 
The project has three components (1) Provision of job brokerage and active labor market 
programs or employment assistance programs, including counseling services and 
programs to assistant the unemployed; and (2)Institution building and technical assistance 
to Employment Services (3) Project Management (details in Annex ) 
 
1.  Active Labor Market Programs and Job Brokerage Services (US$9.0 million): 
Would focus the employment services on matching employers with job vacancies 
to appropriately skilled active job seekers and would focus the employment 
services on providing, through private sector service providers, income earning 
opportunities to active job seekers and to the hardcore unemployed based on the 
experience of the PELRP. Activities under this component would include: 
counseling services; on the job training; support for self employment in 
agriculture, agribusiness, small businesses; job fair and public works; business 
advisory services and skills enhancement training. 
 
2. 
Institution Building and Technical Assistance to the PES (US$1.5 million):
 
Would upgrade and strengthen the PES capacity to provide and outsource job 
brokerage and employment services programs through the development of 
effective procedures,  clear guidelines and regulations, staff training and the 
piloting of analytical labor market information systems including introducing 
labor market research units in the Ministries of Labor.  
 
3.   
Project Management (US$1.50million): 
 Would support the project 
implementation and coordination between all partners in the SESP.  The project 
would be managed by the project implementation units and would include the 
supervision and monitoring of all components under the project as well as the 
knowledge transfer to and training of participating agencies (PES). The PELRP PIUs 
served as a significant source of competition for employment services in delivering 
ALMPs. The role of the PIUs as a competitive pressure would be maintained in the 
second project.  The PIUs would liason, coordinate and inform the line ministries as 
well as the World Bank on project implementation. The PIUs would be responsible 
for the updating and development of operational procedures.  The PIUs would 
implement the integration of all their functions and procedures into the government 
institutions including the employment services, based on the performance of these 
agencies during implementation.  To this end, this component would finance purchase 
of necessary equipment, operating costs (including staff salaries) and limited 
technical assistance (staff development program).
