B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed development objective of the project is to reduce rural poverty in accordance with 
the Government’s Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS), by:  
\01\02
improving rural access for communities to markets, off-farm economic opportunities, and 
social services;   
\01\02
increasing the capacity at all administrative levels to plan, improve and sustain the 
existing rural transport network; and  
\01\02
supporting the development of small-scale private contractors and transport service 
operators. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
This project will build on the previous two projects and be a “stepping stone” in the direction of a full SWAp. In the 
execution of the project the following will be the key principals: 
\01\02
supporting identified components of an overall provincial transport plan including sector-level Medium 
Term Expenditure Frameworks that will allow preparation of capital and recurrent budgets; 
\01\02
setting up partnership arrangements to facilitate agreement on a common policy and standards for rural 
transport between donors and government Ministries; and 
\01\02
 reducing the transaction costs of project implementation by common supervision, moving from prior to ex-
post review and using government, rather than parallel project, procedures during implementation. 
 
Direct provincial budget support will be provided in a small number of pilot provinces. In this 
case no distinction will be made between roads funded by the World Bank and those funded by 
domestic sources. The main project components are expected to be as follows: 
 
Page  2
 
 
Rehabilitation of the core rural roads network 
(US$ 85 million)
 . The focus will be on 
connecting the remaining communes which lack all weather motorized vehicle access and then a 
prioritized selection of commune and district roads. However, this project will provide greater 
flexibility both in terms of the standards adopted and function of road rehabilitated. Greater 
attention will be given to developing cost effective, coherent networks (including bridges) with 
optimum connectivity. As such it is anticipated that some sections of provincial roads will be 
included.  
 
Periodic maintenance of the core rural roads network
 (US$ 10 million).
 This component will 
support provincial maintenance budgets to provide periodic maintenance (re-gravelling or 
overlays) on district and commune roads. The component will be designed so that project 
support in the participating provinces will diminish over time as national and provincial funding 
sources become sustainable. 
 
Institutional support to MoT and the provinces
 (US$ 5 million)
. There will be three main areas 
of support: 
\01\02
to the development of national standards, policies and strategies for rural transport and 
rural roads maintenance, and the tools and partnerships that support their development; 
\01\02
to prioritized provincial level transport plans including maintenance strategies and 
funding plans which have been developed in consultation with districts and communes; 
and 
\01\02
to the promotion of a vibrant private sector to compete in the provision of infrastructure 
and transport services. 
 
A prioritized list of project provinces has been developed by the Transport Development 
Strategy Institute (TDSI) based on equalizing the burden of infrastructure funding on rural 
communities. It is likely that most provinces will be in the Northern and Central Highlands. The 
Mekong Delta has been specifically excluded because the upcoming Mekong Transport 
Infrastructure Development project will have a component looking at rural roads and waterways. 
The aim is to limit the number of provinces to 20.
 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Most provinces will be in the Northern and Central Highlands but they have not been finalized at this stage. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The borrower is implementing the safeguards requirements of the existing project in a satisfactory manner. It is 
likely that the new project will involve less prior review by the Bank and it is necessary that a proper review is 
conducted of capacity during preparation to make sure that this is appropriate.
