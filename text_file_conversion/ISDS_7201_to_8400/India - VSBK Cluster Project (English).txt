B.  Project Objectives  
 
The development objective of the project is to improve the environmental sustainability of the 
brick making sector in the country by supporting the use of alternative cleaner brick making 
technology. 
 
The global environment objective of this project is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases 
by increasing the use of energy efficient brick manufacturing technology. The various positive 
environmental and social benefits of the project have been discussed in the earlier section.  
 
The principal beneficiaries of the project include: 
 
o
The local community in and around the brick manufacturing units as they will be exposed to 
reduced negative environmental impacts. 
o
The local community, including small enterprises, who will have increased business 
opportunities  
o
The brick workers whose annual earnings will increase due to the potential of year round 
employment in VSBK plants as opposed seasonal employment in traditional brick kilns. The 
workers will also benefit from the specific community benefit program, implementation of 
which will be supported by the project. 
o
The global community will benefit from the reduction in GHG emissions

C.  Project Description  
 
The VSBK Cluster Project aims to promote an energy efficient technology as an alternative to 
the traditional technologies being used to manufacture burnt clay bricks in India by facilitating 
the establishment of about 132 VSBK plants in various parts of the country. This project will 
result in generation and sale of about 380,000 ERs to the Community Development Carbon Fund 
of the World Bank. The sponsor has agreed to further enhance the community benefits of the 
project with the additional carbon revenues by ensuring implementation of health and accident 
insurance schemes for the workers, supporting self help groups, and creating a mechanism to 
discourage employment of child and bonded labor in VSBK plants.  
 
The project will target the following Indian states: Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and 
Orissa. The location of individual VSBK plants will be decided by the entrepreneurs in 
consultation with the project sponsor, considering various market, regulatory, economic, social 
and environmental factors. 
 
Institutional Framework 
 
The project will be implemented by Technology and Action for Rural Advancement (TARA), 
not-for-profit society and a national research and development organization recognized by the 
Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India. TARA is the social enterprise and 
commercial arm of the Development Alternatives (DA) group, which has played a lead role in 
introducing and adapting the VSBK technology to India. TARA has extensive experience in 
delivery of business solutions to small and micro entrepreneurs in rural India.  
 
TARA will be responsible for the carbon transaction aspects of the project and will play the role 
of a bundling entity (on behalf of the individual entrepreneurs) and would be the key counterpart 
for the CDCF project. TARA will develop and implement suitable programs and mechanisms to 
catalyze the adoption of new VSBK plants, supervise their operations. TARA will coordinate 
with the entrepreneurs and monitor the implementation of all agreed components enabling 
transfer of the ERs to the World Bank. TARA will acquire the rights to the emission reductions 
by entering into a legal agreement with each individual entrepreneur. Individual micro 
enterprises will be responsible for mobilizing the required resources to set up their individual 
plants and to market and sell the bricks.  
 
The Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) of the World Bank will purchase the ERs 
generated from the bundled activity and has already signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with TARA 
for this transaction. While independent agencies accredited with the CDM Executive Board will 
verify and certify the emission reductions generated by the project, CDCF will have its own 
internal arrangement to monitor and supervise the project activities.  
 
TARA will develop an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and will use 
revenue from carbon credits as a leveraging tool to influence improved environmental and social 
management at plant level. TARA will require ESMF implementation as a condition for the 
entrepreneurs to become members in the bundling program.

D.  Project location 
 
The project will target the following Indian states: Chattishgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and 
Orissa. The location of individual VSBK plants will be decided by the entrepreneurs in 
consultation with the project sponsor, considering various market, regulatory, economic, social 
and environmental factors. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
VSBK brick manufacturing plants will be implemented by entrepreneurs who are likely to have 
initially limited understanding and insufficient capacity to handle environmental and social 
issues. Therefore, TARA has proposed to develop an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and use carbon credits as a leveraging tool for influencing better 
environmental and social management at plant level above and beyond the intrinsic 
environmental benefits associated with the VSBK technology. TARA also proposes to use 
ESMF implementation as a condition for the entrepreneurs to become members in the bundling 
program. 
Entrepreneurs’ capacity to implement safeguard measures will need to be further 
assessed during project preparation and necessary measures will be taken to ensure effective 
implementation of mitigation measures to address environmental and social issues associated 
with the operation of VSBK plants.  
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment 
is triggered considering the potential for cumulative 
environmental and social impacts of anticipated activities during construction and operational 
phases of VSBK plants, particularly if clusters of such plants emerge. The proposed 
environmental and social review will include, but will not be limited to, the following potential 
environmental issues requiring mitigation: 
 
·
Social and environmental issues associated with sourcing of raw materials including soil 
and water required to produce bricks; 
·
Social and environmental issues associated with transport and handling of different raw 
materials at plant sites; 
·
Occupational health and safety hazards (viz. Exposure to air pollution) associated with 
use and handling raw materials at the plants; 
·
Issues related to siting/locations of proposed 132 facilities/plants (particularly, if they are 
close to residential areas potentially causing air pollution concerns for the public);  
·
Disposal of waste material; and 
·
Cumulative impacts of 132 micro-facilities to be developed as part of the project. 
 
Other environment safeguard policies on natural habitat, forestry, pesticides, indigenous peoples 
and cultural properties are not expected to be triggered. However, the planned environmental 
review will examine applicability of any such policies and recommend appropriate measures, if 
found to be applicable.

On the social front, employment of contract and bonded labor, including child labor, are believed 
to be the common practices in India in the traditional brick industry (clay bricks). The possibility 
of the similar practice of labor employment will be reviewed and suitable measures will be put in 
place to ensure that such practices are not followed in the plants under this bundling program.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
In light of the issues (actual and potential) identified in the earlier section and the fact that the 
VSBK technology has significant potential for scaling up, there is a need to understand the 
sector-specific environmental and social issues associated with brick manufacturing and the 
associated risks.  There is also a need to identify the specific environmental and social issues 
associated with operation of the typical VSBK plant and develop suitable operational guidelines 
to minimize and mitigate the environmental impacts associated with plant operation.  
 
During the project preparation the above mentioned issues will be reviewed and suitable 
operational guidelines and management plans will be developed for addressing them. A revised 
ISDS will be prepared before appraisal of the project.
