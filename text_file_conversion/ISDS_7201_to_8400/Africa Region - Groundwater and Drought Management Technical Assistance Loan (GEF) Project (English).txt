A.2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is defined as: "The development of a SADC regional strategic 
approach to support and enhance the capacity of its member States in the definition of 
drought management policies, specifically in relation to the role, availability (magnitude 
and recharge) and supply potential of groundwater resources."  This outcome contributes 
both to key GEF programs and strategies as noted above, and to the overall objectives of 
SADC Regional Groundwater Management Program. 
 
The primary target groups for the project are the users of groundwater and groundwater 
dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in drought prone areas in southern Africa.  The target 
groups are addressed at three scales through the project 
–
at a local level in the two pilot 
Page  2
areas (Figure 1), at the river basin level in the Limpopo river basin, and at the regional 
level through SADC.   
 
At the pilot level
the principal outcome of the project will be that communities and users 
of GDEs will be better able to mitigate against the negative effects of groundwater 
drought in the long term.  While communities in the pilot areas may not experience a 
groundwater drought during the implementation of the project, they will be better 
equipped to deal with these phenomena as a result of the activities.  The outputs at the 
pilot level will consist of physical infrastructure (monitoring boreholes, extraction 
boreholes, pans, alluvial sand storage curtains
1
,
etc), and non-structural measures such as 
improved government capacity, strengthening of groundwater user groups, heightened 
community awareness of the need to manage groundwater and dependent ecosystems on 
a
long-term basis and possibly water pricing.  In addition, water conservation techniques 
such as conjunctive use of surface and groundwaters and improvements in recharge will 
be tested in the pilot studies if circumstances are suitable. 
 
At the national and regional level
,
Environment Ministries (and equivalent institutions) 
represent the national stakeholders and the SADC Environment and Land Management 
Sector represents the regional constituency with an interest in better management of the 
GDEs.  As a result of the project, these institutions will be better able to manage GDEs 
through the knowledge gained, the provision of tools such as maps and guidelines, and 
the establishment of a regional institution. 
 
Progress towards achieving reduced groundwater drought vulnerability will be measured 
through  
·
the development and implementation of agreed management plans at pilot level;  
·
an improved ability of local groundwater users and GDEs to survive groundwater 
drought conditions ;  
·
the ability of government officials to support the continuation and replication of 
these interventions; and  
·
the application of lessons learnt and the use of management tools at regional level.
At the regional scale, the principal outcome will be regional management tools and a 
regional Groundwater Management Institute of Southern Africa (GMISA) for 
government decision makers in the SADC member countries.  The GMISA will contain 
knowledge about managing groundwater droughts, including water conservation 
techniques such as conjunctive use and improved recharge, and thereby contribute to a 
long term solution to the problem across the SADC region.  Progress will be measured by 
endorsement by the SADC Water Resources Technical Committee of the regional tools 
(maps, database, knowledge management system) and guidelines; dissemination of the 
guidelines to member countries; and the establishment of the GMISA will contribute to a 
long-term solution to the problem across the SADC region. including completion of its 
initial staffing and workplan.

Alluvial sand storage curtains are small subsurface barriers constructed across sand rivers to impound 
subsurface floodwaters and thereby recharge alluvial aquifers.

The proposed project will be part of the GEF Operational Program 9 (Integrated 
Land/Water) which has the goal of “helping countries utilize the full range of technical, 
economic, financial, regulatory, and institutional measures needed to operationalize 
sustainable development strategies for international waters and their basins”.  This 
incorporates a special focus on projects in the African region.   The proposed project 
promotes this goal with its objective of improving regional technical capabilities and 
intervention strategies to promote better management of transboundary groundwater 
resources. 
 
The project contributes directly to the first two objectives of the SADC Policy for 
Environment and Sustainable Development (above) by improving access to water and 
protecting groundwater dependent ecosystems in the Limpopo pilot areas during times of 
drought, and by providing regional tools and an institution for the improved management 
of groundwater in drought prone areas, including groundwater dependent ecosystems 
(GDEs). 
 
A.3. Project Description 
Page  4
Component 1
–
Development and testing of a groundwater drought management 
plan for the Limpopo river basin pilot areas  
 
Rationale
:
The primary objective of this component is
 
to test the application and 
replicability of methods of decreasing the vulnerability of local communities and 
GDEs to the effects of groundwater droughts.  The rationale is also to ensure that 
practical on-the-ground benefits accrue to local people from the project.  The 
Limpopo basin has been selected partly because of the pressures its groundwater 
resources are facing, partly because of the extent of GDEs in the basin and partly 
because the groundwater assessment in the Limpopo River Basin has been 
specifically identified as a priority in the SADC Regional Groundwater 
Management Program.  Two pilot areas have been selected within the Limpopo 
Basin (Figure 1) because they were trans-boundary, representative of GDEs, bio-
diverse, drought-prone, had good data availability, and had good local support. 
 
Target Group and Outcome
:
Local communities, including local government, in 
the pilot areas are the main target groups of this Component.  Target groups also 
include the river basin organisations, particularly LIMCOM, and regional offices 
of national Water Departments and Environment Departments.  The main 
outcome at local level in the pilot areas will be improved long-term ability to 
withstand the negative impacts groundwater droughts on water security and 
groundwater dependent ecosystems.
 
Inputs
:
Inputs will include expertise in communications, facilitation and capacity 
building to assist in the establishment and strengthening of stakeholder 
arrangements to develop an agreed management plan.  Further inputs will be 
funds and technical expertise for physical interventions and data gathering, 
monitoring and interpretation to capture the ‘learnings’ from the pilot exercises.  
Where possible, a local tertiary institution will be involved in data gathering. 
 
Outputs
:
The outputs of this component will be improved ability of stakeholders 
in the pilot areas to manage groundwater and GDEs, the small infrastructure 
assets constructed in the pilot areas to reduce the shocks of groundwater droughts 
and the ‘learnings’ derived from the pilot process which will be the input to 
Component 2 of the project – the development of regional groundwater drought 
management support. 
 
Sector Issues
:
This component will provide a greater understanding at the local 
level of the role of groundwater in drought prone areas and measures which can 
be taken to balance human demand with the needs of GDEs.   
 
Component 2
–
Regional groundwater drought management support  
 
Rationale:
In spite of the importance of groundwater resources for regional 
growth, fundamental tools for transboundary groundwater management, such as 
hydrogeological maps and maps of groundwater vulnerability and water scarcity, 
Page  5
are not available in the SADC region.  The tools developed in this component, 
together with the improved knowledge generated through the research sub-
component, meet some of the specific needs identified by the SADC Regional 
Groundwater Management Program.  
 
Target group and Outcome:
Groundwater and environment managers from 
national agencies throughout region and SADC Environment staff will have 
access to an agreed mapping of transboundary and national aquifers as a basis for 
future joint management, improved knowledge of GDEs and the value of 
groundwater, and a set of guidelines for local groundwater drought management 
planning. 
 
Inputs:
Hydrogeological map and data (from associated French government 
funded projects); landuse, economic and ecosystem data-sets.  Climate data will 
be accessed from national institutions and regional Drought Monitoring Centre. 
 
Outputs:
Improved knowledge of groundwater-dependent ecosystems, economic 
valuation of groundwater; maps of groundwater vulnerability and water scarcity; 
greater awareness amongst decision-makers of groundwater role; guidelines on 
better management of groundwater-dependent ecosystems throughout region. The 
translation of information gained through the pilot programs, regional data and 
information, and the GDE research into practical management tools and 
guidelines will make the output of the project both accessible and useful at 
regional and national levels. 
 
Sector Issues:
Greater understanding of GDEs and their vulnerability will 
contribute to their protection and the sustainability of fragile resources upon 
which rural communities depend.  The impact upon and use of transboundary 
aquifers, particularly in the Limpopo River Basin will be better understood 
through the project together with the development of local management and 
physical modalities to ‘drought-proof’ local areas or at least increase their ability 
to cope with groundwater drought.   
 
Component 3
–
Establishment of the Groundwater Management Institute of 
Southern Africa (GMISA)  
 
Rationale
:
There is a need to maintain a long-term regional awareness and 
capacity to address groundwater drought because of the climatic variability and 
unpredictability in the region. This is both to provide follow-through to the 
project (the implementation period of which may not coincide with a drought 
event) and to maintain readiness and capacity for future inevitable drought events 
which may occur anywhere in the SADC region.  The SADC Regional 
Groundwater Management Program has identified the need for an institution (sub-
project 6) to raise understanding of groundwater management through research, 
knowledge management, coordination and capacity building.   
 
Page  6
The provision of a Groundwater Drought Monitoring Fund (GDMF) to the 
Institute will enable continuity of the project research program (included in 
Component 2) and assist the Institute to establish itself, to continue monitoring 
the pilot areas and set up an initial research program.  This will greatly extend the 
value of the project, particularly given that the project period may not coincide 
with a regional drought event.  The GMDF, administered and guided by the 
GMISA will be a key element in the management and protection of shared 
international aquifers in the SADC region and their dependent ecosystems. 
 
Target group and Outcome:
National environment and water resource managers, 
SADC Water and Environment Directorates, and developing River Basin 
Organizations will have a regional institution that provides data, knowledge, 
training and other capacity building, coordination with other regional activities 
and awareness raising of groundwater management.  
 
Inputs:
The Institution will be established with initial support from the project 
together with in-kind support from the host institution.  The data and knowledge 
derived from Components 1 and 2 will also comprise significant inputs to the 
establishment of the Institution.  The Groundwater Drought Monitoring Fund will 
also assist in ensuring the sustainability of the Institute. 
 
Outputs:
Institution capable of taking lead role in regional groundwater drought 
management. 
 
Sector Issues:
Provides node for promoting improved management to the benefit 
of all sectors described in A.1. 
 
Component 4
–
Project management and administration  
 
Rationale:
The project management is designed to provide maximum external 
support to SADC Water Division (WD) through a Project Steering Committee, a 
Project Services Agency and a Project Management Unit in response to lessons 
from earlier projects. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The pilot component of the project is located in the Limpopo River Basin as indicated in 
Figure 1.  This is a semi-arid area, which is highly dependent on groundwater.  The 
broader project is designed to provide the SADC Member States with resources and 
management tools to better manage and protect groundwater resources in drought-
affected areas of the region.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. 
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
 
The project has pilot scale interventions in two pilot areas in the Limpopo River Basin, 
which are designed to test the application and replicability of methods of decreasing the 
vulnerability of local communities and GDEs to the effects of groundwater droughts.  
Project activities will not result in any appreciable negative environmental or social 
impacts.  The small scale of the project activities and the nature of those activities 
(groundwater monitoring and pilot interventions for improving groundwater 
management) make it unlikely that resettlement or environmental damage will occur 
during implementation.  Through improved understanding and management of 
groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs), the project is expected to improve 
environmental conditions in pilot areas, and contribute knowledge to management of 
GDEs throughout the region. 
 
The following safeguard policies are triggered:  
 
International Waterways.  
The pilot areas are in an international water course 
–
the 
Limpopo River Basin.  Requirements of notification have been met through two ways:  
(i) the four countries involved in the Limpopo pilot areas (Botswana, Mozambique, 
South Africa, and Zimbabwe) have been represented in the Project Preparation Steering 
Committee, which has been the body responsible for over-seeing the preparation of the 
project and final approval of the selection of the pilot areas; and (ii) each of the four 
riparian countries noted above have sent project Letters of Endorsement, which fulfills 
GEF requirements.  These are on file and attached to the Project Documents. 
 
The following safeguard policies are not triggered: 
 
Environmental Assessment.  
The primary objective of the project is to improve the 
sustainability of natural resources through the use of a groundwater-dependent ecosystem 
approach.  Project design focuses on the implementation of specific components, which 
as a whole, are designed to improve long-term water resource sustainability specific to 
groundwater.  The array of potential project activities, such as physical infrastructure 
(monitoring boreholes, extraction boreholes, pans, alluvial sand storage curtains, etc); 
non-structural measures such as improved government capacity, strengthening of 
groundwater user groups, heightened community awareness; and water conservation 
techniques, such as conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, and improvements, will 
be confirmed during initial phases of the project.   Although some of the activities cited 
above may require further assessment, it is expected that few activities will have an 
environmental impact.  A Strategic Environmental Assessment to be prepared and 
disclosed during initial phases of implementation will confirm the impact once specific 
pilot activities and sites are known. 
 
Natural Habitats.
 
The Limpopo River Basin Situation Analysis identified a number of 
groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the region, including the riparian areas of the 
propose
d
Limpopo
-
Shaste Transfrontier Conservation Area and the Greater Limpopo 
Page  9
Conversation Area in the western and eastern pilot areas, respectively.  Pilot activities 
will not be implemented within protected areas, although interventions are intended to 
assistant local communities during times of drought and thus reduce pressure on these 
ecosystems.   
 
Forestry.  
Although the Limpopo River Basin includes a number of protected forest 
areas, they are not within or adjacent to specified pilot areas.  It is unlikely that any 
project activities will have any significant effect on forest ecosystems. 
 
Pest Management.  
The project will not finance or support the procurement or use of 
pesticides directly or indirectly. 
 
Cultural Property.
 The project will not include areas of significant cultural value. 
 
Indigenous Peoples.  
The project will be implemented with local communities but will 
not impact any indigenous peoples. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement.  
The involuntary resettlement policy is not triggered because 
project activities are unlikely to result in significant alteration of land or changes in 
access for both communal and private land.  Alteration or change in access is expected to 
be voluntary and any such changes will be small, with accordingly some potential for 
impacts.  It is expected that project activities would result in minimal loss of income or 
livelihood for community members.  Any interventions involving alteration of land or 
water resource practices will be taken by individuals to improve both environmental and 
economic sustainability.  Likewise, community interventions are not anticipated to create 
circumstances leading to involuntary resettlement. 
 
Safety of Dams
.
The project does not involve any dams or construction of dams. 
 
Projects in Disputed Areas
.
The project area does not include any disputed areas.  
D.2. 
 Identify and describe any potential large-scale, significant, or irreversible impacts
.
Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one 
safeguard policy or due to multiple project components.  Describe any potential 
cumulative impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area. 
There are no 
potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts apart from potential 
improved management of groundwater resources.  There are no potential long-term 
impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area, apart from improved 
management of resources. 
 
D.3.
.
In light of 1 and 2,
 
Describe the proposed treatment of alternatives.  
One of the 
primary objectives of the project is to investigate groundwater management alternatives 
in drought prone areas to both reduce the impact on groundwater dependent ecosystems 
and improve the water security of communities reliant on groundwater.  N/A 
 
Page  10
D.4. 
Describe arrangements for the borrower to address safeguard issues
.
The SADC 
Water Division will make extensive use of an international multi-disciplinary advisory 
panel, which is built into the project.  The panel will advise on all elements of the 
project.  The issue of the project effecting international waters is accommodated by the 
Project Steering Committee, which is made up of representatives of all the member states 
of the SADC regions, which includes the Limpopo River riparian countries.  A Strategic 
Environmental Assessment will be prepared during the initial phase of implementation in 
parallel with the specification of pilot activities and the designation of pilot sites within 
the two pilot areas. 
 
D.5. 
Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.  
The 
key stakeholders differ at the different scales of the project : the pilot scale and the 
regional scale.   
 
At the pilot scale the key 
stakeholders are the users of groundwater within the pilot areas.  
These constitute a variety of different parties including rural communities, small towns, 
farmers (subsistence and commercial), conservation areas, commercial tourism interests 
and light industry.  The stakeholders were identified in the project preparation process 
and were consulted in a workshop.  A stakeholder consultation process has been 
designed into the project, which will contribute to all key stages of the pilot programs.   
 
At the regional scale the primary stakeholders are the representatives of the member 
states of SADC, represented through the Project Steering Committee.  Other stakeholders 
to be represented through the Project Steering Committee include those concerned with 
groundwater management, community groups, a representative of SADC Environment 
and Land Management Sector to provide input on GDEs,  LIMCOM (Limpopo River 
Basin Commission - when formed), local government, NGOs, technical specialists and a 
representative of the hydrogeological mapping project.
