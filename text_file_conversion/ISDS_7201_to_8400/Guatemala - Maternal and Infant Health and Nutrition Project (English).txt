2. Project Objectives 
The proposed Project aims to: (a) improve maternal and infant health in 
the project’s 40 
areas of intervention; and (b) reduce chronic malnutrition among children younger than 2 
years of age in the rural areas of the 70 municipalities targeted by the project.    
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed Project (IBRD US$49 million) has four components and will be 
implemented over a five-year period. The project will be complemented with US$13.3 
million provided by the Government of Guatemala to support the operations of the 
CAIMIs during the project life.  
 
-Component 1. Strengthening of the Maternal and Infant Health Network (US$22.8 
million). This component would support the development of a Maternal and Infant Health 
Referral Network, promote the demand for maternal and infant health care, and 
contribute to increase the proportion of safe institutional deliveries, the referral of 
obstetric emergencies directly from the community, and access to a referral system for 
children with acute respiratory and digestive diseases. This component is divided into 
three sub-components:  
Page  2
1.1 Maternal and Infant Health Promotion from the community. This subcomponent 
would focus on the community perception of the maternal and infant health problems, 
thereby promoting the demand for health services.  
 
1.2
Strengthening capacity of the secondary health level. This subcomponent would 
develop a higher level of resolution of maternal and infant health services, to support and 
provide responses to the health problems identified by the PEC.  
 
1.3
Strengthening the referral system. This subcomponent would focus on the 
articulation of the PEC and CAIMIs and the CAIMIs and the hospitals.  
 
1.4
Creation of Maternal Homes (“Hogares Maternos”). This subcomponent would 
support municipalities to create Maternal Homes (“Hogares Maternos”) to 
facilitateaccess to safe deliveries to those women living in isolated areas.  
 
-Component 2. Nutrition - Implementation of the AINM-C and “Creciendo Bien” 
Strategy (US$21.9 million).  
 
This component aims to address the problem of child malnutrition in the selected 70 
municipalities by expanding coverage of community-based growth promotion and basic 
health services. In addition, this component will expand community-based capacity-
strengthening of mothers and families in the most vulnerable and indigenous 
communities. In a country like Guatemala, where half of the children are chronically 
malnourished and where acute malnutrition is relatively low, concerted actions are 
needed in the areas of health, access to basic services, education, and specific nutritional 
interventions. Moreover, in order to tackle the issue of malnutrition seriously in a country 
where, on average, 70 percent of indigenous children are malnourished, one needs to 
ensure that special attention is given to indigenous communities. A successful approach 
to preventing malnutrition therefore needs to focus on the most vulnerable population and 
consider two issues: i) ensure that demand for services is generated; ii) make sure that 
those targeted can best respond to intervention.  This component consists of three sub-
components: (1) Strengthening the basic AINM-C package of services; (2) Extending the  
Creciendo Bien Program in the most vulnerable communities; (3) Supervision of 
nutrition activities.  
 
-Component 3. Communication, Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuous Auditing 
Systems ($2.4 million). This component seeks to: (i) provide support to poor families to 
learn about nutrition and health programs, encourage poor and indigenous population to 
utilize health and nutrition services, promote pattern behavior, disseminate population’s 
right to utilize services, and encourage social audit; (ii) design and implement a 
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the nutrition and health 
interventions; and (iii) measure Project’s impact on targeted population welfare. In 
accomplishing these objectives, the component comprises three sub-components: A 
Communication Strategy, a Monitoring and Evaluation System, and the Impact 
Evaluation of the Project.  
 
-Component 4. Institutional Strengthening ($1.7 million). The Project, through this 
component, will support the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Health to implement 
and administer basic health and nutrition services. In particular, the project will support 
the UCPYP and the SIAS consultant services to provide technical assistance and 
equipment, for an approximate amount of $1.4 million. Apart from that, the Project will 
support the recently created SESAN to consolidate its institutional structure. Equally, the 
Page  3
Project will provide the Secretariat with consultant services, equipment, and workshops 
and training, for approximate ($0.3 million).   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
CAIMIs:  The team has identified 40 tentative CAIMIs locations as described in Annex 4 
of the PAD (p. 46).  Tentative locations of CAIMIs were selected considering maternal 
and infant health indicators, lack of access to secondary services and communications. 
Final locations would be defined through local workshops involving local organizations, 
communities and local authorities.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Incremental Hospital Waste:  The Government has already prepared a plan for CAIMI’s 
waste disposal management.  
 
Social Assessment:  The Government prepared and Indigenous Peoples Plan which 
activities are being included in the project’s implementation plan.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area:

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Government has taken the following measures to address safeguard policy issues:  
 
•
The Government has prepared a plan for CAIMI’s waste disposal management to 
mitigate the incremental hospital waste.  
 
•
The Government prepared an Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) as part of the social 
assessment to ensure mitigation of Indigenous Peoples issues in the country.  The IPP 
will be fully incorporated in the Operational Manual.  Martha RodrÃ­guez was hired by 
the Government to prepare the IPP.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
