B.  Project Objectives 
 
The objectives of the Colombia Sustainable Development TAL are to (i) support the incorporation of environmental 
and social considerations in the policies and programs that principally result in a high cost of environmental 
degradation, urban air pollution, water contamination, natural disasters and indoor air pollution; and (ii) strengthen 
the capacity of the National Department of Planning (DNP), the Ministry of Environment, Housing and Territorial 
Development (MAVDT), the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Health to improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of Colombia’s environmental management. The corresponding improvements in public health, 
productivity, and quality of life through reduction of air and water pollution, vulnerability to natural disasters, and 
environmental health and safety problems associated with the transport sector will principally benefit the poor, 
particularly children, who are typically the most affected by this degradation.  
 
C.  Project Description 
The components of the Colombia Sustainable Development TAL are directly linked with the 
Colombia Sustainable Development SAL program. The TAL will provide assistance to develop 
tools for the Regional Autonomous Environmental Corporations (CARs) and Urban 
Environmental Authorities to implement the policies issued under the first operation of the SAL 
program. Through its support of policy implementation, the TAL will help ensure that the most 
vulnerable segments of society have a voice (“a seat at the table”) in the identification of the 
costs and benefits associated with a particular policy. With respect to program implementation, 
the TAL will promote the integration of components, into broader programs, aimed at improving 
the health and quality of life of the poor.  The TAL will also support the implementation of 
environmental policy instruments such as command and control, economic instruments, 
environmental impact assessment, public disclosure and legal instruments to promote 
environmental mainstreaming and improve quality of life. 
 
The project components under consideration include: 
 
(1)  Mainstreaming environmental and social concerns in priority sectors
.   
Page  2
 
 
This component would support the Government of Colombia with respect to policy, program and 
instrument implementation, through the provision of technical assistance in the environmental 
health, water resources management, environmental education,  territorial development, and 
urban environment sectors. Improvements in health conditions would be supported by providing 
assistance in defining policy proposals and actions to prevent and control diseases that have 
environment-related causes, such as waterborne and hygiene-related diseases and diseases 
related to exposure to ambient air pollution and indoor air pollution, particularly among the most 
vulnerable groups.  
 
Water and sanitation improvements would be supported through technical assistance for the 
preparation, public consultation, and implementation of a proposed water resources management 
law and development of associated regulations. In addition, technical assistance would be 
provided to support the implementation of a program, such as a hand washing program, that 
promotes personal hygiene and prevents hygiene-related diseases among the most vulnerable 
groups.  
 
The loan would support the preparation of an urban environmental policy aimed to improve 
quality of life conditions for the poorest segments of the population, taking into account the 
reduction of vulnerability to natural disasters, indoor air pollution control, and increased access 
to public space. This policy would foster an urban environmental governance system to help 
address housing needs and also improve quality of life and to prevent informal housing 
developments in disaster-prone areas in the future.  
 
With respect to environmental mainstreaming in the transportation sector, the loan would 
provide technical assistance to control pollution from mobile sources, through programs to 
improve fuel quality and reduce emissions, and promote non-motorized transportation (e.g. 
pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths). Furthermore, these programs would also take into 
consideration technology-based standards (e.g., catalytic converters), road-user charges (e.g., 
tolls), and economic incentives to reduce dependency on motorized transportation and to 
promote alternative transportation.  
 
(2)  Improving the effectiveness of environmental management in Colombia
.  This component will provide technical 
assistance to the MAVDT in (a) developing an incentive framework conducive to sustainable development; (b) 
defining competencies across institutions and strengthening coordination among key stakeholders; (c) strengthening 
key processes related to environmental policies (e.g., pollution control and waste management and disposal); and (d) 
ensuring accountability and transparency in environmental management. 
 
In particular, the TAL will support actions to improve quality control and assurance of analytical processes for the 
monitoring of indicators established in the Three-Year Action plans (
Plan de acción tri-annual, PAT)
 of the 
constituent institutions of the SINA, particularly the CARs. In addition, the TAL will provide technical assistance to 
the SINA institutions to improve their management information systems to facilitate the collection and public 
disclosure of environmental information. These systems will support systems for monitoring, surveillance and 
assessment of compliance with the goals established in the PATs of the CARs.  The TAL will also include technical 
assistance to offices of the Judiciary, Attorney General, and Financial Comptroller.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
Given the scope of the Bank portfolio in Colombia, the  Borrower does have institutional capacity to address the 
safeguard policies.  The project will support the implementation of policies, programs, and tools to incorporate 
environmental and social issues in key sectors. The social and environmental impacts of the project are therefore 
expected to be positive. The TAL will play a key role in mitigating the adverse environmental and social impacts 
associated with long-term environmental degradation in Colombia.
