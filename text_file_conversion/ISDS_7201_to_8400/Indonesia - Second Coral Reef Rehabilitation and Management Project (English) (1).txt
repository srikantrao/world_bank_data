A.2. Project Objectives  
 
The development objective of the Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program (COREMAP) Phase 
II is to establish a financially sustainable program that is nationally coordinated but decentralized in 
implementation, in order to empower and to support coastal communities to sustainably co-manage the use 
of coral reefs and associated ecosystem resources, which will in turn, enhance the welfare of these 
communities in Indonesia.

A.3. Project Description  
 
The Coral Reef Rehabilitation and Management Program (COREMAP) Phase II would be implemented 
through three components: 
 
(A)  Institutional Strengthening
 - to enhance government institutional responsiveness to meet the needs 
of coastal communities, in support of collaborative management of marine reserves and larger marine 
protected areas. 
 
This component will provide technical assistance, human resource development,  management structures, 
and legal input to support a paradigm shift from centralized to local management of coral reef and 
associated ecosystems enabled by laws U.U. 22/99 and  25/99 and in accordance with KMK 35. 
 
(B)  Community Based & Collaborative Management
 - to empower all coastal communities throughout 
program districts to sustainably co-manage coral reefs and associated ecosystems to increase incomes 
which will in turn enhance community welfare.   
 
In program districts, coral reef resources (i.e. fisheries) comprise one of the largest sources of potential 
revenue and food security available to coastal communities and local governments. Through replacing 
short-term exploitative practices with long-term sustainable economic benefits, communities and local 
governments can drive the development process, thereby reducing dependence on central government 
finance. For these reasons, this component will empower 416 coastal communities in the first six districts 
to manage extensive and bio-diverse coral reef ecosystems in a cost-effective and sustainable way.  The 
expectation is that by the sixth year, the program is largely financed independently of external sources of 
funds. 
 
(C)  Public Awareness, Education and Extension 
- to promote societal awareness of the benefits of coral 
reef ecosystem conservation and sustainable use that leads to behavioral change. 
 
This component aims to address the knowledge gap in Indonesia of the benefits of sustainable coral reef 
management and thereby support the realization of behavioral change. Toward this end, the program will 
target children and youth through an education and scholarship program, key stakeholders through 
advocacy, local government and communities through technical assistance and awareness campaigns.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The Phase II Program will be implemented in 6 Districts (Pangkep, Selayer, Buton, Biak, Raja Ampat, 
Sikka), 2 National Marine Parks (Taka Bone Rate, Wakatobi) and 4 KSDAs (Regional Marine Parks). The 
locations were chosen based on ecological criteria and are located in the coral triangle, considered the 
world’s best remaining coral reefs. Approximately 416 villages living in these areas and dependent on the 
reefs for their livelihood will be eligible for participation in the program.  Their involvement in the program 
is entirely voluntary.  Finally, the indigenous people (Bajo) living in the program area are specifically 
targeted since they are most dependent on the reefs for their livelihood and have the most to gain from 
increasing the productivity of the reef fisheries through collaborative management and sustainable use.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project does not anticipate any large-scale, significant or irreversible impacts, as the aim is to 
support a process at the community scale to empower coastal communities to manage their coral 
reef ecosystems.  As part of this process, the project will support community-determined micro-
projects, all of which will be site-specific and classified as either Category B or C.  These micro-
projects could potentially trigger safeguard issues, so the project will include an 
Environmental 
and Social Impact Management Framework
 to ensure that the potential environmental and social 
impacts of micro-projects are assessed and considered as they are designed by communities, with 
the assistance of project-financed extension teams.   
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
The project does not anticipate any long-term or indirect adverse environmental or social impacts 
in the communities within project districts as a result of micro-projects, because of their small 
scale and the positive and negative lists (included in the Environmental Checklist) that will be 
applied in reviewing proposals. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
  
 
N/A 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
In order to address potential safeguard issues that could result from community-determined 
micro-projects, the borrower has prepared an 
Environmental and Social Impact Management 
Framework
 to guide project staff to assist communities in the design of micro-projects, so that 
they do not trigger the above safeguards.  This Framework includes criteria that automatically 
prohibits land acquisition, and hence involuntary resettlement, using project funds, and provides a 
process for determining whether proposed micro-projects trigger any of the above safeguards.  If 
triggered, the Framework includes procedures to ensure communities make appropriate siting and 
design changes, operating procedures, and where necesssary, prepare Environmental 
Management Plans which must be approved by the Program Management Unit (PMU) prior to 
COREMAP Phase II approval of micro-projects for funding.  The PMU in each program district 
will be assisted by international consultants and budget for technical assistance as needed, in 
order to ensure the capacity is present to review micro-projects and assist in their design, and in 
the implementation of the Framework.

Proposed ISDS PAD Format – Draft Pre-meeting with ISG - March 15, 2004 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
National
 ministries and line agencies necessary to successfully design, prepare, coordinate and 
implement the Phase II project are represented through the established multi-agency GOI  Design 
Team, the GOI Intra-Agency Preparation Team, and the GOI Intra-Agency Operational Team; 
District
 officials participate in design, preparation, coordination, and implementation through 
their representation on the national teams referred to above; each 
Community
 and co-management 
regime is the cornerstone of the Phase II project.  Without community engagement, the project 
will not succeed.  As a result, communities have been engaged from the very beginning of project 
preparation through the participatory social assessment/consultative process, etc.    
 
Prior to the implementation of activities at all Project sites, the communities will engage in a 
comprehensive planning process that identifies constraints, risks, and opportunities under the 
project. 
A Gender Action Plan
 (under preparation by ADB funded technical assistance 
consultants) will delineate how the Project will encourage women’s participation and provide 
opportunities for them to play active roles in setting up, operating, and managing small-scale 
income-generating projects. It will also ensure that 
indigenous people
 are consulted on each 
activity developed and are able to participate fully and obtain benefits from the planning and 
implementation of community empowerment activities, particularly for the establishment of 
required basic services.  While project sites have heterogeneous populations, the social 
assessment has determined that most project villages are ethnically homogenous.
