B.  Project Objectives 
 
The recent discussions of the 2006-2009 CAS identified two key constraints in achieving the 
Government’s development objectives for the education sector:  a) deficiencies in the financing formula 
and in staff capacities for effective  budgeting and programming, and b) deficient learning achievement in 
general secondary schools due to: i) inadequate availability of basic learning materials in schools, ii) 
teacher’s lack of proficiency in effective teaching methods, and iii) poor children’s lack of access to 
textbooks and other necessities for effective learning.  Two broad development outcomes for general 
secondary schools were agreed with the Government, and these coincide with the proposed development 
objectives for the Basic Education Project:   
·
An improved education financing system, and improved programming and use of education resources, 
and  
·
Improved school attendance and more effective teaching (and improved learning): in general secondary 
schools a) which receive new teaching and learning materials, b) which implement interventions 
targeted to poorest students, and c) where teachers adopt improved teaching practices as a result of in-
service training. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The proposed project design reflects a desire to respond to the Government’s request for assistance in 
financing its Program.  At the same time, the project design aims to introduce a more strategic, evidence-
based and results-based approach to education management – both at the national level and at the school 
level.  The preliminary project proposal includes five components that need to be carefully linked in order 
Page  2
to improve educational outcomes and results.  The project would be financed by an IDA credit of US$40 
million.  Implementation would cover the remaining years of the Government’s Program: 2006 through 
2009.  
Component 1: Provision of learning materials for general secondary schools (estimated IDA financing, 
US$25 million).
 
Computers and textbooks are being provided to general secondary schools by other donors, 
but no financing has yet been committed for other learning materials, such as teachers manuals, 
supplementary readers, student workbooks, maps, carts, and other visual aids, and very little has been 
provided for science laboratory equipment.  These materials are necessary for effective learning and are 
provided for in the curriculum, but are not available in most schools, as documented in the school survey 
which was carried out early in 2004.  It is proposed that the project provide these materials – prospectively 
through a demand-driven process in which schools select from a positive list the learning materials that are 
most relevant to their specific learning needs.   The Ministry has already developed lists of core learning 
materials for each grade and subject.  
Component 2: Strengthening of in-service training for teachers and principals in general secondary 
schools (estimated IDA financing US$4 million).
 
This component would train teachers in more effective 
teaching practices, such as how to use the teaching and learning materials which are to be provided under 
Component 1, how to diagnose the learning progress of their students, and how to address the learning 
needs of their students.  The Ministry has experience with various models of in-service teacher training 
which it is implementing with other donors.  This component would build on and reflect the lessons of 
that experience.   
Component 3: Support for Learning Improvement Plans for schools (estimated IDA financing US$5 
million).
 
This component would support the preparation and implementation of Learning Improvement 
Plans for schools, which specifically address the learning constraints of students from poor households.  It 
is intended to introduce a more holistic approach to diagnosing learning needs at the school level, and 
designing and carrying out school-based interventions to address them.  The Government recently enacted 
legislation enabling schools to establish School Boards comprising parents, teachers, and other 
stakeholders.  The USAID PEAKS project is helping train some School Boards in school/community 
partnerships (although not providing grant financing), and ADB is supporting the preparation and 
implementation of school grants in 1,000 secondary schools.  This component would build on these 
activities to support Learning Improvement Plans in additional general secondary schools.  The 
implementation plan for this component would aim to adopt the implementation arrangements and 
materials developed and put into operation under these other projects  The current proposal assumes that 
about 2,000 schools would be covered, but the actual number could be considerably less than that.  A key 
constraint is likely to be the availability of NGOs and other local service providers to help School Boards 
develop viable Learning Improvement Plans.  The size and phasing of the component would be scaled to 
fit within this capacity constraint.  Another important question is whether school grants should be limited 
to rural schools, whose educational needs are generally more acute than those of rural schools. 
Component 4:  Improvements in education finance, budgeting and management (estimated IDA financing 
US$3 million).
 
This component would support: a) technical assistance to improve the capitation formula 
for decentralized education finance, and b) an extensive program of training for local, regional, and 
central staff who are involved in education programming and budgeting help them do a better job of 
managing education resources.  The activities to be carried out under this component are also expected to 
equip Ministry of Education staff to play a stronger role with the Ministry of Finance and other partners in 
the budget planning process, in PRSP formulation, and in other policy deliberations which impact the 
education sector.  
Component 5: Support for project management and results management (estimated IDA financing US$3 
million).
 
This component would support technical assistance and consultant services, office hardware and 
software, and, possibly, incremental recurrent costs to ensure effective management of project 
Page  3
implementation, including monitoring and evaluation of project activities and development outcomes, and 
timely project audits.  Monitoring and evaluation would  also examine the development outcomes of the 
Government’s broader program.  Project implementation benchmarks would be developed with the intention 
of documenting early implementation successes, on the basis of which a possible sequel project could be built.  
This component would also provide technical assistance to help design a possible follow-on education project. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project locations will include the capital, Tashkent, especially with regard to key technical 
assistance to the Ministry of Education.  Learning materials provided to schools will be 
distributed throughout the country. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
It is not anticipated that safeguard actions will be required.
