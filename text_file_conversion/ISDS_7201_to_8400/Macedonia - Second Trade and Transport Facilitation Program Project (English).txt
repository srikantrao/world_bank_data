B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
 
The overall development objective is to enhance regional trade and transport through facilitating 
related operations along the main transport corridors. To this end, the project would: (i) 
streamline rail border crossing procedures and rail information systems along corridor X; (ii) 
remove remaining physical and institutional bottlenecks in Corridor X road infrastructure and 
optimizing the road toll collection system; (iii) improve freight information flows along Corridor 
X, building on the integrated border management strategy of Macedonia; and (iv) build capacity 
of traders and transport companies to access markets and dialogue with the government. The 
project would thus cooperate to enhance the business environment in Macedonia, strengthening 
competitiveness and stimulating economic growth. 
 
The project is intended to be part of a regional program that may cover all other countries in 
Southeast Europe, creating potential synergies, particularly on information flows and corridor 
optimization, as projects in the other countries are taken forward However, the benefits of this 
project are expected to also justify unilateral implementation. 
 
The main indicators of performance for the regional program would include: (i) increased transit 
turnover on the rail corridor X (to be quantified in US$ million); (ii) increased road toll 
collection by xx percent; (iii) reduced truck travel time between Tabanovce and Bogorodica by 
Page  2
xx percent; (iv) reduced processing time at border crossing by xx percent and reduced variation 
in processing time. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
 
The total project cost is estimated at US$18 million. Bank financing would be around US$15 
million. Grant funding would be sought for the Trade Capacity Building component, with 
matching contribution from the Chamber of Commerce.  
 
TTFSE II would be the second phase of a multi-phased approach, initiated with TTFSE I, for 
enhancing the trade competitiveness of the region as a whole and Macedonia in particular. 
Improvement of trade movement on Corridor X is an essential part of this overall multi-phased 
approach, and would also logically move into its second phase with the TTFSE II.  
 
The project would support the CAS objective for efficient management of public resources and 
tackling corruption  through more efficient and effective operation of the roads and railways, 
enhancing border crossing agencies services and transparency and supporting regional 
integration by increasing cooperation between the border crossing agencies, harmonizing 
procedures, and increasing transparency. It would also support the CAS objective of sustainable, 
private sector driven growth. To this end the project design will be coordinated with the PSAL 
and BERIS projects currently under preparation. 
 
The project would have the following components. 
 
The Rail Border Crossing Streamlining Component
-
expected to require 8% of the resources, 
would focus on developing new traffic (including container traffic) by improving border 
processing on Corridor X. It would include an upgrade to the information system (network, main 
server and software application for data exchange) used by Macedonian Railways (MR) to 
communicate with shippers/forwarders, border agencies, foreign railways, and modification of 
border procedures with detailed performance measurements, preferably in partnership with the 
Serbian railways to minimize downtime. This component would be subject to the commitment of 
MR to modify procedures. 
 
Road Corridor X Improvement
-
this component would involve further infrastructure 
improvement of Corridor X in Macedonia: in the section Tabanovce 
–
Kumanovo (total length 
7km), which would be rehabilitated up to 2-lane motorway standards along the existing 
alignments. 
 
Modernizing the Road Toll Collection System
-
would help develop a new toll collection system 
that would reduce cash transactions which would be applied on both corridors (VIII and X) in the 
country, thereby improving time-effectiveness and reducing fraud and corruption along the main 
transport corridors. 
 
Upgrading BCP Facilities
-
would remove the bottleneck on the road link from Skopje to Kosovo 
by improving infrastructure at the BCP Blace.   
 
Page  3
The improvement of Road Corridor X, the modernization of the road toll collection system and 
the upgrading of the facilities at BCP Blace would require, altogether, 69% of the funds. 
 
The Integrated Border Management for Freight Component
,
requiring an estimated 17% of the 
resources would support the implementation of a single window concept for freight traffic 
processing. The component would include technical services to streamline the overall border 
processing of freight, simplify interagency documentary requirements in line with EU practices, 
define optimized information flows and processing in partnership with neighboring countries, 
and support the various agencies in developing and implementing a single window environment. 
The component would further the transparency efforts initiated under TTFSE by expanding the 
TTFSE website (
www.ttfse.org
)
to provide procedures related to rail transport and to offer 
country pages in Macedonian as requested by users. It would review the possibility to implement 
low cost supply chain management integration solutions (software-electronic documents) for 
small and mid-size firms, building on the outcome of an on-going USAID-sponsored pilot in the 
region.  
 
The Trade Capacity Building Component
,
building on the successful training programs under the 
TTFSE program, this component (requiring an estimated 6% of the resources) would cover: (i) 
training of mid-level managers on logistics and supply chain management concepts, and 
continuation of the TTFSE training programs for border agency staff and private sector; (ii) 
reinforcing of qualitative criteria for transport and freight forwarding companies; and (iii) 
building-
up
the capacity of the Macedonian PRO Committee, Freight Forwarders’ Association, 
and road transport associations to constructively work together and interact with the Government 
to advance the trade and transport facilitation agenda.  This component would build on activities 
from other donors.
 
Grant funding with matching by the Chamber would be sought to finance this 
component.   
 
Given the complexity of problems that TTFSE II sets itself the objective to address, the proposed 
improvements would need to be carefully prioritized and phased in order to ensure that the 
envisaged project finance of US$18 is allocated in the most efficient way. As for the Road 
Corridor X and the Blace BCP improvements, feasibility and preliminary design studies are 
available and will be reviewed at pre-appraisal. Further phasing of the project will be done in 
coordination with Government, depending on availability of supporting studies.
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations under consideration 
or how the location is to be determined during project preparation]
 
The project will be located in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
 
The Macedonian Ministry of Finance has gained adequate experience in implementing safeguard 
policies through the first TTFSE project. It is essential however to maintain and improve the 
capability of staff working on the project and therefore appropriate training programs will be 
provided under TTFSE II.

Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[X] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
This safeguard policy will be triggered as the project activities include 
infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance and an EA with EMP will be 
developed at the time of project appraisal. As the overall regional program gets 
developed, it may be possible for this project to be 
considered a “country 
systems” pilot for ECA if this program is approved by the Board. In this case, the 
PAD will have to include an environmental “equivalency analysis” (as per Table 
A.1 in Annex A of the October 2004 draft Board paper on country systems and as 
amended in final expected February 2005).
