A.2. Proj
ect Objectives
The overall development objectives of the LVEMP 
--
 carried out under a Joint Project 
Agreement, dated September 10, 1996, covering Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda 
--
 are to: 
(a)
maximize the sustainable benefits to riparian communities from using r
esources 
within the basin to generate food, employment and income, supply safe water, 
and sustain a disease
-
free environment; and 
(b)
conserve biodiversity and genetic resources for the benefit of the riparian 
countries in particular and the global community 
in general.
The project is the first phase of a longer term program whose aims are as outlined above.  The 
Page  2
objectives of the first phase are to provide the necessary information to improve management of 
the lake ecosystem, establish mechanisms for cooperat
ive management by the three countries, 
identify and demonstrate practical, self
-
sustaining remedies, while simultaneously building 
capacity for ecosystem management.
A.3. Project Description
The activities supported by the Supplemental Finance will be 
continuation of specific pilot
-
level 
activities in the Lake and its catchment and baseline data collection.  The largest cost items to be 
funded by the Supplemental would include:
Fisheries Research:
 Rapid assessment of satellite lakes, monitoring and mapp
ing of main lake, 
information dissemination, publishing of two regional books on fisheries and biodiversity, and 
updating fisheries data base;
Fisheries Management:
 Reducing illegal fishing practices, disseminate aquaculture technology 
to farmers, data pr
ocessing and analysis of lake
-
wide frame survey, reducing post
-
harvest losses, 
harmonize fish inspection, quality assurance and certification among Partner countries, and 
operationalize the Fisheries Development Fund;
Water Hyacinth Control:
 Continued rea
ring and release of weevils, preparing a joint plan with 
Kenya and Uganda for technical assistance to Rwanda and Burundi (with the expectation that a 
reduction of hyacinth infestations in the upstream countries would reduce the inflow of the weed 
via the K
agera river), research on weevil performance in rivers, continued information 
dissemination;
Water Quality and Ecosystem Management:
 Translate research findings into management 
actions, continue water quality monitoring;
Wetlands Management:
 Continue wit
h the rehabilitation of degraded wetlands, support socio
-
economic conservation activities, disseminate research findings, develop management plans;
Integrated Soil and Water Conservation: 
Update data base on agrochemicals, train extension 
staff, dissemina
te information, continue on
-
farm demonstration of various effective technologies, 
conduct farmer study tours, support women’s groups to adopt more efficient wood burning 
stoves;
Catchment Afforestation:
 Complete activities in and around Magana village for
est, manage two 
additional forest reserves, raise and plant an additional 1,000,000 trees in central and community
-
based nurseries, train farmers to develop local seed sources;
Support to Riparian Universities:
 procurement of textbooks, chemicals and offi
ce supplies; 
training incl. field trips, rehabilitation of aquatic science laboratory and establishment of field 
station in Mwanza;
Micro projects:
 Completion of four projects, making full use of created assets in some 
underutilized ones, build local capa
city, and orient existing micro projects toward conservation of 
Lake Victoria (through tree planting, soil conservation, and energy saving stoves);
Page  3
Community Participation: 
Publish strategy, create further awareness and capacity; and
National/Regional Se
cretariat: 
Organize or participate in Project Implementation Committee 
Meetings, attend regional workshops, harmonize regional work, legislation, etc., support Regional 
Policy Steering Committee meetings, develop data bases, disseminate information, assist
 all 
components with procurement.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis
:
The Project is located in the Tanzanian part of Lake Victoria and its watershed.

Section II 
–
 Key Safeguard Issues and The
ir Management 
D. Summary of Key Safeguard 
Issues
. 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No significant negative e
nvironmental impacts are expected.  Minor, manageable adverse 
effects are possible from some project activities (e.g. certain methods of water hyacinth 
and pollution control).
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipate
d future 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
Page  4
activities in the project area.
No potential indirect or long
-
term impacts are expected.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives 
(if relevant)
Not applicable.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower 
to address safeguard issues. Pr
ovide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Environmental Assessment:
  Recommendations from original 1995 Environmental 
Analysis to manage possible adverse effects from some project activities remain relevant 
and
 applicable, and are being implemented. Borrower capacity to implement these 
recommendations is adequate.
Projects in International Waterways:
  Lake Victoria is owned by the three countries 
participating in the project.  All three are actively collaborati
ng in management of the 
project through a tripartite agreement.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project has an amb
itious public dissemination plan to reach all stakeholders at all 
levels (local, national, regional and international).  NGOs are partners in the 
implementation of most components, and local communities are involved through 
microprojects.  Project reviews 
by QAG, the GEF and various bilaterals (SIDA, 
NORAD) have all been positive.
E. Safeguards Classification
(select one).
  Category is determined by the highest impact 
in any policy.  Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards.  Whenever 
an
 individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1 
–
 Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and 
institutional risks in management of one or more safeguard areas.
[X] S2 
–
 One or mo
re safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their 
impact and are technically and institutionally manageable.
[ ] S3 
–
 No safeguard issues
[ ] SF 
–
 Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven 
development
 or similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic 
approach to address safeguard issues.
