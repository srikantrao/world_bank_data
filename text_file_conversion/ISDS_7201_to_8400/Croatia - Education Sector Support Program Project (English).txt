A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Bank’s sector-wide Education Sector Support Program (ESSP) will help to develop the education system’s 
capacity to continuously improve the provision of education services to better address the expectations of a 
changing society.  
The development objective of the ESSP is improved student learning and system performance.
 
The medium-term objective is that teachers and students will use a wider range of appropriate methods in the 
education process, and that the system functions in more efficient way. To achieve these objectives, the ESSP 
supports professional and institutional development, monitoring and evaluation of education, and regional 
innovations, investments and reform initiatives that will improve the capacities of the education system in a 
sustainable way. 
 
The ESSP supports the overall objectives of the new CAS (2005-2008).  In particular, the ESSP will contribute 
to the wide participation in the economic growth by improving targeting, sustainability, quality, and efficiency 
of education services.  In doing so, the ESSP will support much of the effort Croatia needs to undertake during 
the next four years to meet EU accession expectations in education sector.
 
A.3.  Project Description 
 
The ESSP will provide pooled financing for the MoSES to co-finance the agreed Annual Work Plan within the 
ESDP.  The ESSP will rely on the Borrower’s fiduciary and procurement structures and procedures.  A specified 
amount of the loan will be disbursed according to semi-annual reporting on the progress and planning of the 
sector development. Program implementation will be monitored through semi-annual reviews using pre-
determined system-level indicators as well as performance and input indicators. Disbursement levels may be 
modified based on the implementation performance and overall progress in the sector, as well as on changes that 
may occur in estimated program needs. 
 
The ESSP will provide financial and technical support to the Government over the period of five years (2005-
09).  The actions to be supported through ESSP are arranged around four programmatic priority themes: 
 
Program Priority One 
–
Creating Learning Schools. 
 The Government’s ESDP has an ambitious aim to reform 
curriculum in all schools and to shift the focus of teaching towards active learning, problem
-
solving and 
Page  2

understanding.  The ESSP supports this transformation by converting the National Education Standards to 
school cur
ricula, developing teachers’ professional knowledge and skills, and promoting school-level 
improvement and creation of professional learning communities for teachers in schools.  The ESDP action plan 
that will be financed through ESSP include training of school curriculum specialists, in-service training for 
teachers, new teaching and learning facilities, upgrading regional teacher training
 
centers and new curriculum 
materials for teachers.   
 
Program Priority Two 
–
Improving Monitoring and Evaluation.
 
One objective of the MoSES’ ESDP is to 
establish externally administrated school leaving examination, 
Matura
.
Beginning in 2008, this examination 
will become compulsory for all four-year secondary school students.  The ESSP supports the design and 
establishment of this examination and related logistics as well as the development of educational evaluation 
practices within the education system.  Moreover, the ESSP supports developing policies, activities and 
structures (such as EMIS and national student assessment system) that aim at improving the capacities of the 
education system to collect, analyze and disseminate information related to the system’s inputs, processes, 
outputs and other performance, including students’ achievement.   
 
Program Priority Three 
–
Strengthening Management and Leadership. 
 The MoSES recognizes the need for 
overall improvement of educational management at various levels of the education system.  The ESDP presents 
the success of the decentralization and strengthened regional and local management as key conditions for 
sustainable education development.  The ESSP supports these initiatives by addressing the efforts to improve 
management (including policy, planning and fiduciary capacities) at the central level, administration and 
coordination capacities at the regional level and educational leadership at school level.  The development and 
refinement of the national steering system of education will be connected to the implementa
tion of the program.  
The ESSP will also support the establishment of a system (including facilities) for leadership training for school 
principals, regional and local education authorities and MoSES staff.   
 
Program Priority Four – Supporting Regional Development and Innovations
.
The ESDP presents an 
expectation that the role of regions and schools in education re
form has to be broadened and strengthened.  
Therefore the ESSP provides financing to regionally initiated education development plans and innovations 
within the agreed education sector development criteria.  Since several current challenges in education system 
are local or regional in nature, it is envisaged that the best solutions will also be locally designed to improve the 
overall education service provision.  The ESSP also aims at reducing the number of schools that operate in 
multi-shifts by expanding the infrastructure and hence promotes improving opportunities for schools to expand 
their services to families and students through optional and non-formal activities. 
 
These ESSP Program Priorities form the core of the Government’s ESDP.  The ESSP aims at making a major 
impact on the effectiveness of the Government’s investments in its education reforms.  The MoSES will prepare 
Annual Work Plans and related budgets that will specify the intended activities and required investment needs.  
The ESSP as an investment operation will co-finance the overall sector development program annually 
according to the agreed Work Plans.

Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Increased regional and decentralized funding of education will eventually lead to some infrastructure 
investments, i.e. rehabilitating school buildings or construction extensions or in some cases new buildings.  This 
will be done along the lines of Croatia’s regular procedures aligned with the environmental management 
guidelines prepared prior to the implementation. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
None 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
None 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A
full Environmental Impact Assessment was not required under Croatian legislation or World Bank policies, 
given the limited scale of works envisaged under the program.  The environmental impacts will be localized in 
nature, and these have been adequately addressed through an Environmental Management Plan that has been 
reviewed by the Bank, and that covers issues ranging from waste management and disposal to cultural heritage 
and chance finds.  An environmental assessment is available in the project files. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
MoSES – School Construction Unit experts (discussion on the EMP and related procedures) 
Municipalities – Education authorities (dissemination of EMP)
