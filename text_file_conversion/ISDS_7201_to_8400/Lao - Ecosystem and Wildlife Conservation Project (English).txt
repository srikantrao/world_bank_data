Project Goal and Purpose
To conserve internationally significant biodiversity found in Bolikhamxay Province, Lao
PDR through institutional strengthening and capacity building mechanisms.
Project Description
The project seeks to:
(a) increase the capacity of national and provincial government staff to design,
implement, and monitor the effectiveness of wildlife conservation activities;
(b) increase the extent of implementation and monitoring of conservation activities
by national, provincial, district staff and villagers; and
(a) increase the local constituency around the Nam Kading National Protected Area
(NPA) and the provincial protected areas (PPAs) that practice sustainable natural
resource use.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The geographic focus of the project is Bolikhamxay province which, along with
Khammouane province, contains the most globally significant natural ecosystems in Lao
PDR. For example, Bolikhamxay has the widest geographic spread of Saola records and
probably the country's largest block of uninhabited montane forest. Within
Bolikhamxay, the focus will be around Nam Kading NPA which has high levels of
globally and regionally threatened wildlife.
Bolikhamxay is also known for its exceptional ethnic diversity (e.g., 33 ethnic groups
with minority groups, that are covered by the Bank's policy on Indigenous Peoples,
accounting for about 20% of the population). The project will focus on working with 8
villages selected based on criteria such as proximity of the village to the Nam Kading
NPA; level of human/animal conflict; and presence of important wildlife species.

Comments:
The project intends to result in positive cumulative impacts in improved management of
provincial multiple use forest landscape. The only civil work is construction of an
environmental awareness training center which will not involve broad excavation. A
review of the proposal indicates that a septic tank and shallow drain field will be
constructed to handle wastewater from a small kitchen, two toilets, two showers, and two
sinks. Solid waste will be hauled away from the center to the provincial landfill. A
firebreak will be constructed around the facility to prevent fire from spreading into the
forest should a building catch fire or to protect the buildings from being destroyed from
forest fire. Based on the above, no EA is needed for the project.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
The main project activity that is likely to negatively impact local communities, including
some ethnic minority households, living in and around Nam Kading NPA is the possible
restriction to access of natural resources. The project will work closely with local
communities to enable continuation of forestry-related income-generating activities on a
sustainable basis within the NPA and work with them to develop alternative income-
generating activities in the buffer zone as a remedial measure.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Describe any potential cumulative or long term impacts.
The benefits from the project would be conservation of biodiversity, and for local
communities more sustainable resource use and alternative livelihood activities.
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the
parties' claims on the disputed areas

3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
NA
4. Describe arrangement for the grant recipient to address safeguard issues
An Ethnic Minorities Framework and Resettlement Process Framework have been
prepared.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Over the course of project preparation, five workshops were held with a diversity of
stakeholders-from provincial and local authorities to protected area management staff,
village headmen, women's union, academia and the military/police. Efforts were made
to ensure that people from ethnic minorities were consulted during meetings to gauge
levels of commitment and support for the project and gather socio-economic data and
information on possible conflicts and means of resolving them. Such information was
incorporated into the design of the project proposal.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[I] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and
institutional risks in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their
impact and are technically and institutionally manageable
[]S3. - No safeguard issues
[]SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven
development or similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic
approach to address safeguard issues.
