A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project aims to improve the provision of water supply and sanitation services in 
Colombia in a financially efficient and sustainable manner through the provision of 
capital investment subsidies for poverty-focused coverage expansion and service quality 
improvement. The Project will (a) scale-up the involvement of the private sector in 
medium-size cities through the introduction of performance-based management 
arrangements with specialized operators; (b) support service-improvement related 
investment through targeted capital grants in small- and medium-size cities, and in some 
high poverty peri-urban areas of large cities served by public utilities; and (c) deliver 
appropriate water supply and s
anitation investments in Colombia’s underserved rural 
areas. 
 
In concrete terms, it is expected that during the first phase of the APL, the Project will 
have: (a) improved the quality of potable water supply to 900,000 people, the majority of 
them in Strata 1, 2, and 3; (b) improved access to sewerage services for 695,000 people, 
also predominantly poor; and (d) improved the institutional and operational profile of 60 
public water companies and brought private sector management to 10 utilities. The 
expected outcomes of the three phases of the APL, which represent the 10 years of 
Program implementation, include addressing the water supply, sewerage, wastewater 
treatment, and solid waste service needs in 300 municipalities, representing 4.2 million 
people. 
 
The Project contributes to five key higher-level objectives: 
 
Achievement of MDG coverage goals for water supply and sanitation
.
The Project will 
Page  2
help achieve the relevant Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for access to 
water supply and sanitation in both urban and rural areas.  
 
Environmental Improvement
.
As a large-scale program of investments in water supply, 
sanitation, and wastewater treatment, the Project will directly improve the environment, 
including ambient water quality. 
 
Health
.
The operation will directly improve health outcomes in the Project areas. The 
health benefits of safe water supply and sanitation services are well-documented; 
reductions in incidences of water-borne disease (particularly diarrhea and other 
gastrointestinal illnesses, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis B, among others) are expected to 
result from improved infrastructure and service quality. 
 
Poverty Reduction
.
The operation will reduce poverty through the provision of assets to 
the poor; water and sanitation delivery is a core public service, and investment in service 
delivery infrastructure through the operation will benefit almost exclusively Colombia’s 
poor.  
 
Public Sector Efficiency
.
Bank-support will also contribute to improving the quality of 
public institutions through operational reforms to public service delivery enterprises and, 
as such, enhance the capacity of the Government at all levels to provide public goods. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The key elements of the proposed operation are: (i) expansion of water and sewerage 
networks and adequate treatment of source water along with enhanced operation and 
management of municipal water and sewerage utilities (both publicly and privately 
operated); (ii) investments for municipal wastewater treatment; and (iii) introduction of 
private sector management and/or technical assistance for institutional reform at the local 
level. In subsequent phases, the proposed APL Program would aim to expand and 
consolidate the results of the first phase through funding further investment and 
modernization processes and may include the financing of solid waste management 
solutions which emerged as a sanitation priority during the 
Audiencias Públicas
.
In all 
cases, the first-phase Program content has been subject to the 
Audiencias Públicas
 model 
which vetted priority projects through a demand-driven participatory exercise. The 
overarching Program approach to assessing and financing subprojects is as follows:  
 
For municipalities in which the provision of the services currently involves private sector 
participation
,
the Program will provide capital subsidies to the reformed utilities directed 
to benefiting the poor. Investments would be limited to those not envisaged at the time of 
inception of the private sector participation, mainly resulting from increased population 
growth due to internal displacement from violence-prone areas. 
 
For small- and medium-size municipalities or regional utilities
interested in moving to a 
private sector participation (PSP) model, the Program aims to continue and expand the 
current 
Programa de Modernización de Empresas
 (Utility Modernization Program) 
supported by the Bank under the ongoing Water Sector Reform Assistance Project. 
Annex 13 summarizes the “modernization” approach. Financing for PSP will seek to 
Page  3
support institutional improvements of utilities through facilitating the incorporation of 
PSP in the management and operation of water and sanitation services by providing 
capital subsidies based on the principle of minimum subsidy and technical assistance for 
institutional strengthening and reform processes. The Program will follow eligibility 
criteria and procedures established under the ongoing Loan 7077-CO.  
 
For medium and small urban areas 
with publicly operated services where PSP is not a 
viable option in the immediate-term, the Program would finance targeted investments 
following a detailed viability analysis (covering technical, financial, institutional, 
economic and safeguard issues) as a prerequisite for its financing. The Program would 
also support the construction of wastewater treatment facilities, providing funding to 
those municipalities included in the priority list, based on compliance with a series of 
eligibility criteria, real needs assessment and adequacy of the investment in the light of 
expected environmental impact, appropriate treatment, and financial and institutional 
capacity for operation and maintenance. Infrastructure investment in wastewater 
treatment facilities would be limited to that necessary to achieve treatment levels taking 
into account the assimilating capacity of the receiving water body. In addition to the 
demonstrated capacity to maintain any investment, preconditions for financing under the 
Program include pre-existing treatment of source water and 80% sewerage service 
coverage. Regardless of whether Program resources finance investments in water, 
sewerage, or wastewater treatment, participating municipal enterprises would take part in 
a
series of Government programs for institutional development and capacity building, to 
ensure financial sustainability and recovery of operating & maintenance costs. Specific 
institutional reforms have been established and municipal water companies which fail to 
meet their obligations would be restricted from access to 
Ventanilla Única
 grants in the 
future, regardless of the source of financing. 
 
In rural areas
,
the Program will finance the rehabilitation and construction of basic water 
and sanitation systems, generally including water sourcing through wells and extraction 
infrastructure, along with supporting delivery and treatment infrastructure and septic and 
latrine disposal investments. Participating communities which do not meet the 
requirements to be considered as having a sufficient level of institutional development 
would enter int
o
the Government’s ongoing programs for institutional reform – 
Cultura 
Empresarial 
(focused towards small utilities) and 
Microempresas Comunitarias
 
(addressed at community based service providers) – which are being successfully 
implemented and focus on demand-driven investment, intense community participation, 
and cost recovery of operation and maintenance expenses through tariff revenues and 
municipal and financial contributions. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The subprojects will be located throughout the country.  All subprojects will be screened 
for Safeguards issues related to their location, including potential for impacts on natural 
Page  4
habitats, sensitive areas, local populations, etc.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The Project’s key safeguard policy issues relate to the possible impacts of the civil works to be constructed 
by the local utilities, and the related wastewater disposal and water intake. Specifically, the project’s 
safeguard-related procedures must ensure that subprojects comply with national environmental laws and 
regulations as well as Bank environmental and social safeguard policies, that any cumulative impacts are 
addressed, that environmental and social impacts are managed through application of appropriate 
guidelines, that appropriate oversight mechanisms are established, that project benefits are extended in a 
culturally appropriate manner to indigenous populations who live within the areas (if required), that any 
land acquisition (which would be financed with borrower counterpart resources) and resettlement of people 
is done in an acceptable manner, and that adequate procedures are in place for the protection of cultural 
property. As part of Project preparation, these issues have been addressed through an Environmental 
Framework, an Indigenous Peoples Framework and a Resettlement Framework, each of which is outlined 
below. At the time of Appraisal, a sample of representative subprojects is known, but the list is neither 
finalized nor comprehensive. The list of eligible subprojects will evolve and grow during the first year of 
project implementation. When the situation exists where details of subprojects to be financed are not 
known at the time of appraisal, Frameworks are developed to ensure compliance with national laws and 
Bank policies. The objectives and content of these frameworks is described in general below, and in detail 
in separate annexes. 
 
The Project will deal with each Safeguard Policy triggered as described below:   
 
O.P. 4.01
.
In accordance with OP 4.01, an Environmental Assessment was undertaken by 
a
local consultant to identify the potential impacts associated with the types of 
subprojects envisioned for the Project, and develop appropriate mitigation measures to 
offset those impacts. During preparation, the following analyses/studies were undertaken: 
(a) an update of the institutional and legal context of the existing water sector 
environmental assessment (originally completed in 2000); (b) diagnostic and 
environmental analysis of the solid waste management sector; (c) environmental analysis 
of rural water and sanitation; and, (d) a rapid environmental assessment of all the 
subprojects expected to be included in the Project, with in-depth analysis of a sample of 
subprojects. Results from the EA have been used in the development of the 
environmental management framework.  
Financing of subprojects will be subject to the environmental and social screening, assessment, monitoring 
and supervision procedures set forth in the Safeguards Policy Issues annex (Annex 10), including: (a) 
environmental and social screening of subprojects, including environmental classification; (b) subproject 
typology; (c) definition of required environmental work; (d) development of guidelines for good 
environmental and social practices; (e) implementation of required environmental work; and subproject 
monitoring. 
O.P.N. 11.03
.
Colombian Law 397 (1997) linked cultural patrimony to the Environmental 
Impact Assessment (EIA) process in the country; and Decree 833 (2002) detailed the 
regulations requiring that projects that require an environmental license must also consult 
with the Ministry of Culture on the possible existence of archeological areas in the 
subproject area, and, in the affirmative case, to develop protection plans and 
incorporation of any necessary restrictions and obligations within the environmental 
Page  6
license. However, this requirement will not apply to most of the subprojects, as the 
subprojects do not require environmental licenses (due to their limited size and/or scope). 
Therefore, the Project has adapted and will apply existing Good Practice Guidelines for 
screening of subproject locations and chance find procedures. 
 
O.P. 4.12
.
The Resettlement Framework provides the necessary background to ensure 
that any subprojects that might involve either land acquisition or resettlement of any 
people will comply with both national law and the Bank’s OP. Though no resettlement is 
expected during the Project, as subprojects are considered for financing, a screening 
mechanism will identify those that require further consideration of resettlement issues. 
Again, as all subprojects are not known at the time of Appraisal, the framework describes 
the general context for the sector, the objectives and principles of any resettlement to be 
caused by the project, the legal context, the process for the preparation of a resettlement 
plan, the content of a plan, the process for its execution, the required institutional 
organization and, finally, the financing of the plan. Any resettlement plan will be 
submitted to both DAPSBA and the Bank for review and clearance. 
 
O.D. 4.20
.
The Indigenous Peoples Framework provides the necessary background to 
ensure that any subprojects that might affect indigenous peoples will comply with 
national law and the Bank’s OP. As subprojects are considered for financing, a screening 
mechanism will identify those that require further consideration of indigenous peoples 
issues. Specifically, during the screening of subprojects, DAPSBA will assess whether an 
opportunity exists for indigenous peoples to be beneficiaries of the subproject, or if they 
will in any way be negatively affected by the proposed subproject. If so, an Indigenous 
Development Plan will be prepared by the municipality, and submitted to DAPSBA for 
their review and clearance. The Plan will also come to the Bank for its no objection. The 
content of an Indigenous Plan, general guidance on the approach for Plan development, 
institutional arrangements and monitoring requirements are outlined in the framework. 
 
O.P. 4.37 and O.P. 7.50
.
The Project is not expected to finance any investments which 
either (a) trigger the Bank’s policies on safety of dams or (b) have an appreciatively 
negative impact on downstream water quality in Venezuela. The environmental 
assessment checklist includes both issues, and any subproject presented to the MAVDT 
which triggers either set of issues would require ex ante approval by the Bank and 
relevant Bank policies would be applied. 
 
Public consultation
.
The subprojects that are included during the first phase of the 
Program (the proposed Project) resulted from extensive public consultation activities. In 
conjunction with the 2002-2006 NDP, the Government has identified a medium-term 
investment program to expand coverage and improve service quality in both urban and 
rural areas. Capital investment resources were allocated at the departmental level to 
address needs within each department. These needs were identified through the recently 
completed participatory public consultation process known as the 
Audiencias Públicas 
which identified investment priorities in the water and sanitation sector. In addition to the 
existing public funds allocated to the sector (including intergovernmental transfers from 
Ley 7
15, direct investments by the Ministry of Environment, and programs managed by 
Page  7
FINDETER, and FONADE), approximately US$ 120 million has been allocated for 
investment in the water and sanitation sector under the NDP and 
Audiencias Públicas
.
While these 
Audencias Públicas
 did not specifically address the environmental aspects of 
the subprojects, they gave ample opportunity for any civil society groups, affected people 
and NGOs to voice concerns.
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
Small subprojects may not have any significant impact when evaluated individually, but when looked at in 
the context of the watershed, multiple projects, or synergies with other projects, can cause significant 
adverse cumulative impacts. The project will avoid this through screening of possible cumulative impacts, 
and regular monitoring of such impacts at the Project and regional level. Cumulative impact monitoring 
will be conducted by DAPSBA and will comprise data collection as to the number, type, location, and area 
of subprojects funded in each municipality, as well as other projects (identified in the screening process) 
that are not funded by the project, but that could impact or be impacted by the subprojects. These data 
should be used to identify the potential for yielding cumulative impacts, selecting sites for field visits to 
verify such impacts, and recommending if and how environmental procedures should be modified to 
prevent such impacts (i.e. whether changes are warranted for subproject classification, required 
environmental work, capacity building needs, etc.). Where necessary, the resulting recommendations will 
be integrated into the environmental procedures for all subprojects.   
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Each subproject is the result of a rigorous analysis of alternatives for meeting the sector 
goals in each case.  The Ventanilla Unica requires a technical justification for the 
alternative selected.  In the case of any category A subprojects, a detailed analysis of 
alternatives will be undertaken during the EA process. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Action Plan presented in the EA identifies specific capacity building needs within the sector to ensure 
adequate environmental and social management of the Project.  Many of these might be incorporated in the 
Environmental Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), currently under preparation.  In addition to these 
activities, as they gain experience in screening and monitoring the subprojects, DAPSBA will identify 
additional capacity building needs to guarantee adequate implementation of the environmental procedures 
(including application of environmental management plans, development and application of sufficient 
mitigation measures, etc.).  Costs for capacity building are included in Project costs.  DAPSBA will 
provide technical assistance, including good practice guidelines, to the participating municipalities. 
Each subproject will follow good practice environmental guidelines, the development of 
which will be supported by the Project.  The objective of these guidelines is to ensure 
compliance with all Bank policies, and to define the best environmental practices for each 
type of expected subproject and/or activity.  These guidelines will build upon existing 
government and/or World Bank documents, and will be developed before project 
implementation.   
DAPSBA will include adequate capacity for the following functions: 1) undertaking the 
environmental and social screening of subprojects; 2) review and clearance of the 
submitted analyses, plans, monitoring plans, and indicators, and making 
recommendations for additional analyses and measures, if required; 3) elaborating terms 
Page  8
of reference for any additional environmental and social analyses, and providing 
technical assistance in their elaboration; 4) developing good practice management 
guidelines; 5)  providing support to municipalities for any environmental and social 
issues; 6) ensuring the consistent adequate application of environmental and social 
procedures across regions; 7) contracting experts to provide additional environmental and 
social training and support, when needed; 8) identifying potential cumulative impacts and 
determining necessary mitigatory actions; 9) monitoring the quality of reporting from the 
municipalities, and developing measures to solve any environmental and social problems 
that arise; 10) monitoring a random sample of subprojects; 11) establishing links with 
other institutions to strengthen environmental capacity within each municipality; 11) 
coordinating with the National Cultural Institute, when subprojects might have an impact 
on cultural heritage; 12) working with environmental agencies to facilitate environmental 
licensing procedures, where necessary; and, 13) promoting environmentally and socially 
sustainable projects in general. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The subprojects that are included within this Project all resulted from extensive public 
consultation activities.  
Audencias Publicas
 were held in each municipality to determine 
the investment priorities in the water and sanitation sector. In conjunction with the 2002-
2006 National Development Plan (NDP), the Government has identified a medium-term 
investment program to expand coverage and improve service quality in both urban and 
rural areas.  Capital investment resources are allocated at the departmental level to 
address needs within each department.  These needs were identified through the recently 
completed participatory public consultation process known as the 
Audiencias Publicas
.
In 
addition to the existing public funds allocated to the sector (including intergovernmental 
transfers from Ley 715, direct investments by the Ministry of Environment, and programs 
managed by FINDETER, and FONADE), approximately US$120 million has been 
allocated for investment in the water and sanitation sector under the NDP and 
Audiencias 
Publicas
.
While these 
Audencias Publicas
 did not specifically address the environmental 
aspects of the subprojects, they gave ample opportunity for any civil society groups, 
affected people and NGOs to voice concerns.
