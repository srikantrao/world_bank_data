B.  Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gas from key points in 
the north south gas transmission infrastructure where leaks are very common, including pipelines 
and gate stations. In addition, the project will support the development of an international market 
mechanism
 for “Emission Reductions” (ERs) under the framework of the Kyoto Protocol. 
 
C.
 
Project Description
 
Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and this proposed project will reduce methane leaks from 
natural gas pipelines that would have otherwise been vented into the atmosphere.  The proposed 
together with investments made by GGIC and the MCC will: 
 
·
Identify and repair gas leaks in the transmission pipeline.  It will achieve this goal by 
building the capacity of GGIC staff, installing highly accurate meters, developing an 
intensive monitoring system, and allocating the required financial resources to make large 
system wide repairs. 
 
Page  2
Reduce methane emissions by replacing corroded and leaking sections of pipe, change seals, 
replace worn valves, improve metering and monitoring capacities, upgrade operation and 
maintenance (O&M) skills and management of GGIC staff, methane leak rates will drop instead 
of continuing to grow.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The boundaries of the project are the 234 kilometers of gas transmission pipeline stretching from 
the Russia/ Georgia border to the Georgia/ Armenia border including all the entry and exit points 
for gas on those transmission pipelines.  The project does not include any distribution networks 
operated by others or the East West pipeline network operated by GGIC.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Georgian Gas International Corporation (GGIC) will be responsible for project implementation, 
including compliance with safeguard policies.  
To ensure the Borrower’s capacity for safeguard policies 
and the sustainability of the proposed rehabilitation project environmental training is being provided to 
GGIC during project preparation and will be build upon and reinforced during project implementation 
using funds from the MCC compact.

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The current pipeline is in a poor state of repair due to a lack of maintenance and investment in 
recent years. In the mountainous regions there are also areas that are subject to landslide and 
erosion. The pipeline was constructed in the 80s and early 90s and some sections route through 
environmentally sensitive areas.  While the majority of the works will comprise rehabilitation of 
existing section of pipeline within the existing Right of Way, there are some areas particularly in 
the mountainous regions that may require sections of pipeline to be replaced.   
 
To ensure the compliance of the proposed project with the Bank’s safeguard policies a Regional 
Environmental Assessment (EA) together with an Environmental Management Framework and 
Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared and disclosed for a period of 60 days prior to 
signing of the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA).  
 
During implementation rehabilitation works will be conducted in a phased manner for discrete 
pipeline sections where there are identified major hazards or risks that could impact the integrity of 
the pipeline system.  Discrete engineering works packages will be prepared during project 
implementation for each section that will be targeted for rehabilitation (referred to as ‘sub-
projects’).  Specific sub-projects identified as requiring Category A Environmental Assessments or 
relatively higher risk Category B sub-projects would be teased out through screening using the 
Environmental Management Framework, and site specific EA/EMPs would be prepared following 
typical Bank safeguard procedures

Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12)  
 
In the southern section of the pipeline corridor there are areas where encroachment is reported on 
the right of way.  Mapping of the pipeline corridor is planned to identify amongst other items the 
exact location of the right of way, the degree of encroachment, land use and ownership.  (Sub-
projects that will involve land acquisition or resettlement will require the preparation of a specific 
Land Acquisition Plan (LDP) or Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), following guidance in OP/BP 
4.12, and the Resettlement Policy Framework.)

The EA will examine what is known about the cultural property aspects of the proposed site(s) for 
the by-pass, and if there is any question of cultural property in the area a brief reconnaissance 
survey will be undertaken to determine the appropriate way forward.
