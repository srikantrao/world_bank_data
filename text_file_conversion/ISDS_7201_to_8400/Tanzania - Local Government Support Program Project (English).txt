                                                                for the poor (S)

I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

         The development objectives of the Local Government Support Program (LGSP) are:

(i)      to strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve accountability in the use of local government
resources, and improve management of intergovernmental transfers; and

(ii)     to increase access to infrastructure and services in unplanned and under-served areas of Dar es
Salaam and to improve their operations and maintenance

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

     The project comprises three interrelated components:

·        Component 1: Local Government Grants for investment in infrastructure and capacity-building;
·        Component 2: Dar es Salaam Upgrading and Institutional Strengthening; and
·        Component 3: Management and Institutional Development

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)


     Component 1:

     The project will support initially 41 local governments in rural and urban areas in various regions of
     the country ( Tanga, Morogoro, Kilimanjaro, Arusha, Mwanza, Kagera, Tabora, Singida, Iringa,
     Mbeya, Ruvuma, Rukwa, Lindi, Mara, and Dar es Salaam).

      Only those local authorities within the target group that meet certain conditions will receive funding
     for investment in sub-projects. The target local authorities will have been determined during project
     preparation; but qualifying local authorities will only be determined by an annual assessment process
     after project effectiveness. The particular sub-projects the qualifying local authorities will invest in

                                                        2
                                                                                                             ISDS


     will be identified through a demand-driven planning process at the local level. It is therefore not
     possible to indicate, at this stage or before project effectiveness, which local authorities will receive
     funding or the nature and location of the sub-projects in which they will invest.

     Component 2: This component will support upgrading of community infrastructure in 16 communities
     in low-income, unplanned and underserved areas in Dar es Salaam, namely, in the Municipalities of
     Ilala, Temeke, and Kinondoni.



B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The project has been categorized as a B due to the future potential environmental and social
impacts that might result from infrastructure sub-projects.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

           Under Component 1, local authorities will access modest amounts of capital funding for
           expenditure on the development of local infrastructure and services in priority sectors such as
           education, health, water, local roads, and on basic urban services, such as refuse removal.
           Potential environmental and social impacts due to infrastructure sub-projects are likely to include
           soil erosion, water and soil pollution, loss of vegetation, and the need for land acquisition. In
           addition, unsafe medical waste management may further exacerbate environmental pollution and
           may have negative effects on public health due to the transmission of the HIV/AIDS virus
           through the public's contact with medical waste disposed on public dump sites. Component 2
           will focus mainly on the upgrading of infrastructure and services in low income unplanned areas
           of Dar es Salaam. Funds may be used to finance investments in the provision of services
           including water supply, sanitation, drainage improvements, access roads, solid waste
           management and other basic services. Potential environmental and social impacts will be similar
           to those under Component 1.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

No cumulative impacts are anticipated as the environmental and social screening process will allow for the
application of appropriate mitigating measures.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

No long-term impacts are anticipated as the environmental and social screening process will allow for the
application of appropriate mitigating measures.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

The treatment of alternatives under the project was not required in view of its development objectives.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

To address safeguard issues, the Borrower has prepared the following documents:

(i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to identify and assess potential impacts
under Component 1;
(ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to address potential social impacts related to land acqusition
and loss of assets under Component 1.
(iii) a Community Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) to ensure mitigation of potential impacts
under Component 2; and
(iv) a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to compensate persons affected by infrastructure investments under
Component 2.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

     LGAs and communities will be the main stakeholders in the project. Selection of the sub-projects will
     be participatory and demand-driven. For Component 1, Development Plans prepared through a
     participatory process will define priorities for investment. For Component 2, community participation
     is part of the component design and communities have been involved in decision-making through the
     entire process of preparing Community Upgrading Plans, including decisions related to capital cost
     contribution, direct participation during project implementation, and arrangements for subsequent
     operation and maintenance. The modalities of the participatory approach were defined in a report
     prepared by a specialized consultant during project preparation. Non Government Organizations
     (NGOs), Community Based Organizations (CBOs) and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) will be
     stakeholders in the consultations over investment identification. NGOs and/or CBOs will also
     participate in facilitating the preparation and implementation of Component 2. NGOs will be
     specifically involved in developing a household sanitation improvement strategy and managing the
     implementation of a household sanitation marketing and construction program in each of the three
     municipalities.

     The ESMF, RPF, CEMP, and RAP have been prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders
     (government officials at the national and local levels and affected communities).


     The afore-mentioned documents have been disclosed in Tanazania on August 25, 2004, and were
     advertised in the newspapers. The documents were disclosed at the Bank's Info Shop on August 31,
     2004.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
         management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
         projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
         issues.
