B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The Brazilian Cerrado Program will be an umbrella to assist Brazils Federal and States 
Governments to preserve the biomes processes, structure and function through biodiversity 
protection and improved natural resources management.  
 
The Program would contribute to the global environment by addressing GEF strategic priorities 
of biodiversity protection, integrated ecosystem management, and Climate change. In this regard 
the Program would promote:  
 
-
The conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity through the expansion and 
consolidation of protected areas and the mainstreaming of biodiversity management in 
production landscapes (thus achieving GEF strategic priorities SLM-2, BD-1 and BD-2);  
 
-
The equitable sharing of benefits arising from biodiversity use, specially through knowledge 
sharing and the empowerment of local communities;  
Page  2
-
The reduction of net emissions and increased storage of greenhouse gases in terrestrial and 
aquatic ecosystems, through avoidance of land use changes (deforestation) and promotion of 
carbon sequestering practices (e.g. non tillage agriculture);  
 
-
The conservation and sustainable use of waterbodies, including watersheds and river basins 
through the promotion of conservationist land use practices;  
 
-
By promoting the integration of agricultural biodiversity conservation and sustainable use 
objectives in land use and natural resources use management plans; (OP#13)  
 
-
Supporting capacity building efforts that promote the preservation and maintenance of local 
knowledge, The Program#s outcomes on sustainable land management (OP#$15) would include:  
 
-
The institutional and human resource capacity is strengthening to improve sustainable land 
management planning and implementation to achieve global environment benefits within the 
context of sustainable development (addressing GEF strategic priority SLM-1), to be achieved 
through institutional strengthening activities;  
 
-
Improvement in the economic productivity of land under sustainable management and the 
preservation or restoration of the structure and functional integrity of ecosystems, to be achieved 
through research, extension and a reformed incentives framework.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Total cost is estimated at $50 million, with from GEF contribution of $30 million. This umbrella 
Program will support federal and States Government, in the following areas: (i)Biodiversity 
conservation through the creation and consolidation of protected areas and ecological corridors, 
(ii) Implementation of sustainable production and management of Cerrado, (iii) Institutional 
Strengthening and Policy; and (iv) monitoring of the Cerrado biome. Each participating State or 
Federal Government would apply and receive direct funding for activities listed in the following 
windows.  
 
Window 1. Biodiversity Conservation through the Creation and Consolidation of Protected 
Areas and ecological corridors. (estimated US$ 12 million)  
 
Based on the National Strategy for the conservation of the Cerrado Biome and information from 
the GEF-PROBIO, this window would support the following activities:  
 
-
Identification and creation of protected areas, by national and state governments, and support 
to the creation of private protected areas connected to public protected areas,  
 
-
Establishment of ecological corridors  
 
-
Preparation and implementation of management plans for protected areas,  
 
-
Development and implementation of awareness campaigns and environmental education,  
 
-
Stakeholders involvement and support to participatory management,  
 
-
Promotion of instruments for the economic sustainability of Protected areas,  
 
-
Land demarcation,  
 
Window 2. Sustainable Management of Cerrado. (estimated US$ 9 million).  
 
-
Support to subprojects to sustainable production in the buffer zone of protected areas and in 
the corridors,  
 
-
Programs to suppress invasive species,  
 
-
Creation of ecological corridors,  
 
-
Rehabilitation of degraded lands,  
 
-
Promotion of organic agriculture and low tillage.  
Page  3
Window 3. Institutional Strengthening and Policy. (Estimated $ 6 million).  
 
-
Capacity enhancement needs assessments,  
 
-
Studies for institutional strengthening and policy reform,  
 
-
Strategic planning, institutional reform implementation, strategic communication  
 
-
Conflict management.  
 
Window 4. Monitoring of the Cerrado Biome. (Estimated 3 million).  
 
-
Development of the conceptual model for the biome monitoring system,  
 
-
Establishment of monitoring framework, indicators and data collection protocols,  
 
-
Development monitoring database  
 
-
Data collection and analysis,  
 
-
Periodic evaluation of biome integrity and program effectiveness.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will be implemented on the States of Goais, Tocantins and in the Federal District, in 
the areas identified by PROBIO as relevant for conservation. Specific project location is not 
defined yet.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The States of Goais, Tocantins and the Ministry of the Environment have several Bank loans and 
are familiar with the Banks safeguards. The Federal District of Brasilia are currently applying for 
a
Bank loan and have been complying with the national and international safeguards.
