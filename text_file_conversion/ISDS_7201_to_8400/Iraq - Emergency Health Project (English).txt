A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The principal objective of the Project is to improve access to quality emergency services in selected health 
facilities to serve the urgent needs of the Iraqi population.  This objective would be achieved through: (i) 
the rehabilitation of priority emergency services, including emergency obstetric care in 12 selected 
hospitals, and the urgent provision of basic medical and laboratory equipment to the selected rehabilitated 
hospitals; (ii) the provision of a 3 to 6 month supply of up to 37 essential emergency drugs to be used at 
emergency facilities rehabilitated through this project; (iii) continued support to strengthening of planning 
and management capacity within the central and Governorate health administrations; and (iv) support to 
project management.  By the end of this project, it is expected that: 
 
·
Twelve carefully selected hospitals will have functioning emergency medical services 
defined by adequate physical infrastructure, essential equipment and drugs, adequate 
staffing and well-trained emergency teams. 
 
·
The Ministry of Health will have strengthened its planning and management capacity 
at both central and Governorate levels.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The Project will comprise four components, to be implemented over a period of up to 18 months.  It will be 
fully funded as a Grant under the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund, operating under OP 8.50, Emergency 
Recovery Assistance.  The four components are described below: 
 
Page  2
Component 1:  Rehabilitation of Priority Emergency Services (estimated total cost US$19.5 million) 
 
The Project will support the repair, rehabilitation and equipping activities of hospital emergency facilities 
to restore fully functional emergency services in 12 carefully selected hospitals in 9 Governorates of Iraq.  
These activities have been identified and prioritized using explicit criteria of need, feasibility and 
a
ffordability (see Annex 8A).  Repairs and rehabilitation will focus on the priority structural, electrical, 
mechanical and heating/air conditioning systems for: (a) emergency room reception and administrative 
counter; (b) triage areas; (c) diagnostic services rooms; (d) patient examination areas; (e) patient wards; (f) 
minor surgery operating theatre; (g) doctors’ and nurses’ offices and rest areas; (h) nurses’ station; (i) 
emergency drug dispensary; and (j) other support areas (sterilization room, kitchen, restrooms, storage, 
janitorial space).   
 
The Project will also provide the selected facilities with their most urgent needs in diagnostic and 
therapeutic equipment for emergency services, including specific emergency room equipment.  Examples 
of such equipment selected are: diagnostic equipment, emergency resuscitation equipment, and emergency 
life support equipment (see Annex 8B for a complete list of specific planned investments).   
 
This first phase of the reconstruction effort will concentrate on the establishment of a sustainable model for 
planning, procurement and financial management. It will allow for the development of a standardized 
approach to the rehabilitation of health facilities and will constitute the most effective way for the MOH to 
acquire the capacity it needs to manage longer-term reconstruction/rehabilitation activities.  The Project 
will provide financing for the rehabilitation activities, emergency medical equipment and technical 
assistance for design and supervision of the sites. 
 
Component 2:  Provision of Essential Emergency Drugs (estimated total cost US$3.2 million) 
 
The Project will support the procurement and distribution of a 3 to 6 month supply of up to 37 essential 
emergency drugs to be used at the 12 emergency facilities rehabilitated under Component 1. Categories of 
essential emergency drugs include the following: (i) general anesthetics; (ii) preoperative medication and 
sedatives; (iii) anti-infective drugs; (iv) cardiovascular drugs; and (v) oral and parenteral solutions.  This 
component will be supported through the provision of pharmaceuticals. 
 
Component 3:  Capacity Building and Training (estimated total cost US$1.6 million) 
 
The Project will support capacity-building and training activities in Emergency Medical Services for the 12 
selected sites. These activities will include: (i) technical training of emergency 5-person teams from each 
selected site to improve the quality of emergency services; (ii) training in management of emergency 
services for the hospital directors, emergency chief doctors, head nurses and central-level emergency 
services planners; and (iii) the development of a comprehensive national plan for strengthening emergency 
health care services.  Additionally, the Project will support training to build the general capacity of MOH in 
health planning and management at both the central and Governorate levels.  A number of short-term 
training programs will allow for the constitution of a core group of public health and health management 
specialists.  The project will also provide assistance to the MOH in developing a sustainable plan for 
procurement and distribution of essential emergency drugs.  This component will be supported through the 
provision of technical assistance and training activities. 
 
Component 4: Project Management (estimated total cost US$ 0.7 million)   
 
The objective of this component is to ensure effective administration and coordination of the project 
activities.  The Project Management Team (PMT) will comprise eleven staff, five of whom will be local 
consultants hired under the Project.  The PMT staff will include: a Project Director to manage and 
coordinate the implementation of the Project; a Deputy Project Director to be responsible for day-to-day 
management of the project; a Technical Coordinator to ensure that the technical aspects of the project are 
being implemented; a Procurement Officer, assisted by three staff, to supervise tendering, purchasing and 
delivery of works, goods and 
services; a Financial Officer, assisted by an accountant, to maintain project 
Page  3
financial records; an Administrative Secretary, and a Junior Secretary to support the needs of the office.  
Drivers for the three project vehicles and a messenger will also be hired to support the project.  
 
The component will finance: (i) minor refurbishment of the PMT offices agreed between the MOH and the 
Bank; (ii) adequate office equipment and supplies, and three project vehicles;  (iii) technical assistance and 
training for PMT staff in project management, procurement and financial management; (iv) annual external 
audit of the project; (v) operating costs for the PMT, including vehicle and equipment operation and 
maintenance, communications costs, banking fees, transportation costs, meeting expenses, advertisement 
fees, representation, and office security arrangements.   
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The selected twelve Emergency Units are located in nine different governorates of Iraq. 
Four units are located in Baghdad with a good spread to different areas of the city. The 
remaining eight units are distributed to the following regions/cities: Dyala/Baquba, 
Kirkuk, Missan/Amará City, Karbala, Anbar/Ramadi City, Salah Deen/Samará City, 
Erbil, and Sulaimanyiah.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Because of the emergency conditions, the requirement to carry out a limited 
Environmental Analysis as part of project preparation was waived.  However, for sub-
projects with adverse environmental impacts, a limited Environmental Analysis will be 
carried out during project implementation, but before sub-project approval. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
N/A. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
During appraisal, a Health Facility Planner and the World Bank Environmental Specialist 
provided technical assistance to the Project Management Team to address environmental 
and social safeguard issues.  The Project Management Team’s Architect/Engineer is 
capable of following up on Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment 
Framework (ESSAF) requirements, and further training on ESSAF requirements will be 
provided to the Project Management Team as well as the representatives of the project 
intervention Governorates during the Project Launch Workshop.   
 
A
MOH-PMT specialist will be trained in World Bank safeguards policies, and MOH 
engineering staff (or consultants where capacity is lacking) will carry out site 
supervisions to check on compliance of contractors with environmental and social 
safeguards. Site supervision reports will include a section on environmental and social 
safeguards that will be filed with the MOH-PMT. The first three site supervision reports 
will be sent to the Bank for review. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The ESSAF was disclosed in the country and in the Infoshop on October 7, 2004.  Based 
on the ESSAF, the following standards will be applied during implementation: (i) 
inclusion of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the rehabilitation and 
extension  bid documents of all sub-projects; (ii) use of Safeguard Procedures for 
Inclusion in the Technical Specifications of Contracts; (iii) use of the Checklist of likely 
Environmental and Social Impacts of Subproject; (iv) review and oversight of any major 
reconstruction works by specialists; (v) implementation of environmentally and socially 
sound options for civil works; and (vi) provision for adequate budget and satisfactory 
institutional arrangements to monitor effective implementation and adequately maintain 
Page  5
sanitary facilities after completion. Capacity building on Safeguards and on the 
implementation of the ESSAF has already been undertaken with the Ministry of 
Environment and other line Ministries.   
 
Resettlement and Land Acquisition: There will be no construction of new facilities in the 
Project.  However, there will be some site extensions that will be limited to vacant sites 
that are on public property assigned by the relevant authorities for the use of MOH.  OP 
4.12 should not be triggered since there should not be any displacement of populations or 
new land acquisition.  However, the ESSAF, specifically elaborated for due diligence in 
the case of Iraq, should be used to ensure that this is indeed the case and should there be 
any need for land acquisition or population resettlement, the same guidelines will be 
followed.
