Loan amount ($m.):  
IBRD:  37.5 m. 
B.  Project Objectives 
The proposed additional loan would support the continuation of the Rural Poverty 
Reduction Project in Ceará to (1) improve well-being and incomes of the rural poor 
through greater access to basic social and economic infrastructure and services and 
support for productive activities, using proven community-driven development (CDD) 
techniques; (2) increase the social capital of rural communities and capacity to  organize 
collectively to meet their own needs; (3) enhance local governance by greater citizen 
participation and transparency in decision-making, through creation and strengthening of 
community associations and municipal councils; and (4) foster closer integration of 
development policies, programs and projects in rural areas at the local level, by assisting 
the project’s participatory municipal councils to extend their role in seeking funding 
from, setting priorities for and making decisions concerning the allocation of resources 
from other programs beyond the Bank-supported project.

C.  Project Description 
As under the Original Project, the Additional Financing will support the following three 
components:   
(1) 
Community Subprojects 
will provide matching grants to community 
associations to finance their implementation of about 1,300 small-scale socio-
economic infrastructure, education, health, culture, productive, environmental and 
other investments; 
(2)
 Institutional Development
 will support technical assistance and training to 
mobilize and strengthen community associations in their role of identifying, 
preparing, operating and maintaining subproject investments; and   
(3) 
Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
 will 
support, 
inter alia
,
the costs (excluding salaries) of State Technical Unit (STU), 
the monitoring of project implementation and subsequent impact evaluation. 
D.  Project location  
 
The project area remains the same as that for the ongoing project and will cover 177 
municipalities (of the 184 total statewide).  
E.  Bo
rrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The State Technical Unit (STU) for the Ongoing Project 
–
COPE/SDLR – has complied 
fully with Bank safeguard and project environmental rules.  The Ongoing Project 
operates under both an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and an Indigenous 
Peoples Planning Framework (IPPF); both have worked well and will continue under the 
proposed Additional Financing.

If Applicable, How Might It Apply?

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01)   
 
The ongoing Ceará Rural Poverty Reduction Project (classified as 
Category B)
,
applies several environmental "screens" to during the 
technical assessment of subproject proposals, and is currently operating an 
EMP under the Ongoing Project, which is functioning satisfactorily.  
 
Specifically, the EMP: (a) ensures that the Project is fully compliant with 
relevant State and Federal environmental legislation and Bank Safeguards; 
(b) further consolidates the integration of environmental standards in 
subprojects financed under the Project; (c) fosters a convergence between 
rural poverty reduction and the conservation and adequate valuation of the 
Page  3
environment; and (d) links environmental conservation and protection 
activities with investments that increase the IDS, consistent with Cear
á’s 
medium-term investment program (Multi-Year Plan - PPA). 
 
[X] 
Indigenous Peoples
(
OP 4.10
)
In Ceará, there are four officially recognized ethnic groups:  Jenipapo-
Kanindé, Pitaguari, Tapeba e Tremembé.  Other organizations and 
agencies additionally cite a series of unofficial ethnicties:  Tabajara, 
Kalabassa, Potiguara, Potiguara de Paupina, Kanindé de Aratuba e 
Canindé, Payacu, Anacé, Jucá, Kariri, Tupinambá, Tremembé de 
Queimadas, Tremembé de São José e Buriti e Gavião.  
The Ongoing Project has operated under an Indigenous Peoples Planning 
Framework (IPPF) designed to further promote the social inclusion of 
indigenous communities while respecting their cultural identities.  The 
IPPF—which was updated during the preparation of the proposed 
Additional Financing – will seek to expand Project assistance to 
indigenous communities through coordinated actions with other 
governmental and non-governmental agencies also working in the project 
area. 
 
The Project Operational Manual already defines the guidelines and 
specific procedures for engaging rural communities in project activities, 
both indigenous and non-indigenous.   Building on techniques already 
developed under the Ongoing Project, organized efforts will continue to 
bring these groups into the project through culturally appropriate 
communications and outreach campaigns developed in collaboration with 
indigenous entities/local leaders and designed to help indigenous 
groups/communities understand project objectives and procedures.  This 
will be complemented by a training and capacity-building program 
developed in collaboration with associated/relevant NGOs and institutions 
in the region.  Prior to continued processing of the proposed Additional 
Financing, the IPPF would be disclosed locally (through the STU) in an 
appropriate manner, form and language for those indigenous peoples that 
would potentially participate in the project.

Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
As discussed in the EMP and further detailed in the Project Operational 
Manual, neither the State, nor the Bank, through the Project, will approve 
subprojects which cause degradation to essential natural habitats. 
[X]
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
The EMP already defines a process, including screening criteria in the 
Page  4
Project Operational Manual, for detecting the potential use of pesticides 
under both the Ongoing Project and the proposed Additional Financing. 
Where appropriate, the Project already promotes integrated pest 
management approaches under subproject investments.   
[X]
 
Cultural Property (
OPN 11.03
,
being revised as OP 4.11) 
In the event of 
“chance finds”, the Project Operational Manual already 
outlines procedures to be followed in the event of such discovery of 
culturally significant materials during subproject implementation.
