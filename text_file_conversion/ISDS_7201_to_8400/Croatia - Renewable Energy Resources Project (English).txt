A.2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the proposed project is to help develop an economically and 
environmentally sustainable market for renewable energy resources in Croatia. 
Development of this market will support Croatia in its EU accession efforts.  In addition, 
the project will help make Croatia’s economy less reliant on imported electricity and 
fossil fuels, reduce overall emissions, lead to a higher degree of local equipment 
manufacturing, and create an attractive climate for private investment in renewable 
energy, and generate local industry and employment.  
The project will in principle deal with both the production of electricity and heat from 
RER. However, most of the emphasis will be on electricity production (from wind farms 
and biomass fired cogeneration plants). 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Implementation of the project will include two components: 
Market Framework
 
(GEF grant of US$2.0 million
).  This component will comprise 
technical assistance  focused on supporting the Government in designing and 
implementing policy and secondary legislation on the inclusion of RE in the electricity 
sector.  The component will also include support to the market operator (MO), 
distribution system operator (DSO), transmission system operator (TSO), Croatian 
Energy Regulatory Agency (CERA), and local governments in streamlining the 
Page  2
permitting process.  Technical assistance will be comprised primarily of legal and 
technical support and advice to the institutions and government entities involved in 
creating the regulatory framework for the sector.  Capacity building within the same 
institutions will be required to implement the new regulations and system.  A monitoring, 
evaluation and information dissemination subcomponent is included, along with financial 
support for the Project Management Unit.  Additional beneficiaries will include the 
Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship (MoELE), Ministry of 
Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction (MoEPPPC), the 
Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (EPEEF), HEP (in its capacity as 
TSO and DSO), NGOs, the banking community, policy-makers, regulatory authority, and 
private developers. 
Project Preparation (GEF Contingent Loan of US$2.0 million and grant of US$1.5 
million; total US$3.5 million). 
The contingent loan mechanism and supporting activities 
will be used to identify candidate projects for investment and to cover initial project 
development cost (feasibility studies). The contingent loan facility (US$2.0 million) will 
provide loans to qualified project developers on a cost-sharing basis.  The loans will be 
capitalized in the project financing and repaid, or if the projects do not move to 
implementation the contingent loan will be converted to a grant. Funds that are recovered 
will be recycled and used in future projects.  In addition to and separate from the 
contingent loan facility, US$1.5 million will be used for project development and project 
investment support.  Project development support will focus on development of a 
sustainable pipeline of potential projects that can provide deal flow for EPEEF and the 
contingent loan facility.  This will be facilitated by creation of a national energy centers 
that will provide information and know-how to private developers.  Project investment 
support will include capacity building and financial advice to EPEEF, commercial banks 
and municipal finance authorities.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.  
 
Environmental:
In accordance with World Bank safeguard policies on environment (OP/BP/GP 4.01 
Environmental Assessment) the project was assigned Category C, indicating that no 
environmental issues are anticipated. This was based upon the project design which is 
primarily technical assistance and does not include any physical construction activities. In 
fact, the project is likely to have future environmental benefits because the facilitation of 
investments in renewable energy indirectly will result in major positive impacts on the 
environment, in terms of increased use of renewable energy resources, reduced air 
pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.   
 
However, there could be some potential reputational risk that the Bank faces by virtue of 
the fact that feasibility studies funded by the contingent loan facility may lead to projects 
that may later have some negative environmental impact.  For example, a wind farm 
could, through poor environmental planning, result in avian mortality. However, this will 
be mitigated through the inclusion of environmental assessments following World Bank 
guidelines as mandatory components in the Feasibility Studies to be supported. 
Furthermore, the project will support the MoEPPPC in developing general standards for 
environmental assessments and clearance procedures that should minimize the risk of 
poor projects being cleared. 
 
All consultant contracts in connection with the TA will require the assistance rendered to 
be consistent with Bank Safeguard Policies. Compliance will be supervised closely 
ensuring that the advice provided by the consultants to the Croatian authorities is 
c
onsistent with the Bank’s safeguards policies. 
 
Social:
There are no critical social issues related to the project.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. N/A 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The technical aspects of the Conting
ent Loan Facility will be the responsibility of the 
Page  5
Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund (EPEEF) which is linked to the 
MoEPPPC. EPEEF is estimated to be in a good position to address environmental 
safeguards issues. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
