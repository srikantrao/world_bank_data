B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the project is to increase the efficiency in the use of energy, which 
would reduce energy costs for consumers and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the 
energy sector.  
The global objective of the project is to reduce the gas emissions and the climate change risk, by 
systematically removing the barriers that prevent activities and investments in energy efficiency 
and energy conservation. (GEF Operational Program No. 5).  
Performance indicators would include: measurable reductions of CO2 emissions; investments in 
EE projects; establishment of  adequate regulatory incentives and institutional framework for EE; 
percentage of efficient products on the market; deferred investments in supply expansion; 
reduced energy costs for consumers. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project would include the following components: 
(a) Development of the EE market, including: preparation of energy sector, tax and financial 
policies and regulations for the promotion of EE activities; education, training and promotional 
programs, including energy audits and studies, and dissemination of best practices; a 
standardization, testing, certification and labeling program for home appliances, industrial 
Page  2
equipment and buildings; development of uniform contractual instruments to support ESCOs and 
reduce transaction cost;  
(b)  Establishment of a revolving EE fund managed by a commercial bank as a trustee, to provide 
medium term (2-3 years) debt financing to ESCOs, large users and utilities for EE investments 
and studies; 
(c) EE investments and activities by electricity distribution utilities; 
(d) Program promotion, coordination and M&E. 
 
The project estimated total cost is US$40 million, including a US$15 million GEF contribution 
Co-financing for the project will come from: (i) the Government for the barrier removal 
activities; (ii) utility companies and customers for the utility-based components; (iii) local 
governments for investments in public lighting and public buildings (FEDEI and other funds), 
(iv) large energy users and ESCOs, and (v) the commercial bank administering the energy 
efficiency fund as it will continue lending for energy efficiency projects after recovering the first 
series of 2-year loans.  
 
The project will be implemented by several implementing entities (EPEC, Edenor, others) under 
the coordination of the Secretary of Energy and guidance will be provided by a Steering 
Committee with participation of main public and private stakeholders to the project.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Buenos Aires and Cordoba provinces, and other provinces that might join the project  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
To be assessed for Secretary of Energy, EPEC and EDENOR. 
Commercial bank that will manage the EE Fund will apply environmental screening procedures

No adverse environment of social effects are expected to result from project implementation. 
There will be positive impacts on climate change and energy consumers. Environmental 
screening will apply to all EE subprojects and category A subprojects will not be financed by the 
project.
