B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project’s development objective is to improve the capacity of rural governments to manage 
public resources for the benefit of the rural poor.  This would be accomplished through a two 
pronged approach:  
 
(i) 
Capacity building at the level of the state, the gram panchayats, and constituents 
 
·
At the state
level, increase the capacity to manage the process of decentralization and 
monitor local governments.   
·
At the gram panchayat
level, improve the process of planning, budgeting and 
expenditure management, information systems, and participatory and consultative 
decision making. 
·
At the community
level, support public education and capacity building to build 
awareness and confidence at the community level and capacity to effectively 
participate in planning and budgeting. 
 
(ii) 
Grants for village plans including rural infrastructure to most disadvantaged Gram 
Panchayats

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
India and Indian states spend a larger share of GDP on rural development and poverty 
alleviation than most other countries in the world.  Bank projects have little impact unless they 
can influence mainstream programs.  Therefore, the proposed project intends to assist the 
Government of Karnataka in improving the institutional environment for public rural poverty 
and development programs, including through policy reform, positive incentives and improved 
capacity of both local governments and rural constituents, particularly the poor.  The project 
would raise the capacity of the decentralized arm of the rural public sector, specially the level 
closest to the people, and by improving their capacity leverage various rural programs of the 
state and central governments implemented through them.  The project also intends to address 
the geographical dimensions of poverty.  In Karnataka transfers to rural jurisdictions are non-
equalizing and one of the consequences has been an increasing gap between richer (urbanized 
and irrigated) and poorer regions.  The project would address this issue by : (1) assisting the 
state in redesigning the transfer system to make it equalizing in terms of fiscal disabilities and 
expenditure needs; and (2) providing grants for small rural infrastructure in disadvantaged 
areas to allow these to catch up.  The project gives priority to “poor villages” rather than to 
“the poor within the villages” although the later aspect would also be addressed. 
 
The project components would be: 
 
·
Establishment of a decentralization cell at the state level and an information system on 
local finances and performance; 
·
Capacity building of rural governments in financial management, participatory 
budgeting and planning for poverty reduction; 
·
Equalizing grants for rural infrastructure; and 
·
Organization and human development and information for poor constituents

Environmental Assessment

Page  3
The infrastructure grant component of the project will support multiple small investments / sub-
projects and it is expected that these small investments will not have sensitive, diverse or 
unprecedented environmental impacts. Moreover, the impacts are likely to be site-specific and are 
not expected  to be irreversible. Mitigation measures can be designed locally if necessary to 
address these impacts. Importantly, the main objectives and the principles of OP/BP 4.01 would be 
disseminated as part of the capacity building/ training of rural government staff in order that the 
project would be better able to address specific environment issues that may arise. Furthermore, 
an environment assessment is being prepared which will include an overall baseline analysis, 
review of the legislative system, an assessment of the impacts of the likely sub-projects & the 
mitigation measures that may be required.

Indigenous Peoples
(
OD 4.20
)
The project will be active in areas which feature population groups that exhibit characteristics laid 
out in OD 4.20 to identify Indigenous Peoples and hence this policy is triggered. Although these 
populations would be the main beneficiaries of this project being resident in Karnataka’s poorer 
Panchayat districts, a brief section of the PAD would be devoted to addressing some of the specific 
development issues of these populations, which is a requirement of OD 4.20. This section would 
contain a brief development plan to further enhance the participation of such populations in the 
project.  
 
The populations which would qualify under OD 4.20 would include all Scheduled Tribes as well as 
other groups who fulfill the OD criteria for Indigenous Peoples. Some of these may belong to the 
Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes and the Backward Castes. It will also include other 
vulnerable groups who may not fall into any of these Government categories but fulfill the criteria 
of Indigenous Peoples as per OD 4.20.
