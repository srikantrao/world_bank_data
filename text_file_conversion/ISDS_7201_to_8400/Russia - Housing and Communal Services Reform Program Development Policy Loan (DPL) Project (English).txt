2. Project Objectives: 
The Development Policy Loan’s objective is to support implementation of federal reforms of the 
HCS sector at sub-national levels, by shifting from relying overly on government provision of 
services to market-based mechanisms for competitive service delivery.  The proposed program 
will focus on reforming the institutional relationships within the whole HCS sector, from housing 
management and maintenance to utility enterprises.  The proposed project would seek to help 
implement a comprehensive set of reforms in the HCS sector, thereby placing it on a more 
sustainable path where there is less reliance on government finance and support. 
 
3. Project Description: 
 This Development Policy Loan will support the implementation of key aspects of the Federal 
Government’s Targeted Subprogram Housing and Communal Services (HCS) Reform, which 
was approved in November 2001, with revision incorporated in December 2004.  The DPL will 
support reform in the main areas identified in the HCS Subprogram: (i) financial viability of the 
sector; (ii) improving the system of social protection; (iii) creating competitive markets for 
housing management and maintenance services.

The Project will contain a technical assistance component to support implementation agreed 
policy actions.  The TA focuses on broad institutional and sectoral matters and will not finance 
any civil works or polluting equipment.  The TA is not linked to specific investments, nor will it 
be used for feasibility or design studies for site-specific investments.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The Project will be implemented in 4-6 competitively selected regions with 2 to 3 municipalities 
in each region participating.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The TA focuses on broad institutional and sectoral matters.  It is not linked to specific 
investments (financed outside the TA/DPL) and will not be used for feasibility or design studies 
for site-specific investments.  Being a Development Policy Loan by its design, the Project will 
not finance any civil works and/or equipment. Therefore, it will have no direct impact on 
environment, and is assigned an environmental screening category of
 “C”.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area: 
N/A 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts: 
N/A 
 
Page  3
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
No separate Environmental Assessment or Environmental Management Plan is required.  The 
Technical Assistance program includes allocated funds for specialized training to civil servants 
at regional offices of the Federal Environmental institutions and at the environmental offices of 
the oblast and municipal level in participating regions.  This includes training on the application 
of good environmental impact assessment procedures (including mitigation and monitoring) in 
relation to various municipal level infrastructure projects.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
