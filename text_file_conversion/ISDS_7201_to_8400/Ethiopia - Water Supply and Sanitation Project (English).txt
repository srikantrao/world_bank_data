A.2. Project Objectives 
 
 
The objective of the project is increased access to sustainable water supply and sanitation services, for 
rural and urban users, through improved capacity of stakeholders in the sector and better management of 
water resources. Accordingly, the project is designed to build the capacity of all stakeholders, both public 
and private, to plan, construct and maintain water supply and sanitation facilities. In the process 
approximately 7,000 rural water supply schemes and about 40 town water supplies will be improved in the 
first years. But the main objective is to increase capacity to keep up with population growth in towns and 
urban centers which is doubling every fifteen years, and to provide at least 5,000 community-managed 
systems per year in rural areas (about ten systems per year in each rural woreda). The project would 
underpin economic development in Ethiopia and improve the lives and health of the population. Reliable, 
safe and affordable water supply is key for the success of other commercial and economic reforms in the 
country.   
Progress toward achieving the principal outcome will be measured through the following key indicators: 
• 
number of people with access to improved water supply in rural and urban project areas; 
• 
number of effective woreda and community water and sanitation programs established through the 
project;  
• 
number of effective, autonomous water boards established through the project in towns and cities.
 
 
The project will support achievement of the SDPRP and MDG targets of improving sustainable access to 
water supply and sanitation.  By shifting from a centralized to a demand driven approach, whereby local 
governments and communities identify projects with appraisal and fund management carried out at the 
regional/woreda levels, the Project will support the Government’s policies of decentralization of resources 
management to the lowest possible local level and promoting the involvement of all stakeholders including 
the private sector so as to improve efficiency in service delivery. By requiring villages and towns to adopt 
Page  3
 
 
plans that set out the facilities they want, how they will maintain them including cost recovery for O&M, 
plus replacement and expansion in urban areas, the project will also support the Government’s policy of 
recognizing water as an economic good.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project has the following three components: (i) Rural Water Supply and Sanitation; (ii) Urban Water 
Supply and Sanitation; and (iii) Program Support. 
Component A:  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation.  
(US$63.8 million)
  
Funding is to be provided (i) to 
increase the capacity of participating woredas to effectively manage their rural water supply and sanitation 
programs, (ii) to increase the capacity of participating communities to effectively manage their water 
supply and sanitation facilities, and (iii) to ensure that well functioning water supply schemes are in place 
in participating communities. The principal target group for this component will be residents of rural 
communities, who will benefit from increased water supply and sanitation coverage with improved quality 
and reliability of service in their communities.   
Key inputs will include capacity building to enable woredas, communities and local service providers to 
work together to plan, construct and maintain rural water and sanitation facilities and monitor those 
systems.  Goods and works will be provided for the implementation of Woreda RWSS programs on a 
demonstration basis in selected Woreda. Capacity building will also be provided at the woreda and regional 
level to support program implementation (financial management, procurement, contract management) and 
to put in place improved systems for monitoring and evaluation.   
Key outputs will include woreda RWSS Programs, woreda staff adequately trained and 
equipped to support rural water supply and sanitation, community water committees 
established and able to manage and maintain systems, local service providers capable of 
supporting RWSS at the community level, and improved water supply and sanitation 
facilities at the community level. 
 
Component B:  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation
.  (US$47.4 million).  Funding is to be provided (i) to 
increase the capacity of participating water boards/committees and operators to effectively manage their 
water supply and sanitation facilities, and (ii) to ensure that well functioning and properly utilized urban 
water supply systems and improved sanitation are in place in participating towns and cities.  The principal 
target group for this component will be residents of smaller towns, who will benefit from increased water 
supply and sanitation coverage with improved quality and reliability of service in their communities.   
Key inputs will include capacity building to enable Town Water Boards, operators and local consulting 
firms to work together to plan and implement affordable and sustainable water supply and sanitation 
systems. Technical assistance will be provided (i) for establishment and training of autonomous Town 
Water Boards to plan development of urban water supply systems and monitor performance of operators, 
(ii) to utility operators to carry out operations and maintenance, financial management, customer 
management, and to lower operating costs, reduce unaccounted for water and expand systems to meet 
increasing demand, and (iii) to local consultants to enable them to assist with planning, design and 
construction supervision of town water supply facilities and to help improve technical and financial 
performance.  Smaller towns without a functioning water supply system will receive assistance for design 
and establishment of sound management systems, goods and works to improve service to existing 
customers and major works to rehabilitate or construct new water supply and sanitation facilities.  Larger 
towns which already have a basic level of service will receive assistance with planning for expansion and 
further development of their existing water supply and sanitation systems, improved efficiency, financial 
management and monitoring to enable them to access loans for major works.   
Page  4
 
 
Key outputs will include established Town Water Boards with business plans and sound management 
systems to ensure quality service, efficiency and sustainability and improved facilities for water supply and 
sanitation, operators with improved management systems, local consulting firms able to support Water 
Boards and operators, and improved water supply and sanitation facilities. 
Component C:  Program Support
.  (US$ 8.8 million)  Funding is to be provided to build 
the capacity of regional water bureau personnel and regionally-based consultants, to 
equip water quality testing and training centers, to develop its web site and networking 
capabilities, to carry out applied research, to monitor and evaluate the program, and to 
refine policies and program implementation arrangements.

Resettlement
:  
A small amount of land will be needed for boreholes, pumping stations, 
storage tanks and communal water points. Construction of these facilities as well as 
pipelines can result in temporary or permanent loss of land, crops and other means of 
income generation. A Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared and will be 
disclosed before appraisal. 
 
International Waters
:
  It is expected that about 800,000 people in 40 urban centers and 
1.8 million people in 7,000 rural communities throughout the country will benefit from 
improved water supply services under the proposed project.  The impact of the project on 
stream flow can not be measured, given the fact that less than 0.03% (3 of every 10,000 
m
3
) of average river flow would be abstracted for water supply by the project.  The 
countries of Djbouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan have been informed about 
the proposed project and requested to give a positive response to it.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

Cultural Property
: 
 There is a remote chance that cultural artifacts may be discovered 
during the excavation of pipe trenches and foundations. The ESMF addresses the issue, 
and construction contracts will specify actions that contractors must take if a possible 
cultural artifact is unearthed. 
 
Safety of Dams
:
  OP 4.37 (safety of dams) introduces specific safety requirements 
applicable only to dams more than 15 meters in height. The WSSP will not construct any 
such dam, dam safety is not a safeguard issue. The ESMF various issues and potential 
mitigation measures related to small dam construction which will need to be addressed in 
sub-project environmental assessments. 
 
 
The Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework 
(RPF) for the project identify potential adverse social and environmental impacts that could result from 
village (primarily point source) and town (piped) water supply and sanitation facilities,  measures to 
mitigate them. It also describes capacity building needed to build the assessment and monitoring capacity 
needed to implement the plan. Both the ESMF and RPF set out procedures to follow during the planning, 
design and construction of sub-projects. Each sub-project will be required to prepare a facilities and 
management plan that sets out the proposed (i) scope of the facilities, (ii) the institutional and financial 
arrangements to sustain it, (iii) mitigation measures for potential adverse social and environmental impacts 
that may arise from the construction and use of the facilities, and (iv) compensation plan for those who 
loose income as a result of the project.  
 
 
 
 
 
Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
No significant safeguard issues or impacts have been identified or are suspected. The ESMF and RPF 
provide mechanisms to identify impacts beyond the generic ones for which standard mitigation measures 
are built into planning and construction processes. A full EIA and environmental management plan will be 
prepared for Category A sub-projects, but none are expected. Site specific EMPs will be prepared for all 
sub-projects to address generic issues as well as site specific ones which can not be eliminated through 
project re-design.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  
 
The project will support growth and economic development in participating towns and cities. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

Implementation capacity in the regions and woreda is low, including environmental management capacity.  
Some of the regional EPAs do not exist yet, and the others have limited resources in terms of staff, 
transportation, and operating budgets. Given the capacity required to achieve the Millennium Development 
Goals, capacity building is central to the project development objective.   
 
The approach to capacity building will be learning by doing through project 
implementation. During the start-up phase, before water supply facilities are constructed,  
MWR, RWB, and Regional EPA personnel will participate in a workshop to ensure they 
understand the safeguard issues and policies involved in the project, and the 
arrangements for integrating them into project implementation. Town and worda 
consultants will also be required to attend training workshops to learn the skills required 
of them in project implementation, including environmental assessment for which they 
must become “safeguard certified”. Each RWB will have at least one staff member 
dedicated to monitoring and evaluation, including social and environmental safeguards. 
The MWR will have full time staff and/or consultants for M&E as well as 
social/environmental safeguards. Their primary job will be to assist regions to train 
regional staff and town/woreda consultants, to monitor implementation procedures in 
each region, and ensure that environmental management and resettlement plans are 
prepared and appraised properly. Through periodic workshops with practitioners the 
safeguard and M&E specialists will refine materials and implementation procedures. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
A participatory approach will be taken in planning sub-projects. Water Boards in 
towns/cities and Community Water and Sanitation Committees in villages, representative 
of the different socio-economic groups in the community, will be formed to guide 
planning and implementation. During the planning process the Boards/Committees, with 
the assistance of consultants, will involve the community in making decisions about 
system management and design. Participating communities will prepare Facilities and 
Management Plans that include 
Environmental/Social Baseline Assessments
,
 
Environmental Management Plans
 and 
Resettlement Action Plans as required
 for each 
sub-project. It will be disclosed to the community through focus group discussions and 
public meetings and will be appraised by the worda and Regional Water Boards. 
Regional EPA will be involved in all social/environmental issues beyond generic ones 
addressed in standard project implementation.
