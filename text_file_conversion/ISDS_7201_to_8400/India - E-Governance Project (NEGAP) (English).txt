B.  Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the proposed operation is to improve the quality, accessibility and 
effectiveness of government services to citizens and businesses particularly among the poor and 
rural communities, through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). 
 
The expected benefits from this operation are: 
·
reduction in cost and increase in access to public services by citizens and businesses across 
the country; 
·
re-orientation of civil service from 
a
traditional “command & control” focus on inputs to 
output-based “meeting citizen needs” through business process re-engineering, freeing up 
public resources to overcome remaining market failures; 
·
increase in efficiency, transparency and accountability of the revenue collection and public 
procurement functions; 
·
improvement in the decision-making ability of farmers and rural suppliers through timely 
access to market prices; and

e-Bharat, based on the Hindi name for India, refers to the proposed Bank project to distinguish it from the 
Government’s NEGAP (National e-Governance Action Plan) program.

·
deployment of electronic networking infrastructure for technology-enabled economic growth 
and social equity, enabling better targeting of government programs to meet basic needs and 
empowering monitoring by citizens and advocacy groups. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
1. 
Bank’s lending instrument.
 
The total NEGAP program cost is estimated to be 
approximately US$ 3.2 billion (Rs. 142.62 billion to be confirmed over preparation) over a 
period of four years. The proposed Bank lending would be US$ 500 million over that period, 
provided through this e-Bharat project to support implementation of the NEGAP. 
 
2. Project components.
 The Bank’s financing would support the following components as part 
of the overall NEGAP program. The amount of Bank contribution to each component will be 
determined during preparation.

(MMPs highlighted in

 to be supported by proposed Bank operation) 
 
Component 1. Scaling up of selected MMPs (approximately 73% of total program costs).
 
NEGAP will provide the platform for scaling up and replicating successful e-governance pilots. 
In Table 1, the MMPs are divided into services delivered by: central government departments; 
state/municipal departments; and both central and local departments. They also are classified by 
type of outputs, namely services to citizens (G2C), businesses (G2B), and others to facilitate 
service integration. The Bank would support those MMPs that have an emphasis on the poor and 
rural communities, particularly in the less advanced states, indicated in bold in Table 1. 
 
Component 2. Infrastructure (approximately 16% of total program costs).  
This component 
caters to the infrastructure needs at state, district, block and village levels. It will include: (a) 
state wide area networks (SWANs) to provide fiber optic connectivity up to the block level; (b) 
state data centers (SDCs) to enable aggregation of existing data currently stored in a fragmented 
Page  3
manner; and (c) other support networking infrastructure possibly including access points for 
services and development and deployment of low cost technology solutions.  
 
Component 3. Training, communications & advocacy,
 
and R&D (approximately 7% of total 
program costs).  
This component includes (a) a training program at central and state levels for e-
government leaders, CIOs (Chief Information Officers), line managers, and civil servants in 
general; (b) a communications program to create awareness on e-governance and on NEGAP 
objectives, progress and outcomes; (c) an advocacy program to maintain political support and 
commitment among stakeholders; (d) an R&D function on areas of interest to e-governance.  
DARPG (Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances) would be the 
implementing agency.  
 
Component 4. Program management, TA and M&E
 
(approximately 4% of total program 
costs)
.
This component would finance the capital and operational costs of national and state level 
PMDs (Program Management Directorates) including: (a) overall program management and 
coordination to avoid duplications and exploit opportunities for synergies utilizing common 
infrastructure (e.g. databases, technologies, standards); (b) management of the program funding 
mechanism; (c) supervisory responsibility of core policies including enforcement of standards; 
(d) allocation and delivery of technical assistance resources; and (e) monitoring and evaluation 
for effective tracking of key performance indicators and overall program effectiveness. 
 
3. Funding mechanisms.  
It is important that the funding mechanisms within the program 
should be project-specific to reflect the economic viability of each MMP (i.e. revenue generating 
potential through user fees and/or cost-saving possibility to the GOI), the level of fiscal support 
to be provided either at the central or state level, and the share of Bank financing.  In addition, 
the extent to which these projects can be facilitated through PPP arrangements would further 
enhan
ce the available financing options irrespective of the projects’ income-generating capacity. 
 
The complementary possible financing options, which could exist as separate funding sources or 
under more unified mechanisms, include: (a) project financing for MMPs with strong revenue 
generating potential through user fees, (b) allocation or on-lending of funds from a grant/loan 
pool to support MMPs that may not generate user-fee income but have the potential for 
substantial cost savings to the government, (c) grant funding for MMPs with significant social 
developmental impact but no fee income or cost savings possibilities; and (d) direct program 
financing to private sector partners under appropriate PPP structures. 
 
4. Co-financing opportunities.
 The task team is collaborating with IFC to assess the feasibility 
of their financing of PPP activities under the program, based on their active participation during 
the project identification mission. GoI also would seek to maximize appropriate co-financing by 
other donors, and the task team will build on initial contacts with donor agencies during the 
preparation phase. Preliminary discussions with selected development partners indicate the 
strong possibility of bilateral grant funding being mobilized to help support NEGAP. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Throughout India – specific participating states to be identified during preparation.

The laying of fiber optic cable, which may mostly be dealt with under a complementary rural 
telecommunications development project, could involve the preparation of a technical standard 
to ensure no adverse environmental or social impact.  This will be clarified during project 
preparation once the concept has evolved further.
