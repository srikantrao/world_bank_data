I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project objectives are: to further improve the access of the low income groups in Yemen to basic social
services, while providing an example of an effective, efficient, and transparent institutional mechanism for
providing social services in Yemen by (i) refining the social service delivery approaches, and (ii)
empowering local communities and councils to take charge of their local development.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project will build on the success of the first two phases of the SFD. It will support the SFD to continue
to use participative approaches in delivering social services in an effective manner, focusing on the
sustainability of these activities, and the capacity building of local communities, NGOs, and selected
government agencies to enhance the way development is done in Yemen.

The project will have three main components, similar to SFD II project:

1) Community Development. Under this component, the SFD will continue to support subprojects in the
areas of education, water and environment, health and social protection, cultural heritage, and rural/feeder
roads;

2) Microenterprise Development. During the last six years, the SFD has (i) created awareness and
understanding among policy makers on best practice MF; (ii) experimented with and developed MF models
that work in Yemen; (iii) made available tools such as software and training materials to the industry as
whole. The key challenge for Phase III is to transform the micro-finance projects into institutions. This
involves amongst others: (i) improving leadership and management skills; (ii) improving governance skills
of host-NGOs; (iii) adding specialized "head office functions" such as fund and liquidity management,
financial analysis, forecasting and budgeting, business planning, internal audit, branch management, human
resource management, product and target group development, and marketing & PR. This transformation
from projects into institutions means foremost capacity building and consolidation. Hence focus in phase III
will primarily be on capacity and institution building.

3) Capacity Building Activities: Under this component, the SFD will continue to finance activities in two
main areas: training and organizational support. The component will focus on four target groups: (i)
formally established NGOs and cooperatives; (ii) informal Community-Based Organizations (CBO); (iii)
private sector(individual local consultants); and (iv) Local Authorities (elected Local Councils and
executive organs). The component also supports capacity building activities for the SFD.


I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The nature of this project, as in the first two SFDs, means that exact locations of project activities are not
determined until well after project launch; therefore, the selection and appraisal procedures for each
sub-project will include a questionnaire that will assist SFD staff to determine if any safeguard issues exist
(see below).


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: An overall Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and is being utilized for the
implementation of SFD II. This EMP has been updated and appraised for SFD III - the updated EMP
includes:

a) more rigorous use of safeguards questionnaires early during the preparation of sub-projects;

b) where necessary, preparation of an environmental impact assessment and other safeguard related plans as
part of the preparation of sub-projects; and

c) more comprehensive training for SFD staff and clients on safeguards issues.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

                                                       3

Impacts are expected to be minor and will be studied before sub-project implementation. A questionnaire will
   be completed so that the potential impacts can be identified, appropriate environmental assessment can be
   carried out (where necessary), and mitigation measure can be undertaken.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
n/a

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
n/a

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
n/a

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Each sub-project will be screened by SFD staff using a safeguard questionnaire (see B above) to determine if
   any environmental or social safeguard issues are triggered. If so, the SFD will ensure that appropriate
   documents are completed for the sub-project and include the recommendations contained therein in their
   supervision. The Project will also ensure that SFD staff and clients are adequately trained on these
   procedures, the safeguard policies and theory behind them. The Bank Team will spot-check the safeguard
   questionnaires as well as any resulting documents and actions required of the SFD during supervision.

The project includes activities that are designed to preserve and protect cultural heritage sites. Consistent with
   the Operational Policy on Cultural Property, activities included are training and capacity building of
   relevant partners for preserving cultural heritage sites.

The project will not finance activities that include procurement or use of pesticides. No involuntary
   resettlement will take place. The project will not be implemented in any area that endangers natural
   habitats.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders vary by sub-project. In general, they include line ministries, NGOs, local communities,
   local governments...etc. As part of every sub-project appraisal, safeguard policy issues are discussed and
   potential controversial areas are identified, and mitigation arrangements are put together in case of any
   potential negative impacts.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
