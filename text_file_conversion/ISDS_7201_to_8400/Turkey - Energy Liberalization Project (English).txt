B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 3 of P
CN]
The Project Development Objective
–
To deepen the electricity sector reform and liberalization process 
by:  (a) increasing the reliability and efficiency of the state
-
owned generation plant by completing priority 
thermal and hydro plant rehabilitation
 to ensure supply security during the transition; and (b) supporting 
the  corporatization  and  pre
-
privatization  preparation  of  the  EUAS  portfolio  groups  to  achieve  the 
implementation targets established in the Government's March 2004 Electricity Sector Refo
rm Strategy.
These objectives have been agreed with the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources ( MENR) and with 
the national power generation company, EUAS.  Achieving these objectives would also be a step in 
helping Turkey meet EU requirements.  
C.  
Project Description 
[from section 4 of PCN]
Component  1:    Pre
-
Privatization  Preparation
–
  The  third  component  is  pre
-
privatization  preparation 
assistance for EUAS.   As noted in section 1, EUAS will be restructured into several portfolio generation 
groups
 that will be subsequently corporatized and privatized.  Assistance will be provided in consolidating 
their operations and financial accounts, preparing transition contracting arrangements with the distribution 
companies  and  TETAS,  and  creating  pro
-
forma f
inancial  statements.   This  work  will  be  implemented 
through the Project and will be a separate Project Component, though the proposed Project may not 
finance this work and the funding could come from the existing State Loan. 
Component 2.
Afsin
-
Elbistan A
 Rehabilitation
:   The main component of this project is the rehabilitation 
of Afsin
-
Elbistan Power Plant A.  This is one of Turkey's largest thermal power plants, and the largest 
such plant to use domestic lignite as its main fuel source. 
Afsin
-
Elbistan A
 has 4 lignite fired units of 340 
MW  each,  which  started  commercial  operations  between  1984  and  1988.    Although  the  plant 
has  a 
nominal capacity of 1,360 MW, it has deteriorated sharply over the last few years because of inadequate 
maintenance and its actu
al available capacity currently is far below this level.   
Page  2
A pre
-
feasibility study has been completed on the plant to ascertain the scope of the rehabilitation and its 
tentative cost.  This study was completed by a team from the Bank and Chubu Electric o
f Japan.  The 
main problems appear to be with the Electro
-
Static Precipitators (ESPs) , ash handling systems, high 
pressure pipes, and frequency control systems.  The initial cost estimate is $135 Million for rehabilitation.  
This, however, needs to be con
firmed by a complete feasibility study.  EUAS will be issuing the RFP for 
the feasibility study by the end of May 2004.  
A closely related component is the construction of new Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) units at the plant 
in order to reduce sulfur em
issions.  The Turkish environmental authorities have required that FGD on 
Afsin
-
Elbistan A in their approval of the EIA for Afsin
-
Elbistan B.  The rationale for the FGD requires 
careful assessment and this would be done during preparation.  In addition, si
nce these units are quite 
expensive the Bank will assist the Turkish Government in searching for outside assistance in financing 
them 
-
 hopefully from the EU and others.  The cost estimate for the FGD is about $ 200 million.   
Component 3:  Hydroelectric
 Plant Rehabilitation
–
 Around 11 hydroelectric plants totaling about 860 MW 
of capacity require to be rehabilitated to enhance their load following and response capabilities.  These 
response capabilities contribute to the goal of meeting the stability req
uirements established by UCTE 
(the body that coordinates the technical requirements of the integrated European network) 
–
 that Turkey 
will shortly be joining.   A feasibility study for the hydro rehabilitation components is being prepared by 
EDF.  
D.  P
roject location (if known)
The Afsin
-
Elbistan AThermal Power Station is located in the central eastern region of Turkey. The power 
station  is  a  mine  mouth  plant  so  there  is  a  large  open  pit  lignite  mine  nearby.  There  are  no  major 
population centers in the
 area although there are scattered around some small villages and towns.
The  hydropower  rehabilitation  will  consist  of  replacing  monitoring  equipment,  instrumentation  and 
electrical components, and will be done throughout the country on plants where such 
rehabilitation is a 
priority. 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
Turkey has an advanced environmental regulatory framework in place because of its interest in joining 
the 
EU. 
The 
generating 
company 
EUAS 
and 
its 
prede
cessor 
organization 
have 
an 
effective 
environmental department that has been in existence for many years. In fact, the department has grown 
and benefited from technical assistance provided in a number of previous World Bank operations.

There will be minor issues (noise, dust etc.)

aspects (primarily at Afsin

Elbistan A). If an FGD is included, there are potential 
additional issues associated with FGD operation, e.g. water use, wastewater 
management an
d FGD sludge disposal, etc.

investments: replacement of instrumentation, electrical wiring etc. will not influence 
either the quantity or the quantity of any water body involved, and a waiver from the 
riparian notification requirement will be sought.

If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory):
The Category A assignment is predicat
ed on the assumption that the FGD component will be included in 
the overall project design. If this component is eliminated from the project scope at some future point in 
the project preparation, the environmental category rating would be revisited.
