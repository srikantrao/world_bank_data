A.2. Project Objectives 
The proposed program is intended to provide the poorest families impacted by the conflict with improved 
and affordable housing units in the North East. The program will entail a grant to poor families to 
reconstruct their homes given their vulnerability and weak economic position. The technical assistance 
provided under the program will help meet the long term housing needs in the North East through improved 
construction standards and strengthened housing finance options. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed program will support the GOSL and other stakeholders in achieving the 
vision set out in Assessment of Need in the Conflict Affected Areas (May 2003). The 
upcoming Program would have three components i.e.:  
 
(a) Housing Assistance 
(US$75 million).  This component will finance the Government's 
housing reconstruction scheme, i.e. a grant of Rs150,000 or a part thereof to each family 
below the Rs 2,500 monthly income threshold intended to help rebuild or repair their 
damaged houses. Program related environment and social issues were assessed during the 
course of preparation. 
 
(b) 
Capacity Building Measures
 
($3.1 million).  This component will include technical 
assistance to ensure construction standards, strengthened capacity of VRCs, social and 
environmental safeguards, the development of micro-finance options and strengthening 
of the construction industry. This component will also initiate a dialogue and sector work 
with a view to pave the way for the development of a sustainable housing finance over 
the long term.  
 
(c) support for overall program management 
(US$ 3million).

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The proposed program would cover the North East Province of Sri Lanka.  The program will not finance 
reconstruction activities within natural habitats, declared forest and wildlife areas, therefore  would not 
have any adverse impact on environmentally sensitive areas. It will not support the reconstruction of homes 
with disputed legal title. The Beneficiaries will need to ensure that the land is legally in their name.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The program will fund reconstruction of houses damaged and destroyed as a result of the 
ethnic conflict over the last 20 years.  Therefore, no irreversible environmental impacts 
are anticipated as a result of the proposed reconstruction of damaged and destroyed 
housing as long as adequate precautions are taken to ensure natural resources are not 
exploited in an unsustainable manner when seeking housing materials.  The long years of 
conflict in the North East have resulted in significant natural resource degradation. 
Clearing of vast tracts of original forestland due to security reasons is one of the most 
significant and irreversible impacts the war has had on the natural environment in that 
region. As a result habitats of many plant and animal species have been fragmented 
and/or lost. In addition, forests in other parts of the dry zone have been continually 
exploited for shifting agriculture, land development, human settlements and timber 
harvesting. The exact damage in terms of area of forest lost and if any species 
disappearance has taken place due to the conflict related deforestation is not known, as no 
such survey has been undertaken since the ceasefire agreement was signed. Unless 
adequate precautions are taken, the urgency for housing reconstruction could result in 
further aggravating the problem of conflict related deforestation by exploitation of forest 
resources for housing timber. Therefore, great care must be taken that the fragmented and 
fragile forest eco-systems remaining in the region are protected and not be further 
exploited and damaged.  
 
In addition, the demand for construction material could increase sand and clay mining 
(the latter mainly for bricks).  The mining of sand in rivers has the potential to cause the 
lowering of the river bed, collapse of the banks, intrusion of sea water and reduced sand 
replenishment in the beaches. Mining of coastal sand exacerbates coastal erosion. 
Increased beach erosion due to excessive river and sea sand mining is a serious problem 
in some coastal stretches of the country, especially in the South Western quarter where it 
is done in a widespread manner. Due to this reason, Geological Surveys and Mines 
Bureau (GSMB), which is responsible for mineral resources in Sri Lanka, has designated 
areas where sand can be mined by licensed developers  with least adverse impacts. 
Mining of clay for brick making is associated with environmental problems such as 
development of waterlogged areas and abandoned pits. 
 
The shallow water off the North East near shore areas also harbor several coral reefs. In 
view of security restrictions paced on boating, fishing and tourism in these areas for the 
last 20 years, it could be assumed that these coral reefs are preserved in a fairly pristine 
state and hence should be given priority consideration in protecting from coral mining. 
Coral reefs are very important coastal habitats and generally small and vulnerable to 
degradation. Although prohibited by law, offshore coral mining has been difficult to stop 
in the Southern and South-Western parts of Sri Lanka because it provides a lucrative 
livelihood to coastal inhabitants.  However, due to controls on boating in the north and 
eastern seaboard for security reasons, the probability of exploitation of corals for 
Page  4
limestone in controlled by default.   
 
Water resources are scarce, particularly in the north where groundwater is the main source of water. 
Therefore, the lack of sanitary facilities and poorly designed septic tanks can pose a huge threat in terms of 
contaminating groundwater.  Therefore, precautions will have to be taken to ensure that septic tanks for 
reconstructed houses are designed in a manner to minimize groundwater pollution.  Solid waste 
management, particularly the disposal of construction debris, will also have to be addressed in a 
comprehensive manner to ensure that the direct and indirect environmental impacts of the program is 
minimal. 
 
As explained above, the main impacts of the proposed program is associated with the increased demand on 
natural resources needed as construction material. In order to ensure that sensitive and vulnerable natural 
habitats are not further threatened by the project, the use of designated sites for sustainable extraction of 
raw material for building construction and promotion of natural habitat conservation in important and 
sensitive areas, will be integrated into the program design.  
 
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one 
safeguard policy or due to multiple project component.  
 
The main safeguard policy to be triggered under this project, is the Environmental 
Assessment Safeguard Policy.  Since the sites for housing reconstruction is on existing 
housing sites and resource use will be from designated sites for natural resource 
exploitation under license from the relevant authorities, it is not anticipated that there will 
be any cumulative impact due to application of more than one safeguard policy or due to 
multiple project components. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The North East region suffered much damage in the last two decades due to the civil 
conflict. Existing infrastructure has been destroyed and no development work was 
undertaken during the conflict. Post conflict reconstruction in the war affected areas have 
just begun and will continue for a considerable period. Out of the various development 
needs housing has been selected as a top priority in order for the displaced persons to 
return to their homes. Therefore, further development in this region is to be expected but 
at this point these development programs have not been developed and hence it is not 
possible to say what those activities will be. However, for large development programs 
EIAs/IEEs will be mandatory in accordance with the National Environmental Act and 
associated regulations, hence the impacts will be addressed through the EIA/IEE studies 
in the future.  The EIAs/IEEs will take activities funded under this project into account, 
therefore, cumulative impacts, if any,  will be addressed at that stage. 
 
Overall, the proposed program is expected to have limited negative social impacts. 
Neither the Capacity Building component nor the Project Implementation component are 
envisaged to include any activities that would result in adverse social impacts.  The 
Housing Assistance component will support urgent in-situ repair and reconstruction work 
for households who have legitimate ownership of land. However, some expansion might 
result in resettlement in a few instances, with all resettlement to be voluntary. To mitigate 
Page  5
these risks, a Social Safeguards Framework has been prepared using PPF funds. This 
includes guidelines to prepare a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) in the unlikely event 
that it is needed and tools to screen activities for their social impact. The Government 
reviewed the targeting mechanisms and the VRCs in order to fine tune and strengthen 
them in the context of the proposed Program. A PHRD-funded Social Impact Assessment 
was commissioned to examine longer term social concerns and broader reintegration 
issues such as ethnic and gender equity, the problems faced by displaced populations, 
social capital, and the specific concerns of IDPs in Puttalam and those displaced on 
account of the high security zones in Jaffna.  
 
The term "involuntary resettlement" relates to  the involuntary taking of land resulting in 
(i)  relocation or loss of shelter; (ii)  lost of assets or access to assets; or (iii)  loss of 
income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the affected persons must move to 
another location; or (iv)  the involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks 
and protected areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the displaced 
persons. 
 
When a village social assessment determines that resettlement is unavoidable, the 
NEHRP will provide a resettlement plan consistent with these principles to the Bank for 
approval. NEHRP’s operations will follow the following principles:  
(a) Involuntary resettlement will be avoided where feasible, or minimized, exploring all 
viable alternative program design. 
(b) Where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities will be conceived 
and executed as sustainable development programs, providing sufficient investment 
resources to enable the persons displaced by the project to share in project benefits.  
Displaced persons will be meaningfully consulted and will have opportunities to 
participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs. 
(c) Displaced persons will be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and 
standards of living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or 
to levels prevailing prior to he beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher. 
 
Given that the selection of beneficiaries for the project will be an ongoing process, it is 
not yet clear whether indigenous communities will be involved as beneficiaries.  If it 
seems likely that any of these communities are to be included in the project, a diagnostic 
consultation will be undertaken at that point with the communities in question. The 
consultation will be undertaken by a qualified social scientist/institution, with knowledge 
of the traditions and culture of the Indigenous people, to ascertain their specific wishes 
and to minimize the possibility that interventions by the project and/or its contractors  
inadvertently create adverse effects  within the communities. Based on the consultation 
report, the project will decide what specific modalities to implement vis-à-vis these 
communities and will prepare a brief (1-2 page) written plan describing  the consultative 
steps taken and  the actions agreed upon and the reasons for these actions. The document 
will be made available to the public. 
 
As the issue of land ownership and land title would be crucial to the proposed Housing 
Reconstruction Program, a PHRD
-
financed Land surv
ey examined access to land for the 
Page  6
IDPs and landless communities.  The survey identified legal issues resulting from the 
conflict.  This includes the loss of ownership illegal occupancy, property rights and 
customary law.  The land survey was intended in part to ensure that the land of the 
original owner at the time of displacement will be restored to such persons at the earliest. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
The project is aiming at reconstructing those houses that have been either partially or 
fully destroyed in the North East region, which is considered as a social and political 
priority. Therefore, alternative options do not apply. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The policy and regulatory framework in Sri Lanka provides an adequate basis for the 
mitigation of potential impacts mentioned above. A brief outline of the framework is 
given below 
-
Under the National Environmental Act (NEA), activities that fall into a prescribed 
category is required to go through a comprehensive environmental screening and 
planning process (EIA or IEE). Since the proposed project is concerned with housing 
reconstruction, there will be no EIA/IEE requirement under the NEA.  
-
Under the Forest Ordinance felling of trees in forest reserves are completely 
prohibited. Tree felling for timber is allowed only in designated areas under licensed 
approval.  
-
Mining of sand and clay are also regulated by the Geological Surveys and Mines 
Bureau (GSMB) where only designated areas are permitted to be used for sand 
mining. Here again a license has to be obtained from the GSMB.  
-
Offshore coral mining is also banned under the Coast Conservation Act.
 
-
Under the Local Authority Ordinances, all building plans need to submitted to the 
local authority to obtain approval based on conformation to a specified building code.  
This code has detailed specifications for housing design and septic tank design as 
well as precautions for prevention of ground water pollution from septic tanks.  
 
Although an adequate policy and regulatory framework exists in the country for natural resource 
management and conservation, enforcement of such policies and regulations has been weak. However, 
there are ongoing projects funded by the ADB for strengthening institutional capacity of the Forest 
Department and Coast Conservation Department as well as the Netherlands and IDA is  financing capacity 
building projects for the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) and Local Authorities so that 
environmental regulations and building codes are enforced.  The CEA has embarked on a program of 
decentralization with regional offices in eight locations including three in the
North and East Provinces.  
There are Divisional Environmental Officers (DEOs) located in each Local Authority and reporting to the 
Regional Office.  Therefore, it is anticipated that enforcement of regulations will improve in the immediate 
future. 
 
Although approximately 1000 villages will be beneficiaries under the program, at this 
stage only 29 pilot villages have been identified.  Since the reconstruction will be demand 
driven, an Environmental Assessment and Management Framework has been developed 
during project preparation.  The Framework served as a template to undertake EAs on a 
village basis for the 29 pilot villages.  The Framework includes precautions to be taken to 
Page  7
ensure there will be no unsustainable exploitation of natural resources for housing 
materials.  Based on the 29 EIA that have been conducted, the main environmental issues 
have been identified.  Since the main environmental issues are relevant to resource 
extraction, mechanisms of obtaining natural resources for construction has been agreed 
based on extraction licenses which will be issued for sites suitable for sustainable 
extraction.  A detailed Environmental Assessment Questionnaire Form has been 
developed which addresses the main environmental issues identified in the pilot EIAs, 
which will be used in the approximately 1000 villages, which will be supported under the 
project.  The questionnaire based rapid assessment for each selected village will be 
outsourced to a company with adequate experience. Environmental clearance will be 
granted based on the outcome of the exercise. In addition, EA Forms will be reviewed 
and cleared by environmental staff of the PIU as well as reviewed by the North East 
Regional Offices of the CEA as well as randomly reviewed by IDA during supervision.  
If the EA Form identifies significant environmental issues, a full EIA will be required 
prior to fund disbursement. Monitoring of the implementation of mitigatory measures 
will be mainly entrusted with the regional officers of the CEA attached to the District and 
Divisional Administrative Offices.     
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The main stakeholder groups would be (a) conflict affected returnees (b) politicians and policy makers at 
the local and national level (c) institutions involved in natural resources management (d) The LTTE (e) 
NGOs and CBOs (representing community) (e) building contractors 
 
Consultations with these groups have been held in the form of group discussions and/or regional workshops 
during the process of formulating the Environmental Assessment Framework and the preparation of the 29 
EIAs for the pilot villages.  Public consultation was an integral part of the process of preparation of the 
Framework as well as the EIAs.
