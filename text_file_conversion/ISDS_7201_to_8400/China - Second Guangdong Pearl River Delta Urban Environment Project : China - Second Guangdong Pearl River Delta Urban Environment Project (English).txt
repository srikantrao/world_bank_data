B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
As a follow-up to the first Guangdong PRD Urban Environment Project, the development 
objective of the proposed project is to improve quality of the urban environment in the key city 
of Shenzhen through building urban infrastructure and improving access, controlling 
environmental pollution, and developing sustainable institutions for improved service delivery, 
in order to facilitate future local economic development and to protect the water resources.

C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
The total costs of the proposed project for Shenzhen are estimated at about US$700 million. The 
proposed project would cover: 
(i) 
Shenzhen catchment, consisting of Shenzhen river, bordering Hong Kong and Buji 
catchment, a tributary to Shenzhen river: 

Comprehensive sewer network and interceptors in urban area 

Wastewater treatment plant at Futian and Chaopu under Public Private Partnership 

Water diversion from Dapeng Bay to Deep Bay through the Shenzhen river to 
increase natural flow and associated river mouth hydraulic works to improve flow. 

Flood control with beautification of the Buji river banks  

Landfill for disposal of river sediment from dredging 
(ii) 
Guanglan and Pinshan rivers catchment feeding into the Eastern river, a major water 
supply resources for Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen) as well as Hong Kong. 
Each catchment includes the construction of interceptors along the river and flood control 
works and wastewater treatment plants (under PPP) with associated river rehabilitation 
and beautification. 
 
The objective will be to improve the rivers water quality with a sewer collection and treatment 
ratio over 90%, from the current 60% in the Special Economic Zone and close to nil in the two 
other Districts.  
 
All the flood control components will be done through reinforcement of dykes and river banks to 
meet the city
뭩 flooding control standard with beautification of the river embankments. SMG 
cooperates since 1995 with Hong Kong SAR (HK) on Shenzhen river for flood control related 
investments, including dredging and disposal of sediments in HK on a cost sharing basis (50/50). 
All the rivers will be dredged to improve storage capacity during flood and the project includes a 
site for the disposal of sediments as an alternative to HK.  
 
In addition, a number of Technical Assistance (TA) proposed components by SMG includes: (i) 
Inter-district coordination with regard to urban environmental management; (ii) Municipal 
finance, including municipal bonds, and output-based aid (OBA) with subsidies to low-income 
groups to finance  access costs to water supply and wastewater services; (iii) Comprehensive 
hydraulics and water quality modeling, and river function zoning; (iv) Environmental monitoring 
systems; (v) Industrial pollution control action plan; and (vi) Cultural Heritage. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Shenzhen Municipality 
 
E.  Borrower뭩 Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
SMG should be considered a sophisticated borrower with a high institutional capacity, but no 
Bank experience. There is high level of PSP/PPP in the water sector: The Shenzhen Water Group 
in charge of water and wastewater in the Special Economic Zone has been privatized and is 45% 
owned by a private company. However, relationship with the two Districts outside the Special 
Economic Zone needs to be strengthened to ensure a smooth project implementation.

The Guangdong Project Management Office will assist the Shenzhen PMO in its experience with 
the project preparation of the first Guangdong Pearl River Delta Urban Environment Project. 
Shenzhen Municipality benefits from a grant from the French Government for the project 
preparation and associated safeguard issues. Sogreah Consulting Engineers was selected 
following their work on the first project.
