B.  Project Objective
The main objectives of the project would be to: (i) make road transport cheaper and safer for the 
population of three main regions of Bulgaria, thereby improving living standards by better access 
to markets and public servic
es, and increasing the competitiveness of local production by making 
inputs and outputs cheaper; and (ii) increase the capability of REA to monitor the main roads 
network,  plan  and  budget  expenditures  in  accordance  with  sound  economic  criteria,  and 
impleme
nt  road  works  adequately,  thereby  increasing  the  effectiveness  of  Government 
expenditures for a sizable part of the national budget, and helping implement the EU 
acquis 
communautaire
 in the road sector.
The three regions on which the project would focus ha
ve been proposed by MRDPW as the 
Northwest, the Northeast, and a combination of parts of the Southeast and South
-
central regions.  
These were selected mainly because they are among those with the lowest per capita income and 
have the highest unemployment i
n the country.  These regions represent about 20 % of the 
country’s population.  This selection will need to be officially confirmed.  The proposed focus on 
Page  2
a  limited  number  of  regions  is  intended  to  simplify  project  preparation,  to  make  project 
management
 and supervision more efficient, and to increase project impact
C.  Project Description
The project would include two main components:  
(i)  Periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of about 800
-
1,000 km of Class II and III road 
sections in the three regio
ns
.
  The road sections would be selected on the basis of economic and 
social criteria.  There would be about 30 contracts at a cost of about USD 2.0
-
5.0 million each.  
Road works would be selected, designed, and procured in three batches with implementatio
n 
starting in mid 2005.  The first batch, to be ready for Board Presentation, would be selected, and 
bidding  documents  prepared,  with  the  assistance  of  local  consultants  financed  by  the 
Government.  Selection of the second and third batches would be done w
ith the assistance of 
consultants  financed  under  a  USD  450,000  Japanese  PHRD  grant  that  has  recently  been 
approved.  This project component would also include the provision of consultants’ services for 
preparation of detailed  engineering for the second and
 third batches of contracts, as well as 
services for the supervision of road works.  Project implementation would last about five years.  
(ii)    Institutional  development  of REA.
    This project  component  would  provide  equipment, 
training,  and  consultants’ 
services  for  the  institutional  development  of  REA,  including,  in 
particular, the improvement of road management systems (road network monitoring and road 
planning and programming systems).  This may comprise modern equipment for road condition 
and traffic 
surveys, hardware and software for data processing and analysis, and related technical 
assistance  and  training  services.    As  may  appear  necessary  during  project  preparation,  other 
services, such as for training, study tours, and policy development, may als
o be included in this 
project component.  
Total project cost would be about USD 100 million of which the Bank would finance about 60%.  
D.  Project location (if known)
Road locations are not yet known.  The first year program of works, to be located in
 the three 
regions described above, will be identified before appraisal mainly on the basis of economic and 
social criteria.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity
Responsibility for the main road network falls under the Ministry of Regional Development and
Public Works (MRDPW) and more specifically its Road Executive Agency (REA).  Despite a 
strong engineering tradition, REA has received little external support since 1990 and has not 
strengthened as much by far as road agencies in neighboring countries.  In
 particular, modern 
road management systems and road works implementation methods have only very partially 
been introduced in Bulgaria.  At this preliminary stage in project preparation, REA’s capacity in 
environmental management has not yet been reviewed.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepar
e to mitigate them?
An environmental analysis will be carried out and an environmental management plan (EMP) 
prepared for each of the road sections included in the first year program.  For the second and 
third  year  programs,  an  environmental  assessment  fra
mework  would  be  formulated  during 
project preparation so that each road section to be rehabilitated under these programs can be 
Page  4
checked against the framework when the selection takes place.  The key parts of the framework 
(procedures  for  environmental  asse
ssment  and  content  of  the  EMP)  would  be  agreed  at 
Negotiations.
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed?
Consultation with the population in the vicinity of the road sections included in the project and 
information disclosure wi
ll be a normal part of the environmental assessment process.
