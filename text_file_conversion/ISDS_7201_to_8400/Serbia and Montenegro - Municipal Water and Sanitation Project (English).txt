B.  Project Objectives  
 
The development objective of the proposed operation is to improve safety and reliability 
of the water supply and sanitation services in selected towns and rural areas.  In addition, the 
project will provide technical assistance to various sector stakeholders such as the Department 
for Water under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (DoW), the Statistical Office 
of Serbia, the Association of Waterworks and Public Health Institute to improve overall sector 
regulation.  
 
C.  Project Description 
 
Component A: 
 Water Utility Services Upgrading
:
The component will finance the small scale 
investments to improve water supply and sanitation services in municipalities selected by the 
Page  2
MIA and approved by the Bank, based on the selection criteria in the Government’s sector policy 
note which is currently under preparation and expected to be finalized during project preparation.   
 
Component B:  
Pilot Rural Water Supply and Sanitation
:
The component will finance a pilot 
rural water supply project in selected rural areas to develop a cost-effective and sustainable 
model for improvement of water supply services in the rural areas.  
 
Component C:
 Technical Assistance and Project Management
:
The component will finance: 
(a) technical assistance to the DoW to formulate sector modernization policy; (b) technical 
assistance to the Association of Waterworks for benchmarking and monitoring the sector; (c) 
technical assistance to the Statistical Office of Serbia to add a module on access to safe water 
supply in urban and rural areas to their Household Budget Survey; (d) technical assistance to the 
Public Health Institute of the Republic of Serbia to strengthen rural water quality monitoring; (e) 
technical assistance to water utilities to improve their operation and management; and (f) support 
for project implementation. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The investment sub-projects will be selected by the Municipal Infrastructure Agency and 
approved by the Bank, based on the selection criteria articulated in the Government’s sector 
policy note which is currently under preparation and expected to be finalized during project 
preparation.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The environmental monitoring capacity of the Ministry for Protection of Natural Resources and 
Environment is being strengthened by the Serbia Danube River Enterprise Pollution Reduction 
Project (DREPR, P084604).  The latter project will define a pilot framework for project review 
consistent with Serbia’s environmental assessment regulations.  The framework will then be 
tested with a number of enterprises and refined to be further applied by the Ministry for 
Protection of Natural Resource and Environment for screening of future projects including the 
investment components foreseen under the Serbia MWSP.  The team will coordinate closely with 
the DREPR on this issue.
