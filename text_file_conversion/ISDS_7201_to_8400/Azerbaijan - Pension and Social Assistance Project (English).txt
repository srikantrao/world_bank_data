SPPRED
: One of the “six key strategic aims” defined by the poverty reduction strategy is: “reform of the 
existing system of social protection to give more effective protection to the vulnerable”.  In the area of 
social insurance, the SPPRED defines the following objectives: (i) reliable provision of pensions; (ii) 
increased role of pensions in welfare of the population; (iii) full collection and meaningful use of 
contributions; (iv) increased efficiency of pensions provision by improving its administration, and (v) 
linking pensions to social insurance contributions.  The following actions are envisaged: (i) design of a new 
social insurance system; (ii) establishment of an effective administrative structure for an efficient 
management and delivery of pensions; and (iii) development of an automated social insurance and pension 
system based on individual records.  The proposed project will support the Government in implementing 
actions (ii) and (iii). 
 
Concerning the social assistance, the SPPRED defines the following reform objectives: (i) improved 
benefits’ targeting and more efficient and effective policies; (ii) adjusting the system of social assistance to 
the developing market conditions, and (iii) increasing the efficiency of social assistance provision through 
improving the management and administration of the social assistance system.  The actions to be 
implemented are: (i) establishment of an effective administrative structure; (ii) development of the legal 
framework for targeted social assistance policies; (iii) development of the Social Assistance Strategy; (iv) 
development of the social assistance targeting mechanism; (v) creation of a system of adequate 
compensation for the poorest against the impact of new public utility policies; and (vi) creation of a 
monitoring and evaluation system.  The proposed project will support the Government in implementing 
actions (i), (iv), (v) and (vi). 
 
CAS
:  The proposed project is expected to contribute to one of the four interrelated strategic goals defined 
by the CAS: “improve access to services by reversing the decline in social services and infrastructure”, as 
well as to achieving its social agenda which among its priorities includes “an improvement in social 
protection of vulnerable groups: children, pensioners and unemployed persons”. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project would have three components: (i) strengthening the social assistance administration; 
(ii) strengthening the social insurance administration; and (iii) project management, monitoring and 
evaluation. 
 
Component 1: Strengthening the Social Assistance Administration (US$ 5.09 million) 
 
The implementation of this component will have provided the MLSPP with a good targeting mechanism 
with which to provide social assistance benefits to eligible families; MLSPP staff would have the requisite 
skills to use the targeting mechanism; and MLSPP would have the capacity to undertake knowledge-based 
policy formulation.  The component would include civil works and the provision of equipment, materials, 
technical assistance and training to MLSPP staff in order to enable better targeting of social assistance 
beneficiaries and creation of a related policy planning capability in the Ministry.  The following activities 
are envisaged: 
 
(a)  Implementation of a Management Information System (MIS) to support means and asset 
testing of potential beneficiaries of social welfare programs: 
(i) Refurbishment of MLSPP 
offices to accommodate the MIS in local social welfare offices; (ii) Installation of MIS-related 
hardware and voice and data communications at headquarters and in local offices; (iii) MIS-
related software development and implementation at headquarters and in local offices; and (iv) 
Training of headquarters and local office staff in the use of the MIS system.
 
 
(b)  Implementation of Targeted Social Welfare Programs: 
(i) Implementation of pilot programs 
for the application of a targeted child allowance and later a targeted family poverty benefit in cash 
(to be introduced in 2006); (ii) Staff training in applying the targeting mechanism; (iii) 
Develo
p
ment of a monitorin
g
 and evaluation function in the MLSPP for tar
g
eted benefit 
Page  4
 
 
programs; and (iv) Development and implementation of appropriate public information programs 
related to the introduction of targeted benefits. 
 
(c)  Enhancing Policy Analysis Capacity in the MLSPP for Social Protection. 
 
 
Component 2: Strengthening the Social Insurance Administration (US$ 5.63 million) 
 
The implementation of this component will have provided the SSPF with an efficient and transparent 
pension administration, where the SSPF manages and administers its revenues and expenditures efficiently 
and effectively; and undertakes knowledge-based pension policy planning.  The component would include 
civil works and the provision of equipment, materials, technical assistance and training for the following 
activities: 
 
(a)  Implementation of a Management Information System (MIS) to support a client data base of 
individual records, including provision of hardware and voice and data communications, as well 
as applications software development
: (i) Rehabilitation of SSPF offices to accommodate the MIS at 
central and local office levels; (ii) Installation of MIS-related hardware and voice and data 
communications at central and local levels; (iii) MIS-related software development and 
implementation at the center and in local offices; (iv) Training in use of the MIS system at central and 
local office levels; and (v) Establishment of an IT department (building capacity to operate and 
maintain the MIS). 
 
(b) Strengthening of Critical Processes in SSPF
: (i) Identification and registration of system 
participants; (ii) Contributions collections, including revenue monitoring; (iii) Maintenance of earnings 
and contributions histories; (iv) Establishment of entitlements, payment procedures, post adjustments; 
and (v) Asset management, involving systems to ensure integrity in cash management, standardized 
financial management procedures, and timely and accurate management information. 
 
(c)  Institutional Development of SSPF
: (i) Development of an actuarial capacity; (ii) Development of an 
analysis and forecasting capacity; and (iii) Development of a public information function. 
 
 
Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 0.89 million) 
 
This component will have ensured professional implementation of the project by using appropriate 
mechanisms of project management, and proper tools of project monitoring and evaluation. 
 
The project management structure would consist of an inter-ministerial Steering Committee
1
 and two 
Project Implementation Units (PIU) - one in the MLSPP and one in the SSPF.  Each PIU would include a 
coordinator and technical specialists drawn from departments and units that are directly concerned by the 
p
roject.  They would be reinforced by a Procurement Specialist and a Financial Management Specialist.  
Following effectiveness of the IDA Credit, an Architect would be added to each PIU.  The PIUs would also 
receive periodic technical assistance as needed.   
 
Since the MLSPP PIU currently lacks adequate procurement and financial management capabilities, these 
functions would initially be concentrated in the PIU for the SSPF, which has these skills.  Once capacity 
has been built up in the ML
SPP, they would take over full responsib
ility for all aspects of implementation 
of the MLSPP component. 
 
The main functions of the PIUs are to: (i) ensure implementation of the project components in their 
res

 The inter-ministerial Steering Committee would consist of the Minister of Labor and Social Protection of 
the Population, the Chairman of the SSPF, and representatives of the Prime Minister’s Office and the 
Ministries of Finance and Economic Development.

services; (iii) evaluate bids; and (iv) plan project implementation schedules, review plans and issue 
progress reports.  The PIUs would also ensure that the fiduciary requirements of the IDA are met (i.e. 
procurement and financial management procedures), and they would centralize information that will allow 
monitoring of progress on the project and disbursement of IDA funds. 
 
Major sector issues addressed 
 
The social insurance and social assistance components have been designed to address major issues in two 
critical areas – implementation of reforms in the principal public protection schemes; and policy analysis 
and strategic decision making in the two responsible agencies. 
 
1. 
Changes in the social insurance administration are expected to benefit program participants: workers 
through a better recognition of the linkage between contributions and benefits, and pensioners through 
regular payment of pensions.  At the institutional level, the overall operational efficiency of the State 
Social Protection Fund (SSPF) would be strengthened, and its institutional capacity to perform key 
policy formulation and evaluation functions would be enhanced.  Both should allow SSPF to manage 
resources better. 
 
2. 
Changes in the social assistance administration would benefit eligible poor and vulnerable households 
through increased targeting efficiency; and enhance policy formulation in the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP).
