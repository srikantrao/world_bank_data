B.  Project Objective 
 
The project’s developmental objectives are to: (i) strengthen social capital and social 
cohesion and foment and support social participation, in particular of the private sector 
and of civil society in the reduction of the

their lower secondary education certificate from the project or those that will be in the 
process of getting one) will likely: (a) improve their quality of life; (b) reduce their 
poverty level; and (c) increase their productivity.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard 
issues and prepare to mitigate them? 
A
Social Assessment has been carried out and an IPDP has been prepared.   
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements 
be addressed? 
The institution responsible for the design and implementation of the IPDP has more than 
20 years experience in delivering education to adults in Mexico, including indigenous 
peoples. 
 
The Integrated Safeguard Data Sheet (ISDS) will be submitted to Infoshop in 
Washington; and (ii) the Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP) will be also 
submitted to Infoshop in Washington and will be made available for local public review 
at one or more convenient locations in Mexico.  With respect to the IPDP disclosure the 
team has suggested to use INEA’s, the Ministry of Education (SEP) and the Bank’s 
websites.
