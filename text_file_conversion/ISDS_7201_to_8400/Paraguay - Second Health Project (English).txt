B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
At project completion, the project would have: (i) reduced exclusion and increased effective access (use) by the 
poor to basic and first referral mother and child services in selected areas; (ii) fostered social management of 
basic and first referral health services; and (iii) introduced mechanisms to increase leadership, transparency, 
teamwork and self-monitoring in the MOH.    
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project will have three components for a total of US$10.0 million over a three-year 
period. The costs and activities presented are indicative and will be refined during project preparation.    
 
Component 1: Increase Resources for Maternal and Child Services. (US$ 7.0 million). 
 
The objective of this component would be to increase the use of basic reproductive health and child 
services by the poor, in project areas. It would pilot a subsidy for a limited package of services. Following the 
Bolivia experience, the contents and financing mechanisms of said package foster: (i) self-selection of the 
wealthy out of the subsidy; (ii) increased production and efficiency of service provision; and, (iii) increased 
awareness of the poor regarding their entitlement (thus increase transparency of service provision). It would 
have the following characteristics: 
 

It would finance some of the inputs needed to deliver services (excludes personnel salaries). 

It could finance outreach activities to remote populations, and patient transportation for referrals. 

It would pilot in a limited area a scheme in which resources, calculated on a per-capita basis, are 
transferred to the departmental level that assigns them to the health facilities on a fee-for-service basis, 
creating incentives to increase the number of patients.

It could finance public and private providers, fostering competition among them. 

Inputs could be allocated on the basis of performance and client satisfaction.  
 
In addition to the package, the component would finance TA, training, equipment and infrastructure 
repairs as needed, and pharmaceuticals (on a one-time basis) to improve reproductive and child quality of care 
from the supply point of view in the project areas and for 14 maternities that account for 50 percent of 
institutional deliveries. Specifically, it would: (i) renovate physical structures to ensure a safe and welcoming 
environment for patients and staff; (ii) expand social pharmacies; (iii) train staff to improve their technical 
skills; and (iv) develop and implement a change management strategy, directed at health service staff to 
modify their behaviors respect to transparency accountability, teamwork, and their interaction with patients 
and colleagues. 
 
Component 2: Health Sector MOH Stewardship Capacity. (US$ 1.0 million)
.
The objective of this component is to increase capacity to regulate, monitor, support, and evaluate the 
effect of the interventions of component one, by developing and implementing certain systems and tools. To 
ensure acceptance among staff and institutionalization of those systems and tools, the project will use 
methodologies that aim at increasing trust, transparency, teamwork and leadership among MOH officials. 
Specifically, the component would finance TA and inputs to: (i) develop and implement a scheme to promote 
staff behavior change;(ii) design and implement a unified surveillance system for maternal and child health 
status and service delivery; (iii) reengineer the procurement, and distribution systems for basic drugs and 
medical supplies and monitoring, inefficiency and corruption (particularly in primary health care facilities and 
maternities); (iv) improve the HR policies and incentives in the project areas and in 14 maternities; (v) improve 
the regulation and control of the quality of care for mother and child service provision. In addition, the project 
could provide assistance to develop systems and management practices to maintain recent investments in 
infrastructure and equipment. 
 
Component 3: Social Management. (US$ 2.0 million)
.
This component would focus on empowering communities to organize themselves to monitor, manage 
and even provide health services, as well as to introduce good practices regarding reproductive and child health 
behavior at the household and community level. Whenever possible, activities will be implemented through 
NGOs and local groups and organizations. Specifically, the component would finance TA, training, and 
information activities to: (i) develop and implement strategies to improve family and community behaviors 
related to Component 1; (ii) develop and implement organizational and social marketing strategies to improve 
community participation, management, social monitoring and auditing of mother and child health services and 
programs; (iii) train sanitary agents selected and paid by communities; (iv) introduce basic management skills 
to community-based groups. The component would also assign grants to groups for initiatives integrating 
education and health outcomes following operational procedures approved for MOE projects. 
 
The main project alternatives considered
 include different geographical scope, intervention mixes 
and types of lending instruments. After defining and applying an MDG exclusion index, the proposed project 
would limit most activities to the eight (out of 18) most excluded departments. The project focuses on the same 
health issues as the previous project, but in contrast to it, it will approach them from both the demand and 
supply sides. Also, it focuses on changing attitudes and behaviors rather than on infrastructure. Therefore, to 
achieve its intermediate goal of sustainable increased institutional capacity, the proposed project includes 
ongoing training and follow-up to the MOH staff and managers and the target population. Finally, although the 
project is designed as the first step in a long-term process, a SIL is proposed versus an APL, because of the 
country뭩 inherent risk level and the absence of a well-defined sector program.  Despite the country뭩 risk 
rating, a LIL seems inappropriate because it requires loan effectiveness within three months of approval and is 
limited to a small investment. Both of those characteristics are seen as a handicap in the current Paraguay 
environment.

The 
environment and indigenous populations safeguards
 apply to the proposed project.  Both the 
indigenous population and environmental assessments will be carried-out prior to appraisal, as well as a series 
of consultation with indigenous groups, in order to adapt the project to their cultural realities.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Tentatively most project activities would be implemented in regions to be identified on the basis of a health 
services exclusion index.   
 
E.  Borrower뭩 Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Special care will be given to the issue of medical waste.
