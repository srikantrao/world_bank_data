A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the project is to improve the availability, quality and efficiency of 
the delivery of local infrastructure services  to the population of participating small towns. This 
objective will be achieved by (a) financing the rehabilitation and/or repair of basic infrastructure 
and utility service installations and equipment, and (b) assisting local governments in increasing 
the effectiveness of the management of local infrastructure services. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will finance (a) 
Urban Infrastructure Investments (UII)
:
the rehabilitation, repair 
and/or replacement of deteriorated local public infrastructure and urban utility service 
installations and equipment (water supply, sewerage, and waste water treatment; solid waste 
collection and disposal; storm water drainage, local roads, etc.); (b) 
Social Infrastructure 
Investments
:
provision of small grants to LSGs to implement small-scale investments in social 
infrastructure (schools, community facilities, park facilities, etc.) that contribute to general 
improvements in the living conditions of the town population; (c) support for development of 
Page  2
infrastructure subprojects, including (i) the preparation of town development strategies in about 
five towns that will remain without such a strategy at the time of project inception; (ii) the 
preparation of Performance Improvement Action Plans for urban services providers and/or 
utilities in towns that apply for financing of UII investments; (iii) the provision of training, 
advisory services and other types of support required by PIAP implementors to achieve the 
objectives of PIAPs; (iv) the preparation of final design and procurement documents for UII 
investments as well technical assistance for supervision of project implementation; and (v) the 
training of LSG staff in skill required for the preparation, procurement, and implementation 
supervision of SII investments as well as ARIS advisory support to LSGs in these areas; (d) 
project management support to ARIS including (i) the operating costs of the STICBP project 
management unit within ARIS, including staff salaries, in-country travel costs and mandatory 
employer contributions to the Kyrgyz Social Fund; (ii) the purchase of office equipment and 
vehicles; (iii) the creation and maintenance of a system to monitor and evaluate the performance 
and results of the project; and (e) execution of audits of the project accounts by external auditors.
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The Kyrgyz Republic is located in the north-eastern part of Central Asia. It shares borders with 
China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The national territory is 199,900 sq. km of which 
more than 94% lies at elevations above 1000m and 40% above 3000m. The Kyrgyz Republic 
occupies the western versant of the Tien Shan and the northern versant of the Pamir-Alai 
mountain systems. The STICBP will support investments in the 22 oblast and rayon subordinated 
towns in the Kyrgyz Republic. 
The principal environmental concern, associated with project is water resources management: (i) 
pollution of surface and (ii) ground waters. Both sources are used for supplying population with 
drinking water  and for irrigation. Most of Kyrgyz rivers constitute a part of international 
waterways, which  transport pollution loads to neighboring countries. Poorly managed irrigation  
results in depletion of water resources and salinization of soils. 
The principal rivers (including the Naryn, Kara
darija, Chatkal and Chu) are associated with four   
Central Asian lake basins, the Aral, Tarim, Issyk Kul and Balkhash basins.  The largest of these 
are Issyk Kul (6236 sq. km), Son-Kul (275 sq. km) and Chatyr-Kul (175 sq. km).  Majority of the 
22 towns are located next to these rivers and lakes.  
 
As the project activities will take in urbanized areas, it is unlikely that  sensitive ecosystems or 
plant and animal species would be affected by the project. However, the EMP for each specific 
subproject will analyze the particular threat to environment, if any, and suggest appropriate 
mitigation measures.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project has been placed in environmental screening category B under the provisions 
of the World bank’s Operational Policy 4.01, “Environmental Assessment”.  The project 
is expected to make a positive environmental impact through improvements in urban 
infrastructure services.  Any adverse impacts which will inevitably occur during 
construction works will be limited and can be prevented by appropriate and known 
measures in the process of design and implementation of specific activities.  As noted, the 
project supports measures for environmental improvements at the local level through the 
rehabilitation, replacement, repair or upgrading of existing urban infrastructure such as 
for waste water collection and treatment.    
 
Project may finance extension of water supply or sewerage networks. However, the 
routes will be carefully selected so that  no harm to ecosystems is caused, and the pipes 
are laid on public rights of way and do not trigger OP 4.12 – Involuntary resettlement. 
 
In addition, applicability of World Bank Operational Policy 7.50, “Projects on 
International Waterways” constitutes an exception to notification requirement.     
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project is expected to support positive long term environmental effects, since it will 
contribute to the reduction of surface and ground water pollution, improved solid waste 
management practices and/or reduced air pollution.  The primary adverse impacts from 
the project are largely associated with   small-scale civil works for infrastructure 
improvements. These impacts are very localized (predominantly in urban areas), limited 
in their scope, short in duration and can be addressed through both design and monitoring 
measures. 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not relevant. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has prepared and formally adopted an Environmental Mitigation Plan for the 
STICBP. The EMP summarizes the recommended design measures, construction supervision 
methods and monitoring actions to minimize and/or avoid the limited potential short and long-
term impacts of activities under project-supported investments. The EMP identifies potential 
environmental impacts related to construction and / or improvement of water supply and 
sewerage systems, drinking water improvement and wastewater treatment facilities, solid waste 
handling and disposal.  These potential impacts and their associated mitigation and monitoring 
actions are summarized below and described in greater detail in the EMP.  
The key mitigation measures included in the project are: (a) Preparation of subproject specific 
Environmental Management Plans at detailed design phase, which would identify potential 
environmental issues and ways for their mitigation and (b) Requirement to contractors at contract 
tendering stage to include into proposals the measures to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; 
 
The above would include, but not limited to: 
 
i. 
selection of optimal routes for new pipelines and construction sites for 
other installations will be carefully made to avoid negative 
environmental and social impact; 
ii. 
identification of designated landfills/dumpsites where construction waste 
has to be delivered;  
iii. 
timely identification and provision of appropriate funding for land 
reclamation measures; 
iv. 
strict enforcement of usage of environmentally and human health-wise 
safe  construction materials; 
v. 
noise reduction measures; 
vi. 
strict adherence to occupational health requirements; 
vii. 
proper supervision and regular monitoring of construction activities by 
ARIS and respective national and local level authorities.  
 
EMP will be regularly updated as more specific projects in participating towns are identified. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders are town populations, local and central government officials and utility 
officials.  A brief description in the Russian language of the contents of the EMP was 
published in local mass media during project preparation on August 12
th
 and 13
th
,
2004.  
The announcement invited NGOs and other interested parties to contact ARIS to become 
familiar with detai
ls of the EMP.  The Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations 
Page  5
also participated in reviewing the EMP during project preparation and in the finalization 
of the documentation toward the end of project preparation.  A letter giving a positive 
assessment of
 the draft EMP from the Ministry’s Department of Ecology and Nature 
Management on August 12, 2004.
