A.2. Project Objectives
The overall development objectives of the proposed project are to: (i) Alleviate power
shortages; and (ii) enhance the capabilities of energy sector institutions.

Key performance indicators toward these objectives are:

Objective (i) - reduction in outages;
Objective (ii) - Revised power sector framework, promoting private sector participation


A.3. Project Description
(A) Power System Reinforcement (Total US$ 24.15 m, - IDA US$ 18 m; NDF US$ 6m;
Electrogaz US$0.15m)
This component supports the project objective of alleviating power shortages and improving
quality of power supply in the existing Electrogaz network. These investments will be
implemented in two phases. The first phase, for which bid packages are under preparation, would
cover the provision of additional thermal generation to meet immediate shortfalls, urgent repair
and refurbishment of network, and preparatory work for the balance investments. The second
phase investments would address remaining short term investment based on the recommendations
of the consultant, advising on implementation of the low cost network designs.

(B) Technical Assistance and Capacity Building (Total US$ 4.05 m -IDA US$ 4 m; GOR US$
0.05)
This component will finance studies required for policy/ program development of RURA and
Electrogaz. It will also support training for Minlnfra, Rwanda Utility Regulatory Authority
(RURA), and Electrogaz' personnel. A comprehensive needs review will be carried out by Project
Coordination Unit PCU in consultation with all the agencies, to detail specific training
requirements and plan for provision of this training, which will be agreed with IDA.
(C) Domestic Resource Development & Efficient Utilization : (Total US$ 3.05 m -IDA US$ 3m;                            I
GOR US$ 0.05m)

This component will help prepare for the addition of more economic domestically available,
hydro generation resources - to meet future demand growth in the main grid. The component also
envisages providing technical support to development & implementation of good carbonization
practices and use of improved stoves for efficient utilization of available biomass resources in
Rwanda. It will also initiate a process of decentralized rural electrification via investments in high-
priority micro-hydro based independent grids.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
Diesel power plant: Kigali environs (near Jabana Substation)
Substations: Congo border (Gisenyi & Mururu), Uganda border (Rulindo)
Distribution rehabilitation and extension: country-wide in scope

 Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
 D. 1 . Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
 describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Environmental management of impacts associated with this project have been addressed by the
Government of Rwanda in their Environmental and Social Management framework (ESMF).

Project environmental impacts are mainly associated with component A, which are primarily
investments in the generation, transmission and distribution network.


  By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas
For Generation, investments will be made to increase capacity through thermal generating units
and rehabilitation of small hydro units. Impacts associated with the thermal generating units are
expected to be those associated with civil/construction works for housing of these units. During
operations, impacts associated with air quality in the immediate vicinity of the power stations,
emission of GHG's, impacts from water and soil contamination from fuel leaks due to
transportation, storage and handling of fuels and lubricants, and noise pollution.

With regards the small hydro units, these are all run-off-river type units, below 500kw each and
therefore, there will be no ponding, inundation or flooding associated with these units. Impacts
associated with this are therefore expected to be local and not significant, and are not expected to
impact the local aquatic ecosystems.

With regards project investments in transmission and distribution networks, environmental
impacts will be insignificant in most cases since investments will be limited to rehabilitation of
existing lines on existing routes. In cases where new lines are required to extend the network and
to connect the small hydro units, impacts will be minimized by ensuring routes do not impact
natural habitats, such as wetlands and forest areas.

Social impacts cannot be ruled out, since land acquisition will be required. The Government has
prepared and disclosed a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) that is consistent with the Bank's
Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, OP 4.12.

The Transmission Line for Lake Kivu Gas Development and Power Generation Project is subject
to the conclusion of a satisfactory Power Purchase Agreement with the developer. When the
agreement is reached, to address significant impacts that may be associated with this line, the
Government will conduct and prepare a specific EA as part of the feasibility studies package, that
will address these impacts. At this stage, planning information on the line is not available.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area.

This project has the potential to alleviate some of the root causes of Deforestation in Rwanda in
those areas where electrical power supply is restored on a predictable and more reliable basis, by
reducing the demand for fuelwood and charcoal as the main source of energy. Therefore, this will
have a cumulative positive impact on the conservation of forest ecosystems and their function as
a natural habitat.

Also, due to the unreliability of the rains over the recent past associated partly with the ongoing
crisis with low water levels in the lakes that provide the source for the major hydro-power plants (
not covered by this project), this project will support the increased reliance on electrical power
generation and supply from diesel engines in the short term, thereby relieving pressure on the
lakes allowing them to raise and stabilize their water levels so that the ecosystems and
biodiversity of species they sustain are not irreparably affected.


D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

N/A

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The borrower has prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that
establishes tangible institutional and budgetary provisions to ensure environmental and social
management plans are prepared at the appropriate time that address the impacts discussed in Dl.
above.

Furthermore, the government has also prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to
address the needs of those communities and households who may be affected by the land
acquisition needs of the project.


The government has experience of implementing these type of instruments from other ongoing
bank projects in Rwanda and measures to mitigate any gaps in their capacity to address this have
been included in the project.


D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Both the RPF and ESMF are consistent with bank safeguards policies, were subjected to
representative consultations in Rwanda. Further consultations, with potentially affected people
when they are identified, will be done as part of the preparation of the environmental and social
management plans as stated in the ESMF and RPF.

The documents have also been disclosed in Rwanda and at the infoshop of the Bank.
