B.  Project Objectives  
 
The objectives of this project are to: (i) supplement the resources of the Bangladesh financial markets to 
provide term finance, particularly in scarce foreign currency, for infrastructure and other investment 
projects beyond the capacity of local finance institutions; (ii) promote the role of private sector 
entrepreneurs in the development of capital projects, especially infrastructure, including those benefiting 
from donor funding (iii) allow transparent allocation of social grant funding so that projects which are 
economically attractive but not commercially viable would be developed by the private sector. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The project will include:  
(i) a 
[multi
 
donor] grant-funded
 
technical assistance program for the development and 
promotion of infrastructure projects and for the development of the framework for 
Public Private Partnership 
(of approximately US$[5] million). The project will 
support PPP through supporting pre-feasibility studies and overseeing the contract 
Page  2
bidding processes in collaboration with line ministries and government agencies. It is 
envisaged that as far as possible transactions work beyond initial project development 
will be contracted out to private transactions teams. A core unit will be maintained to 
provide the critical support functions of policy development, information sharing and 
capacity building within the public service funding to strengthen the policy and 
regulatory frameworks for enhanced private sector participation. 
(ii) 
an 
IDA financed
 
lending component
 (of approximately US$25 million). The project 
would support at least two pools of funds a Market Based Fund and a Capital Grant 
Fund to be established either as two distinct legal entities or as distinct accounts with 
Bangladesh Bank. The funds would be allocated to infrastructure and other term 
investment projects on the basis of recommendations of one or more investment 
advisory companies (which may be new entities or existing participants of the FIDP 
and PSIDP) under incentive based contractual arrangements. While investment from 
both funds would be subject to final approval of the GOB and IDA no objection it is 
intended that the criteria for allocation under the Market Based Fund should be the 
minimum to ensure economic efficiency and good governance. Projects would be 
supported on market terms and would require at least 20% sponsor equity component 
and a further 40% of third party funding. The Capital Grant Fund is specifically 
intended to allocate subsidy from donors and the GOB to make economically 
attractive but financially non-viable projects profitable for the private sector, with a 
view to establishing competition, efficient allocation of resources and making use of 
the best commercial practices of the private sector. Funds would be allocated on a 
grant basis and would be subject to rigorous prior review to determine the 
developmental efficiency of the project. It is envisaged that the project may also 
support projects finances through the unutilized components of the FIDP and PSIDP 
projects.
 
(iii) 
a
domestically funded component
 (comprising approximately US$[5] million of 
private sector finance and US$[25] million of Government funds to be provided over 
the life of the project and leveraging funds provided outside the project). The 
financial institutions allocating projects funds will be required to coninvest a certain 
amount to align the interests of the managers with those of the project. It is further 
proposed that the Government should allocate at least a portion of the reflow income 
as it is received from the PSIDP to the new project.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The Department of Environment (DoE) is responsible for providing environmental clearances according 
to the requirements of the Environmental Conservation Act and Rules of 1995 and 1997.  The capacity of 
the DoE to fulfill this function is being strengthened through long-term technical assistance from CIDA.   
 
To reduce risk to investors, IIFC will support much of the subproject feasibility analysis, including the 
preparation of environmental and social impact assessment to meet national and World Bank 
requirements.  The safeguards responsibilities of IIFC will include the following: 
 
Page  3
i). 
Screening of investment concepts against the IFC / MIGA exclusion list to ensure that no 
activities on the exclusion list are financed 
(
http://ifchq14.ifc.org/ifcint/cesweb.nsf/Content/Exclusion+list
). 
 
ii). 
determination of appropriate safeguard categories under both World Bank and DoE 
classifications; 
 
iii). 
Contracting and reviewing environmental and social impact assessments as required by the World 
Bank and DoE; 
 
iv). 
Submitting draft impact assessments for environmental Category A projects and projects with 
significant adverse social impacts for review and no objection by the World Bank, prior to 
seeking clearance from DoE; 
 
v). 
Obtaining environmental clearance for all proposed investments from DoE; and, 
 
vi). 
Providing the World Bank with annual monitoring reports summarizing all investments, their 
safeguard category, and impact assessment / EMP status. 
 
Decisions on the financing of subprojects will be taken by investment advisory groups, which will have 
due diligence responsibilities for environmental and social safeguards as follows: 
 
i). 
Ensuring that required clearances of environmental and social impact assessments have been 
obtained from DoE and the World Bank; 
 
ii). 
Ensuring that any Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) or Resettlement Action Plans 
(RAPs) cleared by the DoE or World Bank are incorporated into the loan agreement / investment 
contract documentation; and, 
 
iii). 
Providing the World Bank with annual reporting of all investments supported, their safeguard 
category and clearances, and any environmental or social commitments (such as EMPs or RAPs) 
which have been incorporated into investment contracts. 
 
To build the necessary capacity to implement this approach to environmental and social safeguards 
management, the project will support the following: 
 
i). 
The establishment of a safeguards function within IIFC, capable of (i) screening investment 
proposals against World Bank and DoE safeguards requirements, (ii) preparing Terms of 
Reference for environmental and social impact assessment sufficient to meet national and World 
Bank requirements, (iii) contracting and reviewing the quality of such assessments, and (iv) 
interacting with the DoE and World Bank to obtain necessary safeguard clearances; and, 
ii). 
The establishment of safeguards due diligence processes and capacity within the investment 
advisory groups. 
 
The project team will seek assistance from IFC, which has developed a training program for Financial 
Intermediaries for screening and management of environmental and social safeguards as a key element in 
the capacity building process.

Environmental Assessment
(

BP
4.01) 
The proposed project will not finance a pre-identified set of projects and no specific social 
safeguard issues have been identified. However, given that it is anticipated that a significant 
portion of activity will be in the infrastructure, it is likely that Environmental Assessments may be 
required for individual subprojects and will be supported under the project.
