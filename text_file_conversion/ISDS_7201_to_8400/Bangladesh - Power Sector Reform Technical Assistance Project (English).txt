A.2. Project Objectives 
The project is designed to:  
(a) 
Create effective capacity within the Government (Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral 
Resources) to put in place power sector policies, industry structures, and a gas supply 
strategy needed for a balanced development of Bangladesh's power sector; 
(b) 
Create capacity within the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to regulate the sector 
effectively; and 
(c) 
Prepare, and secure financing for, at least two well-structured power sector investment 
projects that are then efficiently implemented. 
Main indicators
: 
(a) 
Power sector policies adopted (particularly for underpinning financial recovery, faster 
access for all, and private participation), which are based on robust analysis and are 
consistent with principles of commercial viability with safeguards for social & 
environmental protection; 
(b) 
Regulatory processes in place, particularly for power tariff-setting and quality-of-service 
monitoring, which are effective in ensuring that customers receive acceptable levels of 
service at the least-cost  (based on a broadly accepted investment, operational & 
financing plan); 
(c) 
Improved public perception of power sector's performance and customer satisfaction 
(measured through periodic surveys). 
(d) 
Corporate governance structures and policies put in place for at least 2 power enterprises 
which would facilitate transparent and efficient decision-making, efficient and 
accountable management, and credible and timely monitoring of performance (including 
accounting and audit arrangements consistent with international practices); 
(e) 
Gas sector master plan and strategy updated, ensuring it includes a strategy for meeting 
gas demand from power, industry and other sectors. 
(f) 
Management and operations of at least 2 power enterprises improved through the 
participation of qualified global expertise; and 
Page  3
 
 
(g) 
Monitoring, reporting and Invoicing of power flows between “unbundled” power 
enterprises based on accurate system metering. 
 
The project is designed to create the institutional and policy environment needed to scale up the 
development of the power sector so that it can better contribute to the priority national goals of 
economic growth and poverty alleviation.  Inadequate coverage and poor quality of supply have 
been assessed to be dominant constraints to the achievement of these goals.  Furthermore, studies 
comparing electrified villages with villages without electricity have clearly demonstrated the 
positive impact of electricity services on income and other human development indicators.  With 
53 percent of the rural population still below the poverty line and about 68 percent of them 
deprived of electricity services, there is an urgent need to create the institutional structures needed 
to provide these services in an efficient and sustainable manner. 
The project’s contribution to improving power supply is consistent with CAS objectives of better 
governance and private sector led growth.  By building institutional capacity, the Project will also 
permit the Government’s evolving strategy for poverty alleviation to be better informed.  
   
A. 
Technical Assistance (Approx. $5.5 million): 
A.1 
Power Sector - Policy Making and Enterprise Restructuring ($3.5 million):  This 
component would provide the Government (Power Division/Power Cell) with the consulting 
support to scale up sector reforms by preparing a detailed restructuring plan, using this plan to 
shape Government’s policies and the regulatory arrangements, and creating corporate structures 
for at least two urban electricity distribution entities.  Envisaged consulting services include: 
(a) 
Detailed Design of the Power Sector Reform Plan
:  This task is expected to have 
several discrete but interlinked modules focusing on: 
(i) 
Financial restructuring and recovery plan to restore creditworthiness while 
building the sector to meet the goals of universal coverage and high quality 
service in an efficient and sustainable manner.  
(ii) 
Design of overall restructuring plan, including corporatization models, single 
buyer structure, and initial market interface arrangements for generation and 
distribution entities, based on a critical review of Bangladesh/global experience; 
(iii) 
An electricity/energy demand assessment of main consumer groups and update of 
the country’s Power System Master Plan (PSMP).  The analysis would also be 
used to shape Bangladesh’s electricity demand management, energy efficiency 
and possibly off-grid supply strategies; 
(iv) 
Update of the financing and implementation strategies for the Power System 
Master Plan.  Strategies will take into account Bangladesh and global experience 
with different types of procurement, financing and ownership mechanisms; 
(v) 
Design of Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency Programs (to assist 
customers to improve the cost-effectiveness of electricity consumption); 
(vi) 
Preparation of a sector wide social safeguard framework, including subsidy 
strategy to facilitate access by low income and vulnerable people; 
(vii) 
Other Policy/Program Design, including preparation of training and capacity 
building programs; design of communication and consultations strategy; etc. 
(b) 
Corporatization of Chittagong and Sylhet area electricity distribution companies 
to 
improve enterprise performance, drawing on recommendations of the corporatization model 
developed under the detailed design work (above) 
(c) 
Preparation of Investment Program for Chittagong and Sylhet area distribution entities to 
improve distribution system reliability, reduce system losses, improve accountability and system 
management, and improve customer satisfaction;

terms of reference, assisting with consultant contracting, ensuring quality of consultant work, 
evaluating consultant recommendations, and synthesizing reports (as necessary).  
(f) 
Other eligible tasks based on emerging demand. 
 
A.2 
Energy Sector Regulatory Framework ($0.5 million) 
Component will be defined after the ERC is staffed.  TA will complement and supplement 
activities being funded from other sources (GoB, USAID, ADB, etc.). 
A.3 
Gas Sector Support ($1.5 million) 
(a) 
Technical assistance to the Energy and Mineral Resources (EMR) Division of MPEMR 
to strengthen Petrobangla’s and its own planning and management capacity; 
(b) 
Technical assistance to Petrobangla (the state-owned gas company under the EMR 
Division) to: 
1. 
prepare/update the Gas Sector Master Plan and Strategy; 
2. 
prepare implementation and financing plan which will ensure reliable and adequate 
gas supply to power, industry and other sectors. 
B. 
Power Companies Management Strengthening ($4 million).
  Drawing on the positive 
experience with the way independent power plants are operated and managed, and the successful 
support provided to the rural electrification program by the National Rural Electrification 
Cooperative Association (of the USA) since 1980, the Government is exploring mechanisms to 
introduce modern operating and management practices into electricity distribution in non-rural 
areas and into the management of power plants.  The following contracts are being considered:  
(a) 
Siddhirganj Power Company: A management contract with a qualified firm to be 
responsible for operations, maintenance, and management of the Siddhirganj Power 
Company (SPC), to be set up as a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPDB with a professional 
and independent Board.  SPC will own and operate three 120 MW gas turbine plants to 
be operated to meet peak demand; 
(b) 
Chittagong and Sylhet area electricity distribution companies: Base fees for a core team 
of experts will be covered for a period of 18-24 months, after which company cash-flows 
are expected to be sufficiently predictable to fund these services.  The teams will be 
required to turn around company performance within a supportive policy, regulatory and 
human resource development framework; 
(c) 
Other Power Companies: Based on emerging demand for management services. 
C. 
Training and Other Capacity Building Measures
 ($1.25 million).  Training activities 
will be designed under component A based on feedback from beneficiary entities, and taking into 
account other on-going training programs. They will also include study tours and staff exchanges.  
Envisaged focus/fund allocation is: 
C.1 
Power Sector – Power Division/Power Cell/Power Enterprises ($0.75 million) to 
strengthen planning, management, operations, and customer and regulatory relations of 
enterprises; and Government policy making and reform capacity.
