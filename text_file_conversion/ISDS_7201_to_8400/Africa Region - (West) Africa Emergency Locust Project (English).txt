B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overarching 
Goal 
of
the proposed project is to contribute to a reduction in hardship on 
people and the environment imposed by locust invasions. It is the rural poor people who suffer 
most from the effects locust infestation. The effects of locust infestations on rural people are loss 
of crops for food, loss of revenue from trading agriculture products, and the risk posed on people 
and the environment from risk associated with application, handling and storage of pesticides. 
 
The 
Project Development Objective (PDO)
 is to assist with management of locust infestation 
and its impact on people and the environment in Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, 
Senegal and The Gambia. The evidence that the next locust infestation in countries will be 
managed in a timely fashion would measure the achievement of this objective. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Project will include emergency activities, post-emergency recovery activities, and activities for 
improved preparedness for the future. Activities are divided into four components: 
 
Page  2
Component A: Emergency Locust Management 
The output from this component is that emergency and long-term locust management actions are 
improved (cost-effective, timely), and undertaken in environmental and social sustainable 
manner. The following activities will be appraised: 
·
Emergency Locust Campaign: Evaluate needs for pesticides (short and long-term), 
acquisition of equipment, aircraft rental, and operating cost. Activities should feed into the 
national plan for locust management.  
·
Pesticide inventory storage, safeguarding: The purpose is to ensure i) that pesticides are 
stored in a safe manner following international standards, and ii) verify that only pesticides 
allowed by the country are used (no banned products, no Persistent Organic Pollutants). 
Where needed pesticides storage sites should be upgraded to meet international standards for 
storage of pesticides. 
·
Locust Management Financing Mechanism (for future campaigns): The major obstacle for 
addressing the locust problem in 2003-2004 was a lack of funds provided in a timely manner. 
For this reason, the AELP will seek to set up a financing mechanism (possibly housed within 
ECOWAS who holds other emergency funds). An endowment of two million from each 
country would form the basis for this Locust Emergency Fund, which could be accessed by 
each country on a matching grant basis, or other methods to be defined as part of the project. 
·
Obsolete pesticide disposal: Obsolete pesticides (pesticides that are unfit for use, unwanted, 
or persistent organic pollutants) pose a risk to poor rural people as well as to the local, 
regional and global environment. The project would finance the repackaging, transport and 
incineration of such obsolete pesticides. This would be done in collaboration with the Africa 
Stockpiles Program, a partnership with the FAO, WWF International, and others.  
 
Component B: Emergency Agriculture Investments 
The output of this component is that agriculture productivity in priority rural areas damaged by 
locusts is improved. The project would provide seeds and fertilizers to rural farmers so that they 
can restore their livelihood. The type of support to be provided through this component is to be 
appraised in details, but includ
e
provision of ‘starter packs’, and may also include working 
through existing community driven development or social projects. The FAO, CILSS and WFP 
are undertaking an analysis for each country affected by the locust that will results in an 
estimation of the a) need for emergency food supply (WFP will issue and appeal in the beginning 
of November), and b) needs for restoration of agriculture productivity (FAO will issue and 
appeal in the beginning of November). The financing of activities under this component will 
complement that of other donors and be within the framework of the needs expressed by FAO 
and WFP. 
 
Component C: National Capacity for Early Warning 
The output of this component will be that the national capacity for monitoring and reporting of 
future outbreaks is improved. It is anticipated that the activities top be appraised and proposed 
under this component will complement those activities undertaken through the FAO managed 
EMPRES project (financed by the Africa Development Bank). The appraisal will identify what 
Page  3
types of financing is required to top off the existing committed financing of early warning 
systems in the countries. 
 
Component D: Project Management 
The output of this component will be that the project is managed (that is, designed, adjusted, 
monitored and evaluated) effectively to meet the, possibly, shifting requirements and priorities of 
the effort of assisting with management of locust infestation and its impact on people and the 
environment in concerned countries. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will intervene in seven countries: Senegal, The Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina 
Faso, Niger, and Chad. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Each country has some institutional capacity for managing safeguards as each of the countries 
have prepared Pest Management Plans as part of the requirements for disbursing PPF Advances 
provided during the Identification Mission.

Environmental Assessment Category:

The project is currently assessed to be category B. Appraisal of the project will determine 
whether it is necessary to change the EA category. 
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. 
 
The project will be processed under OP/BP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Loan, and a QER will 
not be required. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
A
PAD will not be required due the processing under the OP/BP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery 
Loan. Instead a Memorandum of the President with Technical Annexes will be prepared. The 
MOP will be finalized by October 31, 2004. 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
Due to the processing under OP/BP 8.50 for Emergency Recovery Loan, the EA will be required 
one year after board approval. This EA will outline the types of environmental impact that could 
arise from implementation of the project, in particular activities related to Emergency 
Agriculture Investments (Component B). The scope of the EA would be to ensure that potential 
negative impact is prevented. 
 
In addition, country specific Pest Management Plans (PMP) will be required prior to 
effectiveness, and likely to be prepared between Mid November and end of December. These 
PMPs will outline the countries policy on pest management, rules and regulations related to pest
