TA and CapacityBuilding

The overall objective is the creation andlor strengtheningof the organizations and institutions
that would help the Government meets its renewable energy target. The capacity areas covered
would be the policy setting, promotion, regulation, serviceprovision, and monitoring/evaluation
of renewable energy power generation. The agencies covered would include DME, National
Energy Regulator (NER), and potential project sponsors and financiers.

Investments

Commercial Solar Water Heating (CSWH). The project will support expansion of South
Africa's nascent solar water heating industry by promoting installation of systems for solar water
heating for commercial, institutional, and industrial a plications; this will be coordinated with. a
                                                                P
UNDPIGEFprogram aimed at the residential market .

There are already a few companies serving the CSWH market in South Africa, without any
subsidies or other incentives; however, they face some barriers which makes it difficult for them
to scale-up. The near-commercial nature of the CSWH presents good prospects for rapid take-off
during the project with GEF support.

The project-supported solar water heating investments will be installed in existing institutional,
commercial, and industrial facilities, within the confines of their facility perimeters. In most
cases, the solar arrays will be installed on rooftops of existing buildings, but ground mounting of
the arrays is possible. The associated water storage tanks, pumps, water softening equipment,

         A typical CSWH system, suitable for a hospital, has a storage capacity of 30,000 litres, whereas the
capacity of residential systems is 200-30 litres. Some of the main end-users of CSWH systems are hotels, hostels,
hospitals, flatslapartment blocks, and industrylfood processing.

etc., will for the most part be installed inside existing buildings but in any case will be in close
proximity to the associated (existing) institutional, commercial, or industrial uses of the hot
water. No new land taking is envisioned for the investments.

Renewable energy power generation. This project is expected to trigger significant private
sector investments in renewable energy power generation; these investments will befinanced
outside of the REMTproject by a combination ofprivate equity and debt, with debtfinancing
facilitated by an output-based revenue streamprovided by external 'carbonfunds' such as the
PCF. Preliminary analysis indicates that over 2005-2008 there will be about 5-6 projects:

         With a renewable generation capacity of 75 MW that would displace about 900 GWh per
         year of Eskom's generation, and capital cost of about $ 150 million, with 'carbon funds'
         providing about $ 50 million;
         Which would utilize resources such as landfill-gas-to-electricity,bagasse cogeneration in
         sugar industry, waste-based generation in the paper industry, small hydro and wind;

Alternative development interventions/approaches The conventional approach of the Bank,
including GEF, financing renewable energy power generation investments was rejected                -this
reflects the emergence of non-Bank funds2as well as the well-developed nature of South
Africa's private and financial sectors.

Lending instrument. The project provides only GEF grants, as there is no need for South Africa
to borrow IBRD hnds for this project.

D. Project location (if known)

Project supported solar industrial process heating investments will be installed primarily in the
major cities: Johannesburg, Pretoria, Capetown, etc., but eligibility for the program is country-
wide.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [fromPCN]

The Government of South Africa has considerable institutional capacity for renewing, analyzing,
and enforcing safeguard policies.

Environmental Assessment Category:
[1A [I B [XI C [ ] FI [ ] TBD (to be determined)

The technical assistance and solar water heating investments in the project are not expected to
present any environmental or social risk. Solar water heating is not a 'listed activity' with
respect to South African environmental requirements, and therefore would not be subject to the
environmental screening or environmental assessment process. Since the project does not
involve any land taking, and the only construction will be within the perimeter of existing
institutional, commercial, or industrial establishments, (and in fact, mostly on rooftops) no social
safeguards are expected to be triggered.
