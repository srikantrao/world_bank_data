A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project will develop an effective policy infrastructure to implement, manage and evaluate 
employment, education and social cohesion reforms in the MoLSAF and in the MoE.  
 
If successful, the project will develop institutional capacity for evidence-based policy making in the two 
participating Ministries. 
 
The Government of Slovakia intends to consolidate the reforms undertaken to date, and to couple them 
with forward-looking and mutually consistent employment and social cohesion policies in order to achieve 
a
lasting decline in poverty and social exclusion.  These reforms will be a necessary condition of 
Slovakia’s continued growth.   
 
The Human Capital Technical Assistance (HCTA) project will contribute to these objectives by 
developing the human resources involved in policy-making; strengthening the management systems and 
processes governing policy preparation and ensuring the capacity for evidence based policy monitoring. 
 
The proposed project is fully consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy
1
goals of supporting poverty 
alleviation through economic development, strengthening labor market reforms and introducing education 
reforms.  It directly relates to two of the three main development challenges for Slovakia as discussed in 
the CPS:  (i) to make Slovakia fully competitive in European and World Markets through the 
implementation of the structural reforms to improve labor and capital mobility; and (ii) to reduce poverty 
and unemployment and to address the marginalization of Roma.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
1
Country Partnership Strategy, May 6, 2004. 
Page  2
The project will have three components: 
 
Component 1:  Creation Of A Policy Capacity Framework (Euro 1,070,000) 
 
The objective of this component is create a framework within which policy making and the design and 
implementation of components of reform in the two Ministries and associated institutions can be 
coordinated.  The component will provide  technical assistance to: (i) assess the current institutional 
capacity for policy making and monitoring in the two participating Ministries; and (ii) develop a consistent 
and sustainable strategy to increase technical capacity for implementation and monitoring of the reforms.  
Additionally, the component will provide support for:  (iii) the creation of project coordination 
mechanisms and the necessary project implementation structure; and (iv) strategies to mainstream and 
ensure the sustainability of reforms. 
 
Component 2:  Investment In Human Resources  (Euro 3,050,000) 
 
The objective of this component is to achieve a significant improvement in the quality of human resources 
available for policy making and implementation in the two participating Ministries and associated 
institutions, through the training and development of existing staff in policy and reform impact analysis 
and through targeted recruitment strategies.  The component will  provide assistance to: (i) improve the 
quality of the Human Resource Management systems in both MoLSAF and MoE; (ii) identify training 
needs and opportunities (including internships, scholarships and research grants); (iii) enhance policy 
capacity through the provision of training and exposure to other policy environments; and (iv) create 
instruments to attract new researchers and policy analysts to enter the field through scholarship and 
research grants. 
 
Component 3:  Building And Upgrading Institutional Capacity  (Euro 800,000) 
 
The objective of this component is to create and implement an integrated policy management system to 
structure and guide the various steps in the policy cycle in both the participating
 
Ministries and in the 
network of associated institutions.  The component will: (i)  develop effective mechanisms to improve 
evidence-based policy making, including the development of important national social and educational 
action plans and reports; (ii)  improve the quality and quantity of internationally comparable data available 
to policy makers in both MoLSAF and MoE;  and (iii) will develop social policy monitoring and 
evaluation indicators  in the field of employment, education and social cohesion.
