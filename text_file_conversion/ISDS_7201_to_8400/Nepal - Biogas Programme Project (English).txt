B.  Project Objective
 
The project proposes to promote recovery of biogas from cattle dung as an alternative source of 
household energy (for cooking and lighting) in Nepal. The proposed project development objectives are: 
 
·
To reduce global emissions of carbon dioxide.  
·
To reduce unsustainable forestry practices by increasing the use of biogas to meet household 
energy needs. 
 
The project will produce additional benefits in addition to those listed as development objectives.  It will 
improve health, especially in women and children, by reducing IAP levels in homes adopting biogas 
technology and by improving sanitation through its linkage to increased installation of toilets which can 
be connected to the biogas reactor.  It will improve rural agricultural productivity through the creation of 
a
nutrient-rich byproduct of biogas production which can be used as a fertilizer to improve crop yields.  
Improved agricultural yields of 6% to 20% have been observed when the bio slurry was utilized as 
organic fertilizer in Nepal.

Furthermore, the project will also have a positive social impact by reducing the amount of time required 
for collection of fuelwood for household needs.  Per household, the workload of women and girls can be 
reduced by about 3 hours per day with the introduction of biogas stoves.  This time previously spent on 
firewood collection, chopping and cooking could now be dedicated towards income generating activities 
or social activities such as increased education.   
 
C.  Project Description
 
The Biogas Programme is a national program that has successfully installed 112,000 biogas plants 
between 1992 and December 2003 (Phases I-Phase III) in 65 out of 75 districts of Nepal through the 
training and mobilization of over 40 Biogas Construction Companies.  Phase IV (July 2003 
–
June 2009) 
will support the installation of an additional 162,000-200,000 small biogas plants. 
 
The overall objective of the Biogas Sector Partnership (BSP) Phase IV is further to develop and 
disseminate the use of biogas as an indigenous and sustainable energy source in rural areas of Nepal. 
Specific objectives of the programme include:  
¾
Develop a commercially viable, market-oriented biogas industry;  
¾
Increase the number of high quality, small(er)-sized additional biogas plants by 162,000-200,000; 
¾
Reduce CO
2
emissions and considerably reduce the consumption of firewood by rural families, 
and improve the health situation of farmers’ families in and around the house. 
 
The target group of BSP-IV are farming families who own at least two-bovines, have land to build the 
biogas plant on, and have access to a sufficient amount of water. 
 
The program will provide subsidy support of approximately 30% of the capital cost of the biogas reactor 
to participants who will contract installation to private sector providers.  The subsidy is funded by 
Government contribution and bilateral grants from Netherlands DGIS and KfW.  The Biogas Sector 
Partnership- Nepal (BSP-Nepal), a Nepal NGO, with advisory assistance provided by SNV/Nepal 
(Netherlands Development Organisation), performs core implementation functions in the field of subsidy 
administration, sector coordination, product development, research, training and quality control.  Credit 
availability for the farmers’ investment contribution is being made available through a KfW revolving 
fund scheme through the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal, and additional outreach by BSP is 
underway to other MFIs active in the target areas to increase rural access to credit. 
The World Bank Carbon Finance Unit has issued a draft letter of intent for the purchase, on behalf of the 
participants in the Community Development Carbon Fund, of approximately 1 million tonnes of ERs 
from the Project with a possible option to acquire up to 1.5 million additional tonnes at a price to be 
agreed (but no less than US$4 and no more than US$5 per tonne). 
The sale of carbon credits to the CDCF is required to satisfy funding requirements for full implementation 
of Phase IV, and the funds obtained through future sale of CO
2
credits will strengthen program 
sustainability by reducing the Program’s dependency on large government and external donor subsidies 
while maintaining the accessibility of the biogas technology to low-income farmers in remote areas.  
Phase IV aims to increase penetration of biogas plants in more remote areas where awareness levels and 
disposable incomes are lower.  As the per plant outreach and investment costs may be higher than 
projected for implementation of this phase, Carbon Finance revenues can also be used to provide 
additional support which may be required to ensure participation in underserved communities.  The funds 
obtained from the sale of CO
2
credits will also allow the BSP to continue the close monitoring, quality 
Page  3
control and registration of the constructed biogas plants in future years.  This support for BSP functions 
has ensured the successful implementation of the first three phases of the Biogas Programme, and is 
required to ensure that the scale up activities in Phase IV achieve program goals.
 
D.  Project Location  
 
The program targets almost all the districts of Nepal. The geographical contexts range from the 
mountainous areas to foothills and flood plains of the Terai region of Nepal. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity
 
The program will be implemented by the Biogas Sector Partnership (BSP) which is an ISO-certified,  
registered non-governmental Nepalese organization.  The BSP has received significant technical 
assistance and training from SNV, and their institutional capacity is quite strong.  They currently fully 
satisfy the reporting requirements of SNV and KfW, and have historically been quite responsive in 
addressing potential environmental and social issues.  The Dutch, through SNV, are providing long-term 
advisory services to BSP, and hold monthly management meetings to discuss and mitigate potential 
implementation problems.   
 
The positive impacts of the project largely outweigh the few potential negative impacts, which can be 
managed properly through some modification to the design of the biogas reactors.  Institutional capacity 
of the borrower for implementing the environmental management measures is not expected to be a 
significant concern.

The program being supported by the Bank 
involves installation of BG reactors, which has 
some generic environmental issues (described 
in the subsequent sections of this document) 
that require mitigation. Therefore, OP4.01 is 
applicable to the project.

Since, the program aims to have a nation 
wide coverage, it is obvious that there 
would be indigenous people in the project 
domain. However, due to the very nature 
and  design of the program, it is expected 
that such communities can benefit from 
the project provided they meet the basic 
requirements to participate in the program. 
As there are no adverse impacts on such 
communities, OD 4.20 is not expected to 
be applicable.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
 
The risks of negative social or environmental issues arising from program implementation are low, but 
this will be further examined during project preparation.  Specific areas to receive attention include the 
following: 
·
possible increases of mosquito breeding and associated health impacts
 
·
environmental impacts from the use of bio slurry as fertilizer.
 
·
The level of human and cattle parasites in the bio slurry to be determined and the impacts 
associated with their presence to be assessed and addressed
 
·
Health impacts associated with handling of bio slurry 
 
Specific social issues which will be further examined include the impacts of the project on the poorest, 
including those who cannot afford to install the biogas plants, and the mechanisms which will be put in 
place to allow for consultation with program participants and communities during implementation.  
 
The trend in decrease of livestock population, observed after installation of the BG reactors (as per the 
sample survey results) may need to be further studied to establish possible linkage with the BG program, 
if any, and concerns arising from the same would need to be addressed during the project preparation. 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
Additional studies would be required to be undertaken to examine the potential impacts mentioned above 
and address the same in the project design. A proposal to examine the presence of pathogens in the 
bioslurry is under discussion, and is expected to be completed by December 2004.  From a technology 
point of view, the specific design of the standard BG reactor will be reviewed with a view to explore 
possible design changes to address the concerns on increased mosquito breeding. Based on the results of 
the study to assess the environmental and health impacts of bio slurry handling and application, measures 
will be devised to address potential concerns.  
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be 
addressed?

Results of the survey and other studies to be undertaken shall be disseminated to the public by BSP 
through consultation workshops and the documents will be placed at different locations accessible to the 
public.  
 
IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT 
APPRAISAL 
 
The task team shall ensure that an environmental review of the entire program is undertaken with a view 
to closely examine the following issues and devise measures, including appropriate design changes to 
address them.  
·
Undertake studies as recommended in the Biogas User Survey Report 
·
Examine the issue of possible increases of mosquito breeding and associated health impacts
 
·
Assess the environmental impacts from the use of bio slurry as fertilizer (impact on land and 
crops) .
 
·
Determine the level of human and cattle parasites in the bio slurry and its impact on human health 
(from handling)
 
·
Further study the decrease trend in livestock population (as reported in the survey results) to 
determine if linkages with BG program exist, assess the significance of the issue and address the 
same appropriately if warranted.  
·
Explore the various ways of enhancing the benefits of the program, especially avenues for 
participation of the poorer sections of the society in this program.     
·
Review/modify the design of the project (including the technical changes) to minimize the 
negative impacts, while maximizing the positive impacts.
