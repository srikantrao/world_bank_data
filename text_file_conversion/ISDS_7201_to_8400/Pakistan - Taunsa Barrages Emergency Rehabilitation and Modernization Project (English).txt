2. Project Objectives
The main objective of the project is to prevent the failure of the Taunsa Barrage that
provides irrigation for 2 million acres and drinking water in the rural areas of Southern
Punjab benefiting several million people. This objective would be achieved through:
(i)rehabilitating and strengthening the Taunsa Barrage and associated structures; (ii)
renovation of the electro-mechanical facilities; and (iii) improving operation and
maintenance and emergency preparedness.

3. Project Description
While the detailed project description is not yet to be finalized at appraisal, the project is
to include the following three components.
 Component 1.      Rehabilitation and Strengthening Works.
 The main works include (a) a 4,300 ft long subsidiary weir located 1,500 feet
downstream of the barrage to raise the tailwater level and ensure proper energy
dissipation at high river flows; (b) repair of the barrage floor by removal of weak
concrete and replacement with a new layer of concrete, and grouting to seal joints and fill
voids in the foundation; (c)sediment mitigation measures for the D.G Khan canal at the
right bank; and (d) installation of a safety monitoring system by placing some critical

monitoring instruments in the barrage and its foundation. The output of this component
will be a secure barrage structure with effective energy dissipation and restored design
discharge capacity, and a functional monitoring system.

 Component 2. Renovation of Gates and Appurtenances for Barrage and Canal
Headworks.
 This component involves renovation of the barrage gates and hoists and improvement in
the operating and control system including necessary O & M equipment and possibly
upgrading of flow measurement equipment at Taunsa. This component will lead to
upgrading of the operating facilities with higher level of automation and remote control.

 Component 3. Consulting Services and Implementation Support.
 This component covers: (i) consultants for feasibility study, detailed design and
construction supervision of Taunsa Barrage; (ii) consultants for detailed designs for
rehabilitation of five other barrages, namely, Jinnah, Khanki, Suleimanki, Trimmu,
Balloki and Islam; and (iii) an independent panel of experts for feasibility study, design,
safety review and construction quality enhancement. (iv) support for the Project
Management Office including equipment and the appointment of specialist in project
management, procurement and financial management.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will be located on the mainstream of the Indus River in the section of Punjab
Province. The Taunsa barrage is located 30 km downstream of Taunsa Sharif Town, in
the arid zone of southern Punjab.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project is designated a category B because (i) it supports the rehabilitation of existing
structures, and (ii) this rehabilitation is necessary to sustain the existing irrigation system,
and is therefore independent of any decision regarding possible future expansion of
irrigation.

 i) Restoration of the design conditions by rehabilitating and strengthening the existing
structures will trigger an environmental impact assessment (EIA). There will be no
significant change to the hydrological regime, so no long-term ecological or social
impacts are anticipated. The EMP covers the management of construction phase
environmental and social impacts, including site housekeeping, temporary facilities,
borrow sites, the management of sediment and water quality, and opportunities for the
expansion of local employment.

 ii) As specified in the EMP, Change Management Statements (CMSs) will be prepared
by the project entity, whenever necessary, to assess the environmental and social impacts
of changes to the construction methodology and unanticipated activities, and propose
measures to mitigate such impacts. No activities will commence within the Taunsa
Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary and Ramsar Site before a CMS acceptable to the World Bank
is approved by Punjab EPD and Wildlife Department (PWD).

 iii) Displacement of about 800 persons (157 households) at the barrage site has had to
be made due to changes in construction layout. A resettlement action plan has been
developed with consultation and participation of the communities affected and is to be
disclosed to the public prior to the start of implementation by end 2005 under the Project.

 iv) The barrage is not a water impounding structure, therefore negligible incremental
inundation damage would occur in the case of failure. However, given the severity of the
impacts that failure would cause, the task team decided to make use of the provisions of
OP 4.37 in the preparation of the project. Also OP 7.50 applies because the Indus River is
international waters. A request for waiver of notification of other riparians has been
cleared by the legal department and RVP. However, an official confirmation from the
government on their meeting the Indus Waters Treaty obligations, is being sought.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
When the construction of Taunsa Barrage subsidiary weir is completed and is
commissioned for operations, it is not likely to cause any significant noise, air or water
pollution or in any way threaten the normal control and maintenance of the upstream
game sanctuary. Nevertheless creation of a safe haven, between the existing barrage and
the new structure, will help the water biota to flourish. Also the water fall over the
structure may oxygenate the water for the aquatic life in the downstream part of the river.

Even the use of the borrow material from the vicinity upto about 6 Km of the project is
not likely to cause such changes which may be irreversible or non mitigable.

 Significant beneficial impacts are anticipated to result from project implementation. The
most important these being a major improvement in the life expectancy of Taunsa
Barrage alongwith a guaranteed and increased water flow in Muzaffargarh Canal, D.G.
Khan Canal and TP Link Canal. This in turn is expected to boost up whole range of
agricultural activity by way of increased productivity and outputs and thus raise in the life
quality of the beneficiaries. With that the capacity to avail the services like clean drinking
water, electricity, education, health and marketing will increase. And that will ease
pressure on the wild life habitat, Dolphin sanctuary and fisheries resources of riverian
tract around Taunsa Barrage.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The 'no build'option is considered inappropriate in view of the long term and wide spread
benefits of a safe and a long term Taunsa Barrage as compared to the short term and
mitigable impacts associated with the construction phase. Construction of 4346 feet long
weir 1500 feet downstream of the barrage is the best option out of 8 alternatives
analyzed.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Government of Pakistan has similar requirements for environmental assessment for
infrastructure projects and its implementing agency is familiar with the Bank safeguards
policies. For environmental and social assessment, an EIA prepared by the implementing
agency and its consultants, had been approved by the EPB and PWD. A Social &
Environmental Unit has been established in the PMO and WWF has been engaged in
undertaking the environmental baseline survey and monitoring at the project site, and a
supervision consultant team engaged for construction-related social and environmental
monotoring.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The EIA has been cleared by the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) and
Wildlife Department (PWD) of Punjab following a public hearing in August 2004, and
the EIA has been made publicly available at the office of the District Officer. The IPD
has provided alternate land to the 157 affected households whose relocation was not
anticipated at the time of environmental assessment. It has developed with the assistance
of consultants, and is in the processing of implementing a resettlement action plan (RAP),
with consultation and participation of the affected communities. Two community
committees have been elected to represent the affected people and a resettlement
grievance committee is to be formed to address the related issues and concerns of
affected people under the Project.
