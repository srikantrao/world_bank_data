C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
a. The framework for Bank support for the mining sector has four interrelated elements. (i) the 
forthcoming Programmatic Adjustment Loan  (PAL2) conditionality (ii) existing Mine Closure 
and Social Mitigation Project (MCSMP) (iii) regional development in the Jiu Valley; and (iv) 
this proposed follow on project to the MCMSP.  
The new Mine Closure and Social Mitigation 2 project is expected to focus on: (a) social 
development and job creation activities to help generate sustainable livelihoods for the 
unemployed in smaller, mono-industrial mining settlements which are most severely affected by 
past and expected future (2004) mine closures; (b) implementing key recommendations of the 
Sectoral Environmental Assessment that was completed under the first project ; and (c) 
strengthening institutional capacity for sector restructuring and to deal with more complex and 
Page  3
environmentally challenging mine closures. Several alternative development interventions are 
being considered for the social development and job creation including scaling up 
implementation of current activities in smaller mining settlements where mine closures are 
causing severe distress; adopting a comprehensive approach to regional development through 
investments in local infrastructure and social development in the mining regions, rather than 
being limited to laid off miners;  and considering the need for possible assistance for improved 
social mobility to help unemployed workers from remote, unsustainable mono-industrial 
settlements where mines are closing or have closed.   
c. The key element of sector reform is to reduce operating subsidies. The proposed project  will 
support this objective through (i) supporting employment restructuring in a socially acceptable 
manner; (ii) the identification and closure of uneconomic mines, in an environmentally 
acceptable manner;  (iii) restructuring and privatization of potentially viable mines 
d.  The main project components would be 
(i) 
Socio-economic rehabilitation  
(ii) 
Mine closure and environmental rehabilitation 
(iii) 
Institutional Development and Mining Reform 
A
specific investment loan is proposed because it provides direct linkages to disbursement of 
mine closure expenditures. A SWAP is also worth consideration given the institutional capacity 
built in the first loan for mine closure planning including environmental impacts and 
rehabilitation.  
e. Based on previous experience the indicative costs of such a project are in the order of $100m 
to $200m depending upon the complexity of mines to be closed. The current project includes 
coal, lignite, metal and sulfur mines to be closed. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be located in various mine sites around Romania. Actual location is to be 
determined based on mines to be closed and will be discussed in detail with Government during 
project preparation.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Borrower has demonstrated the institutional capacity to manage safeguard policy issues in 
the first Mine Closure and Social Mitigation Project (MCSMP). A Sector Environmental 
Assessment (SEA) was conducted under MCSMP.  Environmental Impact Assessments and 
management Plans will be needed for mines to be closed   [OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01]. No other 
safeguard policies apply.
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[X] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The project will support physical mine closure and rehabilitation activity and this 
safeguard is applicable. Environmental Management Plans for sites to be closed 
and rehabilitated are being prepared.    
Page  4
[
]
Natural Habitats
(
OP
/
BP
4.04) 
The mine closure component will rehabilitate areas already impacted by mining 
activity no new land area will be involved, therefore this safeguard is not 
considered applicable. 
[
]
Pest Management
(
OP 4.09
)
There are no pest management issues
 
and no pesticides are to be used, therefore
 
this safeguard is not considered applicable 
[
]
Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
Mines are being closed and affected communities are being supported by the 
project however no resettlement is being conducted therefore this safeguard 
policy does not apply. 
[
]
Indigenous Peoples
(
OD 4.20
)
There are no indigenous peoples affected by the project, therefore this safeguard 
policy is considered not applicable. 
[
]
Forests
(
OP
/
BP
4.36) 
The project does not impact forests since it will be implemented on land areas that 
have already been exploited, therefore  this safeguard is considered not applicable 
[
]
Safety of Dams
(
OP
/
BP
4.37) 
The list of mines to be closed under the project is to be finalized and will be 
closely evaluated to determine if any large tailing dams exist at these sites. At this 
stage there does not appear to be any large dams that would trigger this safeguard 
but this will be revisited as the actual sites are determined. 
[TBD] 
Cultural Property
(draft OP 4.11 - 
OPN 11.03
)
At present, there are not expected to be any cultural property issues that will 
trigger this safeguard policy.  However,  when the  final list of sites for closure 
had been determined, the areas will be examined with the appropriate government 
authorities to provide a definitive determination if the mines involved are near or 
will impact any areas of cultural significance. 
[
]
Projects in Disputed Areas
(
OP
/
BP
/
GP
7.60)
*
The project is not in a disputed area so this safeguard policy is not applicable. 
[
]
Projects on International Waterways
(
OP
/
BP
/
GP
7.50) 
There are not expected to be any activities affecting international waterways and 
this safeguard policy is not considered applicable. 
Environmental Assessment Category:

[X] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory): 
 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
Given the fact that one of the project objectives will be to reduce environmental risks at the mine 
sites, and that the expected interventions do not in themselves pose significant environmental 
risks (i.e. not a category A), the project has been assigned the rating of Category B. 
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. 
 
The QER is targeted for May 2004. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for mines and mine processing sites to be closed are 
expected to be completed by the end of August 2004. Each project specific EMP will include the 
following elements: (a) mitigation plan, (b) monitoring plan, (c) institutional strengthening 
requirements, (d) institutional arrangements for effective environmental management, (e) 
implementation schedule, and (f) a record of public consultations.
 
A
Poverty and Social Impacts 
Assessment (PSIA) is also being prepared and is expected in August/September 2004.
