B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of this project is to provide States with incentives to undertake essential urban 
sector reforms. These reforms affect both the functioning of real estate markets in cities and the 
framework for resource mobilization in urban areas. As a result of the measures that States 
would take in to the program, local governments would have more opportunities to improve their 
finances and capacity to provide services, and more incentives to do so. Monitoring would cover 
both the measures that States take, and the response to those measures in urban local bodies, but 
conditions for release of funds would be based on actions taken by States.  
 
The reforms taken under the project will: (i) improve the responsiveness of local real estate 
markets (ii) increase resource mobilization in local urban bodies through better cost recovery and 
improved local taxation efforts, and (iii) provide more rigorous accounting of the management of 
public funds. As part of the  preparation of the project, we will define both specific monitorable 
policy actions and expected outcomes resulting from those policy measures in those three areas.  
The TA component of the project will support the development of systems to monitor outcomes,  
studies to evaluate policy impacts, and disseminate the lessons of experience across States.

An  example of the type of indicators  to be developed  for reforming States (in the area of 
property tax )  would be: 
1)  Promulgation of improved property tax regulations in the State 
2)  Establishment of monitoring system of compliance with new regulations in local bodies 
3)  % of local bodies complying with new regulations 
 
Trends in property tax revenues and collection efficiencies in urban local bodies 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The purpose of this project is to enhance GoI’s Urban Reform Incentive Fund providing 
incentives for reform the States. This program already funds:  
1)  Performance-Based Fast Disbursing Budgetary Support to reforming States on a grant 
basis. World Bank funds would add to this budgetary assistance. 
2)  In addition, the Bank would work with GoI to: 
a. 
 Establish monitorable reform progress indicators. 
b.  Assist States in preparing reform proposals to access funding from URIF 
 
3)  Technical Assistance to MOUDPA and States 
a.  Strengthening of MOUDPA to manage policy analysis, outreach to States, 
knowledge support to State reforms, and monitoring  and evaluation of reform 
programs undertaken by the States. 
b.  Technical Assistance to participating States supporting the implementation of 
their reform programs. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project funding could be provided to any eligible state or Union Territory in India. No specific 
investments other than normal support for technical assistance are to be supported under the 
project. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
