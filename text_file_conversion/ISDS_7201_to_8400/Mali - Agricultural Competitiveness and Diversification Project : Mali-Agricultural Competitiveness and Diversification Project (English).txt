A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project aims at increasing and diversifying rural incomes and economic opportunities through 
improvements of performance of the supply chains for a range of agricultural and livestock products, for 
which Mali has strong comparative advantage. It will support the development of commercial agriculture as 
a
means to move away from subsistence agriculture, which is often synonymous to poverty for a majority 
of rural households. The project will aim at reinforcing the competitiveness of both traditional (cotton, rice) 
and non-traditional (fruit, horticulture products, oil seeds, arabic gum, cashews, etc.) agricultural crops by 
targeted investment to remove critical bottlenecks, improve productivity and efficiency and build 
organizational and institutional capacities, both private and public, along the supply chains. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project consists of the following five components: 
Component 1: Innovation and dissemination of irrigation and value adding 
technologies
.
The project will support the testing and dissemination by private sector 
providers of low-cost, simple and adapted techniques and technologies to improve the 
production, productivity, processing and marketing of selected high value agricultural 
products.   
It will include three sub-components : (a) demonstration and promotion of technological 
innovations, particularly through a matching grant mechanism; (b) dissemination of 
techniques and technologies; and (c) development of private sector capacities to provide 
equipment, inputs and advisory services through the establishment and strengthening of 
private supply chains. 
Page  2
Promotion of innovative technologies will be supported in the three following areas:
 
(i) 
use of small-scale irrigation technologies and low-cost adapted irrigation equipment; (ii)
 
intensification of cropping systems and in-the-field productivity improvements for high 
value products; and (iii) dissemination of storage, post-harvest and agro-processing 
technologies and equipment, in order to improve the quality of products, their value-
added and increase revenues for producers. 
Component 2: Improvement of agricultural supply chains
.
The component aims at reinforcing 
private sector capacities to respond to market opportunities and improve the competitiveness of 
agricultural products, both traditional and high value products, for which Mali has comparative 
advantage. This would enable the country to diversify its export base and provide farmers with 
more diverse sources of income, thus reducing their exposure to risks. Although some high 
margin products are currently produced, exports are very low compared to that of other SSA 
countries such as Ghana or Senegal. The low level of productivity can be explained by a number 
of constraints including the high transport costs, low-quality of products, insufficient 
professionalism, use of rudimentary production techniques, lack of rural infrastructure such as 
storage, processing plants, and the lack of market information. 
This component will support (i) training and institutional capacity-building (supply chain 
organization, inter-professional dialogue, etc.); (ii) provision of adapted business 
development services (market research, market information systems, private extension 
and advisory services, etc.); (iii) quality and food safety management and standards 
compliance; and (iv) market research and studies (business plan preparation, commercial 
and logistic tests, prospective surveys, etc.).   
Component 3: Access to financing
.
This component aims at
 
facilitating access to capital 
and financial services for the various private actors and operators of the agricultural 
supply chains. It also intends to induce local financial intermediaries (Banks, MFIs and 
existing guarantee funds) to increase their outreach and respond to the needs of the 
various actors in the marketing chain (producers, traders, processors, transporters etc), 
while strengthening the current agriculture credit market in Mali. The project will deliver 
resources to : (i) provide technical assistance and build the know-how and capacities in 
the financial institutions in order to improve the offer of financial services at competitive 
prices.; (ii) set up a partial guarantee fund to enable financial institutions to increase their 
operations in the sector; and (iii) address weaknesses in the range of financing 
instruments available to respond to the needs of agro-food supply chains (leasing, 
warehouse receipts, etc.).  
The component will include three sub-components: 
1. 
Technical assistance for financial institutions and reinforcement of capacities to appraise and supervise 
sub-projects and operations in the sector. The objective is to enable financial institutions to extend their 
offer of equity capital, agriculture related loans and other services, while improving their turn-over in 
this particular sector in a sustainable manner.  
2. 
Initial endowment and support to the operation of a partial guarantee fund to help financial institutions 
engage more actively in the sector by providing partial guarantee coverage. This fund will in priority 
guarantee medium terms loan for capital goods destined to farmers, agro businesses and exporters. 
3. 
Support to the creation and development of a range of financing instruments adapted to serve small 
farmers, rural entrepreneurs, agro-enterprises and agribusinesses, particularly for innovative projects in 
the chosen commodity marketing chains. 
Page  3
Component 4: Market-oriented infrastructure
.
This component will provide resources 
to carry out an investment program in basic commercial and communication 
infrastructure, in order to improve linkages to markets and reduce transaction costs. It 
will (i) facilitate the creation of collection centers, storage and processing facilities to 
support the development of agricultural supply chains and improve their competitiveness, 
and (ii) carry out an emergency feeder road rehabilitation program which is critical for 
post-harvest and marketing operations. 
This component will include two sub-components for public/collective infrastructure: 
1. 
construction of commercial infrastructure such as export facilities, cold chain, storage facilities, pack 
houses, wholesale markets, etc.; 
2. 
rehabilitation/improvement of rural roads, particularly in cotton-growing areas and to secure access to 
post-harvest, processing and commercial infrastructure built with the assistance of the project. 
Rehabilitation of feeder roads is key to improve the collection of cotton and other agricultural commodities 
and provide access to marketing infrastructure and to areas with high increase potential of agricultural 
production. Construction and maintenance of rural roads were part of the public service missions, which 
were transferred from the cotton company (CMDT) to the relevant ministries in the framework of the 
cotton sector restructuring program supported by the recent Bank’s Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC III). 
However, during this transition period, maintenance of many roads has been neglected due to lack of 
resources and adequate funding mechanisms. Rehabilitation will entail essentially the treatment of hot 
spots. 
Component 5: Project management and M&E
.
This component
 
will provide the 
resources necessary to ensure adequate project management, particularly overall 
coordination, financial management and procurement of goods and services, as well as 
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) of results.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Project activities will be undertaken in four regions (Koulikoro, Mopti, Segou and
Page  4
Sikasso), where cotton and high-value diversification crops are cultivated. The project 
will ensure that the protected areas are not affected by the new activities.  
 
Although there are culturally sensitive areas in Mali such as ancient burial sites and sacred groves, the 
proposed activities of the project will have no impact on cultural property.  Where there is a possibility that 
project activities will encroach on these areas, project activities will be diverted to ensure that these 
culturally and socially sensitive areas are avoided.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project has been rated B since there are some adverse environmental impacts from 
construction/rehabilitation and other project-related activities, such as pesticides use for 
high value crops, waste water/residues disposal and treatment for processing units, 
particularly slaughterhouses. Collaboration with the EU-funded Pesticide Initiative 
Program will be enhanced.  All these impacts have been thoroughly analyzed in the ESIA 
and addressed through the ESMP.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
No such long term impacts are anticipated.   
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N.A. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
(1) A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) has been carried out to analyze 
potential environmental and social impacts of project activities, particularly vis-
à-vis safeguards that have 
been identified as triggered.  
 
(2) Mitigation measures will be implemented by the client in order to limit those impacts.  
 
(3) As far as Pest Management is concerned, the ESIA has analyzed potential risks in 
increased use of agro-chemicals in the intensified production systems and has 
recommended to manage these impacts in the framework of the EMP implemented 
through the ongoing Ag. Services Project (PASAOP), including an IPM initiative. In 
addition, it is worth pointing out that due to importing markets requirements for fresh 
agricultural produce like horticulture products, a collaboration has been established with 
the EU-funded Pesticide Initiative Program, which aims at ensuring compliance with the 
Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) legislation.  
 
(4) A Resettlement Policy Framework that covers the areas affected by the 
construction/rehabilitation of rural roads and small warehouses has been prepared in the 
framework of a Mali Transport project and will also apply to this project. It has been 
published in the paper “L’independant”’ on December 10, 2004. 
 
(5) An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) is also being 
prepared and it will describe the process for screening, selection, clearance, 
implementation, monitoring and maintenance of sub-projects that could have 
environmental consequences but whose descriptions were not completed at the time of 
the ESIA such as the infrastructure and equipmen
t
for storage, conservation, processing 
Page  6
and commercialization.  The ESMF will be sent for clearance by the Africa Safeguards 
Enhancement team upon its completion. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Stakeholders include farmers, traders, small agro processors, service providers, input 
suppliers and exporters involved at the various levels of the selected agricultural supply 
chains.  
As far as the rural infrastructure component is concerned, support will be provided to 
local communities in the implementation of environmental and social mitigation plans, 
and the integration of the rural roads rehabilitation programs in the local/regional 
development plans 
 
The ESIA\RPF have been disclosed at the WB Info Shop and in the country.  The ESMF 
will be disclosed in the country and at the WB Info Shop after clearance from the Africa 
Safeguards Enhancement Team (ASPEN).  Radio broadcasts and newspapers 
announcements have informed the population of the availability of the Report at the 
following ministries: Economy and Finances; Agriculture; Livestock and Fisheries; 
Environment; Commerce and Industry; Promotion of Investments and Small Businesses 
and at the National Archives.
