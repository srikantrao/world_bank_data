B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The GoN has proposed that the Bank finance a Rural Telecommunication Project with the following three 
objectives: (a) Improve access to and use of telecommunications services in rural areas for rural 
communities, governments and businesses; (b) continue to strengthen TELCOR
 to ensure Nicaragua’s 
successfully transitions from a monopoly to a competitive market that will increase access to better and 
more affordable services; and, (c) reform the postal sector.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Rural Telecommunications Project would allocate US$7 million of IDA funds to the three 
components described below. Due to its characteristics and size of the proposed project, the lending 
instrument proposed is a Specific Investment Loan (SIL), the details of which will be designed by the 
project preparation team. 
 
·
Expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas.
 The proposed project 
would allocate US$6.0 million to leverage increased private sector investment in up to 
750  rural communities that currently lack telephone and/or Internet access.  The project 
would primarily use output based aid (OBA) mechanisms to help the private sector 
overcome a major barrier to investing in rural areas 
–
higher capital investment 
requirements.  These OBA mechanisms, that have been successfully used in more than a 
Page  2
dozen countries, entail convening public tenders for the private sector to provide 
telephone and/or Internet access services in targeted communities.  The OBA subsidy is 
awarded to the company(ies) that require the lowest capital investment subsidy and the 
subsidies are gradually disbursed as the company(ies) meet established service targets. 
The companies that win the tenders will not be granted exclusivity and will be 
responsible for installing, operating, and providing telephone and/or Internet access 
services for fixed period of time on a commercially-sustainable basis. 
·
Institutional Strengthening of TELCOR.
 The proposed project would allocate 
US$0.8 millio
n
to finance technical assistance to and training of TELCOR’s staff to 
support the solution of key issues that it will face as Nicaragua transitions to a completely 
liberalized Sector, including market dominance, interconnection, price regulation, 
controversies, consumer rights and complaints, accounting for costs, new trends of 
regulation and continue the strengthening of management, strategic planning, 
measurement, and organizational restructuring of TELCOR.  
·
Postal Reform.
 
The project would allocate US$0.2 million to provide technical support 
to: (a) develop a basic market study and a due diligence exercise to assess the current 
market activity of the postal sector and the current financial position of Correos de 
Nicaragua; (b) improve the postal sector legal, regulatory and institutional framework, as 
well as the universal service obligation; and, (c) define and implement how Correos will 
be transformed into a more commercially-focused and viable operation which could 
include a range of options, including a management contract, concession agreement or 
consultancy advisors.  This component  would include a postal worker re-training 
program for any displaced workers required under the reforms.  
Alternative development interventions and approaches that have been considered include: 
 
·
Technical Assistance Credit
.
This alternative was rejected because FITEL would not have enough 
funds to expand access to telecommunications services in rural areas in a timely manner. Without 
an investment credit FITEL will take 10 to 15 years to achieve what the project could obtain and 
at much higher cost due to the economies of scope and scale of telecom infrastructure. 
 
·
SIL to cover a comprehensive E-Nicaragua development strategy.
 Such a project would also fund 
E-Government, computers in schools, hospitals and clinics, and ICT regulatory reform 
components. This option was rejected because it would exceed the available IDA funds and 
would increase complexity of project management. However, other Bank-instruments, like the 
PSTAC II Project would address the beginning of a more comprehensive development strategy. 
 
There are very limited options for co-financing with other international agencies. However, the project is 
expected to have some coordination with the Bank-funded PS TAC project.
