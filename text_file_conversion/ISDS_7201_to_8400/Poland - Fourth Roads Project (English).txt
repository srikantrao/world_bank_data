B.  Project Objectives  
 
The objective of the project is to continue improving the effectiveness of Poland’s national road 
rehabilitation and maintenance systems by (i) further increasing the percentage of national roads 
in good condition, (ii) establishing reliable and stable funding for the national road maintenance 
and rehabilitation network, and (iii) improving the capacity within the Road Administration  to 
operate efficiently and effectively.  
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The preliminary total project cost is USD 190 (EUR 152) million, of which the World Bank 
would finance USD 125 million, i.e., around 65%, split as follows: (i) continuation of the 
financial support to the road maintenance and rehabilitation program (about USD160 million) - 
according to the budget framework prepared by GDDKiA for 2005. The financing scheme and 
implementation principles will be similar to the ones applied under RM&R project. The 
component may include a pilot maintenance project in a selected region, to use a three-year 
performance – based contract; and (ii) implementation of a Management Information System 
(MIS) within GDDKiA (about USD15 million) – in line with the Strategy for a Comprehensive 
Information Technology System approved by the GDDKiA in February 2004. In addition, the 
Page  2
project may include a small TA component to support GDDKiA Concessions Department in 
developing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) in the road sector. 
 
D.  Project location  
 
As a repeater project, Roads IV will provide budgetary support to the Road Administration for its 
FY2005 road maintenance and rehabilitation program. Its location is therefore spread all over 
Poland’s national road network. The works to be financed under the proposed project will be 
limited to the first nine standards defined in the Technical Annex (attached). Hence the project 
will not involve any land acquisition, since works will be carried-out within the right of way. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
An independent assessment of Borrower’s safeguards capacity was carried out during 
preparation of the RM&R project, and found satisfactory to the World Bank.  The existing 
project Operational Manual (OM) - covering the approach to consultation, expected mitigation 
measures, and monitoring and evaluation procedures – will be updated and reviewed to ensure 
that the lessons learned from the RM&R project are included.  The content of this section is  also 
based on (1) the background report and discussions held during the public workshop held in 
Poland in mid January 2004, (2) follow-up consultations and analyses in connection with the 
SWAp, and (3) the experience gained from the overall environmental management plan and site-
specific environmental assessments done for previous World Bank-financed roads projects.

It is proposed that the project maintain the same category as the RM&R project, i.e Financial 
Intermediary (FI) with Category B and C sub-projects, since the project design has the same 
SWAp approach. The recent assessment of the current RM&R project, carried-out in October 
2004, shows that the system works.

TANDARDS
 
The Polish computerized road management system (HDM-4) works on the basis of policies for each section 
whether representative or physical, sub-divided into standards and works. Each policy may contain several 
maintenance and/or improvement standards.  Nine maintenance and five improvement standards have been defined 
for the existing four road classes in Poland. These have been further subdivided depending on the thickness and type 
of material used.  The new sections or committed projects are defined separately. The table below describe the 
technical standards and objectives. 
 
The [nine] first standards are related to maintenance and rehabilitation supported by the present 
project and which does not require any land acquisition
,
whilst the following five are related to road 
improvement with significant changes in the geometry of the existing roads. 
STD 
No 
Standard 
Maintenance Objectives 
(1) Minimum 
Maintenance 
The minimum maintenance standard has been designed to reflect the current 
practice in the absence of major maintenance works. These include the following 
items 
Patching:
Repair of surface distresses such as potholing, wide structural cracking 
and ravelling. It is carried out annually.  
Crack Sealing:
This technique treats transverse thermal cracking and even wide 
structural cracking when limited in area. It is carried out annually.  
Routine Works:
Routine works include all works, which do not have any effect on 
pavement performance as modelled in HDM-4. These works include shoulder 
repairs and routine miscellaneous works such as vegetation control, road sign 
repairs and replacement, line marking, guardrail repair and replacement, etc… 
Routine works are carried out annually. An annual cost is specified for each road 
class.  
Winter Maintenance:
Winter maintenance includes all works carried out as part of 
winter maintenance such as salt spreading; snow removal, etc. An annual cost is 
specified for each road class. It applies to all roads. 
(2/3) Surface 
Treatment 
(Single or Double) 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to 
delay major intervention and renewal of the skid resistance.  
(4) Surface 
Treatment 
With Shape 
Correction 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to 
delay major intervention, improving roughness and renewal of the skid resistance.  
(5) Resurfacing 
by 
Overlay 
To renew surface characteristics including skid resistance, to improve roughness 
and to contribute towards the overall pavement strength. Overlay by surfacing 
included thickness between 30 and 50mm and were applied over a roughness 
values varying from 3 to 5 IRI and low rutting level.

STD No 
Standard 
Maintenance Objectives 
(6) Strengthening 
by Overlay 
 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to reach the critical 
stage (poor or fair roughness condition), improve roughness and renew 
surface characteristics.   Strengthening by overlay concerned the 
application of multi-layer overlays (two or three layers) varying from a 
thickness of 80 to 270 mm applied over a range of roughness values 
varying from 4 to 9 IRI.  
(7) 
Strengthening by Mill and 
Replace 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to reach the critical 
stage (poor or fair rutting condition), improve roughness and renew 
surface characteristics.    It is achieved by removing the distressed top 
asphalt layer (s) and replacing it (them) with a new (or recycled) asphalt 
of similar thickness but with better structural characteristics. This 
standard was applied over a range of rutting varying from 10 to 35 mm.  
(8) Strengthening 
by 
Reconstruction 
 
To reconstruct pavements
2
,
which have reached the failure stage (poor 
roughness condition). Reconstruction is achieved through removal of the 
old pavement structure down to the subbase course and replacing it with a 
new (or recycled) pavement structure with high strength. Pavement 
structures varied according to road class and were applied over a range of 
roughness values carrying from 8 to 11 IRI 
STD No 
Standard 
Improvement objectives 
(9) 
Widening to 7 m 
To increase the narrow roads to a minimum standard road width of 7 
metres. This standard is applicable to Main roads with 6 metre or less 
width.  
(10) 
2 Lanes addition to Single 
Carriageways 
To add two lanes to a single 2-lane carriageway (not dualisation) in order 
to increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Trunk and Main roads, which are not dual yet.  
(11) 
1 Lane addition to Dual 
Carriageways 
To add 1 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to 
increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways.  
(12) 
2 Lanes addition to Dual 
Carriageways 
To add 2 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to 
increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways. 
(13) Reconstruct 
to 
Expressway Single 
Carriageway 
To upgrade GP roads to Expressway single carriageway standard. This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity 
ratios varying from 0.5 to 1 
(14) Reconstruct 
to 
Expressway Dual 
Carriageway 
To upgrade GP roads to Expressway dual carriageway standard. This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity 
ratios varying from 0.5 to 1
