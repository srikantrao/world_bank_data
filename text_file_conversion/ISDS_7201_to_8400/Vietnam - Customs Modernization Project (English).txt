Project Objectives
 
The VCMP aims to strengthen the capacity of the Customs administration of Vietnam to ensure that it is 
able to make an efficient and effective contribution to the achievement of government objectives in respect 
to trade facilitation, revenue collection, production of foreign trade statistics, community protection, and 
national security.  The project would be a key factor in facilitating Vietnam’s accession to the WTO and 
securing the gains from greater integration into the world trading system. The VCMP project would meet 
these objectives by: (i) introducing modern customs systems and procedures based on internationally 
agreed standards and best practice; (ii) improving the organizational structure and strengthening the human, 
financial and physical resource capacity of the GDVC; and (iii) introducing appropriate information and 
communication technology to improve effectiveness, increase transparency, and lower transaction costs. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The VCMP will provide consulting services, training, technical assistance and appropriate infrastructure to 
support three key operational components, and one support component.  It will have a total cost of US$ 
81.4 million, of which US$72.2 million will be financed by IDA and US$ 9.2 million by the Government.  
The components were identified following the conduct of a diagnostic study and the preparation of a new 
Customs business model based on contemporary approaches to Customs administration.  The components 
provide a structured approach or pathway to close the gap between the current situation, as outlined in the 
diagnostic study, and the desired future state, as articulated in the new business model.  Component one 
deals with the core technical systems, and procedural aspects of the reform program, and component two 
with the necessary organizational and resource management improvements necessary to underpin the new 
systems.  Component three provides the information and communication technology (ICT) support deemed 
necessary to ac
hieve world class standards of performance in Customs administration.  Component four 
Page  2
provides the necessary technical and managerial support required to achieve effective implementation and 
long term sustainability of project objectives.  
 
Component 1: Customs Systems and Procedures (US$ 4.3 mn).
 
This component is designed to assist 
the GDVC to introduce a range of modern systems and procedures that will reduce clearance times, provide 
e
nhanced transparency and predictability for traders, reduce red tape and lower transaction costs. 
Specifically, it will support the development and implementation of: (i) a modern, transparent and 
accessible legal framework; (ii) modern procedures such as risk management and post clearance audit; and 
(iii) harmonized and simplified business processes based on international standards such as the WCO 
Revised Kyoto Convention on the Harmonization and Simplification of Customs Practices.  The 
component will also focus on improving the level of compliance through a more dynamic approach to 
Customs enforcement and by achieving enhanced cooperation with other government agencies.  Attention 
will be paid to reducing informal trade and commercial fraud through the development of an enhanced 
compliance and enforcement infrastructure based on the effective use of intelligence and improved research 
and analysis capabilities.  Another part of this component will endeavor to improve the capacity and 
performance of the Customs brokerage industry.   
 
Component 2: Organizational Restructuring and Management (US$ 25.6mn)
.
This component will 
support a rationalization of the organizational structure of Customs.  It will include a restructure at the 
headquarters, regional and branch level offices, designed to strengthen managerial control, improve 
decision making, and provide an appropriate organizational focus on a range of critically important ‘value 
added’ functions.  It will also focus on developing an enhanced human, financial, and physical resource 
management capacity within the GDVC.  This will result in the introduction of modern, merit based, 
human resource management policies and practices, and a greater capacity to identify and develop the 
necessary staff competencies to meet current and future needs. The capacity and functioning of the 
Customs Training Academy will be improved to ensure it is able to make a more effective contribution to 
the long term development of the GDVC.  The capacity of the GDVC to plan and manage its financial and 
physical resources will be enhanced through improvements in the financial accounting and budgeting 
system, including asset management and internal audit.  This component, will also provide, when 
necessary, adequate equipment and infrastructure to support critical project objectives such as 
accommodation for ICT equipment, refurbishment and adaptation of facilities to reinforce the new business 
approach, and appropriate non-intrusive detection equipment.  The component will strengthen the strategic 
planning capacity of the GDVC and its performance management and monitoring systems.  This would 
allow it to plan for future needs and to measure success in meeting client service standards..  As integrity 
and good governance are critical issues, significant attention will be given to the development, 
implementation and monitoring of a comprehensive integrity/anti corruption action plan and supporting 
administrative systems.  
 
Component 3: Information and Communication Technology (US$ 38.9mn).
 
This component is 
designed to provide the GDVC with a modern ICT environment and corresponding infrastructure and will 
include (i) the development and implementation of a comprehensive and modern Management Information 
System that will support the redesigned Customs processes, the collection of data for management, 
planning and statistics purposes, and improve access to information; (ii) the procurement of hardware and 
infrastructure development necessary to the rollout of the new system; (iii) the funding of appropriate 
telecommunications equipment and infrastructure; (iv) support for the nation-wide rollout and the training 
of customs officials at all levels; and (v) measures to improve the capacity of GDVC to manage the new 
system and ICT infrastructure. 
 
Component 4: Project Management Support (US$ 3.3 mn).
 
In addition to the above described key 
components, a fourth component has been included to provide detailed project management support to the 
Project Management Unit (PMU) and project-related coordination bodies including the Customs 
Modernization Steering Committee.  The component will ensure that adequate technical support is 
provided to the PMU during all stages of project implementation.
