B. Project Approach: GEF Supplemental for IDA Baseline Project  
The proposed GEF-funded project will, once prepared, be  blended with the IDA-funded 
Community Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP, P081368), the baseline project,  which 
has already been approved by the Board of the Bank and became effective in September 2004. 
The project will have the same beneficiaries as the CBRDP, will focus its attention on land 
management at watershed and landscape levels, and will be implemented using the same 
implementation arrangement as the base project.  The baseline project has already prepared and 
disclosed its own Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), as well as its Pest 
Management Plan (PMP) and its Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), all of which will be 
used in implementing this GEF supplemental project. 
 
C.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the project is to improve the capacity and enabling environment of 
rural local governments (communes) and village communities to plan, implement and adopt 
sustainable land and water management investments and practices at the landscape and 
watershed levels in the project areas across Mauritania. 
The global environment objective of the project is to contribute to the strategic objectives of 
GEF OP15 and OP1 by introducing sustainable land management practices at the village and 
Page  2
2
regional levels to reduce the rates of land degradation, desertification, and loss of biodiversity in 
the project areas across Mauritania. 
 
D.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project is designed to achieve its objectives through the incremental support of GEF to each 
one of the three components of the IDA-funded base CBRD project.  Three options were 
considered: separated/associated operations, blended operation and an APL.  The option of 
separated/associated operations was rejected in favor of a blended operation, because the latter 
offers better synergies with the CBRD.  When approved, although after the CBRD, the project 
will be considered blended with the CBRD, as it will be implemented by the same CBRD 
implementing agency, using the very same implementation arrangements for greater cost 
effectiveness and efficiency.  The APL option was also rejected for lack of commitment by both 
GEF and IDA.  The GEF operation, as the CBRD, is designed as Sector Investment Operation 
and both will close about the same time, given the six year duration for the CBRD and the five 
year duration for this GEF incremental operation. 
 
The project include three components: 
Component A: Capacity Building
 
($2 millions)
.
This component aims at developing local and 
regional capacity building to adapt and replicate new watershed/landscape management 
approaches and institutions.  This will be piloted in two main Mauritanian ecosystems for later 
scale up to other regions.  The component support the following activities:  
·
Development of watershed and landscape management decision support tools to assist 
communities and local government in their local development planning process, with a 
focus on the optimization of land use, natural resources conservation in general and the 
prevention of land degradation in particular, while maximizing socio-economic 
objectives.  The tools include GIS-NRM databases of watersheds and GIS-based 
indicative watershed master management plans 
(Shémas directeurs d’aménagements
). 
·
Establishment and strengthening of capacity of watershed and landscape management 
decision making institutions at both the geographical and socio-political levels, such as 
watershed/landscape stakeholders associations or committees, and micro-catchments 
community-based organizations. 
·
Strengthening the capacity of national and local research, extension services and 
producers associations to adopt a watershed/landscape management approach in 
developing and transferring sustainable land management technologies. 
·
Training village communities, rural communes, NGOs, and regional planners on how to 
develop, implement and monitor watershed and/or  landscape  management plans; 
·
Development of communication tools for sensitizing communities on land degradation 
issues (e.g., tours to witness disastrous consequences of land degradation). 
·
Review of policies, laws, regulations to identify reforms to provide adequate incentives 
(such as improved tenure security, conflict resolution systems) to rural communities for 
the sustainable management of land resources at the watershed and landscape levels. 
Component B: Local Investment Fund ($3 million)  
This component aims at supporting local 
investments proposed in the community development plans (CDP) that include the application of 
Page  3
3
new, innovative SLM technologies, at the watershed (regional or inter-village) and lower (village 
community) level.  It comprises two matching-grant funds: (i) a village community investment 
fund, which will finance demonstration and adoption of innovative and sustainable land 
management (SLM) investments at the village community level (ADC), to help communities 
bear the financial risk of testing and adopting innovative SLM technologies; and (ii) an inter-
village community investment fund, which will finance inter-village SLM investments selected 
by village communities from their micro-watershed or landscape management master plans, with 
a
focus on interventions which improve or conserve critical ecosystem functions while ensuring 
the sustainability of local livelihoods.  Contributions of communities will not exceed 5% of total 
investment.  Possible activities to be financed include: 
At the ADC level: 
·
Investment in innovative conservation agriculture (CA) technologies, such as no-
tillage/cover crops and agro-forestry, that can minimize land degradation, including 
initial investment in the production of the seeds  of cover crops; 
·
Scaled-up investments in new SLM technologies and activities developed by the GEF-
funded Desert Margin Program, such as sand trapping trees; 
·
Investment in renewable energy production techniques, such as production of natural gas 
from cattle dung, household refuses, compost pits; solar energy-based electrification to 
minimize deforestation, etc. (if assessed as feasible during preparation). 
At the inter-community level: 
·
Upstream and river bank protection investments to minimize erosion,  and sediment 
transport in the watersheds;  
·
Cattle routes, cattle wells and pasture investments; and 
·
Inter-village forest management investments. 
Component C: Project management and M&E ($1 million)
.
This component will focus on 
designing and implementing community and scientific M&E systems to monitor global and local 
environment indicators to assess their impact (desertification/land degradation, carbon 
sequestration, biodiversity, international waters, climate change) in project areas. The GEF 
component will focus on specific activities such as:  
·
Establishment of a GIS database for monitoring trends in natural resources and land 
degradation; 
·
Development of community-based and scientific monitoring  and evaluation system (with 
indicators that can be monitored by communities and scientific indicators) for land 
degradation and watershed management assessment at the local and regional levels; and 
local and global environmental impact assessment. 
E.  Project location (if known) 
Potential pilot sites for the preparatory phase (PUFF-B activities) have already been identified in 
one oasis and in one agro-salvo pastoral ecosystem (Darkled Nouadhibou and Guidimakha). 
Within these areas three potential watersheds have been identified based on the following 
criteria: (i) type and extent of degradation; (ii) zones of interventions with the IDA projects; and 
(iii) current threats to ecosystem health (see attached map in annex). The methodological 
approach developed during the preparatory pilot  phase will be applied within the CBRD 
Page  4
4
intervention area during the project implementation period. It may also be applied outside the 
CBRD intervention area where necessary and appropriate.
 
The CBRD  area where this project will be implemented covers about 1,000 village communities 
in 80 communes located in 9 regions of Mauritania already covered by the predecessor project 
(RNRMP): Hodh El Charghi, Hodh El Gharbi, Assaba, Gorgol, Guidimakha, Tagant, Adrar, 
Tiris Zemmour, Inchiri. The exact locations of the communes and villages are not known at 
present. Detail information on environment characteristics will be obtained during preparation. 
The proposed project would not impact on cultural property. Where there is a possibility that 
project activities would encroach on these areas, project activities would be diverted to ensure 
that these culturally and socially sensitive areas are avoided. 
F.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 The CBRD Central Coordinating Unit (CCU) under the Ministry of Rural Development and 
Environment (MDRE) will be responsible for the overall management of the GEF project.  It will 
coordinate activities among the various agencies and institutions to be involved in the 
implementation of the project.  The CCU has received and will continue to receive training to 
implement Bank Safeguard issues identified in the Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF), Pest Management Plan (PMP), and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) 
during preparation of the CBRD.  The CBRD has built greater awareness of safeguard issues in 
Mauritania, where all Bank Safeguard documents are now publicly discussed before publication.  
The MDRE includes Departments and Agencies dealing with Rural Environment, plant 
protection and pest management, agricultural research and extension.  These units are the target 
of capacity building by the two IDA-financed rural operations (PDIAIM and CBRD).  The GEF 
will contribute to further strengthen these departments and agencies, as well as that of the direct 
beneficiaries.  
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[x] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
Certain environmental safeguards may be triggered by the micro and meso sub-projects 
(e.g., construction of livestock wells, river protection schemes; land restoration schemes;) 
if they are not adequately screened prior to funding agreements with communities.. An 
Environmental and Social Assessment of project activities has already been carried out 
for the base project, which activities are not fundamentally different from the activities to 
be carried out under this GEF supplemental project, only the level of decision making 
will differ (inter-community, above the village). Therefore it is envisaged that the 
Environmental and Social Management  Framework (ESMF) of the base project, which 
has already been approved and disclosed  will apply. It will be disclosed again with 
specific reference to this project. 
 
[
]
Natural Habitats
(
OP
/
BP
4.04) 
Watershed and landscape management plans, and the derived local development plans 
(CDPs)  will normally ensure that natural habitats are protected, restored, or managed and 
used in a sustainable manner. Therefore Natural Habitats is not expected to be triggered 
by this project. 
 
[
x] 
Pest Management
(
OP 4.09
)
Page  5
5
Pest Management, may be triggered if the project allows for the creation of water bodies 
that would increase the number of pests and, therefore, disease such as malaria or 
bilharzias, or if the project funds herbicides for conservation agriculture (CA) practices to 
improve agricultural production.  A Pest Management Plan (PMP) was prepared, 
approved and disclosed for the base IDA project (CBRD) that will apply to the present 
GEF supplemental project as well, since the beneficiaries are the same communities. It 
will be disclosed again with specific reference to this project.
 
[x] 
Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
Involuntary Resettlement may be triggered because land management master plans may 
suggest involuntary resettlement. Land acquired for public and other project activities 
may cause individuals or community groups to lose assets, or access to assets, or 
proceeds of economic activities. To mitigate resettlement risks  a  Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) has been prepared, cleared and disclosed for  the base CBRD project. 
It will apply to this GEF supplemental project since the resettlement risks are similar  and 
concern the same rural communities. It will be disclosed again with specific reference to 
this project.
