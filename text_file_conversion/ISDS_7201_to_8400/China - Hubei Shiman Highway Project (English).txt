Page  3
 
 
the Bank’s highway strategy is to help the government meet its transport sector objectives and at the same 
time support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The project will facilitate trade, 
support China’s transition to a market economy, address the transport needs of less-developed areas, and 
help open up western provinces by increasing road capacity to meet demand for road transport and 
enhancing the efficiency of the highway sector. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project has three components: highway capacity investment (the SME), local road improvements (the 
LRIP), and institutional strengthening and road safety. These activities aim to strengthen HPCD’s capacity 
to manage the provincial highway network efficiently. The construction of SME will support the 
development and integration of western provinces, together with the LRIP it will contribute to local 
development in Hubei province and a better responsiveness of the road network to social needs, and the 
institutional and road safety activities will  improve the management efficiency of the provincial highway 
network and address negative road impacts. 
 
Highway Capacity Investment (US$383.60 million) 
 
The project will improve highway capacity in northwestern Hubei province with the construction of the 
107.3 km expressway (SME) between Shiyan in northwestern Hubei and Manchuangan in Shaanxi 
province at the border with Hubei. In Shiyan, SME will link to Xianshi Expressway, which opened for 
traffic in December 2003, thereby linking Wuhan to  the Shaanxi border. There SME will connect to an 
expressway section planned to reach Xi’an, the Shaanxi capital, and eventually Yinchuan in Ningxia 
province farther north. 
 
SME will support and integrate urban and rural economic activities in Hubei. Moreover, SME will facilitate 
interregional trade and passenger movement to and from western provinces by making shorter itineraries 
possible, thus reducing transport costs for long-distance traffic. 
 
Local Road Improvement Program (US$50 million) 
 
The LRIP aims to improve the competitiveness of the local economy and bring socioeconomic benefits to 
roadside communities by enhancing their mobility and their ability to meet their education, health, and 
other social service needs. A series of Class III and IV roads will be rehabilitated or upgraded in Shiyan 
prefecture, which is a poor, remote area in the mountainous northwest of Hubei province. That area was 
selected because of the high proportion of low-income counties in that area (GDP per capita is RMB 2,201 
[US$266] outside urbanized zones, 26 percent of the provincial average), the condition of local roads, the 
high priority the province gives to improving accessibility in this area, and the potential for leveraging the 
benefits of the SME, which will traverse this area.  
The LRIP component will have multiple phases. A series of criteria will be used for the selection of LRIP 
roads. The first phase, estimated to cost $26.14 million, has been identified: the upgrading of Baoxia–
Zhushan road (85 km) to Class III standard and the construction of the Jiangjunhe bridge over the Han 
River. Additional local road sections will be identified in subsequent phases of project implementation.  
 
Institutional strengthening, policy development and road safety (US$6.60 million) 
 
The Bank has supported a number of institutional strengthening and road management initiatives in its 
ongoing highway projects in Hubei province, and this project will build on that work. It will assist HPCD 
in adopting more efficient practices for managing the road network. The following activities will be 
undertaken: 
\01\02
Pilot study on expressway asset management
. The HPCD will pilot-test total asset 
management for an expressway. This study will cover the complete range of asset 
management issues. Recommendations will address the applicability of asset management in 
Hubei Province and identify the steps necessary to implement that approach on the entire 
HPCD road network.  
Page  4
 
 
\01\02
Capital mobilization study.
 This study will identify sources of funding and methods of road 
investment financing. 
\01\02
Study on new technologies for road maintenance.
 This study will identify and test 
technologies that offer possibilities for improving the quality of road maintenance or reducing 
its cost.
 
 
\01\02
Study on Project Group Management.
 This study will look for ways to improve efficiency of 
operations and resource utilization. 
\01\02
Training program.
 The project will finance a major training program, to meet needs identified 
during a training-needs assessment review, with the support of the Hubei Communications 
Technical College.
 
 
\01\02
Procurement of equipment.
 The project will procure equipment for (i) construction quality 
control and monitoring, (ii) operation and maintenance of the SME thereafter and the highway 
network, (iii) strengthening the institutional capacity of HPCD.  
\01\02
Highway safety management plan. 
The HPCD will prepare a safety management plan that sets 
out its road safety goals, objectives, policies, and priorities for Class I and Class II roads and 
the measures that it is taking to achieve them. 
\01\02
Safety of commercial transport operations.
 The project will address the safety of commercial 
transport operations, with a view to introduce safety criteria for transport enterprises seeking 
HPCD approval to operate freight and passenger services. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The proposed Shiman Expressway starts at the Xujiapeng interchange at the northeast of Shiyan city, 
passes near the urban area, and ends at the Manchuanguan town in Shaanxi province through a tunnel. At 
the east end, the project will connect with the Xianshi Expressway, which continues the Bank-funded 
XiaoXian Expressway. At the west end, the Shiman Expressway will connect to another expressway 
planned by Shaanxi province. The entire expressway falls within Shiyan municipality, and the alignment is 
oriented roughly northwest to southeast. The t
opography of the area is deeply rolling, with sharp peaks and 
absolute elevation varying from 200 m to 1,200 m above Yellow
 
Sea level. The differential height of the 
expressway varies from 40 m to 480 m. The expressway crosses the Hanjiang River, a major river in the 
project area.  
 
According to the environmental assessment reports, forest coverage in the project area is 22.7 percent and 
is composed of mostly mason pines and oak trees. Because of human habitation and development going 
back several generations, almost all the forest cover is tertiary in nature and does not support an active 
floral or faunal population. There is no nature reserve or forest park in the project area. Because of its hilly 
and mountainous topography, soil structure, and intense rainfall, the area is highly susceptible to erosion 
and landslides.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environment 
 
The major safeguard issues associated with the Shiman Expressway project are: (i) the selection of an 
optimal alignment, to avoid and minimize impacts on villages and communities along the alignment; (ii) 
minimization of the use of agricultural land; (iii) avoidance of cultural relic sites and unstable geological 
terrain; (iv) adequate public consultation; and (v) integration of the proposed environmental mitigation 
measures in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The environmental impact assessment report 
found that the proposed highway would not affect ecologically sensitive areas, and that its construction and 
operation would have no significant impact on the environment, provided the mitigation measures given in 
the EMP are implemented properly. The final alignment minimizes the loss of agricultural land and 
residences; minimizes the impacts and disruptions on the livelihood and day-to-day activities of the 
affected people and communities, and reduces the potential risks of landslides and erosion in the mountain 
areas. It also avoids disturbing the Quinglong Dinosaur Egg Fossil Nature Reserve Area along the 
alignment. 
 
The major environmental impacts will likely occur during the construction of the expressway and the other 
roads. Potential impacts are: increase in noise, potential increase in soil erosion, and generation of dust 
during construction and transport of materials. Lesser impacts include alteration of hydrogeological 
regimes, interference with the local people and traffic, and impacts on the local ecology and irrigation 
system. The impact of construction materials hauled in traffic (noise, dust, congestion, traffic safety, etc.) 
using the existing highways is also a potential concern. Safe disposal of excess excavated material from 
cuts and tunnels in the mountain areas will require close attention and supervision during construction. 
Traffic noise, air pollution from vehicle exhaust emission, soil erosion, and water pollution from service 
and administration areas are potential major adverse impacts during the operation period. 
 
Social 
 
Both the LRIP and SME components of the project are located in the poorer areas of the southwestern 
region of Hubei province, which borders the poor southeastern part of Shaanxi province.  
 
The LRIP is designed to contribute to reducing poverty through improvements in road sections selected on 
the basis of criteria developed to target the poorer areas of the province: poverty level of population, 
townships and villages served by the road, traffic level, feedback of local farmers, and other social 
indicators. Consequently, the project will strengthen and complement the current Government poverty 
alleviation efforts by providing more efficient and less costly means of transportation to the population in 
the poor areas. 
 
The Social Investigation and Research Institute of Beijing University has carried out a social assessment in 
the areas served by Shiman Expressway and the first phase of the LRIP and completed a social assessment 
report and a poverty alleviation appraisal report. The social assessment screened the socioeconomic 
settings, reviewed the key social development issues in the project areas, identified key stakeholders, 
facilitated community consultation through focus group discussions and interviews, and provided feedback 
on the concerns and recommendations of the community. The social assessment report indicates that local 
economic development is impeded by inconvenient transportation, lack of information, and low sale price 
of agricultural productions, among other things. The report also concludes that the project will meet urgent 
transportation demands and should increase farmers’ family income, improve the connection to outside 
markets and foster employment opportunities, reduce poverty and benefit villagers, and promote the social 
position of women and children’s education. The villagers interviewed support both the expressway and 
local road improvements.  
Page  7
 
 
 
The social assessment paid particular attention to ethnic minority communities, women, and other 
vulnerable groups to ensure that they participate in and benefit from the project. The report concludes that 
no minority community is affected by the project. Thus, a separate minority community development plan 
is not needed.  
 
Road sections under further phases of the LRIP are not yet selected. However, Social Assessments will be  
carried out to assess any adverse impacts of those projects and whether ethnic minority communities, that 
are not acculturated or economically integrated with the Han population, are affected. Whenever that is the 
case an Ethnic Minority Development Plan will be prepared, not only to mitigate adverse impacts but also 
to ensure that affected communities equitably benefit from the project investment. 
 
Shiman Expressway is expected to require the permanent acquisition of land and some structures, and thus 
will cause adverse impacts to the resettlement of affected households. The HPCD has submitted a 
resettlement action plan (RAP) for the Bank’s review, which includes a census of population according to 
gender and age criteria, an analysis of land capacities, a feasibility study for land redistribution among 
production teams and villages, alternative migration plans to mitigate adverse impacts on land acquisition, 
broad consultation regarding land-based livelihood restoration and the migration alternatives to gather the 
farmers’ feedback. 
 
The first phase of the LRIP does not involve any involuntary resettlement. In order to address possible 
resettlement issues under further phases, HPCD has developed a resettlement policy framework. 
 
At the Shiyan City end, SME will connect to the Xianshi Expressway that opened for traffic in December 
2003, and at the Manchuanguan end SME also connects to another expressway planned by Shaanxi 
province. The Bank reviewed the resettlement management of Xianshi expressway during the preparation 
of the previous Hubei Xiaoxian Highway project and found that the project has complied with domestic 
regulations and procedures on land acquisition and resettlement and on environment. With respect to the 
Shaanxi Expressway section, the Shaanxi Provincial Communication Department has informed the Bank 
that the project is being prepared in accordance with the State relevant policies and construction 
procedures, the State Land Law and State Land Management Regulations. Furthermore, the Ministry of 
Communication Department will not approve that project without an environment protection report 
approved by the State Environment Bureau. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
One of the main reasons for constructing the Shiman Expressway is to improve the effectiveness of the 
Hubei highway network in order to sustain socioeconomic development in the province and improve 
accessibility in poor areas in Hubei Province through the local roads improvement program. The major 
indirect impacts will result from an increase in tourism to the Wudang, Niutou, Sifang, and Baima 
mountains. The construction of interchanges may also lead to the potential expansion of business activities 
at the interchanges, leading to noise, dust, traffic congestion, etc. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The selection of the final expressway alignment went through a number of iterations, beginning with the 
selection of three road corridors linking Shiman to Manchuanguan. These corridors were evaluated and 
compared with each other: length of the corridor, traffic volumes, proximity to major urban and population 
centers, topography and geotechnical conditions, flooding potential, land acquisition, resettlement, social 
impacts, environmental and cultural impacts, etc. The selected corridor was chosen because of its shorter 
length, geotechnical stability in mountain terrain, lower excavation and fill requirements, absence of critical 
habitats, minimum spoil generation and disposal, ease of construction, etc. After the corridor was selected, 
two alignments were identified and the same criteria were compared, but in more detail. This comparison 
emphasized minimizing loss of agricultural land, avoiding cultural and noise-sensitive areas, bypassing

the selected alignment, several sub alignments were identified and compared. The outcome is an alignment 
with minimal environmental and social impacts, shorter length, avoidance of landslide-prone areas, 
avoidance of the Dinosaur Egg Fossils Nature Reserve Area of Qinglong Mountain, generation of 
minimum excess spoil, etc. Work is continuing to minimize spoil material further, develop an excess waste 
disposal management plan, and move farther from the Dinosaur Egg Fossil Nature Reserve Area. 
 
With respect to social issues, minimizing and mitigating the adverse impacts of Shiman Expressway on the 
resettlement of affected households have been major considerations in the selection of the alignment. The 
Bank team has requested HPCD to compare different alternatives to minimize land impacts on local 
farmers. Accordingly, the alignment could be improved. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
EMPs have been prepared for Shiman Expressway and the first-phase roads of the LRIP to: (i) avoid 
environmental and social impacts, by judicious selection of the alignment; (ii) minimize impacts where 
possible; and (iii) mitigate the impacts through either stand-alone technical measures or incorporation of 
the measures in the design, construction specifications, or contract documents. The SME EMP includes 
practical and cost-effective measures necessary to mitigate the project-related impacts by incorporating 
them in the design and by implementing them during the construction and operation phases. The EMP 
specifies the appropriate mitigation measures, environmental monitoring plans, training, institutional 
arrangements, implementation schedule, budget needs, etc. necessary to implement the mitigation measures 
and strengthen the borrower’s capacity. Major mitigation measures include: watering to prevent dust, 
installation of noise barriers, relocation of households and schools to protect against excess noise, 
implementation of safety measures during transport of materials, safe disposal and reclamation of excess 
waste materials, etc. It also includes extensive revegetation and replantation of disturbed areas and slopes. 
 
HPCD has also prepared an RAP for Shiman Expressway. The borrower has proposed two major strategies 
to address livelihood restoration and a series of poverty reduction measures to mitigate the project’s 
adverse impacts on displaced people, as follows: 
\01\02
The project will affect 99,323 m² of residential structures, constructed primarily of earth and 
wood, about 62 percent of major structures required by the project. In China, the priority of family 
plan is to improve living standard regardless of family wealth. The Bank team has suggested that 
HPCD compensate for the earth and wood structures at replacement cost and also consider several 
initiatives: (i) a form of assistance to displaced families in the poor area; (ii) a policy of 
preferential support for poor families who may not be able to build better-quality houses, e.g., 
brick and wood houses, but are eager to build them; (iii) a field survey and population consultation 
on the minimum living space per family; and (iv) protection measures for cultivated land to avoid 
using topsoil to build earth and wood houses. HPCD has increased the compensation rates for the 
replacement of earth and wood structures to exceed the replacement cost, which will benefit 60 
percent of displaced families, and will also provide supplementary cash assistance to poor families 
who may not able to construct 20 square meters of brick-and-wood house per person. HPCD has 
identified the poor families who will be supported by supplementary assistance. 
\01\02
It is the first time that HPCD offers an opportunity to eligible displaced people to use the cash 
compensation for land and resettlement to develop family-based businesses through broad 
consultation.  
 
With respect to the LRIP, first phase projects do not entail any land acquisition. However, a resettlement 
policy framework has been developed by HPCD to address the management of possible land acquisition 
under the second or further phases. First phase investments do not affect either any ethnic minority. 
Nevertheless, should the Bank safeguard on Indigenous People be triggered on a next phase road section, 
an EMDP would be prepared in accordance with the Bank guidelines. 
 
 
Page  9
 
 
The Shiman Highway project will be the fourth World Bank project to be implemented by the borrower and 
as a result, the borrower has developed ample in-house capacity to implement, supervise and monitor both 
the EMP and the RAP.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key project stakeholders are the Hubei Provincial Communication Department (HPCD), the farmers 
who may lose land and livelihoods; villagers and communities that may be displaced, divided, or impacted 
because of the alignment passing through or near their villages; and hospitals, schools, libraries and 
individual households that may be affected by the construction and operation of the proposed expressway 
and the interconnecting roads. Three rounds of public consultation have been carried out with the affected 
people and communities (December 2002 and March and August 2003), and the relevant information and 
documents were provided at the village/town hall meetings. A total of 3,279 people have been consulted, 
and the environmental assessment reports have been placed in 12 libraries of the affected areas in Shiyan 
City, Yun County, and Yunxi County. In addition, the major findings and the summary of the 
environmental assessment reports have been broadcast and published in the local and provincial 
newspapers and made available at the 
www.cnhubei.com
 and 
www.people.com.cn
. 
 
With respect to social issues, a three-part participatory approach has been undertaken. First, all affected 
households and villages have been identified through the census and social economic surveys. Project 
information has been provided to the affected villages and local governments through newspapers, posters, 
and public meetings. Second, all affected villages have participated in the preparation of village-based 
production rehabilitation plans. HPCD has established working groups of local agricultural experts, 
resettlement staff, and village representatives to discuss livelihood restoration measures. Third, Beijing 
University assessed the social impacts on displaced people through a participatory approach, focus group 
discussions on poverty reduction, and focus group discussions on women. The information dissemination 
and consultation process will continue during project implementation. A resettlement information booklet, 
indicating the detailed entitlements of each household, compensation and entitlement policies, and 
grievance procedures will be distributed to affected people before resettlement is implemented. The 
affected communities will play a key role in finalizing and implementing their livelihood restoration 
programs. Furthermore, an internal and independent monitoring process of resettlement operations has been 
designed in the RAP. Finally, the RAPs will be placed in local libraries December 28, 2003, and their 
availability will be advertised in local newspapers in February 2004.
