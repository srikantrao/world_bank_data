B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The goal of the sector-wide support is to contribute to achieving MDGs related to the health 
sector (decrease maternal and infant mortality, fight malaria, HIV/AIDS and other diseases) and 
to closely monitor these goals. The main objective is to strengthen health and social development 
systems at the decentralized level and to fine tune it to cover the underserved population. The 
project's specific objectives are (i) to increase the utilization of services for the lower quintiles of 
the population and to increase the quality of services as perceived by the users, particularly in 
rural areas, (ii) to improve efficiency and sustainability of financing, and (iii) to increase 
harmonization of financing procedures. This operation is expected to strengthen the health 
system?s capacity so as to contribute to a decrease in maternal mortality, child malnutrition and 
child mortality. By improving the coverage and quality of the health care system, the project 
should help reduce malaria mortality and contribute to supporting the implementation of 
HIV/AIDS medical components. Indicators related to the project objectives are developed below.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Government of Mali requested that donors should harmonize their procedures regarding 
support to the health sector. A group of donors, including the Dutch, the Canadians and the 
Swedes, together  with the World Bank, launched a health budget support working group to 
prepare an MoU. The group aims at providing health sector financing under a pooled financing 
mechanism and would complement any ongoing general budget support, such as the EU budget 
support. Specific attention will be paid to improving the deconcentration process and to 
implementing the decentralization of the health system as designed in the country's 
decentralization framework. Thus, the project has three components:  
 
(i) 
Support the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social Development central directorates 
in (a) developing and enforcing policies, norms and standards of services, (b) promoting 
alternative financing mechanisms, (c) ensuring monitoring and evaluation, and (d) providing 
overall leadership to each sector - Amount of US$12 million (30 %);  
 
(ii) 
Support regional and district plans of operations (in regions and cercles) in (a) providing 
effective and quality health and social services in hospitals and Reference Health Centers 
(Centres de Sante de Reference), (b) supervising decentralized community health centers and (c) 
developing public-private partnership for health education, nutrition and relevant community-
based programs - Amount of US$14 million (35%);  
 
(iii) 
Support decentralized health programs in 'communes', including human resource and 
facilities management, in (a)  developing local initiatives involving civil society in order to 
increase the demand of services, (b) in training community-based committees and (c) motivate 
service delivery staff in decentralized facilities - Amount of US$14 million (35%).  
 
The steps towards project implementation will include: (i) reviewing the sector strategy to 
refocus on increasing quality and utilization as opposed to construction of new facilities, (ii) 
further designing and implementing the health sector Mid-Term Expenditure Framework 
(MTEF) in line with the government budgetary system process and schedule, (iii) designing a 
performance-based contracting system, including the development of the decentralized health 
system, building a better public-private partnerships (within line ministries and between those 
ministries and locally decentralized bodies) and expending public-partnerships with the private 
health care sector, (iv) establishing baseline performance indicators and designing a coherent 
monitoring and evaluation system at both decentralized and deconcentrated levels of the health 
and social development systems, and (v) undertaking study trips to learn from other countries 
with relevant experiences in SWAP.  
 
Support to the Health and Social Development sectors  would pursue the following principles:  
 
(i) 
Financing would be provided based on an agreed annual plan of action with central and 
decentralized levels; local authorities will be provided with resources to implement and monitor 
service provision at the peripheral level;  
 
(ii) 
Financing would be divided into unconditional (fixed) portion and variable portion. The 
variable portion would be adjusted yearly, depending on past performance at each level of the 
Page  3
system. The details would be consigned into performance-based contracts with central and 
decentralized levels. The overall system should aim at encouraging best performers; and  
 
(iii) 
Performance will be measured according to how well the (deconcentrated and 
decentralized) system is contributing to improve access, quality and coverage of health care 
services linked to the MDGs and, possibly, how well management capacity is reinforced.  
 
Proposed sector support indicators will include:  
 
i)To increase utilization and quality of services  
 
Service utilization by quintiles of the population :  
 
-
%
of
women achieving 3 ANCs per pregnancy  
 
-
%
of
births assisted by skilled personnel  
 
-
%
of
children under one year of age completely immunized  
 
-
%
of
pregnant women using preventive measures against malaria  
 
-
%
increase of modern contraceptive prevalence  
 
Quality of services :  
 
-
Health service users' satisfaction index for different levels of services  
 
(qualitative and quantitative survey)  
 
-
%
of
health facilities complying with technical norms and standards in curative and preventive 
treatment.  
 
Motivation of health professionals :  
 
-
%
of
personnel locally recruited and paid by decentralized bodies.  
 
-
%
of
personnel satisfied by their job position in decentralized facilities.  
 
ii) To develop efficiency and sustainability of financing  
 
-
%
of
government spending in Health and in Social Development  
 
-
%
of
budget spent in peripheral district and commune services provision  
 
-
Ratio of government spending in recurrent costs (soft) for priority programs (immunization, 
reproductive health, malaria, essential drugs and consumables, etc.) versus capital funding;  
 
-
%
of
people who are covered by a medical insurance scheme (by income quintile)  
 
-
%
of
decline of 'out of pocket expenditures' especially  in peripheral districts (or among poorer 
quintiles)  
 
iii) To increase harmonization of financing procedures:  
 
-
%
of
pooled donor funding versus total donor funding at each level of the two systems (health 
and social development).  
 
The Mali health sector SWAP is a transition phase to a fully effective PRSC expected to be on 
the table by 2008. This SWAP will allow the health and Social Development sectors to 
strengthen their management capacity as well as their ability to integrate the decentralization 
process in Mali. The MTEF should become a routine tool for effective resource planning, 
allocation, and management that focuses on results.  
Page  4
(c) Coordination, monitoring and evaluation.  
 
The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Development pooled-fund will be managed 
by their respective DAF, and the same mechanism will be used. Harmonization will be achieved 
through donors' common reporting formats and timing of reporting, common performance 
indicators at different levels of the health system, joint reviews and use of national (common) 
procedures and norms.  
 
Data to monitor and evaluate the sector program will come from yearly Public Expenditures 
Tracking Surveys (to be financed through the project), National Health Accounts (one is 
currently financed by MOH and donors, including the Bank), specific surveys by local 
consultants as well as data from the health information system. The department of Public Health 
in the Medical School of Bamako is expected to play a major role in the monitoring and 
evaluation of the sector program.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project will have a national coverage with implementation of activities at the central and  
decentralized levels (regional, district and community levels).   Activities will be proposed and 
approved through annual work programs.   Therefore, the exact location of project 
implementation will not be determined in advance, but only at the time of the yearly review of 
the proposed annual work programs.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
A
Medical Waste Management Plan was prepared for the ongoing Bank-financed HIV/AIDS 
(MAP) project.  It is expected that the MWMP will be revised and adapated to cover the needs of 
this project.  The National Health Directorate of the MOH has staff responsible for the 
implementation and follow-up of the MWMP, but it is estimated that the current capacity still 
needs to be reinforced.
