B.  Project Objectives 
 
The goal of the project is to assis
t
the Government’s ability to conduct public administration 
reforms on an ongoing, sustainable basis by establishing the institutional infrastructure and 
capacity to oversee this process.  The project also seeks to facilitate the successful completion of 
a
number of critical reforms in areas ranging from policy coordination to improved human 
resource management.  The target group is, in the first stage, public servants and policy makers, 
who will be better able to perform their tasks more efficiently and quickly, and in the second 
instance, the public, who will benefit from improved government services as a result of the 
effective implementation of public sector reform. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
Consistent with the proposed areas of Public Sector Reform highlighted by the White Paper, the 
proposed project will build capacity by hiring staff, provide training and equipment to support 
reform in four main areas of activity. These are (i) policy coordination and decisionmaking; (ii) 
performance monitoring and evaluation; (iii) streamlining and rationalizing government 
institutions; and (iv) management of financial and human resources. The nature of each activity 
and the loan’s proposed input is described below:
