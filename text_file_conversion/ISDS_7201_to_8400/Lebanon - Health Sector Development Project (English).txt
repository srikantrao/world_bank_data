Project Objectives 
 
There are four proposed development objectives for the considered project: 
 
·
Promote the development of critical tools to achieve significant health finance reforms 
·
Support the rationalization of drug registration, pricing and utilization practices 
·
Strengthen the capacity of the primary health care system to service the poor 
·
Improve the overall quality of health services particularly primary health care services
 
C.  Project Description  
 
There are four general components being currently considered for the proposed project. Some 
components will build on earlier work (e.g. hospital-base improvements in health care quality 
and accreditation)
 
while others will explore new health policy development areas (e.g. 
pharmaceutical reform). These components will include health management information 
activities and will overlap in ways to achieve the four aforementioned objectives. They have all 
been discussed with the GOL during a recent identification mission in June, 2004.  
 
The four components are as follows:-  
 
·
Health Financing Reforms:  
This component will focus on various activities designed to 
improve various aspects of the current health financing arrangements in Lebanon. These 
activities include (i) identifying and helping to implement specific options to integrate 
Page  2
information, operational and regulatory processes across the various public health insurance 
funds; (ii) assisting in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the new 
DRG system within the MOH (possibly transferring the system to the other public funds); 
(iii) updating and institutionalizing national health accounts (NHA) to better track health 
expenditure flows from source of financing to end users of financing; (iv) assisting in the 
development of means-testing methods for indigent health care coverage provided by the 
MOH.
 
·
Pharmaceutical Reform:
 - This component will concentrate on  policy measures designed 
to promote the rationalization of drug registration, pricing and utilization practices by all 
concerned stakeholders (i.e. government, importers, pharmacists, physicians and patients). 
These measures may include critical human resource training in pharmaceutical regulations; 
proposing new drug registration methods ( e.g. separating drug registration from price-setting 
-- by modifying the country of origin rule); introducing new drug pricing methods (e.g. 
altering the fixed percentage mark-ups given to drug wholesalers and retailers); promoting 
consumer and stakeholder acceptance of generic substitution through continuous provider 
and patient education; promoting better prescription and dispensing practices in line with 
standardized treatment guidelines. 
 
·
Public Health & Primary Health Care (PHC):
 - This component will focus on increasing 
the overall quality and capacity (managing a larger volume and range of basic health 
services) of primary health care services in the public and private sectors.  It will also seek to 
strengthen the referral system t
o
more specialized care services (i.e. to reinforce the “gate-
keeping” mechanism).  Five types of broad interventions are currently envisaged:   i) 
Improving MOH capacity to fulfill several critical public health functions (i.e. disease 
surveillance);  ii)improving the service delivery capacity of PHC facilities serving poorer 
sub-populations by demonstrating the positive impact of new managerial and provider 
payment reforms;  iii) assisting the MOH in expanding, monitoring and regulating its 
network of contracted private PHC providers iv) developing quality improvement guidelines 
and processes for PHC providers; and v) enhancing the academic training, continuous 
medical education, professional status and financial rewards of primary health care 
practitioners in the country.
 
·
Quality Improvement and Accreditation Programs:
 -
 
This component will work to 
develop an overall quality improvement approach for Lebanon involving a number of 
concrete “applications” within the areas of primary health care and pharmaceutical reform. 
This approach will include the following activities:  i) developing standardized clinical 
practice guidelines (and methods to continually update them) for critical health care services 
particularly in relation to select priority health interventions;  ii)  introducing quality 
improvement topics into continuous medical, nursing and technical education programs;  iii) 
introducing rational drug utilization practices among physicians and pharmacists (RDU) and 
linking it to quality improvement processes;  iv)  enhancing the existing accreditation system 
by moving from basic and “process” oriented accreditation standards to ones based on 
clinical outcome information and beginning a new accreditation system for primary health 
care facilities;  v) institutionalizing, financially and administratively, the survey work 
necessary for the preparation of health care accreditation audit reports;  vi) improving the 
current GIS-based health mapping system (Carte Sanitaire) to better monitor the quality of 
health care technology acquisition and critical clinical outcomes across the country.

Comments
:
Although I agree that overall the project is EA category C, I would like to strongly recommend 
the TTL to consider the issue of medical waste management as part of the quality improvement component.  
Our Department (Allan Rotman) has been conducting recently a nice piece on MWM you could draw from.

Comments:    Medical waste management activities could be incorporated into the quality improvement and/or 
PHC upgrading components of the project.  Akiko Maeda.
