B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The purpose of this Project is to: 
(a) strengthen Iraq’s environmental protection framework and 
management capabilities, (b) contribute to environmental improvements through the financing of 
pollution abatement activities at the local level.
 
The development objective stated above corresponds to the two following targeted outcomes; 
A)
 
The 
overall environmental management capacity of Iraq is improved through the strengthening of the 
institutional, legal and technical framework with regards to environmental protection
;
B)
 
The 
environmental conditions in a number of local hot-spots are improved through the financing of emergency 
environmental recovery sub-projects to be initiated and implemented locally
.
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Institutional, Legal and Technical Component
 (estimated cost ~ 
US$ 10 million
)
will consist of the 
following five sub-components. 
—
Result/Output 1.1 "Policy making and strategic planning capabilities are in place" 
—
Result/Output 1.2 "An improved institutional and legal framework is effective" 
—
Result/Output 1.3 "An effective air-quality and water-quality monitoring system is put in place" 
—
Result/Output 1.4 “Key “hotspot” ecosystems and habitats identified, mapped and appropriate 
management framework options explored” 
—
Result/Output 1.5 "A results-based Monitoring and Evaluation system is in place" 
—
Result/Output 1.6 "A hazardous waste management system is designed"

The
 
Environmental Improvement Component
 (estimated cost ~ 
US$ 15 million
)
will consist of the 
identification and implementation of environmental investments at the local level. It will provide a 
financing mechanism, managed by the Ministry of Environment, which will finance environmental 
improvement projects at the local level on the basis of appropriate consultation with local stakeholders 
such as municipalities, traditional social structures, NGOs and Industrial companies and will include air 
quality improvement; solid waste management collection, industrial sites clean up and pollution 
abatement measures and natural resources protection.  This component will include developing a 
participatory process to involve the local councils and NGOs in environmental functions, such as 
monitoring and evaluation, public participation in EIA, developing economic and financial instruments 
with a view to introduce them at the provincial or national scale after completion of the proposed project. 
Moreover, the project will ensure that sub-projects satisfy a set of eligibility requirements for the 
investment component, in particular a certain level of cost sharing as well as a minimum level of 
implementation capacity. This component will consist of the following three main sub-components:  
—
Result/Output 2.1 "Community-based environmental improvement projects (that target pollution 
and ecosystem degradation issues affecting the population health and livelihood) are 
implemented" 
—
Result/Output 2.2 "Pollution abatement projects with the industrial sector are implemented on a 
cost-sharing basis" 
—
Result/Output 2.3 "Communication and awareness campaigns are carried out" 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
At this point, the project will be implemented essentially in Baghdad for the first component and 
in places to be identified during project preparation in various governorates on the basis of 
eligibility criteria to be defined also during project preparation. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
A
Ministry of Environment was set up right after the fall of the previous regime. The capacity is 
still weak and the project intends to take proper steps to build up and strengthen this capacity. 
This project will follow the safeguards procedures set forth in the Environmental and Social 
Safeguards Assessment Framework that was
 developed by the Bank on an ad’hoc basis for the 
emergency reconstruction projects in Iraq in order to ensure compliance with the World Bank 
Safeguards Policies, in particular with the environment assessment policy (O.P. 4.01). The 
identification of community-based sub-projects under the second component will include 
appropriate environmental and social screening.
