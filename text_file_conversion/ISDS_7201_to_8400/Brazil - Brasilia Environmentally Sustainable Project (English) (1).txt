B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
To ensure quality water resources to meet the growing needs of the Federal District and the 
Brasília Metropolitan Region, through environmental planning and management activities 
implemented at the regional level, integrated with poverty reduction interventions and 
environmental rehabilitation in the most critical watersheds.
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Total project cost is estimated at US$ 115 million. A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of US$57.5 
million is proposed. The FD proposed project has two complementary axes: (i) regional 
development policies, regulation and planning, including enhancing institutional capacity; and 
(ii) targeted interventions focusing on poverty alleviation associated with rehabilitating, restoring 
and protecting strategic environmentally sensitive areas. Targeted interventions focus on two 
river basins: (i) 
Descoberto
,
which produces 60 % of the water supplied to the FD and (ii) 
Lago 
Paranoá
,
a
landmark reservoir with recreational value and climate control attributes. The main 
pollution source of the Descoberto reservoir is the 
Aguas Lindas 
 poor settlement, located in 
Goiás but draining into the FD territory.  
Vila Estrutural
 and the 
Joquei Clube 
dumpsite (serving 
Page  2
the entire FD population) put pressure on the contiguous National Park of Brasília, created to 
protect the “Cerrado” Biome, as well as many springs that feed into the 
Lago Paranoá
.
These 
low income settlements have unsatisfactory water supply services and inexistent sanitation 
resulting in a high negative impact on the 
Descoberto
 and 
Lago Paranoá
.
These services would 
be provided by under the project through the DF water utility, in
 association with the Goiás 
water utility. An institutional arrangement has already been set with the Municipality of 
Águas 
Lindas
.
Component 1- Policy and institutional development
:
The component would: (i) support regional 
development and improve technical and legal tools for effectively implementing regionally 
integrated management; (ii) strengthen WRM management capacities; (iii) enhance 
environmental management capacity through improvements in institutional arrangements and 
technical tools at the regional level, and (iv) promote institutional development in key FD 
agencies such as BELACAP, which manages the city solid waste collection and disposal, 
SEDUH, responsible for the territory planning, and SEMARH, charged with natural resources 
management. Institution building activities would include modernization of information and 
administrative systems to include regional integration duties, training; introduction of new 
organizational schemes for regional planning and management activities and coordination
.
Component 2 - Social inclusion and poverty reduction: 
This component directly addresses 
poverty, urban services and environmental quality issues in unregulated settlements. Urban 
development, services and works will be designed and implemented in 
Vila Estrutural
,
with the 
active participation of community members in the decision-making and implementation process. 
Focused poverty reduction interventions include employment and income generation specially to 
the population involved with scavenging activities in the 
Joquei Clube 
open waste dumpsite. 
Development of entrepreneurial capacities in recycling and small business will be supported. 
Component 3 - Water resource management and protection
:
This component would (i) provide 
access to improved water and sanitation services to 
Aguas Lindas
;
(ii) phase out and remediate  
the 
Joquei Clube
 solid waste dumpsite; (iii) implement a 25-year solid waste management 
program for Brasília, including construction of sanitary landfill facilities and (iv) finance 
environmental conservation subprojects in key watersheds to recover degraded areas. Other 
activities include modeling of private-public partnerships and microenterprise development for 
waste recycling activities. 
 
Component 4 - Project management, Monitoring and Evaluation
:
Project management, 
monitoring and evaluation would focus on the establishment of the project management unit and 
corresponding planning and management support systems, including administrative, financial, 
procurement, reporting and monitoring systems needed for successful project implementation. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Brazil, Federal District of Brasília. The institutional actions are intended to apply to the entire 
territory of the Federal District, while the physical improvements target only two critical river 
basins within the Federal District. A small area of one of these river basins extends to the 
territory of the state of Goiás.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Federal District of Brasilia invests an average of US$ 100 million per year with own 
resources and external financing. To execute these investments, the FD have been complying 
with the national and international safeguards, mainly regarding the environmental and 
resettlement safeguards.
