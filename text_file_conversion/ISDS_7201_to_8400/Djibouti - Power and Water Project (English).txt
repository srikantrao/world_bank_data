B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project development objectives are to (i) increase the efficiency and reliability of power and water services in 
urban areas at affordable cost to the population; and (ii) protect Djibouti’s natural resources in an effort to avoid 
further depletion and avoid future service delivery at a much higher cost. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Proposed Components 
 
The proposed project includes four main components:  two in the power sector, one in the water sector and a 
combined component focusing on the institutional restructuring of the power and water utilities and policy 
framework.   
 
The power sector-related components cover:  (i) investments in the distribution network in Djibouti Ville to improve 
critically needed services in the commercial district and extension of services to currently unserved residential 
consumers; (ii) the construction of a 2 MWe wind-farm in Ali-Sabieh aimed to serve the towns of Ali-Sabieh and 
Dikhil where wind measurements undertaken have proven promising and growth is expected to be particularly 
strong due to the establishment of new industry.  This would be the first wind-farm in Djibouti and as such is a very 
important component to demonstrate the operational and commercial viability of alternative power production.  The 
amount of land required for the wind-farm and the status of the land currently identified will be determined by the 
feasibility study which will help determine whether or not social safeguards will be triggered.  Funds will also be 
allocated to the undertaking of a study aimed at formulating a power supply strategy for the Obock area which is 
currently underserved and whose population is particularly vulnerable due to the devastation of civil war, continuing 
ethnic tensions and poverty. 
 
The water component will focus on initiating protective measures of the aquifer that serves 70% of Djibouti’s 
population through a study to complete the knowledge of the aquifer extension and yield in order to optimize the 
future extractions while protecting it from the risks of seawater intrusion and acute and ongoing pollution that could 
force the extraction to be curtailed.  The urgent need to protect the  aquifer can not be underestimated given that, 
desalination, the long-term option that Djibouti eventually may have to turn to is likely to cost around 3 times as 
Page  2
 
 
much as current cost of production.  The longer Djibouti can hold off development of desalination the better, or at 
least be able to minimize the share of desalinated water in its water supply strategy.   
 
The fourth component will focus on the institutional restructuring of the power and water utilities 
and the associated legal and regulatory framework.  An options study financed by PPIAF is 
about to start which will identify options for the Government of Djibouti to consider.  The study 
will review private sector participation options ranging from privatization, concessions, Output-
Based-Aid (OBA) and management contracts.  The study will review in detail the potential 
advantages of a merger of the power and water companies to take advantage of synergies 
between the two services, particularly given that such a large share of the water company’s cost 
are related to electricity and the ability of the power company to enforce stronger collection 
measures through disconnections.  The project will implement the selected option which will 
include selection and contract award with the private sector and the formulation of a legal and 
regulatory framework which will include the drafting of laws and an action plan for the 
establishment of a regulatory agency, possibly multi-sectoral.  In selecting a restructuring option, 
aspects related to how the poor can better access electricity will be taken into account. 
 
PPF 
 
The Government has requested that US$0.5 million be advanced to a Project Preparation Facility 
to undertake consulting services and contribute to establishing the PMU.  This request is 
currently being processed and the studies will be launched in the early summer and ready in final 
draft forms in time for the pre-appraisal mission scheduled for November 2004.   
 
 
Implementation Arrangements: 
 
A Project Management Unit is in the process of being established in the office of the Prime 
Minister, reporting to the Director of the Prime Minister’s office.  The Project Manager, who 
also is the Energy Sector Coordinator, has been appointed and agreement has been reached that 
the unit will be strengthened with a water sector specialist, an accountant and an assistant by 
mid-May 2004.  Part of the proceeds of the PPF will be used to procure office equipment for the 
PMU.  In the case of the water component, the Centre d’Etudes et de Recherches de Djibouti 
(CERD) will play the role of scientific advisor and link to the existing knowledge of the aquifer. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project has two locations:  Djibouti Ville and Ali-Sabieh.  The electricity distribution 
network component will be implemented in Djibouti Ville and will most likely comprise 
rehabilitation of existing lines and possibly extension of new lines.  In Ali-Sabieh, the proposed 
component comprises the erection of a 2 MWe wind-farm to be interconnected through a 2 
kilometer transmission line and substation to the existing electricity network.  The location of the 
proposed wind-farm is in deserted area with little alternative use.  
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The borrower in terms of the Government of Djibouti has experience with the Bank’s safeguard 
policies, however the sectors involved in this project (energy and water) have very limited 
knowledge about the Bank’s safeguard policies.  O.P 4.01 has been made available to the project 
Page  3
 
 
coordinator and ToR for the EIA are currently being drafted by the client under the Bank’s 
overall guidance.  The preparation missions prior to pre-appraisal will dedicate significant time 
to discuss the Bank’s safeguard policies and to ensure that they are fully understood.
