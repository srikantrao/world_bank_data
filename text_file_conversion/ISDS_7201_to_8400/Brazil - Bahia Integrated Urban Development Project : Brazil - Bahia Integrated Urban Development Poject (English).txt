2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to reduce urban poverty in a sustainable manner, 
targeting the poorest and most vulnerable sections of Salvador and strategic cities of the 
state of Bahia with access to basic services and improved housing and social support 
services. Specific objectives are: (i) improved quality of life and asset base for the poor 
through the provision of basic infrastructure services, improvement of housing conditions 
and access to urban land, and regularization of land tenure and buildings in slums and 
unplanned settlements; (ii) improved access to social programs in the areas of income and 
employment generation, direct support to families survival strategies (e.g. through better 
and easier to access daycare facilities), health care, education and job training, and 
initiatives in the area of community security at the local settlement level; and (iii) 
enhanced state and local government capacity to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate 
integrated urban poverty reduction strategies involving several different departments, 
undertake urban upgrading and land delivery, coordinate social policy on the ground 
through participatory planning, and monitor and evaluate government programs through 
poverty and quality of life indicators.

3. Project Description 
The proposed Project consists of three major components, as follows:  
 
A
-
Urban Infrastructure Delivery (65%):  This component will finance priority 
infrastructure investments focused on poor communities. Financing under this component 
will: (a) help provide basic services to the poor including urban drainage, roads, street 
paving, water supply and sewage, solid waste management, housing replacement etc. and 
(b)  macro-level infrastructure investments that would be necessary to integrate upgraded 
settlements into the urban fabric.  
 
B
-
Social Services Delivery (25%): This component will finance social investments like 
strengthening of local community based organizations (CBOs), income strengthening 
through training etc. and the needed facilities such as day-care and basic health care units 
that will complement the investments in community infrastructure.  
 
C
-
Institutional Strengthening, Studies and Project Management (10%): This 
component would finance (i) a variety of capacity building activities for participating 
municipalities, giving them tools that will enable them to better manage and plan the 
process of urban poverty reduction projects, (ii) a variety of studies that will be necessary 
to underpin Project implementation and (iii) project management, including monitoring 
and evaluation.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The eight strategic cities that would be involved in the proposed Project, out of  40 
strategic municipalities in the State of Bahia, to be covered by this Project, are Salvador, 
Barreiras, Brumado, Feira de Santana, Ilheus, Itabuna, Juazeiro and Teixeira de Freitas.  
They were chosen from among the 40 according to their importance as urban centers, 
population, economic significance and strategic location on transport routes.  In these 
cities, studies using census data and GIS applications led to the identification and 
preparation of socio-economic profiles of poor and vulnerable sections.  Adjoining areas 
thus identified have been grouped together in physical intervention areas (PIF) and social 
intervention areas (PIS).  Such intervention areas not only gather adjoining informal 
settlement areas with similar characteristics, but also comprise physical planning and 
intervention units.  This makes it easier to plan the infrastructure components of the 
intervention, identifying and articulating trunk infrastructure needs and local-level 
infrastructure needs, which is done by relating the intervention areas to river basins or 
sub-basins. This will help the project to conform to, and support the implementation of, 
the states integrated water resources management plan and municipal and state 
government plans for water supply, sanitation and urban drainage.  In the case of 
Salvador, trunk infrastructure needs in the case of water and sanitation have been largely 
dealt with by the Bahia Azul sanitation program, but there are major deficiencies in the 
other cities.  Trunk infrastructure needs and linkages to water resources management, 
sewage and drainage were identified for sample areas in Salvador and Ilheus as part of 
project preparation.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The potential environmental impacts are associated with provision of water supply and 
sanitation, urban drainage, street paving, solid waste collection and disposal, stabilization 
of slopes and embankments, parks and recreation areas and other basic amenities and 
services at the community level.  Most of the impacts identified are positive in nature 
such as reduced risk from landslides and cave-ins, better water quality, reduced exposure 
to sewage, reduction in dust, better solid waste disposal, etc.  The few adverse impacts 
identified relate mainly to the implementation phase such as dust, noise and vibration 
from construction activities, disposal of debris, temporary disruptions in traffic and 
service delivery and possible safety risks.  All these risks are addressed by the 
Environmental Guidelines that have been developed from existing borrower guidelines 
for this Project.  No long-term adverse environmental impacts are likely. As indicated in 
the Environmental Assessment Report, the Bahia State Environmental Agency (CAR) 
requires that CONDER form an environmental group within the agency to oversee 
environmental issues. This unit is called CGTA (Technical Working Group on 
Environment).  This institutional innovation will provide an ideal device for screening 
subprojects and supervising their implementation from the environmental and social 
perspectives.  CAR also has a commitment to train members of the CGTA in 
environmental analysis. The Project intervention triggers OP 4.12, the Resettlement 
Policy.  Slum upgrading involves limited involuntary resettlement due to the need to 
relocate families occupying high-risk areas such as unstable slopes and flood-prone areas.  
Limited involuntary resettlement may also be needed to improve the road network or 
establish rights-of-way for infrastructure networks, waste collection, etc.  In the proposed 
Project, individual subprojects will be designed to minimize resettlement.  The executing 
agency, CONDER, has experience in minimizing resettlement in slum upgrading projects 
and finding relocation solutions for displaced families in nearby areas, in line with Bank 
policy.  A Resettlement Framework for yet unplanned subprojects was prepared for this 
Project in accordance with OP/BP 4.12.  A Resettlement Action Plan was prepared for 
the Alagados VI subproject in Salvador and a few other smaller interventions that are 
planned for Year I of the Project.  The Resettlement Framework is based on the 
Page  4
minimization of resettlement and, where absolutely unavoidable, offering choices to 
persons subject to relocation.  The framework adopted involves offering either new 
housing or cash compensation to families facing relocation.  Cash compensation would 
be based on a table of values corresponding to the estimated replacement value of the 
assets lost plus an additional compensation  inversely related to total estimated asset 
value per family.  This provides an additional boost to the poorest families, offsetting to 
some extent the vulnerability of families facing relocation. There is also a minimum 
compensation value for families with very low assets that would allow them to minimally 
acquire a new home in a legal neighborhood.  The other major alternative would be 
relocation to housing projects located very close to the neighborhoods from which people 
are relocated (usually less than 1000 meters) and equipped with all basic urban services.  
The quality of the planned new housing is very good, and far better than most of the 
housing it replaces, but not extravagantly so. Social support before, during and after 
resettlement will be offered to help people adjust to new conditions and to maintain and 
even expand their dwellings.  The Project may also trigger OPN 11.3 (Cultural Property) 
with regard to certain sites that are considered sacred by one or more of Bahias many 
religious groups, especially the Candomble (Afro-Brazilian) religion which holds sacred 
the Sao Bartolomeu Park in Salvador, Bahia where several Orixas (Gods) reside.  The 
Project would involve close consultation with community members and Candomble 
leaders to assure that sites considered sacred are not disturbed in such a way as to offend 
members of the religion.  At the same time, the Park would receive physical 
improvements and security enhancements to make it more user friendly. However, a 
lengthy process of public consultation and environmental licensing is envisaged before 
the Management Plan can be approved, and thus the implementation of the proposed 
improvements will take place at a later date and will not be financed by the Project.The 
Project will also trigger OP/BP 4.04 (Conservation of Natural Habitats) in some limited 
cases, in which interventions will take place in settlements located in slopes or along 
water courses, which in many cases are protected areas under the law. Project 
interventions will generate positive environmental impacts in such areas. The EMP sets 
forth procedures for such cases.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No such impacts have been identified other than the likely requirement that residents will 
be expected to pay water and other tariffs for services provided.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Alternatives to the Project design could include significant displacement of populations 
to distant locations to completely rebuild neighborhoods.  These alternatives were not 
considered viable for social, economic and financial reasons.  The Project was designed 
to preserve the social cohesion of existing communities and to assure access to urban 
services, transport and employment by the affected people.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
In addition to a thorough environmental analysis, the first-year subprojects have been 
carefully prepared with extensive participation by community groups including 
discussion of the Project design.  All subprojects will be licensed by the Bahia State 
Environmental Agency (CRA) and will be subject to post-licensing inspection.  CRA also 
requires public hearings to be held for all subprojects prior to licensing.  The 
implementing agency, CONDER, will build environmental management requirements 
into all contracts under the project and will enforce such contracts rigorously.  The 
Project will help strengthen the capacity of CONDERs internal CTGA, or Technical 
Environmental Management Center, which will be delegated some environmental 
licensing responsibilities by CRA under the latters supervision. The highly participatory 
approach and the inclusion of significant social investments in such activities as day-care, 
housing improvements, community health activities, job training, etc. provide additional 
assurance that there will be ongoing involvement of the affected communities which is, 
perhaps, the best assurance that environmental issues will be managed carefully, since 
communities will exercise social control over the outcomes.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders can be categorized as follows:  
 
.
Direct Beneficiaries: local residents in physical intervention areas (PIF) or social 
intervention areas (PIS) subject to Project intervention;  
 
.
Indirect Beneficiaries: residents outside Project areas who benefit from trunk 
infrastructure;  
 
.
Implementing Agency and State and Local Agencies;  
 
.
Contractors;  
 
.
Social Service Providers and Community Leaders CONDER has developed a 
methodology for interventions in poor urban neighborhoods that involves close 
communication with local residents over long periods of time during preparation, 
implementation and post-implementation periods;  
 
.
CONDER may be unique among Brazilian urban development agencies for its 
linking of social development activities with infrastructure development;  
 
.
As mentioned above, in addition to the intensive periods of participatory design and 
preparation, the State Environmental agency also requires public hearings prior to 
licensing any public work of the sort supported by this project.
