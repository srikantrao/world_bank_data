A,2. Project Objectives
The proposed supplemental credit would enable the Government to meet project development objectives
through increasing the use and effective coverage of primary health care services and referral centers,
particularly those affected by the war, and developing further institutional objectives aimed at increasing
Government's capacity to meet the challenges of the sector in implementing its strategies.
A.3. Project Description
The proposed supplemental credit, in the amount of US$4.0 million, would retain the design, basic
objectives and operating procedures of the National Health Development Program. It would aim to
complete the portfolio of the original credit. The proposed supplemental credit and original credit would
have a closing date of December 31, 2006, in order to allow enough time to complete all the activities. It
would finance:
(a) Utilization and coverage of primary health care centers and referral centers (US$2.6 million)
This component will essentially finance the rehabilitation and equipping of planned health facilities and
staff housing (Beli, Tumana, Bafata, Bambadinca, Samba silate, Canchungo, Beli, Gab6, Paunca), the
construction and equipment of a storage facility for drugs (CECOME), and the provision of medical
equipment and materials for the health facilities, and technical assistance for the civil work program. As
part of the minimum package of activities, this component will also provide for essential drugs, technical
assistance, and training for Local Health Management Committees.
Environmental assessment under the original credit was rated a "C", with no displacement of people. The
supplemental will finance the planned rehabilitation of health facilities. No one is expected to be resettled
from any of the investments proposed, including the construction of the storage facility for drugs and staff
housing for which the sites have already been identified. Agreement was reached with Government that it
would prepare simple guidelines for the contractors who will be constructing the drug storage building,
rehabilitating the health centers, and constructing staff housing. The guidelines will be incorporated into
contract documents, a draft of which will be reviewed by the Bank prior to the first contract being let.
(b) Strengthening of Institutional Capacity at all Levels (US$ 0.7 million)



This component will strengthen the capacity of the General Directorate of Planning and Cooperation
(DGPC) through the establishment of a basic health information system in which information on key
sectoral indicators will regularly flows from the health facilities to the center and from the center to the
health facilities. Emphasis will also be given on strengthening capacity in (a) data analysis and their use for
planning and decision-making; (b) strategic planning; and (c) improving external aid coordination. This
component will also contribute to strengthen the Directorate of Administration and Finance (DAF) in
administrative and financial management capacity. This will be achieved through technical assistance,
office equipment, training, incremental operating costs, including contractual personnel. In addition, it will
finance technical and financial audits and final evaluation of the project.
(c) Management and Development of Human Resources (US$ 0.5 million)
This component will finance technical assistance aimed at improving the quality, efficiency and
distribution of human resources through the implementation of specific strategies for personnel
management and training. In addition, it will seek to improve staff motivation (staff housing), working
conditions (rehabilitations and equipment) and career prospects (development of a policy on career
development path) of health personnel as originally planned under the parent credit. Outcomes of these
efforts that have been neglected so far in view of the country's political instability, will directly contribute
to the PDOs and more importantly on improving management (Directorate of Human Resources) and
technical (health facilities) capacity to respond to future health investments in the country. In addition to
technical assistance, this component will also finance training and equipment.
(d) Promotion of Better Health (US$ 0.2 million)
This component will provide for the Malaria Control Program through the purchase of environmentally-
approved products for impregnating bed-nets to be distributed by the Impregnation Centers created under
the original credit. The component will also finance the development of a sector-wide strategy of
communications through technical assistance and workshops.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues,
D. I. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Experience with the parent project has been that there have not been any significant environmental or social
issues. The supplemental does not change the project in ways that would increase the environmental
impacts beyond the category C limits. The drug storage facility to be constructed (land already identified)
is a small structure requiring small quantities of material and is not adjacent to an environmentally or
culturally sensitive area. The rehabilitation activities are small-scale and are not going to generate
hazardous materials, such as asbestos-containing demolition waste. Finally, the malaria program is based
on the provision of environmentally-approved products for impregnating bed nets.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
Not applicable
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
Not applicable
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
During appraisal, the team reached agreement with the borrower on simple guidelines to the contractors
that will be constructing the drug storage building and rehabilitating the centers. These guidelines would
be incorporated into contracts for the work and supervised by the borrower's field staff. For the
rehabilitation work they would focus on workplace safety and disposal of demolition debris as well as
avoidance of asbestos or other hazardous materials in the reconstruction work. For the drug storage
building, again workplace safety would be one issue to cover, and application of good construction practice
in land clearing, erosion control, dust control, drainage design, avoidance of asbestos, scheduling hours of
work to minimize disturbance to local residents, arranging routes and timing of materials deliveries for the
same reason, plus to minimize damage to local roads, etc. Borrower's commitment to prepare the
guidelines and incorporate them into contract documents was received during appraisal. The guidelines
will be reviewed by the Bank prior to the first contract being let.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
