I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The project will be the first phase of an Adjustable Program Loan (APL) expected to continue with two
following phases
The development objective of the project is to reduce government's fiscal vulnerability to natural disasters,
measured in terms of exposure of the state to losses generated by natural disasters, by strengthening  
national capacity for identifying and monitoring risks and by devolving responsibility for disaster risk
reduction to local governments and to the private sector through components which support: (i) risk
identification; (ii) risk reduction; (iii) institutional development (for risk reduction); (iv) risk awareness and
preparedness: and (v) risk transfer



I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
Component A - Disaster Risk Identification
Sub-component A. I. - Disaster Risk Information System - DRIS. This sub-comnponent will support the
development of a comprehensive information system on disaster vulnerability, risk evaluation and risk
reduction programs. The DRIS will provide a platform for the agencies which make up the National System
for Disaster Prevention and Response to manage and to share information about vulnerability and risk,
including scientific and technical data, geographic and mapping programs and reports on mitigation
programs and actions - in particular best practices from local entities. The DRIS activities will include, but
not necessarily be limited to a review of existing information and information management systems among
the various government agencies currently responsible for reporting on scientific, technical, geographic andl
planning bases, recommendations for a systematiziing data gathering in compatible formats and for sharing
data oin a networking system. The sub-component will support purchase and installation of hardware and
software, other equipment, and training as needed to enable related agencies and local entities to increase
their capacity to manage disaster information.
In addition this sub-component will support the development and establishment of a program to identify
and to quantify regional indicators of risk on a regular basis. The program of monitoring risk indicators,
primarily the number of persons and homes in areas declared to be at risk, the number of hectares
considered to be at risk and the number of hectares occupied or used inappropriately in terms of disaster
risk, is mandated by a Ministerial Decree (Date- Annex) which defines the monitoring of environmnental
indicators as a key task of the MMAVDT-MA. The environmental indicators, which pertain to the
possibility of natural events leading to disasters, will provide the basis for measuring the impact of
government efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters.
Information pertaining to risk awareness, disaster preparedness and emergency response will be managed
by DPAD, while information concerning vulnerability and warning systems by the Institute for Hydrology,
Meteorology and Environment Studies (IDEAM), and reduction and mitigations by MMAVDT.
Sub-component A.2. - Environmental Risk Monitoring. This sub-component will finance tcchnical
assistance, purchase of equipment and installation works needed to update existing systems for monitoring
catastrophic events such as, inter alia earthquake, hydro-meteorological events, volcano, flood, and drought
and for providing the respective early warning systems (INGEOMINAS, IDEAM)
Sub-component A.3 - Risk Evaluation. This sub-component will support studies, purchase of equipment
and training to improve the capability of national level agencies to identify and analyze risk deriving from
key geological and hydrological hazards as they affect such vital infrastructure as schools, hospitals, roads,
etc. and key watersheds. A special program will focus on analyzing risk and identifying preventive
measures for the water and sanitation sector. Pending availability of fiscal space it will also finance
purchase of equipment and technical assistance to put in place systems to detect phenomena related to El
Nino, to tsunamis and tidal wave events in the Pacific (IMBEMAR/IDEAM).
Component B - Risk Reduction
Sub-component B. I. - Risk Analvsis for Regional and Municipal Development Plans. This sub-component
will support the MMAVDT's program to improve the present practices of territorial planning by including
better risk assessmcnts, risk analyses and preventive planning in all municipal and regional planning
exercises. MMAVDT will manage a program of technical assistance to municipalities and "CAR's" in the
form of studies, training and workshops including but not necessarily limited to:
i)     development and promotion of methodologies for risk analysis and assessment for the
inclusion in municipal and regional development plans (PDMs and POTs);
ii)    strengthening municipal and sector risk mitigation plans in up to thirty selected
municipalities and up to five vital social sectors; and
iii)   monitoring and evaluating PDMs and POTs from the point of view of risk analysis



iv)     production and distribution of simplified guides to environmental procedures to assure
that investments in disaster mitigation and risk reduction avoid any negative
environmental impacts
Sub-component B.2. - Municipal Disaster Mitigation Measures. Following on MMAVDT's programs to
promote, to assist and to monitor municipal planning and investmnent in disaster risk reduction, this sub-
component will support municipal and local level disaster risk reduction through sub-projects for disaster
risk reduction, prevention and preparedness as financed through transfers from the federal government.
Reimbursement will follow verification of investments by the Controloria de la Repiiblica. Impact of local
and municipal risk reduction investments will be tracked and analyzed on an annual basis by the
MMAVDT and conclusions will serve to reformulate the municipal and regional assistance program.
Sub-component B.3 - Disaster Risk Reduction for Vital Infrastructure. This sub-component will support
the reinforcement and retrofitting and other disaster risk reduction measures which affect infrastructure of
primary importance to the national interest through sub-projects carried out by sector agencies such as the
Ministries of Health and Social Protection, of Public Works and Transport. of Environment and Housing,
and of Education, and by state-owned companies with active disaster reduction programs, such as
ECOPETROL, conditional on the presentation of a strategic sector review satisfactory to the Bank and on
verification of investments by the Controlorfa de la Repiiblica, as in the case of the municipal transfers.
Component C - Institutional Development
Sub-component C. I Strengthening of the National System for Disaster Management and Response. This
subcomponent will support studies and policy development work necessary to define and to implement a
broadened focus and policy framework for SNPAD, including but not necessarily limited to i) a review of
SNPAD to identify it existing strengths; and identify new areas to be included, including physical and
financial risk reduction and prevention, risk transfer and risk retention, and will propose an appropriate
organizational plan for the System to cover all relevant areas of work; ii) the development of a clear policy
framework redefining the role and responsibilities of the state on natural disaster risk management (i.e. the
broad level of risks it is willing/capable to assume).
Sub-component C.2 Project Management. This sub-component will help to provide technical assistance to
strengthen national capacity for coordinating, implementing, monitoring and evaluating risk reduction
including but not necessarily limited to supporting local and sector entities carrying out risk reduction plan
and programs. As such it will support the three general areas of project management:
i)     Financial management and administration, though technical assistance, training and
equipment to improve performance and capacity of The Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit (MHCP) to handle procurement, disbursement and financial management for
sound and efficient project coordination.
ii)    'rechnical follow up and control, through technical assistance, training and equipment for
the Technical Committee and the respective units of the participating agencies to build
capacity for project planning, for monitoring and reporting on physical progress and for
evaluating and reporting on project impact.
iii)    Development of subsequent APL phases and support for specific municipal and regional
programs under the national policy framework, through technical assistance, training and
equipment for DNP's Department for Urban and Regional Development and
Environment which is developing a special unit for disaster risk management and will
continue to be responsible for sector planning and support.



Component D - Awareness and Preparedness
Sub-component D.l - Emergency preparedness. This sub-component would support the FNC program to
finance risk reduction and disaster preparedness at the local level through sub-projects which include small
works, purchases and training in support of fire-prevention, first aid, and search and rescue organizations
directly involved in natural disaster response as well as local governments.
Sub-component D.2 Emergency and Contingency Planning. This sub-component would support the DPAD
for the development and implementation of emergency and contingency plans at Municipal level.
Sub Component D.3 Risk Awareness. This sub component will finance workshops for creating awareness
between members of the national system institutions.
Component E - Risk Transfer
Sub-component E. . - Risk Transfer and Coverage of Public Sector Assets. This sub-component will
support the Central Governments in defining strategies that improve and optimize the financial coverage of
risk. The sub-component will include the financing of technical experts and studies to assist the MHCP
and other participating agencies and Municipalities in the evaluation of risk exposures. and the formulation
and implementation of cost effective risk transfer arrangements.
Sub-component E.2. - Disaster Emergency Assistance. This component would assure that the Government
can obtain up to US$ 150 million in the event of a major natural disaster on Colombia soil. The bulk of
these funds would be disbursed against a positive list of imports in case a national emergency is declared,
while a small amount would be disbursed against works, goods and services required to attend the said
emergency.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
Il.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. t' information is not available.
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No major environmental impacts are expected in phase I. Disaster mitigation sub projects carried out by the
municipalities will follow environmental procedures established under national law and municipal law,
which are compatible with the World Bank policies and are explained in the EAF Report. The Contraloria
de la Republica will audit municipal investments assuring that the all the environmental regulations and
procedures are followed. Supervision by the Ministry of Environment will guarantee that any negative
environmental impacts will be adequate managed.
The mitigation measures to reduce disasters vulnerabilities at municipal level will be mainly activities such
as preparedness, training, recovery action, and studies of risk identification and risk reduction, which carry
no major environmental impacts.
To ensure compliance with the Bank's safeguard policies (particularly OP 4.01 (Environmental
Assessment) and OP 1 1.03 (Cultural Property)) the EAF report consists of the following sections:
I ) Environmental Base Line
2) Environmental assessment for the hazard risk mitigation and prevention
3) Identification of potential environmental impacts
4) Environmental procedures and screening criteria
5) Institutional arrangements
6) Evaluation and monitoring
The project will not result in significant environmental impact during phase 1, where necessarily the
environmental procedures included in the EAF will be applied.
No involuntarily resettlements are expected during phase I . However, a resettlement framework will be
prepared during the preparation and the first phase of the project and will be reviewed and approved by the
Bank for the second phase of the project. Additionally the project is supporting the preparation of a
National Resettlement Policy, which will apply to the municipalities that are included in the following
phases of the project.
Furthermore, the OP 4.37 is not triggered because no dams of any kind, new or under construction, will be
involved in phase 1.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No potential impacts are expected in phase I.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) and OP 11.03 (Cultural Property) are accordingly addressed under
Colombian regulations as mentioned on the EAF.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
No actions are assumed to trigger any policy in phase I regarding environmental impacts. For the
municipal small disaster mitigation works, consultation procedures described in EAF rely on municipal
procedures and community consultation as per Colombian law.
