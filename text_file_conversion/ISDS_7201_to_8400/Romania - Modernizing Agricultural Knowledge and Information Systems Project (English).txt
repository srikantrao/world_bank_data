A.2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the project is to assist the Romanian Government to improve the 
competitiveness of farmers and agro-processors in the EU accession environment.  This will be achieved 
through: (i) strengthened National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety and better implementation 
of measures for inspection control, risk management and communication in food safety matters; (ii) 
modernized and strengthened national research and extension system to provide staff in the food safety agency 
as well as within the research and extension system with necessary agricultural knowledge, skills, and 
technology; (iii) improved advisory services to ensure access to relevant information and technology by the 
farming community; and (iv) increased access of farmers and processors to knowledge of technologies related 
to production, quality control, food safety, processing and marketing in order to meet EU requirements. 
The Project is not a poverty-focused operation.  The essential aim of the project is to help the farming 
community meet relevant EU agricultural directives that will allow them to capture the benefits of EU 
accession.  The primary beneficiaries would be middle-sized and small farmers with the potential to become 
commercial. 
Overall project impact will be measured in terms of: increased food safety; improved agricultural productivity, 
competitiveness and exports; and increased access to and adoption of improved farm practices, marketing and 
post-harvest technologies leading to increased household incomes. 
The project is designed in response to the Government’s Strategy for the Development of Agriculture, Food 
Industry and Forestry for the medium- and long-term (2001-2005 and 2005-2010). This strategy elaborates the 
objectives of the agricultural sector as: “productivity and quality increases of agro-food products, the 
modernization and the improvement of food processing and marketing chains as well as increase of 
agricultural producers’ income and the sustainable development of rural areas, in compliance with 
environmental protection requirements, in order to create a competitive sector which should meet the common 
market requirements”.   
A.3. Project Description 
 
Page  2
The project will consist of four components to be implemented over six years. 
 
Component 1 -- Strengthening the National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety 
(ANSVSA) and the Phyto-sanitary Units.
 
The objective of this component would be to strengthen the 
National Agency for Sanitary, Veterinary and Food Safety (ANSVSA) and Phyto-sanitary units so that they 
a
re better able to (i) implement the new food safety regulations adopted by Romania in compliance with EU 
accession requirements; and (ii) provide the necessary control and verification of fresh and processed products 
to enable farmers, agro-industry and food processors to supply local and international markets.  The following 
activities will be financed: (i) institutional capacity building
 through (a) strengthening ANSVSA’s 
communications system with support for information technology and training; and (b) developing an effective 
public awareness system, including the establishment of a press office; (ii) establishment of national and 
regional laboratories
;
(iii) support for Border Inspection Posts (BIP); (iv) program for Animal Welfare in 
livestock production to demonstrate the EU requirements; (v) establishment of p
hyto-sanitary Central 
Laboratories
 and (vi) provision of training.  
 
Component 2:  Support for Agricultural Research (US$ 23.9 million
).  The objective of the agricultural 
research component is to strengthen the capacity of the national agricultural research system (NARS) to 
provide agricultural knowledge, skills and information based on the needs of the agro-food sub-sector and in 
line with the EU requirements.  MAKIS would support Romania’s agricultural research on the following sub-
components:  
(i) 
Establishing National Reference Laboratories
 necessary to be functional immediately after accession 
for implementation of: (a) nitrates and sludge directives, and (b) testing for Genetically Modified 
Organisms (GMO);  
(ii)  Reform Program
:
The Government has identified four priority research programs 
to be supported under the project.  These include:  (a) safe plant nutrient management 
practices and the identification and monitoring of vulnerable zones in terms of soil 
fertility and water quality, including developing remedial measures and promoting good 
agricultural practices; (b) high quality, authentic planting materials for horticultural, 
vegetable and ornamental crops, and the establishment of non-GMO plant and food 
products of plant origin certification capacity and development of bio-safety and 
regulatory procedures for GMO; (c) profitable, environmentally safe, diversified  
cropping systems for  the production of high quality food and feed within an overall 
Field Crops Research Program for  plain and upland areas, including arable crops, 
forages, potatoes; and (d) profitable, environmentally sustainable and safe animal 
production systems.  To address these priority research programs, five  priority 
Research Institutes have been identified that will become “Centers of Excellence”.  
These include: National Research and Development Institute for Soil Science, Agro-
chemistry and Environmental Protection “RISSA” in Bucharest, National Research and 
Development Institute for Bio-technology in Horticulture (NRDIBH), Stefanesti, the 
Agricultural Research and Development Institute (ARDI), Fundulea, the Potato and 
Sugar Beet Research and Development Institute (PSRDI), Brasov and the Animal 
Biology and Nutrition Institute (IBNA) in Balotesti.   
(iii) 
Mainstreaming the Competitive Grant Scheme (CGS)
 into Government (MAFRD) 
agricultural research funding for core public sector activities.  The ongoing competitive 
grant funding under the ASSP, for applied research, will be expanded and mainstreamed 
gradually over the life of the project as one of MAFRD’s core activities.   
 
Component 3 - Support for Advisory and Information System (US$ 10.2 million).  
The main objectives of 
this component are: (a) to improve the capacity of the research, extension and food safety specialists to better 
serve the needs and improve competitiveness of farmers/ producers and processors in the context of EU 
accession and (b) to increase access of farmers and
processors to knowledge on technologies related to 
Page  3
production, quality control, food safety, processing and marketing in order to meet the EU requirements.   
Towards this, the project will support two sub-components: (i) the establishment of a Training and Information 
Center; and (ii) improving effectiveness of advisory services. 
Component 4: Project Management Unit (PMU) (US$ 2.7 million).  
The project management component 
w
ould provide for project co-ordination and administration staff, procurement, financial management, 
reporting, monitoring and evaluation activities for all components.  The MAKIS-PMU would be formed on the 
basis of the existing ASSP-PMU with staffing reflecting the needs of the MAKIS. Funds would also be 
provided for hiring short-term 
consultants on a need basis. Two of the PMU staff would be located in ANCA.  
The project would provide for purchase of some additional equipment and  vehicles, rehabilitation of premises, 
together with salaries and operating costs over six years.

strict delimitation of construction area with fences and/or warning belts 
·
protection of soil surfaces by removing fertile soil layer to be re-applied later  
·
protection of surrouding sensitive vegetation, if any 
·
noise-absorbent panels mounted around the construction area 
·
use of dust-absorbing screens, provision of adequate waste disposal services and measures to 
ensure that solid waste is disposed appropriately, maintenance of vehicles and construction 
equipment in special places only 
Page  5
·
strict adherence of construction work regulations. 
National inspection procedures will be applied to monitor the mitigating measures.  
 
R
egarding the laboratories involving use and handling of hazardous chemical substances and bio-hazardous 
materials, the necessary mitigation measures may be summarized as follows: 
a)  environmentally friendly design of civil works to be undertaken in each case in 
order to ensure the protection of soil, water and air against pollutants will be made 
available 
b)  issues of hazardous and bio-hazardous waste management will addressed as part 
of each laboratory project design and the laboratory program as a whole. 
c)  Compliance with all environmental regulations in force will be monitored  
d)  GLP certification will be obtained for all laboratories involved according to rules 
laid down by legal agreement MO146/2000 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, 
and Rural Development (MAFRD) 
e)  All laboratories using bio-hazardous materials will be required to develop the bio-
safety handbook on the basis of general requirements laid down in MO 823/2001 
of MAFRD and taking into account its special requirements.  In this context, the 
EU has already established a number of similar laboratories and has prepared 
manuals for the safe use and handling of hazardous materials. Each laboratory 
will be required to keep these manuals on site to be made available for 
consultation and use by all concerned staff.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include staff of the border inspection posts, the regional and national 
laboratories as well as the Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.  
The EA and EMP were prepared in full consultation with the above staff.
