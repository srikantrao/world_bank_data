Municipal Sanitation Component:
 
This component will finance the construction of about 62 public toilets in priority areas 
(commercial and poor districts) that respond to community needs as assessed in an LMG 
demand analysis and projection.  Public-private partnerships will be sought to reduce the 
municipal subsidies and improve operational efficiency. 
 
Solid Waste Management Component: 
 
This component will construct one municipal solid waste transfer station (with a capacity 
of 450 tons/day), 42 waste collection stations, and invest in needed waste hauling trucks 
and vehicles to transport waste to the distant and recently built second city landfill.  
 
Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component:
 
This component includes:
 
·
Technical assistance to help implement the Wastewater Component; 
·
TA to help develop LMWTC as an institution; 
·
TA to improve operational efficiency of solid waste management operations; 
·
TA to help promote Public-Private Partnerships for Public Toilets; 
·
TA to support an industrial waste pollution control program,  including Industrial 
Pollution Control Action Plans /IPCAPs for eleven enterprises that discharge 90% 
of the city’s total industrial wastewater; online monitoring of industrial 
wastewater discharges; introduction of a Discharge Permit System/DPS; 
institutional development of Liuzhou’s Environmental Protection Bureau and 
funding of associated environmental monitoring equipment. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
Page  3
analysis: 
 
Project components will be located in various areas in Liuzhou, a city in Western 
China’s 
Guangxi region.  Liuzhou is surrounded by low hills and opens to a plain in the south.  It 
has a subtropical climate with abundant participation and mild to hot temperatures year 
round.  The average annual temperature in the city is 20.5 C, its average annual 
precipitation 1461 mm and its relative average annual humidity 76%.    
 
The urban area of Liuzhou is surrounded by agricultural land, mainly fields of rice, other 
grains and vegetables, with fish ponds in the suburbs.  Because of the long history of 
human activities and development in the area, there is little natural forest except in the 
northern mountainous region, and few wild animals.  Limestone hills form the area’s 
natural scenery and many of the city’s parks and tourist attractions.  
 
Liujiang River, which zigzags across the city through 74 kilometers of waterway, is a 
landmark river as well as the primary domestic water supply source of the city.  Also 
flowing across the city are two tributaries:  the Zhuerxi river, originating from the city’s 
northwest, discharges into the Liujiang river one km from the Liujiang Iron Bridge, and 
has a total length within the urban area of about 5.2 km.  The Jiuquhe river, originating 
from the Longhuai reservoir in the city’s west, discharges into the Liujiang river at 
geology hospital.  While the Zhuerxi river is primarily a receiving water body for the 
city’s municipal and industrial wastewater discharges, the Jiuquhe river is a used for 
domestic water supply, irrigation,  and fish farming, and  receives wastewater discharges. 
Environmental monitoring shows that the Liujiang river  generally maintains its 
designated Category III surface water standards, with exceptions in a few cross sections 
where suspended solids and ammonia nitrogen exceed applicable standards.  The Zhuerxi 
and Jiuquhe rivers, on the other hand, seriously exceed Category V standards for COD, 
BOD, SS and NH
3
-N.  For example, COD readings in Zhuerxi river have exceeded 100 
mg/L, indicating very poor water quality under current conditions.  
 
The project would support the following project components: 
1.  Baisha Sewage Treatment and Conveyance  (14 km pipelines, 100,000m3 
capacity) 
2a.  Longquanshan  Sewage Treatment  (150,000m3 capacity) 
2b.   Comprehensive Renovation Project of Water Environment of Zhuerxi  
4.     Yanghe/Jinlan sewage treatment and conveyance  (70 km pipelines, 125,000m3 
capacity) 
5.   Labao Sewage Treatment and conveyance   (34.5 km pipelines, 25,000m3 
capacity) 
6.  Guiliu Solid Waste Transfer Station with daily transfer capacity of 450 tons 
 
There are 48 minority nationalities comprising a total of 1.83 million people in greater 
Liuzhou.  66% of these minorities are Zhuang.  Minorities live with the Han in urban 
areas, but are concentrated in particular areas.  For example, 75% of the population is 
Molao in Yanghe and 40% of the population is Zhuang in Longquanshan.  The analysis 
Page  4
showed that livelihood modes and the production pattern of the Molao and the Zhuang 
are similar to those of the Han.  The major difference between the minorities and the Han 
is the minorities’ lower average income.  Moreover, minorities do not exhibit the features 
of indigenous peoples as defined in the Bank’s OD 4.20, and thus this policy does not 
apply.   
 
Though difficult to quantify precisely, the project is expected to benefit—directly or 
indirectly—a large number of Liuzhou citizens.  This includes direct benefits of reduced 
pollution and better health conditions for those who live and work near riverbanks, or 
more indirectly, quality of life and economic benefits for the general population.  The 
project’s new public toilet and solid waste infrastructure will also better health conditions 
and enhance the city’s quality of life.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental impacts
:
The net environmental impact of the project is, on balance, substantially positive and the benefits greatly 
outweigh the negative impacts.  The project would reduce pollution loads in the Liujiang River (CODcr 
reduction by 44,639.5 t/y)
 
and improve public health by providing rationally distributed public toilets in the 
city and solid waste management system.  
 
Major potential adverse impacts during the construction of the sewer network, wastewater treatment plants, 
solid waste transfer station and the public toilets include, as appropriate, excavation, dust, noise, soil 
disposal, night construction, and traffic and urban service disruptions.  Impacts during the operational phase 
of these facilities include sludge disposal, noise, and odor.   
 
Site selection for the solid waste and public toilet facilities has been controversial.  Citizens, though 
generally supportive of project investments, have voiced concerns about impacts on their neighborhoods 
and quality of life.  In fact, because citizens voiced complaints, the LMG postponed the construction of a 
second waste transfer station.  
 
The EAs, however, specify mitigation measures, and related environmental monitoring plans, institutional 
arrangements and training, and cost estimates for implementing the measures themselves.  Major mitigation 
measures include control on construction practices, careful site selection, selection of facilities with 
appropriate buffer zones, control on noise and odors, and appropriate sludge disposal.  
 
Regarding sediment and sludge disposal, during the EA, sediment samples upriver and at 
the lower reaches of the southern and northern branches of Zhuexi river were collected 
and analyzed.  In addition, sludge samples from the Longquanshan wastewater treatment 
plant (phase I) were also collected and analyzed.  The test results indicate that heavy 
metals in the sediment and sludge have exceeded agricultural standards and as such are 
unsuitable for agricultural land disposal.  To further determine the nature of the sediment 
and sludge for proper disposal planning, leaching tests were performed for heavy metals 
to determine whether the sediment and sludge are hazardous waste.  The results show the 
heavy metal content is below the concentration limits indicated in GB5085.3-1996, 
indicating that both the sediments and sludge are non hazardous and thus can be disposed 
at the Liuzhou Lichonggou sanitary landfill.  More sampling will be conducted prior to 
project implementation. 
 
During the WWTPs operation period, total sludge generated from the four WWTPS will 
be 103,000 m3/y with 75% water content.  The sludge will be sent to Lichonggou landfill 
and disposed of separately from municipal solid waste. 
 
The Lichonggou landfill is located in Yibu Village, Liujiang County, Liuzhou, in the 
mountain ridge area on the right side of Liujiang River.  It is being constructed as one the 
sub-projects of an acid rain and environment treatment program supported by the Japan 
Overseas Cooperative Fund, and the first phase will be completed in early 2004.  Its daily 
disposal capacity will be 600 t.
At a total landfill capacity of 7.96 million m3, the 
Page  6
designed operation life of the landfill will be 17 years.  The Liuzhou Environmental 
Sanitation Division has a permit for WWTP sludge being disposed of at Lichonggou 
landfill. 
 
Land Acquisition and Resettlement:  
The construction of the wastewater treatment 
plants and subprojects under the sanitation component will require land acquisition and 
relocation.  Further information on the nature of these impacts is summarized in the 
following table.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Liuzhou
’s current population of 1.2 million is expected to reach 1.8 million by 2020. It is 
estimated that Liuzhou will also enjoy continuous strong  economic growth .This 
demographic change and economic development will require further investment in 
wastewater treatment system and sanitation system and solidwaste management.  
Regarding the sanitation (public toilet), it is expected the demand for public toilets in 
residential areas will decrease as  economic growth will allow most of households to live 
in the houses with toilet, while the demand for public toilet in commercial areas would 
continue to increase. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
By assessing  the Liuzhou City Master Plan and Environmental Protection Plan, 
Alternative Analysis was conducted.  The EA recommends an option that  supports four 
WWTPs under the project, which is a better number of WWTPs compared with the five 
WWTPs in the original project proposal.  During the project’s development and design, 
various alternatives were screened and compared against technical, economic and 
environmental criteria.  In terms of the environmental comparison of the alternatives, the 
primary objective was to identify and select options with the least adverse environmental 
impacts.  Evaluations and comparisons were made of alternatives with the following 
components and/or aspects:  
 
With and Without the Project:
The do-nothing scenario will leave the city with serious pollution in the 
Zhuerxi and Jiuquhe rivers, and continue to significantly and negatively impact the lives of residents in 
nearby communities as well as on fish farming in these water bodies.  As the construction of a hydrodam 
downstream will reduce the Liujiang river’s assimilative capacity, the source of drinking water may b
e
at 
Page  7
risk if no action is taken to intercept the direct wastewater discharges into Liujiang and the inflows of 
seriously polluted water from Zhuerxi and Jiuquhe rivers.  With the project, these pollution issues will be 
addressed; thus, supporting a project is a preferred alternative.  
 
Scale of Wastewater Treatment Plants:
Four alternatives were proposed and compared, including a five 
W
WTP alternative, two four WWTP alternatives with different total treatment capacities, and one three 
WWTP alternative.  The four WWTP alternative was considered optimal because of it involved less land 
occupation/resettlement and best utilized existing wastewater collection and conveyance pipes.  In short, 
this option impacts the natural and social environment the least.  This alternative also requires less capital 
costs, although it does require river-crossing pipelines.  
 
Wastewater Treatment Processes:
Two different processes were considered and compared for the Baisha, 
Longquanshan and Yanghe wastewater treatment plants: oxidation ditch and A
2
/O.  Both are mature 
technologies capable of meeting the treatment objectives including nitrogen removal, but A
2
/O was selected 
because it occupies less land, consumes less energy, and thus impacts the environment less, and has lower 
capital and operating costs.  For the smaller Labao wastewater treatment plant, the comparison was made 
between an oxidation ditch and UNITANK process.  Oxidation ditch was selected because of its lower 
equipment requirements, lower energy consumption, simpler operations, and lower operation costs. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The LMG recruited the Sino-Japan friendship Centre for Environmental Protection to 
prepare the EA and EMPs, and the Shanghai  Academy of  Social Science to conduct the 
Social Assessment and prepare the Resettlement Action Plans.  The LMG disclosed these 
documents to the public and organized two public consultations. 
 
Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan 
 
An EA and EMPs for the project’s wastewater component and solid waste/public toilet 
component were carried out respectively.  During preparation and evaluation, national 
procedures and Bank safeguard policies were diligently followed.  The EA documents 
such as EA reports, EMP and EA Summary have been prepared, incorporating Bank’s 
comments during project preparation and pre-appraisal, and found to be satisfactory.  The 
EA covers the project description, baseline environmental conditions, the needs for 
project and environmental benefits, alternative analysis, potential  environmental impacts 
and mitigation measures both at the construction and operation stage, environment 
management plans, public consultation and information disclosure.  The EMP specifies 
the environmental management and supervision mechanisms, mitigation measures, 
environmental monitoring plans, training plans and budget allocations necessary for 
implementing the mitigation measures, monitoring plans and ways to strengthen client 
capacity.  Key environmental construction management issues include: dust reduction; 
soil reuse and proper planning of soil disposal; use of low noise equipment/techniques; 
and use of proper operational procedures by  the contractors during construction.  There 
will be environmental staff members in the PMO to supervise the implementation of the 
EMP. 
 
Industrial pollution control action plan
:
The LMG implemented an industrial 
Page  8
pollution control program.  This program includes the following elements:  1) relocating 
polluting industries from developed city areas to suburbs or new industrial development 
zones around the lower reach of Liujiang river; 2) prohibiting new heavy-polluting 
industries, 3) requiring that all existing industrial operations operate in compliance with 
applicable discharge standards, 4) introducing wastewater tariffs according to polluter 
pay policies, 5) enforcing monitoring and supervision programs; 6) mandating 
installation of automatic online monitoring systems at heavy-polluting industries which 
will be linked to EPB’s  information center; and 7) establishing goals for industrial water 
recycling and water reuse to minimize wastewater discharge.  All industrial pollution 
control action plans will be enforced by the end of 2005, and represent part of an 
integrated effort in Liuzhou to control water pollution and improve the city’s water 
environment. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key project stakeholders are the Liuzhou Government, the PMO, Liuzhou 
Wastewater Company, Liuzhou Environmental Sanitation Department, and local people 
and communities which may be impacted by the construction and operation of the 
project. 
 
Public Consultation on EA  
 
Wastewater Component:
 
Two rounds of public consultations were held with  project-
affected people; one at the EA TOR stage, and one at the draft EA report stage.  To get a 
full understanding of public opinions on project construction and public satisfaction and 
acceptance of the mitigation measures
,
the EA team conducted public consultations in 
directly impacted areas.  Questionnaire and discussion meetings were handed out and 
held respectively  during the public consultation activities.  In all, there were 650 
questionnaires distributed during the first consultation, with 490 collected/returned.  
Results from the questionnaires and public hearings on affected communities were 
examined and considered before the second round of public consultations.  These 
consultations targeted directly impacted areas, with 103 residents involved.  Based on the 
information provided in the EA, what has been done is overall acceptable.
 
Sanitation Component
:
:
In the EA, it was described that two rounds of public 
consultations were also conducted.  The consultations were conducted in urban areas and 
with residents who would be directly affected by or benefit from the proposed public 
toilets and solid waste transfer stations.  As a result of the consultations, one transfer 
station was dropped from the project.  Over two rounds of public consultations, 
questionnaire surveys, combined with individual interviews, represented the main 
consultation methods.  A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed. A majority of 
surveyed people expressed their support of the project.  To tackle people's concern, some 
mitigation measures were proposed and discussed in the second consultation.  During the 
EA work, local people were consulted at least twice.  The following approaches were 
Page  9
used for public consultation: (1) consultation meetings with local government 
representatives, and (2) questionnaire analysis of public opinion, supplemented by 
interviews.  
 
Information disclosure
:
Information about EA report preparation was disclosed through the local newspaper 
“Liuzhou Daily” dated October 27, 2004.  The EA EMP, RAP were placed at the 
Liuzhou PMO for interested people/group information as well as at the Bank Infoshop.
