A.2. Project Objectives 
The overall objective of the proposed PRSC4 is to continue to support the implementation of  
Uganda’s poverty reduction strategy, as set out in the Poverty Eradication Action Plan/Poverty Reduction  
Strategy Paper (PEAP/PRSP).  
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed Credit builds on the series of PRSCs (PRSC1, PRSC2, and PRSC3) that have been  
approved by the Board in May 2001, July 2002, and September 2003 respectively. The proposed Credit is  
a core operation to implement the objectives of the Uganda the Poverty Eradication Action Plan, and the  
Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Main emphasis of the PRSC4 will be on consolidation  
of the reform program developed under PRSC1-3; in support of the four pillars of the PEAP:  
Pillar 1. 
 
Efficient and equitable use of public resources, which is essential for improving public resource allocation 
and raising the productivity and cost-efficiency of public investment and other  expenditures, and  
strengthened financial sector performance.  This includes reforms aimed at  improving public expenditure 
management, strengthening monitoring and evaluation, and  improving performance of the pension and 
insurance sectors;  
Pillar 2. 
 
Improved governance through cross-cutting public sector reforms, such as the reform of public service and 
pay, public procurement, financial management, and measures to increase transparency, civil society 
participation, and fight against corruption. The revision of the current public pay structure and human 
resource management will help the Government recruit and retain high-quality staff.  Improvements in 
public procurement and financial management will promote accountability for public resources, and 
enhanced trans

ation, and anti-corru
p
tion efforts will hel
p
 citizens hold their leaders and 
Page  3
 
 
public officials more accountable for the quantity and quality of services;  
Pillar 3. 
 
Promotion of enabling environment for rural development, including steps to improve the effectiveness of 
agricultural research and advisory services, and the promotion of rural finance, rural roads, and sustainable 
natural resource management. Stimulating agricultural and rural growth rates is essential for sustained 
poverty reduction, since 96 percent of the poor live in rural areas and most of them earn their living from 
agriculture;  
Pillar 4. 
 
Improved access to and quality of education, health care, and water and sanitation services as  
highlighted below:    
- 
Improve quality of education: (i) primary education (reduce pupil-teacher ratio, pupil-textbook 
ratio, pupil-classroom ratio), (ii) post-primary education (develop and implement a strategy for the 
expansion of post-primary education)  
- 
Improve health care: (i) health care financing (rationalize health care financing); (ii) drug 
procurement and management (strengthen procurement and management of drugs  and medical 
supplies); (iii) human resources (increase human resources for health); (iv) health infrastructure 
(improve health infrastructure). 
- 
 Increase access to and reliability, affordability, and sustainability of water supply and sanitation 
(WSS) services. (i) rural WSS (strengthen decentralized planning, preparation, implementation, 
and management, improve central government's capacity to provide technical assistance to 
districts; utilize the local private sector for WSS delivery; develop a strategy for national hygiene 
promotion, sanitation, and communication); (ii) small towns WSS (introduce a new management 
framework), (iii) urban WSS (introduce commercial operations, improve financial sustainability). 
   
In each of the sectors included in the PRSC, sector plans are prepared by sector working groups which  
include government officials, donors, NGOs, and private sector representatives.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
PRSC4  will  be  coordinated  by  the Office of the Prime Minister and implemented by central and line 
ministries, districts, small towns, and communities across the country.

], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
 
Comments: 
The proposed PRSC4 builds upon the sector work in the previous PRSCs and 
continues to focus on several sectors and therefore adheres to the safeguard requirement 
set forth in OP 4. 01 as recommended by the Bank's PRSC safeguard working group. The 
Credit has been classified as Category B and will continue to build on preceding PRSC 
environmental analysis conducted for health, water and sanitation, and rural 
development. Two areas are of safeguard concern pesticide management and land tenure. 
The safeguard measures will ensure that potential adverse impacts will be screened and 
provisions are in place to mitigate impacts, if any.  The environmental analysis will be 
incorporated as an annex to the PRSC4 Program Document, and the annex will be 
disclosed at the Bank's Infoshop and in Uganda.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The potential adverse environmental and social effects associated with PRSC4 are mainly related to (i) 
medical waste handling and disposal, (ii) district road maintenance, (111) borehole drilling (depending on 
location), (iv) design and construction of WSS facilities, and(v) handling and use of agricultural inputs, in 
particular, pesticides, and (vi) potential land tenure processes that may result in individuals having to 
relocate. Overall, the biophysical and social impacts of these impacts are expected to be modest. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
None. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
None. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Safeguard issues are addressed through the sectoral strategy building, supported by ongoing IDA-funded 
investment projects in various sectors (such as roads, agricultural research and technology, agricultural 
extension) Priority setting has been increasingly devolved to district and sub-county governments, and the 
central government is providing technical assistance to districts for this effort. Bringing environmental and 
social safeguards into policy making is included in capacity-building initiatives supported by IDA and 
other donors . An environmental monitoring plan has been put in place, and environmental and social 
safeguard indicators have
been included in the PRSC monitoring plan.  
 
Rural Development- Agriculture:  
Measures to mitigate impacts of pesticide use will be taken through 
the ongoing National Agriculture Advisory Services Project (NAADS) that was approved in January 2001 
and responsible for environmental monitoring and evaluation. The project aims to transform the existing 
publicly delivered extension service to a decentralized, largely farmer-owned and private sector advisory 
service. Although agro-chemical use is relatively low in Uganda, NAADS will facilitate intensification of 
smallholder agricultural production systems, potentially increasing the use of fertilizers and other 
agrochemicals. As a category B project, its Environmental Assessment was prepared in July 2000, and in 
September 2000 a Pest Management Plan, that ensures sustainable pest management activities, minimizing 
health and environmental pesticide risks and strengthened capacity for integrated pest management and 
pesticide regulatory control.  Mitigation practices identified in the NAADS EA are described in the detailed 
EA annex of the PRSC Project Document. A pesticide specialist was used during preparation to identify 
key issues regarding pesticide use, management, registration with recommendations to key stakeholders 
that will be incorporated into PRSC4 actions. 
 
Rural Development - Land Tenure: 
The Land Act passed in 1998 provides for regularizing land tenure 
under mailo, freehold and customary tenure regimes. The Land Sector Strategic Plan prioritizes 
interventions and forms the basis for developing a National Land Policy, strengthening capacity for land 
administration, and implementing three pilots for land consolidation and land readjustment in Soroti, 
Masaka, and Ntungamo  The pilots provide an opportunity for any land tenant/occupant to go through a 
formalized process of having land "certified" and then if desired "titled". In general, a land owner can come 
to agreement on a settlement where the occupants can purchase the land, with money coming from the 
Land Fund No resettlement Is expected in pilot areas since occupants and tenants are getting certificates 
through the demarcation and adjudication process Presumably, if occupants have in recent time settled on 
land and they cannot provide evidence of long occupancy, they do not quality for a certificate. The Prime 
Minister's Office will continue the development of national standards for involuntary resettlement. Like 
Page  6
 
 
the Bank, the Government is committed to ensuring that processes of involuntary land acquisition leave 
those affected no worse off than they would otherwise have been. The Bank will continue to explore 
options to support the intended updating of the background and policy work carried out in 1995. 
The Land Commission in other parts of the country is sorting out land occupancy between several 
ethnic/tribal groups, and the Land Fund is being used to provide payments for demarcation and settlement 
of tenants and occupants. If there is any action regarding resettlement of persons associated with the Land 
Fund or LSSP, the Bank will review with the Government this process and when appropriate, a 
Resettlement Action Plan or Framework will be developed.  
 
Environment Assessment:
 Uganda has adopted environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations in 
1998, and the National Environmental Management Agency (NEMA) has developed environmental impact 
assessment guidelines that cover the actual identification of biophysical and social effects, public hearing, 
code of conduct of EIA practitioners, environmental inspectors, and environmental easement. It has also 
started to establish EIA units in line ministries. Under PRSC4, the Government intends to continue 
developing environmental guidelines across the range of public programs, in order to mainstream 
environmental considerations at the levels of both Ministries and various tiers of sub-national government, 
while the Prime Minister's Office will continue the development of national standards for involuntary 
resettlement. 
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Stakeholder consultation will be critical in two areas. The first one is community WSS services. DWD 
currently uses community workers and staff trained in social work to undertake community outreach 
programs. This work will continue under PRSC4. The decentralization process has devolved priority setting 
to political processes at local levels which have remained very open and participatory, and are deliberately 
designed for accountability, transparency, and increased public control.  In addition, special consultative 
efforts will be undertaken in secondary education planning, natural resource management, and the 
normalization of land rights These consultations will be an important tool aimed at building ownership for 
the programs and reducing inter-and intra-community resource conflicts. 
 
The environmental analysis will be incorporated as an annex to the PRSC4 Program Document, and the 
annex will be disclosed at the Bank's Infoshop and in Uganda prior to appraisal. A separate Pest 
Management Plan is not required for the PRSC4 because pest and pesticide management issues are 
addressed through the NAADS project's PMP which has been disclosed. In addition, as part of PRSC4 
preparation, the Bank together with the Government explored ways to further strengthen pesticide 
management. This work will focused on pesticide registration, selection, the overall regulatory framework 
governing pesticide use, and incentives for integrated Pest Management.
