I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The main development objective of the Iran Local Development Fund (LDF) is to pilot in selected
provinces an approach to build the capacity of local councils to undertake community-demand development
activities that would eventually contribute to the overall goal of poverty alleviation and respond to the needs
of the more vulnerable groups in the community. This will be achieved through three main types of
activities: (i) support to local community development by improving access to basic, social and economic
services (health, education, physical environment), and income generation opportunities; (ii) support to
targeted vulnerable groups, especially women, children, youth and the disabled; and (iii) provincial and
local-level institution building, monitoring, evaluation and learning.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Development programs financed by the LDF will be demand-driven and identified in a participatory
manner, and will be selected by Local Village and City Councils assisted by specialized consulting firms.
Provisionally, the programs would be situated in 13 poor peri-urban communities and 26 small rural
communities situated in five provinces purposively selected for improved targeting and better resource
allocation. The provinces are: (i) Khorasan Razavi; (ii) Khorazan South; (iii) Khoozestan, (iv) Hamedan,
and (v) Tehran, whose selection was based on several criteria, including measures of poverty and other
human indicators, level of readiness and social mobilization of LCs and the chances of success leading to
replicating the LDF in other provinces. The selection of the provinces and the communities is explained in
Annex 4 of the PAD: Project Rationale and Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary, and has been confirmed
at appraisal.

The project will consist of three main components:         (i) local community development; (ii) support to
vulnerable groups and pilot initiatives; and (iii) provincial and local-level institution building, monitoring,
evaluation and learning, and project management costs. All activities to be supported under the three
components will identify issues of inclusion and exclusion in development benefits, devise approaches that
ensure greater sensitivity to gender matters especially where needs of poor women are concerned, and
address socio-economic and gender equity considerations. The main tools to ensure these concerns are the
social assessment/situation analysis and the Operations Manual (OM).

Component 1: Local Community Development (US$75 million)
This component will be the largest in the project with an estimated allocation of 75% of total project funds.
This component will finance investments in three areas that are interrelated: (a) Small scale demand-driven
social infrastructure projects; (b) Small scale demand-driven economic infrastructure; and (c) Income
generating activities.

Component 2: Support to Vulnerable Groups and Pilot Initiatives (US$15 million)
About 15% of the project's funds will be allocated to this component. This component will finance: (a)
Programs/projects to support vulnerable groups like the disabled, children, youth, women and the elderly;
and (b) new and innovative ideas through pilot initiatives with potential for replication in delivering social
services to the identified target group.

Component 3: Provincial and Local Institution Building, Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning
(US$10 million)
About 10% of the project's fund will be allocated to this component. This component will
finance: (a) Provincial Institution Building; (b) LCs Capacity Building; and (c) Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) and Systematic Learning; and (d) project management costs.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The project will cover five provinces: (i) Khorasan Razavi; (ii) Khorasan South; (iii) Khoozestan; (iv)
Hamedan; and (v) Tehran. The programs would be situated in 13 poor peri-urban communities and 26
small rural communtities situated in these five provinces. The project is demand driven, thus the exact
location of investments within the identified clusters will depend on demand and on the results of the social
assessment that will be conducted at the onset of the project.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: No significant environmental issues are envisioned to be caused by the LDF. Investments under
Component 1: "Local Community Development" are small-scale infrastructure improvements and
rehabilitation, most of which will be less than US$100,000 and are not expected to have major adverse
environmental impacts as they would be limited in scope. The proposed project will not entail any resettlement
or land acquisition. In addition, the project will not fund any major construction works. The LDF is expected
to have substantial beneficial impacts on the environment as it would improve basic social and economic
infrastructure for the communities.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The project triggers OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment.                Component 1, the Local Community
Development, may have potential negative environmental impacts related to construction for improving
and/or rehabilitating community social and economic infrastructure. Under this component, the project
would finance the rehabilitation of schools, health and cultural facilities, community potable water supply,
small wastewater disposal schemes, as well as irrigation and drainage schemes. Given the small scale of
these community subprojects, negative environmental impacts that could arise would not be significant,
irreversible or large in scale. Potential negative impacts will be mainly related to construction activities
including disruption of traffic pattern, interference with other infrastructures, disrupted access to residential
and/or other buildings, change in the landscape (loss of vegetation), noise nuisance, air pollution due to
dust formation, safety hazard from construction activities and inappropriate disposal of excavated materials
and construction debris.

As is the case with other demand driven projects in the region, the OM will include procedures for
appraising the environmental impacts of any proposed subproject. If a subproject is found to include
substantial environmental impacts, further procedures are included to address them or to alter the design of
the subproject.

The OM describes in detail how subprojects will be evaluated to ensure that environmental and social
safeguards are enforced and World Bank policies are complied with. Environmental criteria will be
included in the selection of subprojects, and adequate mitigation measures will be incorporated in the
contract agreements so that all anticipated environmental impacts are avoided or minimized.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

No cumulative impacts are expected at this stage, however the appraisal mission will identify any potential
cumulative impacts.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

No long-term negative impacts are expected at this stage. Possible positive environmental and social
impacts include provision of adequate water quantities and qualities, protection of water resources from
contamination, improved access of poor people to health and social services, improved employment
opportunities for long-term unemployed, etc.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Environmental assessment OP 4.01:

The appraisal mission reviewed, in close coordination with other Bank projects in the Islamic Republic of
Iran, the environmental, legal and regulatory framework for assessing the environmental impacts of
subprojects, including the mechanisms and responsibilities for environmental screening and review of
Environmental Assessment (EA) results. The project will provide capacity building for the TSUs and other
concerned stakeholders to ensure that subprojects are properly evaluated and meet the environmental
requirements of appropriate national and local authorities and are consistent with OP 4.01.

Guidelines for Environmental Assessment has been prepared and has been included in the Project OM.
Subprojects submitted for financing will be environmentally screened and will be subject to an
environmental review according to the environmental guidelines. This environmental review would identify
potential environmental issues that might arise from proposed subprojects. Based upon the review, the
applicant may be asked to prepare an environmental assessment or an Environmental Management Plan to
ensure that all negative impacts are properly mitigated and monitored.

The environmental guidelines include details of environmental review procedures, institutional
arrangements for environment as well as legal requirements. Any subproject, as a condition of approval,
will be required to meet all environmental requirements and have in place all necessary approvals, licenses
and certificates as required by the government authorities. During implementation of the project, wide
participation and consultation at the central level wil be ensured through the Steering Committee that
includes representatives of the Government, NGOs and LCs.

An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was developed, finalized and disclosed in Iran and the Bank's
InfoShop prior to the appraisal mission. The appraisal mission reviewed the EMP and confirmed its
relevance and appropriate' for the project. The EMP has mitigation measures built into the Plan and these
will be dealt with through contractual clauses with the Projects' Contractors.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders of the project include Government and related agencies including the Management and
Planning Organization (MPO), the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (MOEAF), the Ministry of
Interior (MOI), municipalities, NGOs and LCs.

During the initial project preparation, the technical, financial, environmental and social issues associated
with the project were discussed in meetings attended by representatives of the LCs, municipalities, NGOs
and various other stakeholders. Consultations were held during appraisal to faciliate stakeholder
involvement and awareness at all levels or project implementation. The objective of these consultations
was to ensure that the information required for decision making would be available to interested parties.

During the implementation of the project, wide participation and consultation at the central level will be
ensured through the Steering Committee that includes representatives of Government, NGOs and LCs.

The participatory approach is integral to this project. LCs, being the lowest representative body, are forum

for the key local stakeholders together with CBOs, NGOs, municipalities, local authorities and local
communities at large are key stakeholders in this project. They are collectively engaged in all stages of the
project, including the gender-sensitive social assessment, program identification, formulation and execution.
Several examples already exist of local development committees and groups that bring together a wider
than normal range of stakeholders for project identification and management. The capacity of LCs in
developing sensitive local social assessments and community action plans would be enhanced during the
project.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
