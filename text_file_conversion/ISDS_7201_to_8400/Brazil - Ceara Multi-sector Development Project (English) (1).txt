B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 3 of PCN]
The Ceara Multi
-
Sector Reform APL would supp
ort through funding and capacity building key 
programs across sectors which contribute importantly to the achievement of development 
objectives as defined in Ceara Cidadania and the PPA. Specific development objectives (key 
outcome indicators) would be ide
ntified during project preparation.  The operation would 
enhance the government’s capability to design, budget, implement, monitor and evaluate its 
development agenda in the ‘central secretaries’ while strengthening efficient program design 
and resource us
e by key sectors and programs.
C.  Project Description 
[from section 4 of PCN]
The operation would be a combined APL/SWAp 
-
 a six
-
year $240 million program comprising 
two three
-
year SWAp
-
type loans.  The main triggers for the second operation (the APL fe
ature) 
would be the satisfaction of a majority of Performance Results Matrix (PRM) benchmarks set out 
in the first operation plus agreement on a revised PRM for the second operation.  Selection of 
sectors and benchmarks would be conducted with counterparts
 during project preparation.  Some 
$800 million in planned investment spending over the period 2004
-
2006 could be reviewed for 
partial SWAP funding.  Potential sectors/programs, grouped by the state’s development agenda 
(
Ceara Cidadania),
 include the follo
wing

.
As a core integrative aspect of the loan, this would likely 
include  institutional  strengthening  and  performance  improvements  in  debt  and  expenditure 
management, revenue, budgeting, M&E, human resource management, c
ash and asset control. 
The financial management and procurement areas will also require a technical assistance sub
-
components to ensure efficient program implementation.
Ceara Integracao
.  Water management throughout the state is a critical issue.  Bank p
rojects 
(PROGERIH, Sao Jose, PROURB) have set the framework for sustainable resource management 
and with Bank support the water company (CAGECE) has made considerable strides.  However, 
the  unfinished  agenda  is  huge  to  maintain  management  and  physical  infr
astructure  while 
extending potable water, waste water treatment and water resource management especially to the 
interior of the State.  Environmental protection is also critical as Ceara confronts challenges 
relating  to  water  course  degradation,  conservati
on  of  the  biodiverse  and  threatened 
caatinga 
(scrub forest), and degradation of coastal areas critical for water quality control and tourism.
Ceara Vida Melhor
.  
Ceara
 is making significant strides in education and health.  Programs that 
could  be  consider
ed  for  Bank  support  include  secondary  school  support
--
infrastructure  and 
education  quality,  pre
-
school  program  support,  state/municipal  coordination  including  school 
upgrading,  pedagogical  improvements,  and  teacher  education.    In  health,
  Ceara
  has  a 
distin
guished 
"agente
  de
  saúde
"  (health  agent)  program  and  is  extending  basic  coverage 
throughout the state.  Health programs to be supported could include programs to upgrade and 
extend hospital and clinic service delivery, supply pharmaceuticals, and strengthe
n primary and 
preventive  health  care.    Other  programs  dealing  specifically  with  youth  and  vulnerable 
populations, housing, and regional development might also be considered. 
Ceara Empreendedor
.  Strategic infrastructure expenditures (not involving large 
or ecologically 
questionable  projects)  could  include  basic  services  like  road  pavement  and  maintenance, 
extension of coverage for electricity to poor/un
-
served communities,  METROFOR construction 
(partly financed by Bank loan), urban transit, and regulator
y improvements.
The APL/SWAp would have the following features:

 
Eligible program expenditures would be pooled each year and the Bank will finance a 
percentage of these pooled annual expenditures (the exact percentage to be determined).  
Release of loan f
unds against incurred program expenditures will also be conditioned on 
the attainment of benchmarks in the PRM.

 
Under established precedents eligible expenditures could include salaries (percentage to 
be determined).  This could be an important incentive f
or those sectors where programs  
(finance  and  fiscal  management,  planning,  social  security,  procurement,  fiduciary 
oversight) are highly labor intensive with few capital investments
—
if indeed they require 
program expenditures. 

 
Performance results benchmar
ks will be negotiated for the six year period with emphasis 
on the first 3 year SWAp.

 
At the end of each year a Review Meeting will validate counterpart expenditures and 
compliance with PRM benchmarks, and confirm loan disbursements.
Page  3

 
Components  in  the  PRM 
will  be  weighted  according  to  agreed  importance  with  the 
weights summing to 100.  The annual programmed disbursement  will be allocated across 
sectors according to their weights.  Hence, if the education sector is accorded 20% of 
year  two  disbursement  of  $
49  million  it  will  account  for  $9.8  million.    Within  each 
sector, this amount will be allocated across specific performance benchmarks according 
to their importance.  
Non
-
achievement of any benchmark will result in non
-
disbursement 
or delayed disbursement 
of the benchmark’s corresponding  value.

 
The PRM will be adjusted at the Annual Review Meeting to take into consideration new 
developments and areas, recommendations from recently completed diagnostics and the 
external  environment.    This  flexibility  is  r
equired  to  ensure  that  the  Bank’s  program 
support and sector strengthening efforts are continuously updated and relevant.

 
The APL structure allows the Bank to review the functioning of the design arrangements 
after 
3 
years, 
make 
adjustments, 
and 
incorporat
e 
changes 
and 
new 
areas/recommendations  into  the  second  operation  through  the  mechanisms  of  eligible 
program selection and the PRM.

 
A technical assistance component will also be included to fund limited sector benchmark 
activities like key studies 
--
to ens
ure both funding and Bank oversight.  It is expected that 
amounts of up to $1
-
1.5m will be set aside for procurement and fiduciary reforms coming 
out of the SPAR and SFAA studies, thereby providing an important funding link to key 
fiduciary recommendations
.
There appear to be no legal impediments on the Bank side to such arrangements and there are 
also useful precedents.  The client has been queried on these design features and has agreed in 
principle.
