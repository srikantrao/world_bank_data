A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the project is to provide improved water supply to the urban poor in a 
sustainable manner.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project comprises four components: 
(a)  The ger area water supply component, to improve water supply in the ger areas of  Bayankhoshuu, 
Chingeltei, Dambadarjaa, Dari-Ekh, Naran, and Uliastai. 
 
(b)  The city water supply component, to strengthen the primary network system in selected areas, support 
water conservation and leakage control, and expand monitoring of water flows and water quality. 
 
(c)  The energy efficiency improvement component, to replace selected obsolete high energy consuming 
electrical equipment with energy efficient equipment. 
 
(d)  The institutional development and project management component, to support further improvements in 
selected operational and commercial aspects of USAG, as well as the overall project management. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
Ulaanbaatar (UB), Mongolia’s capital city, is located in the foothills of the Khentii Mountain range, at an 
elevation of 1,350m, along the Tuul River and in valleys of its tributaries -  the Tolgoit, the Selbe, and the 
Uliastai.  UB’s climate is continental, with very cold and dry winters with limited snowfall, and short 
summers (June-August).  The temperature is  below zero ºC from November through May.  The a
nnual 
precipitation is 250mm, of which 94% falls from April to October. 
 
The UB water source is groundwater, pumped from four well fields along the Tuul River.   In 2002 the 
water production was about 180,000m3/d.  The distribution network supplying the city core is 350 km long, 
and the raw water pipes connecting wells and pumping stations are 100 km long.  Since the pipelines were 
constructed without corrosion protection and further because of their age, breakages and leakages are on 
the  increase.   
 
Ger area residents obtain potable water from about 358 communal water kiosks supplied with water tankers 
from the city system.  Some kiosks are closed during winter because they are inaccessible to the tankers.  
Family members carry water from kiosks in containers for an average distance of about 350m.  The daily 
water consumption of between 5-10 liters per capita per day (lpcd) has been steady for years.  Some 
households

dubious quality.  
 
Apartment buildings forming the city core are provided with full range of municipal services.  The 
apartment residents are supplied with running hot and cold water, and central heating throughout the year.  
The excessive water use by the residents (over 300 lcd) has been slowly brought under control by 
installation of water meters under UBSIP.  However, a considerable number of apartments are not yet 
metered.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1 
. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project will bring about positive health and environmental benefits to the residents of selected ger areas 
through improved supply of safe drinking water.  There are no major environmental issues associated with 
the project.   
 
D.2  
Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
The majority of the impacts identified are regarded as positive.  The most significant positive impact of the 
project in the operation phase will be the availability of an increased quantity of safe drinking water on a 
sustainable basis, thus meeting a basic need for a healthy, productive life of the people in the ger areas.  
The proposed water supply schemes will ensure better service delivery, which would enable supply of safe 
water at convenient public points.  This will reduce the drudgery in fetching the daily water needs by the 
households, particularly among women and children.  The time and labor saved due to the better and more 
convenient service could provide opportunities for income generation, especially for women.  Construction 
of water supply pipelines is likely to have negative impacts on noise and air quality but only in the short-
term.    
D.3 
. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)  
Since the ger areas are under-serviced in terms of potable water supply, only the “with project” scenario 
would bring the positive/beneficial impacts that would significantly improve the living conditions and 
enhance the social and economic development of those areas.  Alternatives examined included: providing 
water to the ger households through water tankers feeding kiosks on a daily or other basis; piped water from 
local boreholes, the 
q
ualit
y
 of water from which is acce
p
table onl
y
 with some chlorination; and connectin
g

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

the kiosks to the city network.  The option of connecting to the city network was chosen where it was cost 
effective.  In the case of Uliastai, tanker supply remains the only realistic option.    
 
D.4
. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described
. 
The Borrower has prepared the Environemtnal Impact Assessment (EIA), the Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP), the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), and the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).  The 
EIA, the EMP, the RAP and the RPF have been disclosed as required under Bank requirements.  The PMU 
has implemented resettlement under UBSIP satisfactorily.  Its capacity to implement the Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) is being strengthened by establishing an environment ‘cell’ within it, staffed with 
at least one professional with experience in water and sanitation.  There are already such personnel within 
MUB who could be seconded to the PMU.  PMU staff will be trained in implementing safeguards to meet 
Bank requirements. 
 
D.5. 
. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Consultations were carried out with the communities using household survey questionnaires (2000 
respondents) and interviews with ‘key stakeholders’.  Key stakeholders were defined as households in the 
project area, civil society organizations, government agencies, khoroo leaders and other key persons in the 
community such as teachers, health workers, doctors etc.  The project concept was received 
enthusiastically.  Concern was expressed about the impacts during the construction phase, but it was 
recognized that these would persist only until project completion.  All people met expressed a strong desire 
for better conditions in the ger areas.  The most significant changes made to project design relate to the 
locations of water kiosks within each khoroo.
