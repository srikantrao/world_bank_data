A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project’s development objective
is to foster the development of adequate tools and 
mechanisms to facilitate future large-scale restoration of riparian forests throughout the 
State of São Paulo, both in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado Biomes, while providing 
opportunities for improved livelihoods and economic well-being of rural communities. 
 
The global objectives
of this project are to: 
(a
)
stop and reverse
 
land degradation 
processes in the State of São Paulo, with special focus on riparian ecosystems, both in 
public and private areas; 
(b)
 restore the structure, function, and ecosystem services of 
riparian forests located within productive agricultural landscapes; 
(c) 
increase carbon 
sequestration in riparian forests and in agricultural soils; and 
(d) 
contribute to the 
conservation of biodiversity of global importance through the planning and 
implementation of corridors of native riparian forests as a means of connecting fragments 
of remaining native vegetation, and capacity building activities that enable long-term 
biodiversity conservation. These objectives can be met through restoration and 
conservation of agro-pastoral lands and of riparian forests in rural areas, pursuant to GEF 
Operational Program 15, with specific relevance to OP #3. 
 
The proposed project would support the long-term restoration of globally important 
Page  2
riparian ecosystems and adjacent agro-ecosystems through strategic actions addressing 
key land degradation issues and constraints. Financing the incremental costs associated 
with the restoration of these ecosystems, it would build on the Baseline Scenario by: (i) 
developing a comprehensive policy and regulatory framework to support the 
implementation of payment mechanisms for services rendered by riparian forests, with a 
special focus on the needs of small, poor farmers; (ii) testing and validating practices for 
ecosystem restoration: (iii) increasing capacity for production of seeds retrieval and 
seedlings production, to respond to future demand from a state-wide program for 
restoration of riparian forests; (iv)  implementing sustainable land management practices 
to restore and reduce pressure on both agricultural and riparian forest lands, the latter 
focused on pilot/demonstrative on-the-ground investment in at least 15 microwatersheds; 
(v) strengthening institutional and community capacity to address land degradation 
issues, and increasing public awareness of the importance of and need to support 
sustainable land management; and (vi) improved institutional capacity to coordinate 
cross-sectoral interventions and to monitor and disseminate project impacts and results, 
respectively. Under the GEF Alternative, the Government of São Paulo would be able to 
undertake a cross-sectoral program generating both national and global benefits. It would 
contribute to the protection of globally important biodiversity hotspots and assist the 
country in developing adequate tools and mechanisms to facilitate future large-scale 
restoration of riparian forests, while providing additional opportunities for improved 
livelihoods and economic well-being of rural communities – as a result from better 
farmers organization and increased land productivity fostered by the more adequate 
management of agro-pastoral lands. Benefits generated from this alternative approach 
would include both national and global benefits.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 
–
Policy Development
 (Total US$1.47 M, GEF US$0.89 M)
.
This component’s objective is to set in place a realistic technical, financial, and economic 
framework for future implementation of a state wide program for the sustainable 
restoration of riparian forests. There are two sub-components: (i) development of a 
System for Payment for Environmental Services, and (ii) formulation of a State Program 
for Recovery Riparian Forests (PEMC). 
 
Component 2 - Support to Sustainable Riparian Forest Restoration
 (Total US$1.98 
M, GEF US$ 0.70 M). 
This component’s objective is to ensure the development and dissemination of 
appropriate methodologies, as well as improve the market offer of seeds of native trees in 
the quality and quantity necessary for the full restoration of riparian forests in the State of 
São Paulo. There are two sub-components: (i) the development and validation of a 
methodology for riparian forest restoration, and (ii) the harvesting of seeds and 
production of seedlings of native species. 
 
Component 3 
–
On-the-Ground Investments in Sustainable Land Management 
practices 
(Total US$10.28 M, GEF US$ 2.17 M)
.
This component’s objective is to promote and disseminate ideas, methodologies, and 
Page  3
technologies for sustainable management of natural resources in productive areas, and for 
the sustainable restoration of riparian forests in the State. Some of the practices to be 
fostered by this component include no-till agriculture, use of green manure, terracing, 
building of fences to isolate and protect water springs and stream margins, stabilization 
and restoration of gullies, adoption of rotational pasture practices and construction of 
watering points for animal consumption.  
There are two sub-components: (i) investments in sustainable land management practices 
in agricultural and pasture lands, and (ii) implementation of demonstrative pilot projects 
for restoration of riparian forests. 
 
Component 4 
–
Environmental Education and Training
 (Total US$ 2.40 M, GEF 
US$ 1.7 M) 
This component’s objective is to set the basis for a more visible and effective 
participation of local populations in the planning and implementation of local/regional 
development and conservation activities, with a focus on better quality of life stemming 
from the sustainable management of natural resources. There are four sub-components: 
(i) environmental education for school teachers through additional modules and 
information in the formal educational curricula, (ii) mobilization of stakeholders and 
dissemination of information within the five priority river basins, (iii) training of various 
project executors (rural extensionists, technical staff within the State Secretariat of 
Environment and the Secretariat of Agriculture/CATI, and volunteer environmental 
agents operating under the PEMH, and (iv) training of project beneficiaries (farmers) in 
sustainable land management practices and approaches at the microwatershed level.  All 
training and environmental education activities will focus not only on the local benefits 
of sustainable land management and restoration/conservation of riparian forests, but also 
on global environmental issues relevant to the particular realities of the various clients.  
 
Component 5 
–
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Information 
Dissemination.
 (Total US$ 2.77 M, GEF US$ 1.38 M) 
This component’s objective is to coordinate, manage, and monitor, on a continuous basis, 
all activities supported under the project, as well as to disseminate project results at the 
regional, state, and national levels.    There are three sub-components: (i) intra and inter-
institutional coordination for effective project management, (ii) monitoring and 
evaluation of project activities and objectives, and (iii) dissemination of information 
within project activities and to other interested public. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will be implemented in five watersheds, selected according to criteria related 
to (i) the physical environment, especially those linked with geomorphology and to 
factors of soil potential and susceptibility; (ii) the intensity of natural plant cover 
(favoring priority areas for conservation in the Cerrado and the Atlantic Rainforest); (iii) 
agricultural characteristics and levels of poverty and soil use. The watersheds for the 
implementation of demonstration projects are Paraíba do Sul River; the Piracicaba, 
Capivari and Jundiaí Rivers; the Mogi
-
Guaçu River; the Tietê/Jacaré Rivers and the 
Page  4
Aguapeí River. These watersheds meet the conditions established by the project: they 
include areas representative of the factors that hinder (or impede) the recovery of riparian 
forests and contain areas considered to be priorities for conserving the biodiversity of the 
Atlantic Rainforest and the Cerrado.  The areas where demonstration projects will be 
implemented, are to be selected, in priority watersheds, during the project implementation 
phase, taking into consideration consultations with priority Watershed Committees as 
well as interaction with the State Microcatchments Program. Specific criteria for 
selection of pilot microwatersheds have been defined for each watershed.
