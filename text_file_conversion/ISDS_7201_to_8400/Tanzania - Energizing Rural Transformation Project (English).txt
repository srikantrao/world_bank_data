B.  Project Objectives:
The development objective is to improve the quality of life of rural and peri
-
urban households 
and to raise 
the incomes generated/jobs created by enterprises in those areas 
–
 by means of increased access of 
households, enterprises and social facilities to electricity and ICT services.
2a. Proposed global objective
The project’s global objective, i
n line with GEF OP6, is to remove the barriers to, and reduce the 
implementation costs of, renewable energy technologies to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. 
Proposed GEF co
-
financing supports OP6 strategic priorities 
–
 expanding productive uses of r
enewable 
energy (institutional solar PV systems for social services) and promoting power sector policy frameworks 
supportive of renewable energy (stand
-
alone grids). 
C.  Project Description:

Only Phase 1 (four years) of the proposed APL is presented her
e. 
The project would be financed by an 
IDA credit of about $80 million, GEF grants of about $7
-
10m, and carbon finance of about $5
-
10m for 
purchase of emission reductions. The balance would be mainly from private sources (electricity and ICT 
project sponso
rs, including a commercialized TANESCO).

TA and Capacity Bu
ilding
:  The project will finance: (a) capacity building in the fledgling rural 
electrification and ICT institutions (line Ministry, subsidy intermediation by REF and RCDF, 
regulation), (b) cost
-
shared business development services to qualified private pro
moters of RE 
and ICT sub
-
projects, (c) designing credit enhancement mechanisms to facilitate local 
commercial finance for 8
-
15 year terms; and (d) strengthening of the ICT policy, legal, 
regulatory and institutional framework in the ICT sector.
Electricity
 Investments:
It is expected that 50,000 new connections in rural and peri
-
urban 
areas will be made annually at a cost of about $30m/year, which includes the upgrading and 
reinforcement of the existing medium and low voltage networks that is necessary to 
serve the 
additional demand. 
T
his program will entail (a) distribution extensions from TANESCO’s grid 
as well as independent grids owned/operated by TANESCO or other service providers, (b) solar 
photovoltaic systems in remote social service facilities to m
eet their high
-
priority electricity/ICT 
needs; and (c) small solar systems for household and other private users able to afford cash 
purchases of equipment.  Investments in renewable energy independent grids and solar PV 
systems will be supported by partia
l (and declining) GEF grants or ‘carbon credit’ purchases.
ICT Investments:
 The project will support (a) expansion of ICT access and coverage to rural 
and underserved communities, primarily through telephony and internet connectivity 
-
 the latter 
by expand
ing points of presence (POPs), and enabling local area ISPs that tap into the POPs 
-
 by 
competitively allocating capital subsidies administered by the RCDF, and (b) expansion of ICT 
services focusing on high priority social services. 
Alternative Developme
nt Interventions/Approaches:
First, 
an ICT component was included 
in view of the synergies on the supply side, as well as the potential for a much greater combined 
impact. 
Second, 
the option of sole reliance on the private sector was abandoned in favor of
 a 
public
-
private partnership model, because, at present in Tanzania, it is difficult to induce the 
private sector to undertake any significant investments in rural infrastructure.

Lending instrument:
An APL fits well with the GoT’s desire for long
-
term su
pport for electricity and 
ICT access. Furthermore, a three
-
phase APL makes it possible to define a long
-
term strategy in which the 
institutions and policy framework are established in the first phase, leading to accelerated scale
-
up in the 
second and third
 phases. 
D.  Project location (if known)
Program activities will be located throughout Tanzania. However, a spatial coverage of the program may 
emerge as the program will be informed by the on
-
going Rural Electrification Master Plan, Private Sector 
Parti
cipation (PSP) interest, and the location of the existing location of the transmission and distribution 
network.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
Tanzania has recently developed some institutional capacity for relev
ant safeguard policies from 
experience with different sector lending programs and projects. For instance, in agriculture with the 
satisfactory implementation of the environmental and pest management action plan for the Tanzania 
Agricultural Research Projec
t (which is closing on June 30, 2004) and the pest management plan for the 
National Agricultural Extension Project (which closed on December 31, 2003). More recently an ESMF 
and RPF were prepared for the Participatory Agricultural Development and Empowerme
nt Project 
(PADEP), which is now effective. In the education sector, the Government of Tanzania also prepared an 
ESMF and RPF for the recently approved Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP).  In 
addition, the Government has taken several steps (po
licy and institutional development) under the Poverty 
Reduction Support Credit towards greater mainstreaming of environmental issues and building capacity 
for environmental assessment both at the national and district level. The National Environment 
Manage
ment Council (NEMC) has been involved in reviewing these documents and is significantly 
knowledgeable on the Banks Safeguards Policies. Also, NEMC staff have recently benefited from 
training on Bank Safeguards. 
Proportionately also, Tanzania has a much b
igger land surface area devoted to resource conservation 
(29%) than most countries. The hierarchical protected
-
area system consists of national parks (12), game 
reserves (28), the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (1), and game
-
controlled areas (38), comprising
 a total 
of 240,000 km
2
. In addition to the wildlife
-
protected areas, there are 540 forest reserves covering 132,000 
km
2
, equivalent to 15% of the total woodland and forest area in Tanzania. There is also the Mafia Island 
Marine Park.
Thus,  Tanzania has 
a substantial institutional capacity for safeguards policies.

applies because the ERT 
program will finance investments in power generation, transmission, distribution and 
marketing to largely rural communities and in some instances to peri
-
urban communities 
too. The progr
am will also finance the expansion of telephone and internet services to 
rural communities. The location of the areas/locations where investments will be located 
will be determined during  program implementation. Therefore, the GoT is preparing an 
Page  4

Environm
ental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to ensure that the 
environmental and social issues associated with this program are adequately analyzed and 
understood, and that all associated adverse impacts are captured through screening, 
effectively mitigat
ed and monitored and that the institutional capacity to ensure this 
happens is maintained and supported financially through the program. The ESMF will be 
sent to the Bank for review and clearance before it is disclosed publicly in Tanzania.

In most cases program activities will be 
so designed and routed that this poli
cy will not be triggered. However, for the few cases 
that may trigger it, the GoT is also preparing a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) , to 
ensure that the needs of those who are affected by the land acquisition needs of the 
program activities, loss of 
assets and/or access to their individual or community 
economic, social and cultural resources, are addressed in such a manner that ensures their 
pre
-
program status is at least restored if not improved upon. The RPF will also address 
how those affected in t
his way will be consulted to ensure their meaningful and effective 
participation. The RPF will also be sent to the Bank for clearance and approval before it 
is disclosed publicly in Tanzania.
