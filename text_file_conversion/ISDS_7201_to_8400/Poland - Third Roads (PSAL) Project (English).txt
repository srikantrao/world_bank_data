A.2. Project Objectives
The project aims to improve the effectiveness of Poland's national road rehabilitation and maintenance
systems, particularly dimensions of quality, efficiency, road safety, financial viability, and road user
satisfaction. Outputs to be delivered in pursuit of this objective include: (i) improved capacity within
GDDKiA to operate efficiently and effectively, and to reflect the views of road users in developing its
programs; (ii) the establishment of reliable and stable funding for the national network and for road safety;
(iii) improved absorptive capacity within the road administration systems; and (iv) a significant increase in
the percentage of national roads in good and fair conditions.
Achievement of the Project Development Objective will be confirmed using the following key indicators:
(i) evidence of adoption and continued use of improved road rehabilitation and maintenance practices
within GDDKiA; (ii) evidence of adoption and use by government of a coherent 6-year rolling roads
expenditure program together with an adequately balanced maintenance/investment program; (iii)
significant increase in the percentage of the road network in good condition when compared with pre-
project conditions; and (iv) evidence of high road user satisfaction following rehabilitation or maintenance
operations when users are polled, both about the quality of the completed sections and the inconveniences
associated with the rehabilitation or maintenance processes.
The latest CAS for Poland was approved in November 2002. During the discussions, the Government
requested support for its restructuring of the national road agency as one of its highest priorities. In light of
these discussions, the CAS includes the following assessment (paragraph 67) under the development theme
of enhancing private sector-led growth and employment creation:
New lending would help finance increased infrastructure investment particularly in roads. A proposed loan
would support the commercialization of the national roads agency and development of other institutional
capacity, and help Poland address road financing and other key sector policy issues. As a number of
Poland's other partners are involved in roads, including the EU, EIB and EBRD, with far greater resources
at Poland's disposal in the coming years than the World Bank, the Bank's financing would be structured in
such a way to facilitate the full use of those other funds.
A.3. Project Description
The proposed E100 million project will be financed under a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) structured to
support the rehabilitation, and maintenance of economic, social, and institutional roads infrastructure, as
well as to finance consultant services and management and training programs. Although a significant share
of the project is devoted to finance physical investment related to roads rehabilitation and maintenance, it
also provide support to the badly needed improvement of the institutional capacity of the GDDKiA.



The project loan amounts to E100 million, equivalent to US$123.4 million and includes four components:
(a) GDDKiA modernization action plan [US$2.5 million]; (b) national roads maintenance and rehabilitation
program [US$111 .0 million]; (c) road safety improvement program [US$5.6 million]; and (d) promotion of
public-private partnerships in the road sector [US$ 0.6 million]. The remaining balance
[US$3.7]corresponds to unallocated and front-end-fee.
1 - GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan [US$2.5 million]: The GDDKiA Modernization Action Plan
(MAP) was prepared and agreed upon on the structure of the policy matrix used at an earlier stage of the
project preparation. In addition to a reference made to the road safety and the PPP promotion, the MAP is
articulated around four major topics: (i) to carry out detailed diagnosis of current situation of GDDKiA,
implement modernization measures at GDDKiA headquarters and launch works for development of
procedures for preparation and implementation of roads projects [Stage 1]; (ii) to complete the process of
GDDKiA reorganization at central level, undertake reorganization at regional level and finish works on
procedures for preparation and implementation of roads projects [Stage 2]; (iii) to establish a proper system
of strategic planning at GDDKiA that reflects better roads' users needs [Stage 3]; and (iv) to evaluate
efficiency of implemented measures, pursue modernization of the gaps that will continue after stages I to 3
and review potential for further improvements in order to further increase efficiency of GDDKiA.
2 - Road maintenance and rehabilitation program [US$111.0 million]: The road maintenance and
rehabilitation program has been prepared by GDDKiA within the framework of the budget 2004. The total
road expenditure program amounts to PLN5.5 billion (equivalent to US$1.4 billion), to which the national
budget contributes to PLNI.5 billion (equivalent to US$375 million), i.e., 27%. The other source of funds
are provided by the newly established National Roads Fund, and EU related financial supports. The
National budget funds and those from the project are pooled together and amounts to PLNO.6 billion
equivalent to US$158.6 million.
3 - Road safety improvement program [US$5.6 million]: The objective of the Road safety improvement
program is to significantly reduce current road accidents cost to society estimated at more than 2% of
GDP. Road safety equipment has been already provided under the previous Roads Projects mainly to the
traffic Police to enhance its enforcement capacity. It was a part of GAMBIT 2000, a comprehensive Road
Safety Program carried out in close collaboration inter alia with the Ministry of Interior and
Administration, and the National Police. A set of regional programs, oriented to modify areas of accidents,
as permitted to develop a close relationship with local authorities. However, implementation of the
nationwide Road Safety Program requires further strict action on the procurement of road safety equipment,
and to continue the implementation of exemplary projects at the local level, on the educational aspects of
pedestrians and drivers, on the adequate preventive signalization, and on the elimination of individual black
spots.
4 - Promotion of PPP in the road sector [US$0.6 million]: In order to increase private sector involvement
in the financing and operating of road infrastructure, technical assistance will be provided to GDDKiA and
Mol to define an adequate policy framework providing incentive for the development of PPP schemes in
Poland. It is expected that at the end of the project, at least one combined routine/periodic maintenance
concession would have been awarded through international competitive bidding process.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: As the project
is providing budgetary support to the Road Administration for road maintenance and rehabilitation, its
location is spread all over Poland's national roads network. The works financed under the proposed project
are related to maintenance and rehabilitation, i.e., the eight first standards defined in the attached Technical
Annex, which does not require any land acquisition, as the geometry of the roads remain unchanged.
B. Check Environmental Category A [],B [],C [],FI [x]



Comments: Given its focus on maintenance and rehabilitation of roads without expansion and new
construction, the project has been rated as category Fl (Financial Intermediary). As a results of the project
SWAp design, the nature of the work it finances is well known, but not its precise location. Having good
procedures for meeting environmental and social safeguards issues as these sub-projects are identified and
implemented is therefore crucial. Therefore, an EMP, included in the project Operational Manual has been
prepared and published both locally and at the Infoshop.

Involuntary resettlement: Since no new road segments or expanded roads will be financed, the involuntary
resettlement safeguards will not be triggered. Furthermore, road maintenance and rehabilitation works
supported by the project will not involve acquisition of land. In connection with the broader SWAp
framework proposal, a team of social specialists has visited Poland to review Polish procedures for land
acquisition and resettlement.
Cultural Dropertv and chance findines: Protection of cultural heritage is currently regulated by the Act of
23 July 2003 on Protection of Monuments (Dz.U. of 2003 No 162 item 1568). This new law, which
replaced the old Law of 1962 on Cultural Heritage Protection has reinforced the already quite strict rules
concerning protection of cultural heritage. In fact its requirements in this context, including far reaching
powers of cultural heritage authorities (so called 'Conservators of Monuments") in relation to planning and
development control are often considered to be too rigid. Chance findings during works are regulated by
the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage which is empowered to give and recall permits for carrying
out conservational, archeological and excavatory works and on terms of carrying out of these works and on
qualifications of persons carrying out these works (Dz.U.00.93.1033).
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas

Technical Annex
Maintenance and Improvement Standards
Definition of Maintenance and Improvement Standards
The Polish computerized road management system (HDM-4) works on the basis of policies for each section
whether, representative or physical, sub-divided into standards and works. Each policy may contain several
maintenance and/or improvement standards. Eight maintenance and six improvement standards have been
defined for the existing four road classes in Poland. These have been further subdivided depending on the
thickness and type of material used. The new sections or committed projects are defined separately. The
table below describe the technical standards and objectives.
The eiaht first standards are related to maintenance and rehabilitation supported by the
present proiect and which does not require any land acquisition, whilst the following six are
related to road improvement with significant changes in the geometry of the existing roads.
i.                             ,..  4 '  '  -                               --  .  -   -
(I)       Minimum       The minimum maintenance standard has been designed to reflect the current
Maintenance    practice in the absence of major maintenance works. These include the following
items
Patching: Repair of surface distresses such as potholing, wide structural cracking
and ravelling. It is carried out annually.
Crack Sealing: This technique treats transverse thermal cracking and even wide
structural cracking when limited in area. It is carried out annually.
Routine Works: Routine works include all works, which do not have any effect on
pavement performance as modelled in HDM-4. These works include shoulder
repairs and routine miscellaneous works such as vegetation control, road sign
repairs and replacement, line marking, guardrail repair and replacement, etc...
Routine works are carried out annually. An annual cost is specified for each road
class.
Winter Maintenance: Winter maintenance includes all works carried out as part of
winter maintenance such as salt spreading; snow removal, etc. An annual cost is
specified for each road class. It applies to all roads.
(2/3)  Surface Treatment To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to
(Single or Double) delay major intervention and renewal of the skid resistance.
(4)    Surface Treatment To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to
With Shape     delay major intervention, improving roughness and renewal of the skid resistance.
Correction
(5)     Resurfacing by  To renew surface characteristics including skid resistance, to improve roughness
Overlay      and to contribute towards the overall pavement strength. Overlay by surfacing
included thickness between 30 and 50mm and were applied over a roughness
values varying from 3 to 5 IRI and low rutting level.



ver ay    surface characteristics.  Strengthening by overlay concerned the
application of multi-layer overlays (two or three layers) varying from a
thickness of 80 to 270 mm applied over a range of roughness values
varying from 4 to 9 IRI.
(7)    Strengthening by Mill and To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to reach the critical
Replace         stage (poor or fair rutting condition), improve roughness and renew
surface characteristics.  It is achieved by removing the distressed top
asphalt layer (s) and replacing it (them) with a new (or recycled) asphalt
of similar thickness but with better structural characteristics. This
standard was applied over a range of rutting varying from 10 to 35 mm.
(8)        Strengthening by   To reconstruct pavements, which have reached the failure stage (poor
Reconstruction     roughness condition). Reconstruction is achieved through removal of the
old pavement structure down to the subbase course and replacing it with a
new (or recycled) pavement structure with high strength. Pavement
structures varied according to road class and were applied over a range of
roughness values carrying from 8 to 11 IRI
(9)    Widening to 7 m        To increase the narrow roads to a minimum standard road width of 7
metres. This standard is applicable to Main roads with 6 metre or less
width.
(10)   2 Lanes addition to Single To add two lanes to a single 2-lane carriageway (not dualisation) in order
Carriageways           to increase capacity. This improvement standard is applied over a wide
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied
to Trunk and Main roads, which are not dual yet.
(11)    1 Lane addition to Dual To add I lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to
Carriageways           increase capacity. This improvement standard is applied over a wide
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways.
(12)   2 Lanes addition to Dual To add 2 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to
Carriageways           increase capacity. This improvement standard is applied over a wide
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways.
(13)   Reconstruct to          To upgrade GP roads to Expressway single carriageway standard. This
Expressway Single      improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity
Carriageway            ratios varying from 0.5 to I
(14)   Reconstruct to          To upgrade GP roads to Expressway dual carriageway standard. This
Expressway Dual        improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity
Carriageway            ratios varying from 0.5 to 1
