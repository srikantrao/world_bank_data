B.  Project Objectives  
 
The proposed regional project would aim at contributing to revert the trend in 
rapid growth of HIV/AIDS incidence in Central Asia through: 
 
(i) harmonization 
of 
regional policy
 regarding prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS; 
(ii) 
development of regional partnerships between different sectors and agencies; 
(iii) 
development and harmonization of 
surveillance
 on HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB; 
(iv) 
capacity building
 on prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS; and 
(v) 
prevention and treatment 
of HIV/AIDS. 
 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
 
The following project components will be further discussed with 
counterparts: 
 
(i)
 
Policy development and monitoring & evaluation 
(estimated cost $2 
million). This component would support the Regional AIDS Committee that 
would steer project preparation and implementation, and coordinate the 
strategic approaches and  policies concerning HIV/AIDS in Central Asia, 
Page  2
 
 
including legislation affecting highly vulnerable groups; anti-discrimination 
laws; and policy regarding use of anti-retroviral drugs. This component would 
develop a regional framework to establish common approaches for 
registration, procurement, quality assurance and price negotiations for 
pharmaceuticals and related medical technology and supplies as they relate to 
HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment.  The component would also establish 
monitoring and evaluation of regional progress on prevention and treatment of 
HIV/AIDS. 
 
(ii) 
Development of partnerships between different sectors and agencies 
(estimated cost $5 million). This component would aim at increasing civil 
society participation on HIV/AIDS control in Central Asia. It would support 
the participation of governmental, private sector and non-governmental 
organizations in regional activities promoted by the Regional AIDS 
Committee. It may be organized as a fund that would finance regional 
activities on a demand-driven and competitive basis. 
 
(iii) 
Strengthening epidemiological surveillance and lab capacity 
(estimated 
cost $5 million). This component would upgrade and harmonize surveillance 
of HIV/AIDS, STIs and TB in Central Asia, especially focusing on sentinel 
surveillance

. The component would support the development of regional 
protocols for establishing regional information and data standards, common 
forms and reporting procedures.   
 
(iv)
  
Building regional capacity to tackle the epidemic 
(estimated cost $7 
million),  including leadership, policy development and surveillance; outreach 
work with groups at risk, and updated treatment protocols; and project 
management, including financial management, procurement, and monitoring 
and evaluation. The component would support the development of a regional 
School of Public Health.
  
 
(v)
  
Prevention and control of HIV/AIDS 
(estimated cost $5 million). This 
component would support the development of regional outreach work with  
mobile highly vulnerable groups and vulnerable groups (CSWs, truck drivers, 
migrant workers, army, etc); and dissemination of guidelines regarding blood 
safety and of evidence-based protocols of care for PMTCT and for treatment 
of PLHWA.  
 
(vi)
 Project 
Management 
(estimated cost $1 million). Several options are being 
considered for project management and implementation of this regional 
project

Sentinel surveillance
 allows monitoring of the population’s epidemic through small-scale sampling of 
specific subgroups. It can include special studies of HIV prevalence in highly vulnerable populations such 
as IDUs, anonymous and unlinked testing of blood obtained for other purposes such as in blood donations, 
and testing of institutionalized or military populations on a regular basis.
