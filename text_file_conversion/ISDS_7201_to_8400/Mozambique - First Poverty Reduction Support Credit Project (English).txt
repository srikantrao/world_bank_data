Project Objectives  
 
The proposed PRSC1 is the first of a program of fours single-tranche operations   
aiming to contribute to poverty reduction in Mozambique and ultimately to progress 
towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals by supporting high growth and 
improved service delivery.  The PRSC1 will support the Government’s Action Plan for 
the Reduction of Absolute Poverty (PARPA) focusing specifically on policies and 
reforms aiming to improve the living conditions of the population by promoting growth 
and employment, accelerating human resource development, and strengthening 
governance and public sector management.  PRSC1 will also support the Government 
maintain macroeconomic stability by helping to close the external financing gap as well 
as to generate the domestic funds required to execute the policies and programs included 
in the PARPA.   
 
Project Description  
 
PRSC1 will address the policy dialogue on cross-cutting, fiduciary issues including 
governance and public financial management, supporting specific cross-sectoral actions 
to strengthen public sector performance and enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the 
use of public resources.  In particular, the PRSC1 will address reforms in governance and 
public financial management, supporting in particular a new financial management 
system, key legal reforms and budget allocation to the PARPA priority sectors.  The 
proposed PRSC1 is the first of a program of four single-tranche operations planned 
between FY04 and FY07.  It is expected that based on successful completion of prior 
actions identified in PRSC1, the program will move on to support sector specific reforms 
in health, agriculture, education and rural water supply.  The content of PRSC2, PRSC3 
and PRSC4 will be defined during preparation of PRSC2 and it will be based upon 
progress made on policy reforms under PRSC1.   
 
Project location   
 
The project is not location-specific.  Due to the policy content of the PRSC and its 
overarching objective of  supporting the Government’s own poverty reduction strategy, 
the geographic and social target of the program can be identified with the territory and 
population of Mozambique.  PRSC1 will be implemented by the Ministry of Planning 
and Finance and the following PRSC operations will be managed by line ministries as the 
sector specific focus of the program will require.

A [ ], B [], C [X ], FI [ ], TBD [ ] 
 
Given the strong policy content of the PRSC program, it is expected that the impact of 
the reforms supported through the PRSC will have negligible impact on the environment.  
However, in order to mainstream the environment in the PRSC process, and in 
consideration of the sectoral characterization of PRSC2, PRSC3, and PRSC4, the 
Government intends to carry out an environmental impact assessment for these 
operations
. 
 In this regard, the PRSC team intends to take in full consideration the 
extensive work already completed under individual sector operations relevant to the 
specific sectoral activities as the program unfolds.   
 
In particular, sector wide EIAs and sector reports as well as project specific safeguard 
reports were completed under the ongoing operations in compliance with the applicable 
safeguard requirements.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, 
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project 
 
The proposed credit has a strong policy focus on fiduciary and public sector reform.  No 
potential adverse environmental and social effects are expected to be associated with 
implementation of the program.  
 
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Describe any potential cumulative or long term impacts.  
 
There are no cumulative or large scale impacts associated with the reforms supported by 
PRSC1. 
 
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required) 
 
N/A 
 
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues 
 
The Government of Mozambique intends to carry out an Environmental Impact 
Assessment to identify and mitigate potential adverse environmental and social impact in 
the sectors where investments will be financed under the PRSC program - PRSC2, 
PRSC3 and PRSC4.  Arrangements will be made accordingly during preparation of these 
operations. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard 
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The PRSC1 is being prepared as part of the Government’s broad consultation process of 
poverty monitoring, which involves operationalization of the Poverty Observatory, a 
consultative body involving civil society and all development partners, and 
implementation of the PARPA, the poverty reduction strategy, through the Performance 
Assessment Framework (PAF), a monitoring matrix agreed by the Government with its 
development partners. 
  
E. Safeguards Classification

Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. 
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the 
provisions of that policy apply.
