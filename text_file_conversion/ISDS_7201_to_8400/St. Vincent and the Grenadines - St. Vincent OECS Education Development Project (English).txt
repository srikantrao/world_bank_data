A.2. Project Objectives 
The project objectives will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary 
education; (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more 
direct interventions and provision of resources at the school level, a focus on student-
centered learning and mechanisms to provide student support, and (iii) strengthening 
management of the sector and governance of schools. The performance indicators in the 
table below will be used to measure progress in meeting the established development 
objectives.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project description has been developed by stakeholder working groups and presented 
by the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (GOSVG). The proposed project 
content is founded in the country’s Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP) and 
takes into consideration the areas covered by other donor funding
.
   
 
Component 1. Increase equitable access
. Absolute enrolment in secondary has 
experienced a yearly increase of 1.3% between 1993 and 2003 and should continue to 
grow markedly to the year 2010, experiencing a peak between 2005 and 2007. There is a 
long-term need for 1,800 additional places in secondary to achieve universal coverage 
within the next five to seven years. Based on results from a recent school mapping 
exercise and building analysis, the project will support:  
Page  3
 
 
1.1. the construction of a new school in Belair, in the largest census district of 
Calliaqua and 
1.2. the rehabilitation of three secondary schools. 
 
Component 2. Improve quality
.  
2.1 
Upgrading of teacher skills and standards
. This subcomponent aims to improve the 
quality of teaching and learning. A recently adopted teacher appraisal system will be 
instrumental for evaluation and continuous assessment of teacher performance and will 
guide the activities for this subcomponent. The following activities will be financed: (i) 
an audit of the teaching system; (ii) the development and implementation of a screening 
system for new entrants to the teaching force; (iii) the provision of certificate-level in-
service training for uncertified graduate and non-graduate teachers in content and 
methodology and (iv) the establishment of professional development grants and a Master 
Teacher program for exemplary teachers. 
 
2.2 
Curriculum development for Forms I to III.
 This will support ongoing efforts in SVG 
to review and update the secondary curriculum, in line with the ESDP, and will 
complement ongoing work by the OERU for the sub-region. This sub-component aims 
to: (i) develop a national curriculum policy; (ii) complete the national assessment policy 
for secondary education; (iii) develop curriculum guides for the first three years of 
secondary education in key subject areas and (iv) establish a National Curriculum 
Advisory Committee. 
 
2.3 
Literacy enrichment and support
.  The project will improve students’ literacy levels 
through: (i) specialized literacy training for ten teachers in diagnosis, concepts and 
methodology; (ii) establishment of a literacy resource centre for teachers and curriculum 
officers; (iii) establishment of learning resource centers in six rural secondary schools and 
classroom libraries in eight low-performing primary schools and (iv) training of 
secondary school library assistants.   
 
2.4 
Improved student support services
. This will include: (i) specialized training for 12 
guidance officers (ii) training and resource materials to enable students to function as 
peer counselors and mentors; (iii) training and resource materials for 360 parents to help 
them provide necessary support to their children; (iv) student-led extra-curricular 
activities, targeting boys especially and (v) training of 60 remedial teachers to provide 
support to selected students.  
 
Component 3. Strengthen management and governance
. This component is key to the 
achievement of the project and sector objectives. At this stage, the Government has 
identified need for
 
technical assistance to: (i) develop an appropriate legal and regulatory 
framework for the operations of the MEYS, establishing the foundation for adequate 
governance and management of the education system; (ii) train school principals, parents 
and teachers to design and carry out school development plans and (iii) improve and 
expand the EMIS and upgrade the staff database and the integration of this information in 
the EMIS.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
A school mapping exercise, funded by DFID in 2003, has identified a long-term need for 
1,800 additional places in secondary to achieve universal coverage within the next five to 
seven years. The deficit is most acute in the districts of Calliaqua and Central 
Leeward/Barrouallie. In fact, Calliaqua is one of two districts without a secondary school, 
despite being the largest census district accounting for one fifth of the population. The 
GOSVG has used a recent building analysis and the school mapping documents to make 
final decisions regarding the need for new schools and their locations. The Government 
has requested support from the World Bank to build the school in Calliaqua (Belair). 
 
The GOSVG has acquired approximately 3.8 acres of land at Belair. National budgetary 
allocations have been made for the construction of a bridge and access road to facilitate 
school construction (completion is a condition for disbursement), and the GOSVG has 
initiated the purchase of an adjoining 4.1 acres to be used for recreational purposes and 
curricula activities such as Agricultural Science. The site is ideally located away from 
immediate vehicular traffic and dwelling homes, yet within the vicinity of the main 
population centres and feeder primary schools. Residents of Belair and environs were 
consulted (March 2004) and support the idea of construction of a secondary school. There 
are no resettlement issues.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Construction of a new school requires an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). The 
GOSVG has carried out the EIA, and it has been reviewed and approved by the Bank.  
No significant issues have been identified. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
N/A. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The GOSVG has used the Bank’s 
Guidelines for Addressing Environmental and Social 
Safeguard Issues in World Bank Education Projects in Latin America and the Caribbean
 
to guide the EIA and has agreed to include the guidelines in all bidding documents for 
civil works. An Operations Manual has been developed which details the selection and 
construction process.  The aforementioned Guidelines also establish the minimum 
procedures to handle any unexpected cultural property issues. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the residents of Belair. A public meeting was held in March 
2004 and the Government’s plans for construction of a new school were openly 
discussed.  In addition, the EIA will be publicly disclosed by 7 May 2004. The Belair 
residents were very receptive to the idea of school construction since there is no 
secondary school in the district and children currently have to travel long distances or do 
not attend secondary school.
