B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the project will be to a) strengthen the institutional and financial framework for 
the water/wastewater ; and b) provide budgetary support for critical public expenditure that will 
result in an improvement in service provision. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF) is expected to be the Borrower under this project.  For 
the municipal sector, the funds will be transferred from the MoPF to the utilities and regional 
operators.  To ensure financial discipline, proper cost recovery covenants, including the 
possibility of intercepting transfers in case of defaults, should be in place.  A proposed financing 
plan for a Bank loan of US$ 100 million is presented below.  The non-Bank contribution will 
correspond to expenditures financed by the municipalities and central agencies, including taxes.  
The project proposes to have the following two components:

Component 1:  Investments
The project will support public expenditures (central and local) in 
the water/wastewater and possibly the solid waste sectors.  These expenditures will be for: a) 
Romanian co-financing required for EU grants.
 
Proposed Bank’s financing will mainly be for 
Cohesion funds - starting in 2007 and  co-financing eligible ISPA projects  where financing is 
not  fully secured; and b) non-EU related viable projects that require public assistance.  This 
Bank financing can support public expenditures starting in 2005.   
 
A
key feature of the project will be that disbursements will be output based
.
This will help bring 
the focus on results rather than process and it will allow the Romanian Government to utilize 
Bank resources to co-finance with the EU grants.  The disbursements will be made against bid 
prices once the outputs are confirmed through independent technical and financial audits.  A loan 
advance may also be provided to finance the completion of works.  A proposed list of 
performance benchmarks to measure outputs areincreased number of house connections for 
water; increased number of house connections for sewerage; volume of wastewater treated; 
number of meters installed; length of pipes replaced etc  
 
For the output based approach to work effectively, it is important to have a multi-year program
prepared upfront with the Government which will include institutional development, a public 
investment program with a financing plan and clear measurable outputs.  Also, the program will 
have to be developed with full consultation with the EU and other International Financial 
Institutions (IFIs), taking into account Romania’s obligations towards the EU and the various 
sources of financing.  During preparation, the fiscal impact
of the project will be examined 
carefully, given that the Bank loan funds will be included in the budget as a financing source of 
public expenditure. 
 
Country procedures should be used as much as possible and the application of the Bank’s 
fiduciary and safeguard policies
will have to take into account that Romanian procedures on 
these topics are converging with or are in compliance with EU directives.

Procurement
:
The possibility of using EU and Romanian procedures will be explored.  
Preliminary review indicates that for procedures that follow EU requirements, there will 
be no ex-ante control by the Bank.  During preparation, the Romanian procurement 
procedures will be reviewed to determine their applicability under the project; 
 
·
Financial Management:
 
The financial management system used in MoPF to transfer 
resources to the municipalities and central agencies will be reviewed; and 
 
·
Environment/Social:
 As part of project preparation, the Romanian laws and practices will 
be examined to determine their equivalency with EU and Bank policies and procedures.  
To the extent possible, Romanian procedures will be used
.
Component 2:  Technical Assistance
 
To facilitate the implementation of the project  and to 
address the Government’s need to establish an institutional framework, the project will:  
 
·
support the development of an Infrastructure Development Facility (IDF) in the Ministry 
of Public Finance (MoPF).  The IDF will not duplicate the ongoing related activities in 
the MoPF and the sector ministries related to EU financing and sector development.  
Working with the sector ministries, the IDF will: a) help to prioritize investments and 
establish financing mechanisms for the water/wastewater and possibly the solid waste 
sectors.  The IDF will draw on the on-going work of an inter-ministerial group that is 
looking at various financing options at the sub-sovereign level;  b) identify regulatory 
needs and promote legislation on PPP; and c) manage the flow of funds under the project 
for the public expenditure;  
·
support the strengthening of the water/wastewater regulator which was created in 2002.  
The regulator has limited staff in relation to the task of effectively regulating the 
activities of 600 operators providing water/wastewater services.  Technical assistance 
will be provided for the development of legislation on quality of service and guidelines 
on tariffs which have to increase to finance the required investments; and 
·
support the sector ministries and agencies, as needed, to develop investment priorities.  
This Technical Assistance is needed for Romania to prepare for the use of the Cohesion 
Funds. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project locations are not known and will be identified during preparation. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Based on the Bank’s experience in Romania, the risks of inadequate institutional capacity to 
implement applicable safeguard policies seem low. Under this project and to the extent possible, 
Romanian or EU procedures will be followed.

(as per Table A.1 in Annex A of the October 2004 draft Board paper on country 
systems and as amended in final expected February 2005) that will compare 
World Bank, Romanian and EU procedures specifically for the range in 
operations expected to be financed. This analysis will expand on any available 
broader EU/World Bank analysis planned to be carried out by ECSSD, but will be 
more specific to Romanian laws applicable to the planned investments.
