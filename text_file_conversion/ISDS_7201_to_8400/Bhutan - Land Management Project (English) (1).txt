B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project will promote innovative technical and institutional mechanisms to enhance 
sustainable land management practices with local, regional and global environmental benefits. 
The project will test and demonstrate technical innovations which reduce land degradation and 
related downstream impacts such as water erosion, focus land-use planning on long-term 
maintenance of ecosystem functions and services, and develop cross-sectoral mechanisms for 
landscape monitoring and management in collaboration with local resource users and 
stakeholders.  The project aims to address land and watershed degradation issues through multi-
sectoral planning and implementation with strong local participation. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Component 1
:  An improved policy and planning framework for sustainable land management 
(estimated cost: up to $0.50 million).  Planning in Bhutan is largely sectorally-based which may 
not fully take into account the risks and costs of overlap and the social and environmental 
implications of plans and investments.  Under the proposed project, RGOB line agencies, local 
Page  2
 
 
governments and residents would work together to jointly assess and decide on planned 
developments in those localities, taking into account local  livelihood issues and practices, 
environmental risks, expected impacts and trade-offs so that future land-use is more 
environmentally sustainable.  Public sector planning and policy may be gradually refined over 
time as local options for resolving land usage and access, constraints and trade-offs evolve and 
are incorporated to help inform central and local Government policies.
  
 
 
Component 2
:  Integrated land management sub-projects (estimated cost: up to $10.0 million). 
This component will pilot integrated landscape management approaches in priority sites, to help 
government and other stakeholders address issues of competing demands on the land resource, 
assess its carrying capacity and articulate a plan for its rational management.  From the 
experience of several pilot sites, selection and eligibility criteria and processes will be 
established and funds made available to other sub-projects as they are proposed and successfully 
appraised during the project period.  These efforts will be documented and the lessons learnt will 
inform and be integrated into future planning and implementation of development programs.   
 
Component 3
:  Institution-strengthening and capacity-building (estimated cost: up to $6.0 
million).  This component will support decentralized environmental management and strengthen 
the capacity of Bhutanese institutions to address land degradation issues and improve cross-
sectoral mechanisms and incentives for ecosystem management.  The component will play a key 
role in supporting RGOB’s decentralization agenda by helping to clarify technical and 
institutional needs, accountability systems, training requirements and other mechanisms to 
ensure the early and full participation of local governments and other stakeholders at the local 
level in environmental planning and implementation.  Collaboration with other projects will be 
emphasized. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Locations to be determined.  It is expected that rural and urban sites will be identified during 
project preparation, following methodology that defines including: 1) Land Use Systems, 
2)Severity of Land Degradation Indices, and 3)appropriate Sustainable Land Management 
strategies.  Stakeholder inputs will be sought using a Strategic Environmental Assessment 
approach.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The project will be implemented under the guidance of an inter-agency steering committee, 
headed by Ministry of Finance, which is an experienced project partner of both the GEF and the 
World Bank.  Detailed components are likely to be specialized agencies like Ministry of 
Agriculture, National Environment Commission, and Ministry of Works and Human 
Settlements, all which have substantial experience of working with the World Bank as well.  All 
arrangements for implementation and flow of funds will be appraised and capacity building 
measures put in place as necessary for project implementation.

Environmental Assessment Category:
    
[ ] A   [
Ã
] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI  
 
The EA category is now assessed as ‘B’ (potential adverse environmental impacts human 
populations or environmentally important areas such as wetlands, forests, grasslands and other 
natural habitats ).  In case the project design includes grants to communities for sub-projects that 
have environmental implications (eg.  water management, soil erosion control schemes, etc), the 
EA category could be ‘F1’. 
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

would be prepared.
