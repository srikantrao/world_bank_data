A.2. Project Objectives 
The objectives of the Fourth Power Project (Cr. 3545-UG) are to: (a) improve power 
supply to meet demand in Uganda by supporting critical investments in the power sub-
sector; and (b) strengthen the Borrower's capacity to manage reforms to, and 
development of, the power and petroleum sub-sectors. The Board approved the Credit on 
July 3, 2001. It became effective on April 4, 2002, and is scheduled to close on December 
31, 2005. 
 
In December 2003, the project's Mid-Term Review (MTR) found that the project overall 
was meeting its development objectives and that the implementation of all components 
was satisfactory. The MTR recommended several amendments to the Development 
Credit Agreement (DCA) and the Project Agreement (PA) to reallocate unused funds for 
activities necessary to implement the Government's Power Sector Reform and 
Development Program. Following the MTR, the Government requested a restructuring of 
the project in March 2004. All of the proposed amendments will support the project's 
original objectives. The proposed amendments to the DCA and the PA are the following: 
(a) New project components; (b) Modification of project implementation arrangements; 
(c) Modification of procurement, re-lending, and disbursement arrangements. 
A.3. Project Description of Restructured Components 
The proposed amendments of the project's description in the DCA will add four new activities under the 
Page  2
Power System Expansion and Rehabilitation component - one for distribution rehabilitation and 
strengthening; a second for transmission strengthening and expansion, and a third for generation. The new 
activities are the following: 
 
1. 
Support for the Management of Power Distribution Assets by a Private 
Concession (US$ 11.0 million).
 This activity will finance urgently needed investments in 
the distribution system to improve the quality of electricity supply and expand service to 
new consumers. It is part of a security package that the Government has requested that 
IDA provide to enhance the attractiveness of the concession agreement. The proposed 
restructuring of the project will provide funding for the required distribution investments. 
At the same time, IDA and the Government have proposed allocating a portion of the 
Credit to the Privatization and Utility Sector Reform Project (Credit 3411-UG) as a 
contingent Credit. 
 
2. 
Expanding and Strengthening the Power Transmission System (US$ 6.8 
million from IDA and US$ 5.6 million from NDF. 
This new component will support 
the expansion and strengthening of Uganda's power transmission system to improve 
supply reliability and expand service coverage. This component will have three activities: 
(a) investments to increase the transmission capacity at the new Kampala Industrial and 
Business Park in Namanve; (b) studies on the technical feasibility, the environmental and 
social impacts of expanding and rehabilitating the transmission system; and (c) 
investments in the rehabilitation of four transmission stations to be co-financed by NDF. 
 
3. 
New Components for the Generation Company:
 Components include (a) retroactive financing 
of claims relating to the Third Power Project; and (b) sealing of the land allocated for the construction of 
the Bujagali Dam 
 
4.
 
Expanding the Scope of the power sector development and reform 
component and the Environmental Monitoring Component.
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
New sub-components under the restructured project will be implemented in the following 
areas of the country: (a) Mukono district (centra region) where the new Namanve 
substation will be located near Kampala; (b) the distribution system - to be partly 
rehabilitated with IDA support - covers about 235,000 industrial, commercial, residential 
and municipal clients throughout Uganda; and (c) the districts of Masaka, Rakai, 
Sembabule, Mbarara, Mukono where four substations will be rehabilitated. The potential 
for soil and water pollution in urban and rural areas due to oil leaks containing PCB and 
the disposal of old poles that have been treated with creosote are of major concern. 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A
[
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
Comments: 
The restructured project has been assigned the environmental category B due 
to the potential for loss of vegetation, air pollution, soil erosion, soil and water pollution 
due to oil leaks containing PCB and the disposal of old creosote-treated poles. and the 
need for compensation of five brick makers who will be negatively affected by the 
construction of the new Namanve substation.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Overall, environmental and social impacts under the restructured project are expected to include soil 
erosion, soil and water pollution, loss of vegetation, traffic conjestion, air pollution, loss of livelihoods of 
five brick makers. However, particular attention will have to be paid to the negative environmental and 
social impacts of (i) PCB that most likely is contained in the oil of old transformers and (ii) old creosote-
treated poles that will have to be disposed of. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
Potential indirect and/or long term impacts are not anticipated because the Environmental 
Management Plans for the various activities provide clear guidance on how to mitigate 
potential environmental and social impacts. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
In view of the objectives of the Fourth Power Project and its proposed amendments, a 
discussion of alternatives to the proposed investments and the provision of an IDA 
guarantee, as well as a political risk insurance through MIGA and a funding facility was 
not relevant. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
When preparing the original Fourth Power Project, the Borrower (a) assessed the safety 
of the Kiira dam which was found satisfactory; (b) notified the riparian countries of the 
planned project; and (c) prepared an Environmental Analysis (EA) of the potential 
environmental and social impacts that might result from the addition of the two 
remaining generation units No. 14 and 15. The EA led to the preparation of an 
Environmental Monitoring Plan (EMP) to monitor the impacts of power generation at the 
Kiira Dam on, among other things, the fish populations, water quality, microbial and 
chemical contamination. The EMP also required the preparation of an annual 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
Environmental Monitoring Report. Among others, the latest monitoring report 
recommended that the project make provisions for the disposal of harvested water 
hyacinth in the reservoir. The restructured project provides funding for the employment 
of a contractor who will be responsible for the disposal of the harvested water hyacinth. 
 
To address potential environmental and social impacts that might result from the new 
components of the restructured project, the Borrower has prepared (a) an Environmental 
Impact Assessment of the Distribution Assets to be rehabilitated with IDA funding; (b) 
an Environmental Impact Statement of the new Namanve Substation as well as a 
Resettlement Action Plan for five brick makers who will be affected by the construction 
of the substation; and (c) an Environmental and Social Assessment of the rehabilitation of 
the Mbarara, Masaka, Lira and Lugazi substations. The Borrower has approved and 
disclosed these documents in Uganda and authorized the Bank on December 2, 2004, to 
disclose these documents in its Infoshop; the Bank has disclosed them on December 8, 
2004. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders include representatives of local governments, relevant ministries, the concessionaire who 
will lease the power distribution assets and operate them under a twenty year concession contract, UEGCL, 
UETCL, UEDGL, and potentially affected persons in those areas where the project will be active. The 
environmental studies have been disclosed in their respective locations, for example, in schools, libraries, 
district offices, relevant ministries and at the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and at 
the Infoshop.
