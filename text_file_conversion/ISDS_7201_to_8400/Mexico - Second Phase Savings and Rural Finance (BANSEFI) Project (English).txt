A.2. Project Objectives 
Project Development Objective.
  The project will help the government of Mexico develop a robust SCI sector, consisting of a 
large number of entities which are compliant with the law, financially viable, operationally effective, managerially sound, 
technologically upgraded, and having an enhanced level of outreach and access to financial services by the underserved Mexican 
population. 
 
Key performance indicators
 are as follows: 
\01\02
About 195 entities assisted under the project certified by CNBV to operate as independent or merged entities, or identified 
for liquidation; and an additional 40 entities with appropriate plans and/or implemented strategy to deepen penetration 
and outreach
1
; 
\01\02
Procedures for liquidation of unviable entities initiated by the government (could be about 10% of the universe of 420 
entities assisted under this and the on-going project)
2
; 
\01\02
Deposit Protection Fund established for at least one Federation/ Confederation; 
\01\02
At least 45% market penetration for the Technology Platform achieved (about 100 of the 240 entities in the resulting 
consolidated sector adopt the platform); 
\01\02
At least 90% of the participating entities show satisfactory outcomes in accounting and governance aspects (internal 
controls), as evaluated in the process of auxiliary supervision implemented by the CNBV and the supervision 
committees at federation level; and 
\01\02
Clients of the sector increased from 4 million to about 9 million. 
 
The National Development Plan of Mexico envisions the Mexican economy to demonstrate, among others, the two key attributes 
of human development and competitive growth.  These two attributes are represented in the three objectives of: (a) increasing a
nd 
expanding competitiveness; (b) promoting balanced regional development that includes all population segments; and (c) 
increasing equity and equality of opportunity.   The 2004 Country Assistance Strategy (FY 2005 through FY 2008) supports the 
Mexican government’s efforts to achieve these three objectives through initiatives under the two broad themes of: (a) reducing 
poverty and inequality; and (b) increasing competitiveness. 
   
Reducing poverty and inequality.
   The CAS highlights incidence of acute poverty in rural areas, and a skewed regional

 The on-going project supports TA for about 375 entities; about 150 of these entities require more 
intensive and in-depth TA for which funds are not available under the on-going project.  These are being 
supported under this project.  About 40 of the 375 entities are ready for more strategic inputs focusing on 
improving access and outreach, for which too funds are a constraint under the on-going project.  These 
entities will be supported under this project.  About 45 entities have indicated their desire to seek TA for 
the first time.

 About 40 entities are expected to be liquidated in total, about 20 under each project.

development.  It suggests improving access to financial services to enhance  the poor’s ability to save, invest and manage risk
s.  It 
also recommends that sustainable poverty reduction should go beyond mere human capital development, and suggests economic 
empowerment of the poor by helping them to build physical and financial assets that would provide a means to better cope with 
economic shocks.  
 
Increasing competitiveness.
  The CAS also indicates that a broad-based financial sector is crucial to enhanced competitiveness, 
and suggests access to financial services for individuals, entrepreneurs, small and medium enterprises, and the agriculture sec
tor 
to achieve: (a) competitiveness with increased employment opportunities and improved income distribution; and (b) a more 
regionally balanced development.   
 
The proposed operation clearly supports the 2004 CAS objectives. It will: (a) deepen the outreach of the non-bank financial 
sector, and widen access to financial services by the underserved Mexican population, particularly in rural areas; (b) promote 
“bancarization” of hitherto unbanked segments of the population and economic units, integrating them into the global economy; 
and (c) facilitate monetization of physical assets, contributing to financial empowerment.  It builds on the financial sector 
strengthening objectives embodied in the Bank Restructuring Facility Projects (Number 67491 and 71323), the Rural Finance 
Development Structural Adjustment Loan Project (Number 74655), and the on-going Savings and Credit Sector Strengthening & 
TA Services Project (Number 70108).  It also complements the other proposed financial operations identified in the 2004 CAS to 
reform the development banking institutions, and is in line with the suggestions emanating from recent sector work studies. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project is expected to cost US$160 million (Bank share: US$75.5 million, including a US$1.5 million contingency, and a 
US$0.75 million front-end loan processing fee; Government of Mexico share: US$14.6 million; stakeholder/entity share: 
US$69.9 million), and have a duration of 4.5 years, starting July 1, 2004.   The project has four main components: (a) 
strengthening sector institutions; (b) developing a technology platform; (c) monitoring and evaluation, studies, and informatio
n 
dissemination; and (d) project management.  Each component is discussed below briefly. 
 
Component 1: Strengthening sector institutions.
  This is expected to cost US$13.0 million (Bank share: US$10.8 million), and 
consists of the following main sub-components:  
(a)  continuation of technical assistance to institutions due to an increase in the number of institutions offering themselves 
for certification, classification of a relatively large number of already assessed institutions in “C” and “D” categories, 
requiring a more focused technical assistance package to ready them for certification, and the longer time required for 
the classification exercise due to the range of accounting practices being followed by the institutions.  The project will 
finance technical assistance to about 45 additional institutions (including specific actions to serve indigenous population, 
where these entities are situated in the identified marginal areas), and to about 150 institutions already being assisted 
under the on-going project
2
; 
(b)  technical assistance to about 40 institutions expected to be classified in categories “A” and “B”, requiring little or no 
assistance with certification, but which may need strategic inputs to go “beyond certification”, improve their efficiency 
and effectiveness, and push the sector objective of deepening outreach and access to financial services.  These better 
managed institutions will comprise a critical mass of institutions to field-test new financial products developed under the 
project to address access-related aspects
2
; 
(c)  technical assistance and guidance on aspects relating to the creation and functioning of the Deposit Protection Fund at 
the federation/confederation level; 
(d)  quality assurance, including a consultancy to manage and monitor this component which will become increasingly 
complex with the number of diagnostics and work plans increasing with a peaking of the classification effort, and 
maintaining consistency in application of classification guidelines across entities and service providers; and 
(e)  training of sector staff (BANSEFI, CNBV, federations, SCIs), which will consist of accounting and financial 
management (to migrate from existing accounting systems to CNBV prescribed systems), and other topics such as 
portfolio management, risk management, credit analysis, governance aspects, market analysis and understanding, and 
management of SCIs at the federation level.  It will also include developing capacities in institutions adopting the 
technology platform-based accounting system. 
Component 2: Developing a technology platform.
  This is expected to cost US$136.9 million (Bank share: US$56.2 million, and 
consists of the following sub-components: 
(a)  hardware, comprising establishing technological capacity at the branches of BANSEFI and the assisted SCIs, data 
center, and virtual private network (VPN) for connectivity
3
; 
                                                          
 
3
 A pilot has been initiated under the on-going project.  The total cost of the technology upgrade is about 
US$85 million, US$19 million towards the pilot under the on-going project, and US$66 million under this 
project. 
Page  4
 
 
(b)  software, comprising development of the applications package, licensing of the software from the supplier for an initial 
three-year period for assisted entities by which time the platform would have reached a “stable” state for BANSEFI to 
charge reasonable rates, data warehouse, ERP, and internet banking; 
(c)  technical assistance, consisting of quality assurance of the applications package, hardware/data center/VPN modules, a 
strategy and an organizational plan for BANSEFI’s IT support service, a verification and validation exercise including 
regression testing to support the maintenance function requirement, and operations support; 
(d)  consultancy, consisting of services from an external service provider to manage and monitor the national roll-out of the 
technology platform in the participating entities and federations; and  
(e)  contributions by the entities towards installation and operating costs of the platform.   
Component 3: M&E, Studies and Information Dissemination.
  This is expected to cost US$7.5 million (Bank share: US$6.2 
million), and consists of the following sub-components: 
(a)  extending the M&E study under the on-going project to include a “sample filling” arrangement which would make up 
for the households lost in the sample survey through attrition.  This will enlarge the sample and improve the credibility 
and confidence level associated with the data and its interpretation.  A second area will be to provide assistance for 
consultancies to ensure that the various datasets are consistent, and to interpret the household survey data; 
(b)  evaluation of the outcomes of specific project interventions through clearly focused studies; 
(c)  refocusing the content of the on-going advertising campaign from the need to comply with the law to informing about 
the change in the complexion of the SCI segment to instill confidence in the existing and potential clients, marketing the 
benefits of financial intermediation through a certified entity,  and disseminating the range of new financial products 
which the renewed institutions will be offering with the adoption of the technology platform; 
(d)  conducting studies and workshops, relating to development of new savings and financial products, technology platform 
pricing study for cost recovery, sector issues related studies, and other topics related to sustainable development more 
generally; and 
(e)  disseminating the findings of the M&E outcomes, including any other reports and studies that may be of relevance to the 
sector.  This would essentially take the form of participatory workshops and seminars. 
Component 4: Project Management.
  This is expected to cost US$1.9 million (Bank share: US$1.4 million), and will cover the 
following two main areas of assistance: 
(a)  incremental operating costs relating to the BANSEFI IT team which are directly attributable to the scaling-up of the pilot 
IT initiative; and 
(b)  incremental operating costs relating to the BANSEFI Core Team, from the date of the closure of the on-going loan to the 
date of closure of the proposed operation.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  Identify and describe any potential 
large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project is essentially a technical assistance project.  No negative impact is foreseen; rather the project is expected to 
benefit some of the savings and credit sector entities operating in marginal areas (which are identical to the ones in the on-
going project) where indigenous population is high. The project will continue to assist about 195 entities, some of which are 
in the marginal areas, and for which indigenous population aspects are already being addressed under the on-going project.  
It will assist about 45 new entities, very few of which may be situated in the identified marginal areas. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area. 
 
No indirect or long-term negative impacts are expected as a result of project activities.  The technical assistance is expected
 
to deepen the outreach of the assisted entities, and will improve access to financial services in the underserved areas in 
Mexico, benefiting all categories of populations.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Since the marginal areas are identical across the on-going and this proposed operation, the same simplified IPDPs and the 
Social Development Model (SDM), which are already under implementation in the on-going project, will be used for this 
project’s technical assistance component.   This model consisted of preparation of simplified IPDPs for each of the six 
marginal areas, enriched through consultations under the on-going project, and informs the formulation and implementation 
of action plans comprising information dissemination and an outreach strategy for each of the assisted entities in the 
marginal areas.    
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to 
plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The Planning and Strategy Department in BANSEFI will prepare Terms of Reference for the technical service providers 
who will be working with the entities with a requirement for developing specific actions in their strategy to serve indigenous 
population, where these entities are in the identified marginal areas.   In addition, the department is procuring the services 
of 
an external consulting firm to assure quality of the services from technical assistance providers; this firm will incorporate a
t 
least one social scientist in the team to ensure that the SDM is applied appropriately in the assisted entities, where required
. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with 
an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Simplified IPDPs were prepared using a participatory approach under the on-going project through consultation workshops 
with representatives from indigenous communities in marginal areas.  These are being used to inform the communication, 
and access and outreach strategy of the entities, and will be applied in case of those entities seeking technical assistance 
under this project that are situated in the identified marginal areas.
