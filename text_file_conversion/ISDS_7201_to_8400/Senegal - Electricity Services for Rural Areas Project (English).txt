A.2. Project Objectives
The 
main
 development objective of the proposed Rural Electrification program 
is to support the 
progressive transformation and improvement in the living conditions of rural Se
negal.  This should be 
achieved by: (i) providing lighting and access to modern communication to rural households; (ii) improving 
Page  2
delivery of social services by providing electricity to potable water delivery systems, health clinics, 
schools, etc.; and (ii
i) enhancing economic productivity through the provision of electricity for productive 
purposes.
Specifically, the objectives to be achieved by 2015 are to :
(i)
deliver electricity services to 70% of the rural communities, directly or 
indirectly;
(ii)
provide acce
ss to electricity by 30% of the rural communities;
(iii)
implement multi
-
sector programs (PREMS) as a complement for 
accessing to electricity to 
increase productivity of small and medium 
enterprises, to enhance the quality and efficiency of some sectoral 
program
s such as in health, education, water and agriculture, and so, to 
improve living standards, and focus on rural transformation.
The main development objective of the proposed biomass energy component
 is to ensure and expand the 
supply of woodfuels to the ra
pidly growing urban and peri
-
urban areas without the loss of forest stocks, of 
rural ecosystem stability and of rural wealth and economic development opportunities. The objective of the 
project is also to protect the global environment by encouraging the u
se of renewable sources of energy 
(ENR) and fuel
-
efficient lamps to both meet rural electricity needs and reduce project
-
induced greenhouse 
gas emissions.
A.3. Project Description
The RE program is conceived as a long term effort covering 12 years (mid 2
004 to 2016) to be 
implemented in 3 phases. 
The twelve years APL will be divided into three phases, roughly equal in terms 
of time, (3 phases of 4 years); the first phase would start progressively with a lot of technical assistance and 
pilot efforts, and t
he pace of investments would pick up in the second and third phases. The support to the 
biomass energy sector would last only the first two years of the program and can be defined as a bridge 
toward extended efforts through PRSC. 
Both the Government and th
e private sector operators would want 
the Bank group to be committed to the whole program, because of the long term nature of the concession 
contracts. 
The first phase (mid 2004 
–
mid 2008)
 will focus on implementing the instruments designed 
during the pro
ject preparation phase, on capacity
-
building and on technical assistance, and on investing and 
managing four or five concessions and some well defined local initiative projects (ERILs), and the first 
generation of PREMs in the three IDA concessions.  
The s
econd phase (2008
-
2012)
 will complete the 
building of capacity and increasing the investments in the large concessions, the ERILS and second 
generation of PREMs .  
The third phase (2012
-
2016)
 will complete the development of the 18 concessions 
and mainly w
ill focus in increasing the density of the coverage and productive demand in concessions 
previously awarded.
The proposed project is composed of 4 components : (i)  a rural electrification fund to 
promote 
access to electricity services to satisfy basic el
ectricity needs of rural households 
and
 support programs maximizing social and economic benefits of rural electrification, 
(ii) a
 capacity development and institutional strengthening component, (iii) a technical 
assistance, communication and monitoring and
 evaluation component, and (iv) a 
sustainable and participatory energy management component (PROGEDE II).
The total costs of the program are estimated to be around US$300 million, of which the 
first phase of this project will contribute around US$50.0 mil
lion (IDA 
–
 US$31.4 
million). The contribution of IDA through out the 3 phases of the project is estimated to 
be around US$100 million.
Project Component 1
–
US$ 30.8 million (IDA 
-
 US$ 16.25 millions & GEF US$ 3.6 
millions)
The first component of the proj
ect consists of three investments subcomponents to: 
Page  3
(i)
Provide OBA (output
-
based
-
aid) type capital subsidies, refinancing and 
guarantees under a transparent and competitive concession bidding process to 
ensure economic sustainability of rural electrification
 in 
primary targeted 
concession areas (Concession PPER)
. (
US$ 37.5 millions (IDA US$11.5 
millions & GEF US$ 3.0 millions))
Investment costs would be funded by a mix of private equity, commercial bank 
loans, and grants for the subsidized portion of the capi
tal expenditures, channeled 
through a 
Rural Electrification Fund.
 Special financing instruments (refinancing 
account and guarantee account) will be finalized during the first phase of the 
project to help mobilize the required additional financing from comm
ercial banks. 
The IDA financing will focus during the first phase on three concessions 
(Dagana
-
Podor, Mbour, Kolda
-
Velingara). Those three concessions were 
surveyed under the local electrification plans (PLEs) and were selected because 
they are a represen
tative sample of the 18 concessions.
(ii)
Finance under a similar process, smaller concessions 
-
ERIL projects
 (project 
direct proposal for some small specific areas). (
US$ 6.0 millions (IDA 
US$1.25 million & GEF US$0.6 million))
ASER will proceed to launch te
nders for ERIL projects on a regular quarterly 
basis.  A predetermined amount will be allocated for each tender invited and 
eligible projects will be scrutinized and then classified according to simple 
transparent criteria.  
Assistance in planning ERIL pr
ojects:
 potential sponsors of ERIL projects will 
not necessarily have the competence and expertise for preparing their own project 
applications 
(
demand
analysis, technical specifications, financial set
-
up, Business 
Plan).  Hence technical assistance funds 
have been included in the project for this 
purpose.
(iii)
Support multi
-
sectoral energy projects 
(PREMs)
 in same areas than primary 
concessions
, (i) to ensure adequate energy provision to other sectoral 
programs, which require it to enhance their impacts in term
s of poverty 
reduction, and (ii) to increase productive use of electricity
 of small and 
medium enterprises
.. (
US$ 4.0 millions (IDA US$ 3.5 millions))
T
hree P
REM families were identified: (a) social
-
oriented PREMs,  (b) 
production
-
oriented PREMs and  (c) a specific “micro
-
finance” PREM.
During the first phase of the project, in order to test the concept and the practical 
modalities, only one or two PREMs per co
ncession will be implemented. This 
first phase will prepare scaling up for phase 2, provided the results from the first 
PREMs are conclusive

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis
:
The project will cover all of Senegal.  Eighteen rural electrification 
concessions have 
been set

The main implementation agencies for the Rural electrification components are the 
Agence Sénégalaise d’Electrification Rurale (ASER), the Commission de Régulation du 
Secteur Electrique (CRSE) and the social ministries through out the Comité Multi
-
Se
ctoriel (Multi
-
Sectoral Committee). They have little experience in implementing such 
activities. Although, they were very involved in the project preparation, the project 
proposes an important capacity building component, particularly during the first phas
e of 
the APL.
With respect to the Biomass component, the implementation units are the same units and 
personnel that implemented the PROGEDE project.
