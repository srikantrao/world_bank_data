 A.2. Project Objectives

 The project development objective     is to support Ukraine's efforts   to provide equal access to quality
 education and to increase the  efficiency of the education system     which will prepare graduates   for the
 knowledge economy in keeping      with their European counterparts.      The Equal Access to Quality    Education
 Project will cover Phase I of the Ukraine Education Sector Reform.

A.3. Project Description

The project will support the goals   ofthe education sector reform     program through: (i) the professional
development of educators; (ii)  the improvement of the learning      process, with a modernized curriculum,
updated teaching and learning tools    and improved student assessment;       (iii) the development of improved
planning and management capacities;       (iv) enhancement of optimization     plans; and (v) the rehabilitation of
schools. As a result of the project,  educators would have increased       awareness, knowledge and    professional
competences to implement     education reforms underway in      teaching and learning, general    secondary
schools would have capacities,   tools and facilities to be able  to implement a modern curriculum      and
assessment plans and the overall   system would have improved        its management and increased     efficiency
and access.

Component 1: Professional      Development of Educators         (Total cost US$ 10.1 million)

The aim ofthis component is    to raise the awareness, professional     knowledge and competences      of teachers
and school directors in order  to implement the reforms underway        in teaching and learning in general
education. The project will (a)  enhance the professional quality     ofteacher trainers through a cadre    of
educators who can model new     approaches to the education     ofteachers, provide relevant    in-service training
and become a force for renewal    in their institutions.; (b) redesign  the current obligatory teacher  in-service
training by gradually shifting into a continuous, needs-based     in-service training and professional
development system and pilot    and deliver new courses for teachers;      (c) establish a permanent and
officially approved professional  development system of school       principals, including professional  standards,
training modules, and regulatory   framework for all school directors;     and (d) enhance the facilities and

 environment of the oblast in-service  training centers.

 Component 2: Improvement        of the Learning Process (Total      cost US$ 18.2 million)

 The general aim of this component    is to support ongoing efforts to improve     the conditions of teaching and
 learning in secondary schools in  Ukraine, including curriculum     development, evaluation of education
 outcomes, teaching and learning   resources, and school improvement       initiatives for classroom level
 education reform.   The project component seeks to     build on initiatives and reform    programs which are
 already underway. To support curriculum      modernization, the project will help     MES to: review and
 improve the new curricula for   grades 5 to 12, develop guidelines   for new textbooks, teaching guides    and
 CD-ROM teaching and learning materials,      and develop and disseminate a      national curriculum framework.
Teaching and learning resources    will be supported by: financing a    rigorous and systematic assessment    of
the current textbook policy, providing    specific support in the areas of  connectivity and maintenance of
 computer classes in rural schools,  supporting experimental programs      on e-books, virtual labs (science and
technology), and foreign languages    teaching material, and assisting   with the creation of an on-line data  base
with information of existing and   available teaching and learning materials     in each area within the context of
the national curriculum reform.    The project will support the development      of a National System of
Educational Evaluation and Quality     Assurance, participation in international    assessments such as TIMSS
and PISA, development and piloting     of exams and work on school- and       classroom-based assessments. The
project will provide grants for  good practice at the school and classroom     levels on the basis of innovation
and improvement plans having a     direct impact on student achievement,      and at the level of rayons which
engage in networking of innovative    schools and disseminate resulting     good practices. A renewed policy    of
school improvement and innovation      would be in place as a result of this   initiative.

Component 3. Efficiency and Management            of Resources (Total cost US$ 63.0        million)

The aim ofthe component is to improve       the efficiency ofthe general education     system and to strengthen
the policy development capacities    ofthe MES and other institutions     responsible for general secondary
education, as well as to support the  Government plans to optimize the      schools network and provide
assistance for the rehabilitation of schools.  Policy development capacities will      be strengthened through the
establishment of a policy planning   division in the MES general secondary       education department and the
provision of technical assistance and  training for administrators at the   central and locals levels. An
education management information      system would be initiated which     would begin by focusing on the
collection and processing of administrative   statistics related to general secondary    education. The project
will provide support for a strategic public information campaign to     raise public awareness about the
proposed program of education reforms      and project activities. The project    will finance the implementation
of a selected number ofRayon     Optimization Plans which would      serve as pilot models for subsequent
similar investments. Activities  will be phased and participatory,    with ample technical support and
transparent reporting of outcomes   in order to deal with the concerns    expressed in the Social Assessment.
Finally the project would finance   the rehabilitation and furnishing of   a limited number of general
education schools in priority areas  and schools, with particular emphasis     on achieving greater efficiency
and economy in the maintenance     and operation of the rehabilitated   facilities and ensuring that the
rehabilitation works meet health,  safety and environmental standards.     A Program Coordination Unit will    be
established at the MES to coordinate   all project activities.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical   characteristics relevant to the safeguard    analysis:

The project will support minor rehabilitation   works in rural schools across Ukraine.      The scope ofthe
rehabilitation work would be limited   to address the most urgent needs,    which include: roofrepairs and
correction of structural defects;improvement of heating facilities    and insulation; provision of adequate
water and sanitation; and improvement     of electrical systems. Measures    will be taken to ensure that the
rehabilitation works meet health, safety  and environmental standards.

 Section II- Key Safeguard              Issues and Their Management
 D. Summary ofKey SafeguardIssues.
 D.1. Describe any   safeguard issues and   impacts associated   with the proposed project.   Identify and describe
 any potential large scale, significant and/or  irreversible'impacts.

 Some environmental     impact may be expected      under the project that could affect the safety of the school
 occupants and the learning    environment, and for   which, mitigation   measures are needed    in implementing
 the minor rehabilitation  of selected project  schools. Many school     buildings in Ukraine   were built during
 the Soviet regime and   are roofed with asbestos    materials. Their rehabilitation  under the project will  require
 the removal and disposal    of such asbestos materials.   In this respect, MES   has drafted an Environmental
 Management Plan     (EMP) for the project.




 D.2 Describe any potential    indirect and/or long  term impacts due to   anticipated future activities in the
project area.



D.3. Describe the treatment    of alternatives (ifrelevant)


D.4. Describe measures     taken by the borrower    to address safeguard   issues. Provide an assessment   of
borrower capacity   to plan and implement     the measures described.

Although Ukraine's    environmental regulations     are comprehensive,    the EMP would provide     for specific
measures that include,   among others: (i) prohibiting   the use of asbestos  containing materials   and lead-based
paints in school rehabilitation;  (ii) proper disposal ofasbestos materials    according to law and   consistent
with generally accepted    disposal practices; (iii) control of construction  related noises at aminimum level
acceptable to the surrounding    community. Borrower      has capacities and   the EMP will be part   of the
standard bidding documents.

Ukraine's State Construction    Regulations make it    obligatory to undertake   an Evaluation of Environmental
Impact (EEI) when    specifying materials   for construction projects.  During development     of the EEI,
compliance with the   Law of Environmental      Protection and the Law    on Ecological Review    is mandatory.
These laws adequately    cover rules and standards    concerning, sanitation,  ecological protection,  fire
protection, etc. in construction.  The management of chemicals,      radioactive substances   as well as asbestos
are included in the Guidelines. The local    authorities, schools, and contractors would    follow these
Guidelines where applicable.

D.5. Identify the key  stakeholders and describe    the mechanisms for    consultation and disclosure  on
safeguard policies, with  an emphasis on potentially    affected people.

Building contractors  will be asked to abide   by the EMP which     will be part of the standard  bidding
document.

The EMP was submitted      to the Bank on June    18, 2004. On June 22,    2004, MES convened     a public
consultation on the  EMP with stakeholders     and local NGOs, with    minutes of the public   consultation
attached as an annex  to the EMP. The public    consultation was held    in Pushcha Vodytsya,    a suburb of Kyiv.
Both Ukrainian and   English versions of   the EMP with the    attached Minutes have    been disclosed on   June
22, 2004 as follows:  (1) the MES Website     (http://www.mon.gov.ua/international).      To view the linked
