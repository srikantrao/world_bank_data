A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective  is to increase the effective and productive use of 
sustainable infrastructure services by poor rural communities in selected territories of the 
regions of Coquimbo, Maule, BíoBío, Araucania, and Los Lagos.  The infrastructure 
services include water supply, sanitation, roads,  Information  Communications 
Infrastructure Technology (ICT) and electricity. As an intermediate institutional 
objective,  the project will strengthen the capacity of participating agencies to implement 
territorially-based, demand-responsive and multi-sectoral approach to  rural infrastructure 
as a contribution to local economic, social and environmental sustainability. The learning 
and results of the project will provide a basis for implementing a longer-term institutional 
reform on how rural infrastructure services are planned, financed and delivered in Chile. 
 
Project outcomes will be measured by the increased use of sustainable and quality 
services by the rural population and their contribution to economic and productive 
activities (see Annex 3 for indicators). The institutional outcomes will  be measured by 
the mainstreaming of the territorial, demand-responsive and multi-sectoral approach to 
rural infrastructure within government programs, namely: (a) new methodologies for 
integrated economic and social evaluation of multi-sectoral projects implemented by 
MIDEPLAN; (b) more effective, decentralized service delivery models and appropriate 
technical solutions adopted by relevant sectoral agencies to reach unserved and dispersed 
population; and (c) multi-sectoral territorial-based planning and service delivery model 
replicated in other non-project territories and regions. 
Page  2
The 2002 CAS set three broad goals: (a) sustaining economic growth and social progress, 
(b) heightening inclusion, especially of rural populations and vulnerable groups, and (c) 
modernizing the state as an underpinning of the two previous objectives. To achieve these 
goals, the CAS incorporates a project on rural infrastructure following the completion of 
the sector work. The proposed project aims to improve livelihoods of rural communities 
by i) developing more appropriate strategies for efficiently extending services for those 
rural households without access to one or more infrastructure services, and ii) improving 
the efficiency, sustainability and developmental impact of the infrastructure services 
already provided.  The project will also support reforms of institutional processes to 
improve government capacity to attend the needs  of the rural population and vulnerable 
groups in a more effective manner. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will include the following three components: 
 
1. 
Participatory Territorial Planning
:
this component will assist local stakeholders 
and regional government agencies to: (a) prepare in prioritized rural territories in the 
5
project regions comprehensive development plans, (b) identify demands for 
improved infrastructure services and prepare sub-project proposals to submit for 
financing under Component 2, and (c) monitor progress with plan implementation. 
2. Infrastructure Service Delivery: 
this component will support: (a) rehabilitation of 
rural roads, and construction, rehabilitation and expansion of water, sanitation, 
electricity and ICT infrastructure, and (b) establishment and strengthening of local 
service providers to operate, maintain and administer the services to achieve quality 
and sustainability.
 
3. 
Institutional Strengthening: 
this component will support: (a) project coordination 
units at national and regional levels, (b) implementation of studies and capacity 
building to strengthen policies and institutions in areas of territorial planning and 
rural infrastructure service delivery, and (c) project monitoring, evaluation and 
learning as a contribution to national level expansion of the program. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project investments will be located in poor rural communities in selected territories 
of the regions of Coquimbo, Maule, BíoBío, Araucania, and Los Lagos.  Criteria for 
selection of the territories include high levels of poverty, productive potential and 
contiguous areas based on social and economic inter-actions.  The investments in those 
territories will be identified through participatory territorial development plans, and 
outside of environmentally protected areas and site of high cultural or social significance 
as specified in the environmental assessment report and the Project Operational Manual.  
The investments consist of the following:  
 
Page  3
·
upgrading or periodic maintenance of existing secondary rural roads, bridges and foot 
bridges; 
·
conventional piped water supply and appropriate technologies for point source 
improvements in dispersed populations; 
·
on-site sanitation and sewers with wastewater treatment, as appropriate; 
·
construction of info-centers and the access to the Internet for schools, health posts, 
etc.; 
·
improving quality of conventional electricity services (to provide continuous services and to upgrade 
from two-phase to 3-phase grid connection) and off-grid and renewable solutions (generators, solar 
panels and wind turbines). 
 
As the beneficiary communities will largely be dispersed rural areas, the size of the investments will be 
small and their features conducive to their operation and management by local population or communities.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project does not foresee any major environmental or social issues due to the small 
nature and simple technical characteristics of the interventions. 
 
To take into account social issues, the project interventions will be identified through 
participatory mechanisms with relevant stakeholder groups from communities, 
municipalities, private sector, civil society and regional government.  These mechanisms 
have already been applied as part of the development of Participatory Territorial 
Development Plans (PDTs) in the regions of the Bio Bio and Araucania, and has served 
as a basis for designing the locally-based participation processes that will be followed 
during project implementation. SUBDERE will be further required to promote the 
specific participation of women and indigenous groups in these processes. 
 
Environmental issues in the project are being mainstreamed into the Territorial Planning 
and subproject preparation and approval process.  Checklists for conducting EAs have 
been prepared for each type of sectoral investment.  An environmental assessment was 
conducted as part of project preparation, and guidelines have been developed for each of 
the infrastructure subsectors. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The implementation of the project should lead ultimately to improve the living conditions of the rural 
population of the selected territories.  The PDTs include the identification of specific productive activities 
that are expected to be carried forward with the execution of the infrastructure investments.  These 
productive activities however are, in line with project interventions, of a localized nature and normally 
involve ongoing endeavors that require enhanced infrastructure conditions for improving their commercial 
competitiveness.  In sum, the longer term impacts will be beneficial to the local population without creating 
any noticeable impacts on existing natural environments. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Chile has very good institutional and regulatory capacity to address environmental and indigenous is
sues.  
The Environmental Agency, CONAMA, has established procedures for identifying and providing 
mitigation for environmental issues arising from project activities.  The regulations for the National 
Environmental Evaluation System have been operational in Chile since December 7, 2002.  These 
regulations define the types of investment that are subject to a full-scale impact evaluation process, and 
those that can be managed through the application of environmental guides (such as check-lists) and 
procedures pre-defined during project preparation and included in the environmental assessment report. 
Page  5
To address social safeguards, an indigenous peoples policy framework and action plan was also prepared as 
this is very relevant for Region IX where there is a large number of Mapuche population. The National 
Council for Indigenous Development, CONADI, was consulted during project preparation and has 
requested close coordination between this project and the IDB-financed Origenes program, which has many 
lessons to share regarding indigenous people participation.  An involuntary resettlement policy framework 
and action plan were prepared, although no major issues are expected since none of the sub-projects will 
require resettlement. A social safeguard assessment and action plan has been submitted by the SUBDERE. 
 
The environmental assessment report will include “chance finds procedures” for 
contractors, in case items of archaeological or historical interest are discovered during 
civil works. 
 
Regional project implementation units will need to build their capacity to introduce participatory processes 
in the way they work, as well as trained in safeguards issues.  The project therefore includes the 
strengthening of participatory processes, environmental planning and supervision capacity of government 
agencies, as an integral part of the territorial development planning and project implementation process. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultation and disclosure at the local level has taken place in the pilot development of Participatory 
Territorial Development Plans (PDTs) in the regions of the Bio Bio and Araucania, and has served as a 
basis for designing the locally-based participation and consultation mechanism that will be followed during 
project implementation.  All relevant stakeholder groups from communities, municipalities, private sector, 
civil society and regional government have participated in the elaboration of the PDTs.  Representatives of 
local stakeholders will have the opportunity to sign the PDTs and SUBDERE will be required to promote 
and monitor the specific participation of women and indigenous groups in this process.
