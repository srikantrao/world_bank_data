B.  Project Objectives  
 
The proposed program project will establish an efficient, transparent, and accessible land rights 
recording system, in order to reduce litigation, bring about long-lasting tenure security and 
promote an enabling investment climate. This will lead to widespread support, adoption and use 
of reliable land registration procedures by farmers and other end-users in participating areas of 
the Punjab Province. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The project design would follow a two-fold approach (complementary and simultaneous) 
outlined by the client: First, the identification, assessment and removal of institutional, technical 
and regulatory constraints that could prevent the GoPunjab from obtaining full benefits from the 
computerization of land records. These would be based on lessons from the pilots. And second, 
through significant improvements to the land recording system, the establishment of a demand-
oriented service concept.  
 
The types of activities for the first area include, inter alia: (a) process and business reengineering 
(covering legal, policy and institutional reforms); (b) assessment of needs for physical and 
technical infrastructure and for operational capacity of kiosks, hardware procurement and 
technical maintenance; (c) long-term and systematic training, (d) public awareness campaigns 
Page  2
and communication strategy; (e) issuance of 
Fards 
and verification of records with the public 
(including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms)
;
(f) quality assurance and technical 
assistance for the pilots; and (g) assessment of social impact, monitoring and evaluation.  
 
For the second area, activities are more IT oriented and they include: (i) acquiring licenses and/or 
source code of the AOS software
1
,
(ii) data entry services (e.g. computerization of manual 
records and services); (iii) configuration, networking and connectivity; (iv) IT training to 
District-level staff and kiosk operators; (v) correction of data entry errors, technical support and 
software maintenance (throughout the project); (vi) spatial data software development, 
(vii) hardware and software maintenance; and (viii) web-based service delivery.  
 
A
preliminary schematic description by component is attached in Annex 3.  
 
Evidence of success at the end of project implementation: 
 
·
Conclusiveness of the land registration system leading to increases in tenure security in 
the Province (e.g. measured by a gradual decrease over time in the number of land 
disputes entering the court system); 
·
Growing increase in the proportion of rural land transactions that utilize the new land 
registration system; 
·
Growing increase in the number and type of end users accessing the system; 
·
Considerable increase in user satisfaction in participating areas following the introduction 
of the new land registration procedures; 
·
Decreasing number of fraudulent land transactions due to the integrated nature of the 
recording system (e.g. connecting the deed system with the Revenue Record); 
·
Significant increase in the use of land as collateral for loans in participating areas; 
·
Significant reduction of transaction costs on land-related deals. 
 
4.  Potential risks and mitigation 
 
Potential Risks 
Mitigation Measures 
Political changes may result in lack of project 
ownership
.
There is a growing demand from the people of Punjab for 
reliable land records at the highest levels of society to which 
any new political proposal would need to respond. The project 
is a politically popular one and efforts since the mid-Nineties 
made in this regard have shown the commitment of various 
political governments. Now that a good solution is available 
the confidence in its ability and success will encourage the 
successive governments to continue with it.  
Deteriorating national security situation 
slowing down  implementation in some 
districts. 
Implementation arrangements would include local actors (e.g 
Union Nazim- who is an elected representative, Union 
Councils ).
 
Institutional culture and interests generate 
strong resistance to change and poor inter-
institutional and inter
-
departmental 
Incentives and constructive organizational restructuring 
incorporated into project design.

The WB has recommended that the source code be acquired due to the evolving and dynamic nature of the data 
and procedures to be dealt with. The BOR  fully agreed with the recommendation. During Project preparation, the 
cost-benefit analysis will include this issue in order to provide relevant guidance to the BOR and IT Departments.

Mitigation Measures 
coordination. 
Other development projects (e.g. ADB-TA) 
dealing with relevant reforms interfere with 
expected Program outcomes. 
Multi-donor approach and effective coordination from start. 
Legislation needed (e.g. to change business 
process and/or to recognize legal validity of 
Fards
 and other documentation issued 
electronically) is not passed or gets 
significantly delayed. 
Punjab Province is committed to have a state of the art 
r
egistration system and the political support at the CM’s level 
has been clearly expressed.  The Electronic Transactions 
Ordinance 2002 already provides admissibility of computer 
generated revenue record. BOR has also issued amendments 
for electronically-based documentation. With regards to other 
legal reforms, they will be linked to a highly participatory 
process reengineering, which has the full buy-in from the 
highest levels of the administration (CM and BOR).  
Safeguard issues will be addressed during project preparation. This is anticipated to be a Category C 
Project. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Although gradually, the project would be implemented in the Province of Punjab which consists of 34 
districts.  While the proposed program project aims at having a rural-urban focus due to the nature of the 
issues to be addressed 
–
and its design already includes urban-specific activities – the incorporation of a 
full urban component would be gradual given the current complex and dispersed institutional setting.
