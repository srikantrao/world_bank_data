B.  Project Objectives  
The project seeks to support the GoM’s efforts to improve the competitiveness of the Mexican 
economy through a program that (i) strengthens the innovative capacity of the private sector; (ii) 
contributes to the formation of advanced human capital;  and (iii) facilitates the integration of the 
Mexican Science, Technology and Innovation system into OECD area systems. 
Overall success of the project would be measured by the increase in private R&D from the 
current level of US$ 730 million (0.1% of GDP) to at least 0.2% of GDP.  More specifically:  (i) 
private investment into collaborative R&D centers, start-up of technology-based firms, and 
employment of R&D personal would increase from US$ 2 million per year to US$ 30 million per 
year;  (ii) a sustained reform of the scholarship program would produce 30,000 graduates in areas 
with increased employability, of which a higher share will be employed in private enterprises;  
and (iii) increase international visibility as measured  by increase in co-authorships, an increase 
towards 1% of new global S&T knowledge, and increased international participation in 
cooperative research.

C.  Project Description  
To reach the project’s development objectives, the team proposes a project with two major lines 
of investment, in addition to supporting the policy framework for and internationalization of 
Mexico’s innovation system. First, on the
 demand side
,
the project would increase support to 
business innovation; while, second, on the 
supply side
 the project accelerates formation of 
human capital (through strategic and coordinated use of the scholarship fund);  and finally it 
supports the cohesion and effectiveness of Mexico’s S,T & I system.  
(i) 
Promotion of business innovation.
 This component would stimulate R&D business 
innovation through the scaling up of three incipient programs: (a) formation of 
medium term agreements of collaborative R&D between public R&D institutions and 
a
minimum of 2 private enterprises (so-called Consortia).  The program would 
increase support to linkages between groups of medium to large enterprises with 
existing R&D absorption capacity, and public R&D centers; (b) support to technology 
start-ups through CONACYT’s technology department, and (c) support researchers in 
industry with the dual purpose of strengthening innovative capacity within firms, and 
create linkages between the universities and private R&D sector.  
(ii) 
Scholarships for excellence and relevance
.
The activities would support the on-going 
reform process of the scholarship program that seeks to link supply of skills better 
with demand from society, notably the private sector. The component would orient 
scholarships towards graduate programs of high relevance and excellent quality to 
improve Mexico’s future S&T skill base.  
(iii) 
Support for policies for enhanced innovation and internationalization
.
The aim is to 
improve the innovation system by strengthening Mexico’s S,T&I policy capacity, and 
increase international integration.  The component would:  (a) support the 
coordination and knowledge sharing between and within the private and public 
sectors;  (b) finance analytical work;  (c) finance an evaluation of existing 
CONACYT funding programs;  (d) establish a system for international accreditation 
of graduate programs;  (e) support systematic strengthening of the linkages with 
foreign S,T&I centers,  and (f) include OECD standard monitoring and evaluation.
 
The team proposes that a medium to long term implementation horizon is most appropriate, since 
successful technology upgrading takes one to two decades of continual reform and stable funding 
to reap the full benefits. The proposed duration of the project is 7 years with a phase 1 of four 
years (2006-2009), and a partially overlapping phase 2 (2008-2012).
