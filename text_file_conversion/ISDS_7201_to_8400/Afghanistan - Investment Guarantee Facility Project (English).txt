B.  Project Objectives 
 
The proposed Guarantee Facility is designed to assist Afghanistan in its reconstruction efforts by 
stimulating foreign investment through a program of political risk insurance 
–
in an environment 
where the perception of political risk by foreign investors is still very high.  The World Bank 
Group and the Government of Afghanistan expect the project to stimulate private business 
activity and attract foreign private investment in a variety of sectors, including but not limited to 
manufacturing, agribusiness, banking, and smaller scale infrastructure projects.  They expect the 
project to stimulate the local economy, employment, create tax revenues, and assist in the 
transfer from abroad to Afghanistan of modern technologies and business practices. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
In order to fund the Guarantee Facility, it is proposed that IDA will provide a credit for US$5 
million to the Government of Afghanistan to develop a political risk insurance program 
administered and implemented by MIGA. In addition, the GOA has authorized US$5 million of 
ADB resources for the Guarantee Facility and has encouraged MIGA to mobilize additional 
donor funds.

In conjunction with MIGA, the proposed Guarantee Facility will cover eligible foreign 
investment against the risks of War and Civil Disturbance, Expropriation, Transfer Restriction 
and Breach of Contract.  Currently, MIGA is one of the very few institutions that is able to 
provide political risk insurance cover for Afghanistan
1
,
making it very difficult for MIGA to 
share risks with others.  This in turn limits the scope of activities that the Agency could 
undertake in Afghanistan in the next few years.  Risk sharing with other private and public 
insurers is a vital tool for any financial institution to manage risk.  MIGA does this in two major 
ways: through a treaty reinsurance program, whereby a pre-agreed percentage of every project is 
reinsured by MIGA’s treaty reinsurers (consisting of two private insurance companies) and 
through facultative reinsurance, whereby the reinsurance partners and amounts are decided on a 
project by project basis.  While all projects benefit from (some minimal) treaty reinsurance, 
many projects also involve risk sharing with other private and public insurers through the 
facultative reinsurance/coinsurance program.   
 
Unfortunately, in the case of Afghanistan, MIGA’s abilities to share risks with others are 
extremely limited.  Most public insurers (the export credit agencies) currently do not wish to 
operate in Afghanistan, although some have indicated they will on a limited scale (e.g., OPIC).   
In addition, in view of the high level of risk, MIGA will have to pay careful attention not to 
impair its relationship with its treaty reinsurers, which could hurt its ability to provide insurance 
in other developing countries.  The proposed IDA credit will allow MIGA to efficiently share 
risks, thereby significantly increasing the political risk insurance capacity that is currently 
available for Afghanistan from sources worldwide.  
 
With regard to the structure of the proposed Facility, MIGA and World Bank would follow a 
structure, which in previous cases, has been successful. The World Bank provides a credit and 
the IDA funds are disbursed to a commercial bank, acting as Trustee of the Facility.  MIGA will 
be the implementing agent of the Facility.  ADB, MIGA and World Bank lawyers, in cooperation 
with the their respective competent safeguard staff, will ensure that the structural design of the 
facility complies with all applicable safeguard policies and procedures. 
 
As the Implementing Agency, MIGA has the sole authority to issue guarantees, backed by funds 
in the account held by the Trustee.  This requires Host Country Approval from the Government 
of Afghanistan.  In the case of a claim, MIGA will have the authority to mediate the claim with 
the Government of Afghanistan, and in the case of an unresolved claim, MIGA will also have the 
sole authority to call for the Trustee to pay out a claim.   
 
D.  Project location  
 
All guarantees supported by the IDA funding will be for firms to be located in Afghanistan. In 
selecting the projects, the Facility will follow MIGA’s regular underwriting procedures and 
methodologies.  The Guarantee Facility will ensure that all projects comply with MIGA’s 
environmental guidelines and Board-approved  Safeguard Policies.

Afghanistan became a member of MIGA in July 2003, and is, therefore, eligible for MIGA’s guarantee program

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
MIGA is the implementing agency for the Guarantee Facility, that will be funded in part by the 
IDA credit.  Therefore, the Government’s institutional capacity with regard to safeguard policies 
is not applicable.  In view of the need for an independent assessment of the political risks in 
Afghanistan and in the selection of projects that meet objective criteria with respect to their 
commercial viability and contribution to economic development, MIGA, as the expert political 
risk insurance institution, has been chosen to be the implementing agency for the Guarantee 
Facility.  MIGA will be responsible for not only the marketing of the Facility, and selection and 
underwriting of projects, but also for implementation of  the environmental guidelines and 
Board-approved Safeguard Policies for the Facility. MIGA has the institutional capacity to 
ensure that any projects that trigger environment/social development safeguards are adequately 
and appropriately reviewed.
