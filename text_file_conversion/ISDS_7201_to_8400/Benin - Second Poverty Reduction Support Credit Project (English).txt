A.2. Project Objectives

The proposed operation constitutes the second of a series ofPoverty Reduction Strategy Credits (PRSCs)
designed to help the Government implement its Poverty Reduction Strategy that was launched in December
2002. The move toward a policy and results-based dialogue (initiated under the PERAC in 2001) has
gained momentum over the past 12 months, leading to improved dialogue and interactions between the
Ministry ofFinance and Economy and line ministries, and to increasing Government leadership in program
preparation and implementation, and to better donor coordination. The proposed PRSC-2 would help
improve the efficacy ofpoverty reduction efforts by strengthening public expenditure management and
increasing the efficiency of service delivery. The line ministries are expected to become more responsible
and efficient in budget formulation and execution.

A.3. Project Description

PRSC-2 ($30 million equivalent) would support: (a) key policy measures aimed at bolstering the medium-
term macroeconomic framework; (b) cross-cutting public expenditure management reforms, civil service
reforms, and decentralization programs; (c) improved service delivery, governance, and institutional
capacity in the Rural Transport, Agriculture, and Justice sectors; and (d) continued implementation of the
Environment and Urban Sanitation and the Forest Management programs, including appropriate funding,
execution, and monitoring. This support will ensure that these two programs are properly funded,
implemented and monitored.

In particular, PRSC-2 will support activities in the following three pillars.

Pillar-i Accelerate Sustainable Economic Growth:

       The PRSC program would support the first generation of structural reforms, aimed at increasing
       private sector investment and thus enhancing its contribution to economic growth. In particular, the
       PRSC would focus on: (a) strengthening the legal and judicial systems, under PRSC-2; and (b)
        improving the private sector environment. Preparatory work would take place in three steps: (a)
        carry out a thorough assessment of impediments to private sector development; (b) based on this
        diagnostic, develop a realistic and articulated private sector-led growth strategy, and a medium-term,
       results-based implementation program, both in close consultation with the private sector; and (c)
        develop a public-private partnership to implement this strategy.

                                                                           r                          -

* Overall Agriculture sector: In this sector, The program will focus on five strategic objectives: (a)
  increasing crop yields and overall agricultural productivity; (b) building rural infrastructure; (c)
  improving access to markets; (d) strengthening sector management; and (e) protecting natural
  resources. The program would provide technical assistance, along with other sector donors, to
  develop a results-based implementation program; and would support implementation of the sector
  strategy in line with the PRSP objectives.

* Cotton sector reform: Under PRSC-2, the Government would consolidate the functioning of the
  cotton sector by (i) restoring a well-functioning system of importation and distribution of inputs, and
  of the primary marketing of cotton, and (ii) establishing incentives for producers to boost production.
  Implementation of the reform should help ensure that the marketing season for cotton proceeds
  normally, and in particular, that: (a) input distributions are made through the agreed-upon
  mechanism by all interested parties; (b) there is no parallel marketing circuit; (c) cotton producers
  are paid on time; (d) input credits are recovered entirely and the critical functions are well
  performed; (e) the new operators of SONAPRA after the privatization are in place and operating;
  and (f) the established rules are respected by all actors and enforced by the State.

* Rural Transport: The PRSC would support the development and implementation of a National Rural
  Transport Strategy, as a means to increase the transport sector's contribution to economic growth.
  The program would also support an investment program focusing on two objectives: (a) improving
  the access of rural communities to basic social services, and the access of traders to remote
  production areas, through cost-effective and demand-driven infrastructure services; and (b)
  strengthening the management of the rural transport sector.

  adequate M & E system for the monitoring or water resources, and (iv) support the decentralization
  and deconcentration ofrural water supply services;

* Agricultural development activities aim to: (i) improve the efficiency of the core functions of the
  Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock at the national and regional level, (ii) create the enabling
  conditions necessary for the effective participation of producer organizations in sector management,
  (iii) improve access to agricultural services access for the poor and the cotton sector, in collaboration
  with the CDD program, and (iv) to develop decentralized, demand-driven and integrated agricultural
  services, (v) improve public and private agricultural investment promotion;

* Cotton sector reform will (i) design and implement a single mechanism for the importation and
  distribution of inputs and cotton primary marketing with clear indication ofpenalties for those who

        do not respect the mechanism, (ii) review the rules for the inter-profession, reorganize it to facilitate
        internal debate, but accept only a single inter-professional group with a clear definition of the
        relationship between the inter-profession and the Government and between the different professional
        groups; adopt a framework that would clearly define these relationships and make them legally
       binding; (iii) get the different professional organizations (producers, input distributors, ginners) to
        agree on their internal regulations and how they will operate within the rules of the reform; (iv)
       confirm the status and timetable for the privatization of SONAPRA's gins and confirm that there
       will be no further involvement of SONAPRA (bis) in the cotton sector;

     l In rural transport: (i) implement a multi-year rural road investment program targeted to the poorest
       and most under-served areas, based on clear criteria for selecting optimal level of service; (ii)
       establish appropriate institutional arrangements for managing and financing local rural roads in the
       context of decentralization; (iii) provide incentives to promote transport services in rural areas;
       (iv) improve the financial and management capacity of local governments and conmnunities; (v)
       strengthen national, regional and local coordination mechanisms; (vi) strengthen the capacity of the
       Rural Road Directorate at the central level and regional rural road administration to implement the
       program; and (vii) establish an appropriate monitoring and evaluation system.

    * Environmental management and urban sanitation: (i) improve the M&E and performance
       measurement tools for program budgets, (ii) prepare a plan for increasing the coverage of sanitation
       services in low-income and disadvantaged areas in Cotonou and Porto-Novo, and other secondary

       sufficient funding and adequate equipment to the forest service, (ii) continue consultation process for
       the creation of forest user associations as partners to the co-management schemes between the forest
       service and local communities living on adjacent lands, (iii) prepare forest management plans, and
       establish an M&E system, and (iv) review and update of forestry legislation.


Pillar - 3 Improving Governance and Public Sector management:

    * Results- based budgeting : (i) continue and implement action to improve the quality of the MTEFs
       and the links between the program budgets and sectoral MTEFs, (ii) design and implement a
       transition strategy from project to program-based budgeting, (ii) develop a technical guide including
       quality standards for content and documentation for the preparation ofprogram budgets, (iv) develop
       and implement a stronger performance monitoring and M & E capacity building program, and (v)
       extend the coverage of the integrated public expenditure management system to all externally funded
       programs;

    * Budget execution: Under PRSC-2, the Government would be expected to take action to: (a) improve
       implementation of medium-term program budgets through multi-year management of investment
       expenditure; (b) further strengthen and improve spending procedures, and ensure the full
       functionality of integrated computerized expenditure budget management system (SIGFIP), and
       particularly the full integration of all public expenditures into the system; (c) improve SIGFIP's
       capacity to generate more and better financial information on budget execution; and (d) decentralize
       SIGFIP to the regional level.


    * Improving accounting: PRSC-2 would support the following reforms: (a) installation of a new
       computerized accounting system (ASTER), in Treasury at the central level, and then at the regional
       level; (b) creation of an automatic interface between Treasury's computerized accounts (ASTER)
       and the computerized expenditure management system (SIGFIP), to ensure consistency between
       administrative accounting and general Treasury accounting; and (c) improvements in the Treasury

        account statement to comprehensively reflect fiscal operations;

      * Internal Control and Audit: The Government is expected to plan and implement an overall reform of
        its intemal control function, which would simplify and strengthen its internal audit capacity in line
        with the shift toward results-based public expenditure management, also to be implemented under
        PRSC-2 in 2005. The organization and attributions of intemal audit both at the level of line
        ministries and in the overall government would be clarified, and professional norms and standards
        would be defined to ensure an effective control function consistent with results-based management.

      * External Oversight:       The supreme audit institution is       expected to be enhanced through
        implementation of the following measures: (a) - audits of communes and selected state-owned
        enterprises starting in 2005; (b) - more timely submission of government accounts to the Chamber of
        Accounts; (c) - further capacity building and technical assistance for staff;       (d)   application of
        intemational standards of financial audits for the public sector; (e) timely reporting to the National
        Assembly; (f) - progressive integration of financial and performance audit reporting as a basis for
        Budget Reporting Laws; and (g) - systematic identification and publication of transgressions in
        managing public resources;


     * Public Procurement: The Government would complete the requirements for establishing the five
        pillars of the procurement reform: (a) Establish a modem legal procurement framework acceptable
        by intemational standards and in conformity with WAEMU's regulations, (b) Ensure that the
        Procurement Code includes modem methods of procurement, and develop tools such as standard
        bidding documents and databases for prices and suppliers; (c) Develop and implement a national
        capacity building strategy; (d) - Systematize a non-jurisdictional, independent technical audit and set
        up an effective mechanism for complaints., (e) - Create effective anti-corruption measures at all
        stages in the procurement process, in line with the Government's anti-corruption program.

     * Legal and Judicial Sector:        Implementation Plan for 2005-07 supported by PRSCs             aims to
        strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency, and accessibility of the justice system by: (a) Improving the
        capacity ofMoJ to carry out the reforms; (b) - Improving service delivery ofthe courts by reformning
        the court clerk's office, improving equipment for the courts, and improving training (including
        continuing training) for all legal professionals; (c) -    Modernizing the penitentiary system by
        instituting alternative sanctions, improving      infrastructure of the prison system, and improving
        training ofinmates for social reintegration; (d) - More effective human rights protection, particularly
        of minorities, women, children, and youth, by modernizing the national legal framework and gearing
        it to the realities in the country and by building awareness among the population of their legal and
        human rights.

     * Reducing the Incidence of Violence and Corruption: PRSC-2 would support the Government's
        efforts to: (a) reduce the fiduciary and other risks associated with the provision of direct budgetary
        support (b) integrate its anti-corruption efforts into broader public expenditure management reforms;
        and (c) update and finalize the Strategic Anti-Corruption Plan. As a key input to reducing fiduciary
        risks, PRSC-2 would support the strengthening of existing accountability mechanisms and of human
        and institutional capacity in Government institutions;

Public Communication and Transparency: The following initiatives are supported by PRSC-2, to enhance
information disclosure and improve Government communication: (a) Analyze the regulatory framework on
Government information, and assess the perceptions and attitudes ofrelevant stakeholders, including
legislators, regarding the issues of transparency and disclosure ofinformation; (b) Review and enhance the
existing public information and communication systems of the line mninistries, as well as the inter- and
intra-ministerial communication systems and mechanisms ; (c) Develop and implement a comprehensive
national information and communication strategy on the PRSP and PRSC, (d) Introduce participatory
monitoring mechanisms to allow stakeholders to monitor the quality ofkey public service delivery.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key SafeguardIssues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Key Safeguard Issues:

     The potential adverse environmental and social effects associated with the proposed PRSC-2 are
mainly related to the rural /semi-urban water supply activities, the health sector interventions,              the
investment in rural roads, the implementation of the forest management schemes, and the intensification of
agricultural production, including cotton production.(i) the drilling of wells for rural water supply, and (ii)
medical waste generation and handling.

     While the drilling of wells may only have minimal adverse impact on the physical environment, the
use of the water sources and the maintenance of their surroundings could generate environmental            effects
stemming from the lack of adequate hygiene and the spread ofwater-borne disease (e.g., diarrhea        caused by
wastewater, mosquitoes, etc.).      Such effects may create public health concerns.         In addition to these
concerns, the site and the drilling of wells could take away land from uses that support the livelihood         of
specific members of local communities.        The mismanagement and inadequate disposal of medical and
biomedical wastes (body tissues, blood or body fluids and pathogens, sharp instruments, pharmaceutical
compounds and packaging, etc. are also the source of substantial public health risks.

     The construction or rehabilitation of roads can result in several types of adverse environmental and
social impacts. Earthworks, right-of-way preparation, drainage works, quarries and borrow pits,           vehicle
and equipment servicing and fueling, etc. can cause damage to (i) non-living environment                (physical
features, soils, water resources, air), (ii) living environment (flora, fauna), and (iii)         to the human
environment (impairment of economic activities, human settlements, and public health and           safety, etc ).).
Agricultural The intensification of agriculture, and especially cotton production wkill likely require an the
increased use of pesticides. The misuse of pesticides has the potential for serious adverse environmental
(surface and groundwater, fauna, flora), public health and safety impacts.           To sum up, the activities
supported through of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock that are supported by PRCS-2 may raise
potential pest management issues. As a result, the Bank safeguards policy related to pest management         (i.e.,
OP 4.09) is triggered.    Finally, while the development and implementation of community-based forest
management schemes will yield significant positive effects on the resource base, the restriction of certain
types and level of uses of forests and forest products may impose hardship, or at least reduce the access to
livelihood means of some segments of the local communities. Such effects        will receive adequate treatment
consistent with the resettlement operational policy (OP 4.12).


Most of the environmental and social impacts of these investment programs supported by PRSC-2 are
expected to be modest, and would be reversible through appropriate mitigation actions.       PRSC-2 will
finance the measures needed in order to eliminate or at least minimize the negative environmental and
social impacts described above. The Environmental and Social Management Plan of the PRSC-2             identifies
the responsible institutions that are responsible for implementing and monitoring    the mitigation measures
associated with each category ofsectoral investments. The Benin Environmental Agency will be
responsible for overseeing the execution of the ESMP of PRSC-2. An appropriate reporting         mechanism
will also be put in place to ensure that sectoral partners as well as external partners are kept abreast of the
implementation performance.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long terrn impacts due to anticipated future activities in   the
project area. No known indirect or direct long-term impacts associated with     future activities are anticipated
at this time.
D.3. Describe the treatment ofalternatives (if relevant): N/A

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment         of

  borrower capacity to plan and implement the     measures described. A more elaborated description        ofthe
  measures presented below are found in the EA annex        to the PRSC-2 Program Document.

       Institutions for environmental management have         developed slowly but steadily in Benin since the
  creation of the Ministry of Environment in 1992.       The country adopted an overarching environmental         law
  (loi cadre sur l'environnement) in 1999 that places       environmental impact assessment at the core of         the
  Government efforts towards achieving the goals       ofthe sustainable development. Following the       creation of
  the Benin Environmental Agency in 1995, the       country benefited from the Bank support from 1996-2001          in
  the implementation of the Environmental Management            Project that focused on the creation of the basic
I institutional and technical capacity for enviromnental        management.     Environmental impact assessment I
  (EIA) was one ofthe key areas of emphasis of     the capacity building efforts. These capacity building      efforts
  consisted of three main types of activities     including (i) enacting a framework environmental          law with
  specific requirements for EIA (and preparing and          adopting implementation decrees for EIA law),          (ii)
  developing sectoral guidelines for EIA, and      (iii) holding several training workshops for the      staff in line
  nministries, in consulting firms, and a few NGOs.      These training workshops started in 2000       and have had
  several rounds with differing thematic focus and     complexity.

       In addition to the training of staff from the  line ministries, the Environmental Agency helped      to create
  EIA cells in the following ministries: (i) economy     and finance, (ii) public health, (iii) nationaldefense, (iv)
  basic education, (v) public works and transport,        (vi) agriculture, livestock and fisheries, (vii)   mining,
  energy and water resources, (viii) interior,     security and decentralization, (ix) industry,     commerce and
  employment, (x) information, communication           and new technologies. Of these ministries,        seven have
  enacted an arrete ministeriel that establishes the  legal foundation for the operations of these cells. The   main
  role of these units is to undertake the screening of the   public investment projects included in the budget      of
  each year, and recommend appropriate actions       (under the guidance of the Enviromnental Agency)         aiming
  to mitigate any residual negative environmental          or social impacts. Based on the sectoral        guidelines
  prepared by the Agency, they provide guidance       and supervision of EIA studies, and mitigations      plans. All
  the expenditure programs supported by PRSC-2          (health, education, water supply, rural roads,   agriculture,
  urban environment, forestry) are located in   line ministries where sectoral environmental      impact assessment
  cells have been created supported by PRSC-1             (health, education, water supplv). The Ministry           of
  Environment, Housing, and Urban Development           will continue to provide the Benin environmental      agency
  with the budgetary resources that will allow     the agency to continue the upgrading of its       operational and
  technical capacity, particularly in strategic   environmental assessment.       These new skills will help the
  agency in order to provide the best possible     oversight to the sectoral EIA units in the     implementation of
  their respective ESMPs.

       During the implementation of the Environmental             Management Project (1996-2001), the -Benin
  Environmental Agency helped to establish            municipal associations for environmental management
  (AMAE). These associations (NGO status) also         benefited from training in environmental assessment,       and
  in local investment planning in the area of environmental        management. Following the formal creation of
  the communes and the first municipal elections             in 2002, the AMAE are collaborating with              the
  municipalities in the area of local environmental    management.

  EnvironmentalPolicy Implementation

       In addition to the NEAP (updated in 2001), the           Ministry of Environment, Housing, and Urban
  Development (MEHU) has adopted in 2002 a Medium-Term              Strategic Plan (2002-2006) that highlights the
  main objectives ofthe country in the area of environmental       management, housing, and urban development.
  The Environment Directorate and the Benin Environmental          Agency share the responsibility and objectives
  ofthe Ministry's mandate in area of environmental       management. This mandate that focuses on the control
  of the country's major environmental threats evolves          around the following activities (i) strengthening
  deepening the regulatory framework, (ii) developing      environmental compliance and enforcement tools,        (iii)
  protecting of coastal resources and controlling costal erosion,   (iv) controlling urban transport pollution, and
  (v) increasing access to urban sanitation and drainage    services.

       These activities are fully reflected in the Ministry's 2005         budget, and medium-term expenditure

framework supported by PRSC-2. The Ministry          has also developed an effective expenditure     tracking, and
activity/performance monitoring system that      is now followed by other ministries. It is  the progress toward
strategic planning and effective performance          monitoring, especially in the area of environmental
management that led to the inclusion of      the Environment Program (of MEHU) in PRSC-1.            PRSC-2 will
ensure that this Program continues to be implemented,       and is supported with adequate budgetary    resources.
The integration of environmental impact      assessment (big spending items that clearly     require attention in
terms of environmental impacts) in increased      sectoral spending is one of the two indicators   included in the
PRSC-2 monitoring matrix (see Program Document).

ArrangementsforBorrowerto Address SafegutardIssues

     Based on the above, it is fair to state that Benin  would have the institutional, regulatory,   and technical
capacity required to support the implementation      ofthe measures needed to ensure compliance       with its own
EA law as well as Bank safeguard policies. In      addition to the general framework for applying    due diligence
and compliance with the country's environmental         legislation, a review of the implementation    of PRSC-2
specific enviromnental assessment measures         used in each of the ministries supported      by PRSC-2 was
conducted. The result of this review    and the lessons leamed from the implementation       of the environmental
and social management plan of PRSC-1         will help identify the most effective ways    to ensure compliance
with the Bank safeguard policies during the    implementation of PRSC-2. The recommended            sector specific
measures aimed at mitigating any negative     environmental and social impacts are described     below.

Arrangementsfor dealingwith environmentalandsocialsafeguardsin              sectoralministries


(i)  Investments in Rural Water Supply
     The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources,               in particular, is among the departments         that
acknowledged most the importance        of these EIA cells by giving them a legal      mandate (i.e., adopted an
arrete ministeriel that clarifies the roleofthe sectoral EIA unit). The environmental      safeguards adopted by
the Ministry in the area ofrural water supply    and water resource management include      the following:


     * Mandatory full EIA for dam;
     * Avoid unsanitary sites (cemeteries, near     dump sites, cattle pens and sites that served  this purpose in

       the past);
     * Control ofwastewater and mud around wells;
     * Sensitization ofusers on hygiene; and
     * Imposing restrictions on the distance between     wells and latrines (at least 15 meters).

     These measures will continue to be enforced         during the implementation of the rural      water supply
investment of the proposed Credit. The     Government is not directly involved in      the process of designating
the location where the wells are drilled.   This process is completed by the requesting     community through a
consultation process facilitated by NGOs.         The drilling starts only when the community          reaches an
agreement on the selection of the site.     This agreement must be based on a        donation title signed by the
commune. This process has worked fine so far.

(ii) Medical Waste Management

     Environmental safeguards for the Ministry      of Health have to do mainly with the treatment    and disposal
of medical wastes. In 1998, the Ministry      of Health and the Ministry of Environment,     Housing, and Urban
Development jointly prepared and adopted       a National Sanitation Action Plan. This     Action Plan includes a
component on health care waste management           that has three categories of expenditures,   namely, training,
acquisition of health care equipment,    and incinerators. The lack of sufficient    financing (total cost in 1998
was US$ 1.1 million) has impeded the implementation        ofthis Action Plan.

     Fortunately, the implementation of the         Environmental Management Plan of the Multi-Sectoral
HIV/AIDS Project provided the opportunity        to implement the most urgent and cost-effective     actions of the
health care waste management component         of the National Action Plan. In fact, a waste    management plan

(covering the whole country) prepared by the           borrower was cleared bv ASPEN in early 2002.
Consequently, there is no need to prepare another plan. The       project is now under implementation along
with the waste management plan. PRSC-2 will       use the same plan and rely on the existing implementation
mechanisms to meet the safeguards requirements     in the area ofhealth service provision.

(iii) Forest Management Activities

      Although no reliable data on changes in forest   area is available, it is a common knowledge that the
forest resource base of Benin has been decreasing at    an accelerated rate over the last years. Efforts by the
Government to reduce the rate of deforestation have      been hampered by fast growing demand for forest
products, vested interests in the forest industry, and property rights          issues.    The Program for the
Management of Forests and Adjacent Lands aims at developing         new and more effective ways to reducing
the rate of deforestation through the implementation of four   set of activities: (i) restructuring ofthe forestry
administration, (ii) providing technical and organizational assistance    to local communities for sustainable
forest resource management, (iii) stimulating private investment          in forest-based enterprises and in
altemative sources of income for the rural communities       living near gazetted forests, and (iv) promoting
sustainable agricultural practices in order to reduce encroachment      of forest lands. This Program is co-
financed by the GEF in a separate operation.

      GEF will support activities aiming at managing the forests and adjacent      lands in an integrated way so
as to reduce encroachment onto the remaining forest    lands, and protect the forest resource base. In addition
to yielding benefits to the local populations (reduced    degradation of forest and land resources leads to
increased agricultural outputs and forest products), the implementation       of integrated forest and adjacent
land management plans will produce multiple global benefits including: (i)       enhanced carbon sequestration,
(ii) increased and more effective protection of biological   diversity, and (iii) protection of water resources
and watersheds. The planned activities are organized into      three components, including: (i) Technical and
managerial capacity strengthening of the central and            regional forestry administration units, (ii)
Development and implementation of participatory forest and         adjacent land management plans, and (iii)
Sustainable production of fuel wood.        Although the GEF component is still under preparation,            the
Government has started the implementation of the Program since       2002. The It is important to mention that
local populations and communities living around the forests          selected for co-management were fully
involved in the preparatory activities. phase of the forest management    program. This involvement resulted
in the formulation of a sub-component titled "Sustainable use and community             development" aiming to
provide community members who might lose economic opportunities          with alternative livelihood means.

      Overall, the proposed activities are not expected to generate noticeable         environmental and social
damage. Except for forest enrichment activities, little or no physical or    structural investments are planned
within the forest areas. However, the co-management plans could result       in reduced access to the resources
by the neighboring communities as way to ensure the sustainable use      of the forest resources. As part of the
preparation of the GEF component, an environmental and social assessment            of the full program is being
prepared, and will be completed by the time the PRSC-2 is effective.          This assessment will develop an
environmental and social management plan that will propose             mitigation measures for any adverse
biophysical and social effects that might result from the implementation         of the proposed activities. In
particular, the study will identify clearly and account for the various categories    of resources users affected
by the planned activities, and prepare a resettlement process       framework that establishes a mechanism
whereby affected people get to participate in planning, design, implementation          and monitoring to ensure
that any restriction of access to customary resources is handled  in accordance with OP 4.12.


(iv) Urban Sanitation

      Urban sanitation services have improved steadily in the two major      cities of the country (Cotonou and
Porto-Novo) since the mid 1990s.        However, the concems for unhealthy sanitation and environmental
conditions are growing in low-income neighborhoods of Cotonou         and Porto-Novo, and in secondary cities.
The improvement of sanitation infrastructure in low-income urban       areas, especially in Cotonou and Porto-
Novo could generate noticeable environmental and social impacts.          Such impacts are known to a great
extent because the existing sanitation master prepared          in 1998 included an environmental impact

assessment study that proposed an environmental and social management         plan. PRSC-2 will help update
the 1998 master sanitation plan by selecting high priority low-income areas     where urgent improvement of
sanitation services is needed in order to reduce the burden of environment-related    diseases. Investment in
terms of earth work and construction of drains will not start until 2005      because (i) the 2004 sanitation
budget is allocated primarily to the completion of on-going sanitation   work in other areas, and (ii) the need
to complete area-specific technical studies. As part of these studies,    the 1998 environmental and social
study will be updated to meet the specific needs of the targeted areas.       In addition, the Government is
preparing a resettlement policy framework (RPF) as part of the preparation    of the second decentralized city
management project. The RPF will be completed by February 2005.           These studies will be completed by
the time the preparation of the 2005 budget starts (May 2004).

(v) Pest management in agriculture and cotton sub-sector development

     In conformity with the World Bank safeguards policies, the government prepared          an environmental
management plan (EMP) as part of the cotton sector reform program       started in 2002. This EMP consisted
oftwo major parts: (a) the environmental audit of the ginning plants that  were eligible for privatization, and
(b) the pest management plan. The environmental audit provided         recommendations related to workers'
safety, pollution control within the plants, and outside in the neighboring communities, and road safety. In
compliance with the pest management safeguard policy, the pest management          plan (PMP) is designed to
minimize potential negative impacts on human health and the environment,           and to promote alternative
ways of pest control. The plan also helped to screen pest control products    for better efficiency and safety
of the use of such pesticides. Finally, the plan includes a capacity building   component (training, targeted
research, and awareness raising). This plan that has been in use since 2002   will continue to guide the work
on environmental and social safeguards in the agricultural expenditure programs supported     by PRSC-2.

(vi) Rural roads and safeguards

     The preparation of the sectoral transport program (Programme Sectoriel Transport)      in 1996 integrated
operational directives for environment (Directives en matiere d'environnement).            The directorate of
national road network (direction du reseau routier national) was in charge  of irnplementing these directives.
These environmental directives that are included in the implementation       manual of the sectoral transport
program include two sets of measures: (i) an environmental and social       management framework for road
rehabilitation investment, and (ii) guidance for developing full environmental           assessment for road
construction. The environmental and social management framework included          the following issues, among
others:

     * Compensatory measures for involuntary resettlement,
     * Sensitization and awareness raising on HIV/AIDS and other STDs,
l    * Restoration of borrow pits and quarries,
     * Construction anti-erosion structures when necessary,
     * Waste management on construction sites, and
     * Dust reduction and control.

Following the adoption and enactment ofthe framework environmental        law in February 1999, the Ministry
ofPublic Works and Transport created an office for environmental studies     in September 1999. This office
benefited from technical and financial suppordfrom DANIDA for the       implementation ofthe environmental
directives. Along with other line ministries, the Ministry established and environmental   cell in 2001 (as
indicated above). This cell is now in charge of overseeing the integration of environmental   and social
aspects into the planning and implementation of investments. In order to take into  account the sectoral
guidelines published by the Benin Envirommental Agency, the sectoral environmental       directives were
expanded in 2002. PRSC-2 will rely on these mechanisms for the integration of environmental        and social
safeguards into the implementation ofthe planned investments.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation    and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected peole.

PRSCs support key activities that are identified in Benin's   PRSP. The PRSP process includes extensive
consultations with civil society and stakeholders on the   central and local level. The preparation of the two
associated GEF operations has had a long consultation process     both at the regional (i.e., prefecture,
municipal), and local levels (i.e., individual villages orcommunities) likely to be involved in the planned
activities. In fact, the strong involvement oflocal  communities in the implementation phase is critical for
the success ofthese natural resource management activities.     As a result, the institutional arrangements for
the implementation of these activities are centered on a  network of user associations (i.e., forest user
associations for the forestry component). The role    of these community-based user associations in the
implementation phase has been discussed extensively      during regional preparation workshops in which
participated representatives of local governments,   deconcentrated units of line ministries involved, and
local NGOs. Detailed description of the role of these    associations is provided in the respective project
documents (GEF project brief).

In accordance with the Bank disclosure policy, the    EA annex and the Pest Management Plan (PMP) have
been disclosed in the InfoShop on January 27, 2005 and March       8, 2005, respectively. The French version of
the EA annex has been disclosed in Benin in the sectoral ministries    involved in PRSC-2 and in the Country
Office of the World Bank on February 2, 2005. The French version       ofthe PMP is being translated and is
expected to be disclosed in-country on April 15, 2005 through a workshop.
