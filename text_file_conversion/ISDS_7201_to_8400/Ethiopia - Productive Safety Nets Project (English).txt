A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of Phase one of the project is to move from a relief-oriented 
to a development-oriented safety net by (i) providing predictable, multi-annual resources, 
(ii) replacing food with cash as the primary medium of the grant, and (iii) making 
resources available for critical capital, technical assistance, and administrative costs. 
Moreover, the project aims to significantly strengthen community involvement by 
supporting community targeting and local-level participatory planning as core principles 
of the program. Further, emphasis will be placed on relating public works activities to 
addressing some of the underlying causes of food insecurity, especially with respect to 
soil and water conservation. The proposed measures are expected to lead to significant 
improvements in the productivity of the safety net over the current humanitarian system.  
 
The Productive Safety Net Program is a key element of the Bank’s support to the 
implementation of the Government’s poverty reduction strategies outlined in the SDPRP.  
The Program is a major instrument for achieving the Government’s clearly stated goal of 
reducing vulnerability and attaining food security for approximately five million 
chronically food insecure people by 2009.  The Productive Safety Net is expected to 
contribute to the reduction in the number of Ethiopians suffering from extreme hunger, 
malnutrition, and poverty (MDG 1), and to the restoration and rehabilitation of the 
environment by strengthening soil and water conservation (MDG 7). It will also build 
public infrastructure on community land or at the request of the beneficiary, and it will 
undertake maintenance of such infrastructure. Through the provision of grants rather than 
food, the project will enable small-holder farmers to invest in economic activities (e.g. 
purchase fertilizer) and stimulate the development of rural markets. 
A.3. Project Description. 
Page  2
The proposed APL will finance the following two key components: 
 
Component 1: Safety Net Activities 
 
a) Labor-intensive public works, 
which
 
will provide grants to households whose adults 
participate in the public works program. Activities to be undertaken as part of public 
works will be determined locally by the beneficiary communities through an annual, 
participatory planning process.  With appropriate technical assistance being provided by 
woredas and regions, projects will focus on, but are not limited to, environmental 
rehabilitation. A specific budget for administrative costs and equipment will be allocated.  
Furthermore, as the most appropriate time for undertaking public works is during the dry 
season, and the period of most need for food insecure households is during the rainy 
season, a system of deferred payment of grants will be established. Public works 
participants will receive 50 percent of the grant at the end of the month in which they 
have worked, and 50 percent will be deferred until later in the year. This will ensure that 
households have the resources available when they are most needed, that works can be 
undertaken at the most appropriate time, and that public works activities do not compete 
with the intensive agricultural season.  
 
b) Direct support
 will provide grants to households who are labor-poor and cannot 
undertake public works. Beneficiaries will include, but are not limited to, orphans, 
pregnant and lactating mothers, elderly households, other labor-poor, high risk 
households with sick (HIV/AIDS) individuals, and the majority of female-headed 
households with young children.  
Component 2:
 
Institutional Support
 
This component will focus on strengthening all aspects of program implementation, 
including (i) capacity building at community level to strengthen beneficiary identification 
and local level planning, technical training at woreda and regional level to ensure that all 
projects are appropriately designed, and financial management and procurement training 
to ensure smooth program implementation; (ii) support to the development of a 
monitoring and evaluation framework and the program MIS. This includes the 
implementation of a benefi
ciary survey, and a detailed program “process” survey after 24 
months. It will also finance several additional studies as part of the shift to the Second 
Phase APL, and (iii) procurement of essential goods and services.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The first phase of the project will provide partial financing to the Government’s full 
program which will operate in approximately 242 chronically food insecure woredas. 
These woredas have been identified using specific selection criteria outlined in the 
Government’s draft Program Implementation Manual. 
 
Projects will be implemented in rural areas, within the identified regions. In cropping 
Page  3
areas, they are expected to be within around 5 kilometres of the homes of the intended 
beneficiaries, or less in areas of steep or difficult terrain.

Comments: 
The Productive Safety Net Program includes a community ‘public works’ 
component aimed at developing communal infrastructure and assets in areas of chronic 
food shortage. The program will make food or cash payments for labor provided by 
community members in the implementation of the projects. The Government’s full 
Program is expected to serve around 242 woredas, in which public works will be 
conducted over a five-year period in approximately 3,600 kebeles, involving some 21,600 
villages. The Bank’s support will finance a part of the overall program.   
 
The selection of the  public works activities will be driven by the local planning process. 
They may include, for example, hillside terracing, land reclamation, improvement of 
roads or bridges, improved access to water, or repair of health facilities. In the case of 
pastoralist areas, it is to be expected that projects may include development of water 
points, agro-forestry, or initiatives related to livestock.  Given the nature and large 
number of these public works, it is important that their design and implementation follow 
good practice in order to manage any potentially adverse impacts. While it is 
acknowledged that many of the public works will themselves be intended to rehabilitate 
the natural resource base, it is equally important that such projects be well-designed and 
executed to ensure that undesirable impacts are avoided or mitigated.  
 
Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Impact Assessment
 (EIA) proclamation, the World Bank’s 
safeguard policies and international standards subscribed to by other potential partners in 
the PSNP are applicable to the Safety Net programme. In keeping with Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Impact Assessment
 proclamation, the term ‘environment’ in this context 
covers biophysical, social and cultural heritage impacts.  In the case of the Productive 
Safety Net Program, where individual projects are numerous, community-based, and not 
known in advance, it is not realistic to execute EIAs.  The Government, with the 
assistance from the World Bank has produced a global Environmental Management 
Framework for the Program that sets out in simple terms: a) Criteria for project selection, 
to avoid unnecessary problems such as resettlement; b) A checklist for preliminary 
project assessment, to avoid a location or project design which might give rise to 
undesirable impacts; and c) A shortlist of mitigating measures to be taken during project 
implementation.   
 
Preliminary project assessment will be conducted at woreda level, and compliance with 
the recommended mitigating measures will be monitored by the concerned Development 
Agent (DA). Only in exceptional cases would it be necessary for a project to be reviewed 
at a higher level, in which case under Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Management
 
proclamation, the regional Environmental Bureau, or equivalent office, would be the 
determining authority. It is not intended that the PSNP will include any public works 
activities necessitating a separate EIA under the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
proclamation.  For the sake of simplicity, the standard mitigating measures for each type 
of project will be incorporated in the technical standards manual to be provided by the 
Program. The environmental management process and guidelines developed for the 
Program will be subject to approval by the Environmental Protection Authority of 
Ethiopia. The draft Environmental Management Framework for the Program is a 
Condition of Appraisal. The Government has written to the Bank to outline its disclosure 
plans in-country and to authorize the Bank to disclose the same. 
 
Riparian Issues.
 
A
component of the Safety Net Program is public works, in which watershed 
management activities feature prominently. Most of the latter are soil and water conservation activities. 
However, the list also includes activities such as small-scale irrigation (e.g. spring development), micro 
water channels, and water harvesting (communal micro-ponds). None of these activities have been 
identified a priori as activities that will be undertaken
--
only that they are not excluded.  Plus, they do not

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
As indicated in Table C above, the Environmental Assessment and Projects on International 
Waterways are the key applicable safeguards. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01)
:
The Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Impact Assessment
 (EIA) 
proclamation, the World Bank’s safeguard policies and international standards subscribed to by 
other potential partners in the PSNP are applicable to the Safety Net programme. In keeping with 
Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Impact Assessment
 proclamation, the term ‘environment’ in this 
context covers biophysical, social and cultural heritage impacts.   
 
The selection of the  public works activities will be driven by the local planning process. Given 
the nature and large number of these public works, it is important that their design and 
implementation follow good practice in order to manage any potentially adverse impacts. While 
it is acknowledged that many of the public works will themselves be intended to rehabilitate the 
natural resource base, it is equally important that such projects be well-designed and executed to 
ensure that undesirable impacts are avoided or mitigated.  
 
In the case of the Productive Safety Net Program, where individual projects are numerous, 
community-based, and not known in advance, it is not realistic to execute EIAs. The 
Government, with assistance from the World Bank, has produce a global Environmental 
Management Framework  (ESMF) for the Program that sets out in simple terms: a) Criteria for 
project selection, to avoid unnecessary problems such as resettlement; b) A checklist for 
preliminary project assessment, to avoid a location or project design which might give rise to 
undesirable impacts; and c) A shortlist of mitigating measures to be taken during project 
implementation.   
 
Projects on International Waterways (OP7.50):  
A
component of the Safety Net Program is public works, in which 
watershed management activities feature prominently. Most of the latter are soil and water conservation activities. 
The majority of these activities are communal, demand-driven, small scale (that is labor-intensive) and focus on 
rehabilitation of the environment.  However, to improve food security of households, small-scale irrigation activities 
(e.g. spring development, micro-water channels, micro-pond construction) are not excluded.  Since these small-scale 
irrigation activities may be undertaken on international waterways, the safeguard on “projects on international 
waterways” is triggered.  The Government and the Bank teams have identified (a) which international waterways the 
project activities may affect; and (b) estimated maximum quantities of water abstraction involved, and (c) notified 
the countries involved.   
 
Resettlement
:
The Productive Safety Net  program will not involve any resettlement
 
and hence does not 
trigger this safeguard
.
The land on which project sites is located is clearly defined in the Government’s program 
implementation manual as public communal land.  Moreover, public works activities will target existing sites, which 
are identified through a community based participatory planning process, and which require rehabilitation; for 
example, rural feeder roads and public pathways will be improved to support all weather travel, and thus, no new 
roads or pathways will be built. Similarly, restricted access to forested lands, isolate lands that are deforested and 
suffer from environmental degradation. The program is expected to contribute to the environmental rehabilitation of 
these areas rather than restrict access to existing forest resources. 
Page  7
In addition, the scale of public work activities envisaged is very small, and located within existing communities.  
Proposed sub projects that do not meet the criteria, including site eligibility, will not be financed under this program.  
The only exception is a few interventions where the community, with the consent of the individual beneficiaries, 
may determine to provide labor and capital inputs on land owned by labor-poor female-headed households.   
 
S
afeguards policies on pest management (OP4.09, Natural habitats (OP4.04) and  Physical cultural resources (OPN 
11.03/OP 4.11) may be triggered. The ESMF provides a checklist and provisions to mitigate these safeguards. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area. 
 
Integrated watershed management is one of the activities that will be undertaken by communities 
across the program woredas. It is anticipated that this will lead to long term rehabilitation of the 
environment and improved water and soil conservation. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
All the projects proposed will be subject to the requirements of the Government of Ethiopia 
relevant environmental safeguards as described in the proclamations (see below, D.4) and World 
Bank safeguard policies.   
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Ethiopia has already enacted three relevant proclamations: 
1.
The
 
Environmental Impact Assessment
 
Proclamation 
2.
The Environmental Management
 Proclamation,  and 
3.
The Pollution Control 
Proclamation 
Preliminary project assessment will be conducted at woreda level, and compliance with the 
recommended mitigating measures will be monitored by the concerned Development Agent 
(DA). Only in exceptional cases would it be necessary for a project to be reviewed at a higher 
level, in which case under Ethiopia’s 
Environmental Management
 proclamation, the regional 
Environmental Bureau, or equivalent office, would be the determining authority. It is not 
intended that the PSNP will include any public works activities necessitating a separate EIA 
under the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
proclamation.  For the sake of simplicity, the 
standard mitigating measures for each type of project will be incorporated in the technical 
standards manual to be provided by the Program. Given limited existing capacity for 
environmental management at the local level, as identified in the ESMF, as part of the training to 
be provided to program implementers, emphasis will be placed on strengthening knowledge of 
environmental and social safeguards measures. The environmental management process and 
guidelines developed for the Program will be subject to approval by the Environmental 
Protection Authority of Ethiopia. The Government, with technical assistance from the World 
Bank, has prepared an ESMF.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Page  8
The key stakeholders are the beneficiaries of the Safety Net Programme, as well as those 
involved in implementation of the Programme. The key provisions outlined in the ESMF, 
including potential environmental impacts and related mitigating measures to be undertaken, are 
being incorporated into the training materials being used for Woreda and Kebele levels, which 
will take place in October and November 2004 respectively. Further, the ESMF will be disclosed 
in country.
