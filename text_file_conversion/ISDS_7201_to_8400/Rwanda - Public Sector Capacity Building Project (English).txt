A.2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is to support public sector entities to: (i) attract, manage and retain 
qualified staff, (ii) decentralize non-core functions and (iii) use financial resources in an 
effective, transparent and accountable manner towards achieving the objectives of their 
strategic plans.  This objective will be achieved through the combined impact of the 
anticipated results of all five components.  The following presents the envisioned 
intermediate results of each component (see annex 3 for results indicators): 
 
1.  The Human Resource Capacity Building Agency (HRCBA) effectively 
coordinates, monitors and evaluates capacity-building interventions, manages the 
MSCBP basket fund, and educates the public on targets and achievements under 
the MSCBP. 
2.  Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) reduce staffing gaps through 
training and recruitment of well-qualified personnel. 
3.  Improved capacity of MDAs to manage public finances and monitor outcomes.  
Lean, efficient and professional MDAs that successfully carry out their core 
mandate.  
4.  Participating MDAs develop and implement strategic plans and successfully 
manage their own capacity building to enhance agency performance 
5. 
Public sector entities have the policies, skills, ideas, hardware and maintenance 
systems necessary to use ICT effectively. 
 
A.3. Project Description

government program by (i) focusing the project on the public sector, (ii) setting up a 
coordinating agency that provides strategic leadership, coordination, monitoring and 
evaluation and support to implementing MDAs, (iii) increasing the understanding of the 
comprehensive concept of capacity building through a policy and operational guidelines, 
(iv) building momentum through early results and (v) building capacity for capacity 
building at MDAs.
