A.2. Project Objectives 
The broad objectives of the BFP are to reduce poverty and inequality and promote human capital 
investments among poor families through the provision of direct monetary transfers to poor 
families and incentives for investing in human capital.  As a Sector-Wide Approach, World Bank 
assistance would broadly support these same objectives.  As the World Bank’s financial 
contribution is relatively small (US$520.2 million, or about 8% of total conditional cash transfers 
under the BFP), it would be most accurate to state that overall reduction of poverty and inequality 
is the 
ultimate
 objective of the Bank’s assistance under the proposed project.  The proposed 
project would seek to strengthen the BFP’s ability to achieve these broader objectives of reducing 
poverty and inequality and promoting human capital development by supporting: (a) a 
consolidation of conditional cash transfer programs and reductions in gaps and duplications in 
coverage; (b) a strengthening of the system for identifying the target population; (c) the 
development of a monitoring and evaluation system for the BFP; and (d) a strengthening of the 
basic institutional functioning of the program.   
The proposed project is at the center of one of the core pillars of the Bank’s CAS – achieving a 
more equitable Brazil – and is closely aligned with corporate priorities of achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  The BFP will directly contribute to the reduction of 
poverty (MDG 1) and inequality in the short- and long-term.  In coordination with other

 The total World Bank loan is US$520.2 million, of which the IBRD loan will reimburse US$500.0 million in expenditures for 
conditional cash transfers under the BFP, provide US$15.0 million for technical assistance and project management, and provide 
US$5.2 as capitalization of the front end fee.  The BFP conditional cash transfers to beneficiaries (grants) to be reimbursed b

malnutrition (MDG 1), achieving universal education (MDG 2), reducing child mortality (MDG 
4), and improving maternal health (MDG5) through the demand-side incentives it provides for 
investments in education, nutrition and health (for pregnant women and young children).
 
A.3. Project Description 
  
The proposed first phase APL project (mid-2004 to end-2006) would consist of five components: 
one component that would reimburse the Government for expenditures on conditional cash 
transfers under the BFP; three mutually-reinforcing technical components to help improve the 
quality and basic architecture of the program; and a small component for project management.  
Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (Grants) (US$6,493 million in project costs; 
US$500 million in loan financing).
  This component would provide support to the Government 
in consolidating and rationalizing conditional cash transfers, and in reducing duplications and 
gaps in coverage of the BFP, as part of a broader and balanced strategy for economic and human 
capital development.  For this component, the World Bank would reimburse the Treasury a share 
of the expenses on conditional cash transfers made under the BFP during the project period.  The 
category of disbursements would be cash transfers (BF grant transfers).  Disbursement 
percentages would increase as key technical improvements (“milestones”) are made, as discussed 
above.    
Component 2: Strengthening the System for Identifying the Target Population (US$3.7 
million in project costs including contingencies).
  This component would provide assistance to 
improve the mechanisms used to identify the target population of the BFP, which constitute a key 
element of the basic architecture of the program.  With a more accurate system for identifying the 
target population, the program will achieve better redistributive efficiency, with a higher share of 
its resources going to the poor, and will be able to cover a larger share of the poor.  It will thus 
serve as a more efficient instrument for reducing poverty and inequality in Brazil.   
As with its predecessors (pre-reform programs), the BFP selects beneficiaries from a national 
database of potentially poor households called the “Cadastro Único.”  While the construction of 
the Cadastro Único sought to integrate household registries across the (previous) multiple 
programs in a very short period of time, there are several aspects of the system that could be 
improved.  To do this, Component 2 of the proposed project will support activities to strengthen 
the system for identifying the target population of the BFP and overhaul the Cadastro Único 
system in several key areas: (a) clarifying the strategic framework for the overall system 
including conducting a study to identify other programs that could potentially use the Cadastro 
for eligibility determination; (b) revising the eligibility criteria for the BFP and the Cadastro 
questionnaire and data collection strategy, taking into account different local realities reflecting 
urban vs. rural settings (including population and poverty density) and diverse cultural, ethnic and 
racial characteristics of the populations; (c) reducing administrative errors in the Cadastro Único; 
and (d) enhancing the legitimacy of the Cadastro Único system; (e) strengthening the technical 
and technological capacity of the Cadastro Unit in MDS to monitor, verify and use the Cadastro 
Único, as well as the capacity of municipalities and other potential cooperating institutions for 
carrying out data collection and beneficiary selection.   
 
Component 3: Developing a Monitoring and Evaluation System (US$6.7 million in project 
costs including contingencies).
  This component  would support the design and implementation 
of a solid monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system.  Such a system would constitute a key 
element of the basic architecture of the program, and one that the Government has made a top 
p
riorit
y
 since the launchin
g
 of the BFP.  To su

p
onent 3 of the

will support: (a) the development of a strategy for the overall M&E system and support for 
capacity building in MDS in this area; (b) the strengthening of Bolsa Família’s management 
information system (MIS) which would provide up-to-date information on program activities and 
outputs; (c) the development of instruments to monitor program processes to provide feedback on 
the quality of service delivery and program implementation and to detect problems so that they 
can be corrected early, including (i) inter-government processes; (ii) annual Quality Control 
Reviews to monitor BFP processes (including verification of health and education 
conditionalities, the selection of beneficiaries, and payments); and (iii) support for citizen 
oversight (“social control”) mechanisms; and (d) the development, execution, and analysis of 
qualitative instruments and quantitative surveys to monitor and evaluate key outcomes and the 
impact of the program at both the “territorial” (municipal and sub-municipal) and family levels.   
Component 4: Institutional Strengthening (US$4.2 million in project costs including 
contingencies).
  This component would support the strengthening of the basic institutional 
functioning of the BFP in terms of: 
\01\02
Strengthening of the operational institutional framework, including the legal architecture 
of the program (developing needed 
regulamentos
, operational guidelines, norms, etc. for 
the BFP and the Cadastro Único);  
\01\02
Strengthening program management, including: (a) 
clarifying and strengthening 
institutional roles for the basic functioning of the program itself, including developing a 
matrix of responsibilities, clarifying information flows for the Cadastro Único, and 
developing and implementing a system for verifying human capital conditionalities; 
(b) providing training and technical assistance on the system for verifying human capital 
conditionalities; (c) developing a strategy for operating the program in remote areas; (d) 
defining possible mechanisms for inter-governmental partnerships to help in expanding 
the program, increasing the level of benefits, and/or linking BFP beneficiaries to 
complementary services; and (e) developing an inter-municipal information network to 
share good practices, experiences with implementing conditional cash transfers and the 
BF Program across municipalities;  
\01\02
Developing a solid communications and dissemination strategy with consideration of 
culturally- and ethnically diverse publics, including: (i) establishing a “hotline” number 
with trained operators to answer questions on the program and the Cadastro Único (for 
the general public, beneficiaries, other officials, etc.); and (ii) designing, printing and 
disseminating information booklets (
cadernetas
) for beneficiaries (including information 
about benefits and conditionalities); and 
\01\02
Evaluating and piloting social welfare innovations in “self-sufficiency” and “bridging” 
approaches and service delivery.  This sub-component would support initiatives 
(Subprojects) to help BFP beneficiaries develop tailored strategies for growing out of 
poverty (self-sufficiency or “
emancipação
” strategies) and gain access to complementary 
programs and services (bridging services).  These initiatives could involve various 
approaches, including: (a) social worker support to help beneficiaries develop these self-
sufficiency (
emancipação
) strategies and bridging access to complementary services; 
and/or (b) the development of “one-stop shops” where beneficiaries can gain access to 
information about a variety of social services (including the BFP).  Some similar 
experiences have also been developed at the local level in Brazil.  The sub-component 
would thus support; (a) international study tours and exchanges to share information on 
these various “
emanci
p
ação
” and “brid
g
in
g
” a
pp
roaches; 
(
b
)
 consultancies 
and 
Page  5
 
 
workshops to help design mechanisms for piloting and evaluating such approaches under 
the BFP; and (c) an “Innovations Fund to Promote the Self-Sufficiency (
Emancipação
) of 
BFP Beneficiaries” (Subprojects).  The adoption of Operational Guidelines satisfactory to 
the World Bank for these Subprojects will be required prior to disbursement on this sub-
component.   
Component 5: Project Management (US$0.7 million in project costs including 
contingencies).  
The project will support existing institutional structures in MDS and a Core 
Management Committee (“
Nucleo
 
Gestor
”), led by the Executive Secretary (SECEX) and made 
up of managers of the relevant units in MDS, that would oversee the project.  To provide such 
support, the proposed Project will finance incremental costs related to management and 
supervision of Project activities.  These costs include a committee of external consultants that 
would help advise on overall project activities and strategy, consultants on each of the three 
technical components, consultants for the fiduciary and operational aspects (procurement, 
financial management, project planning and supervision), office equipment, and travel expenses.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project trigger’s the Bank’s Indigenous Peoples Policy (OD 4.20), which requires an IPDP to 
ensure that indigenous and quilombola peoples participate in and benefit from the project in a 
culturally appropriate way.  The proposed project will make efforts to (a) ensure that household 
registry activities (which form the basis of beneficiary selection) are carried out in indigenous 
areas and 
quilombolas
 in a culturally appropriate way; and (b) monitor the participation and 
receipt of benefits by such populations.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
Reduction of poverty and inequality and promotion of human capital investments among the poor 
in Brazil, including indigenous and quilombola populations.  
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
n.a. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The full IPDP was presented and discussed with the government (which also participated in 
consultations), which agreed to consider the recommendations while fine-tuning the Bolsa 
Família Program.   Additionally, Government officials also met with representatives of 
indigenous and quilombola peoples to discuss these recommendations and it was agreed that this 
dialogue would continue during the BFP implementation.  Finally, in the context of the technical 
assistance components of the proposed loan (US$15 million), the following recommendations 
will be incorporated into the proposed project: 
\01\02
Ensure that the updating of the 
Cadastro Único
 will consider cultural differences, 
including in the selection of indicators that will be used to determine beneficiary 
eligibility.    
\01\02
Train agents responsible for registering indigenous and quilombola families so as to 
ensure cultural sensitivity and knowledge in the process. 
\01\02
Ensure proper dissemination of BFP information, including eligibility criteria, operations, 
and conditionality, specifically tailored to indigenous and quilombola publics; 
\01\02
Continuously  monitor and evaluate the BFP to ensure that indigenous and quilombola 
communities have access and benefit from the program in a culturally appropriate manner 
and the that program does not have unexpected negative effects on the community;  
\01\02
Provide technical assistance to the Government so that it develops a strategy to ensure 
that payments are accessible to groups living in reach remote areas, including indigenous 
and quilombola communities; and 
\01\02
Establish a monitoring mechanism that includes representation from  indigenous and 
quilombola peoples. 
The BFP is managed by 
the Secretaria Nacional de Renda de Cidadania
  (SENARC) in the 
Ministry of Social Development.  In addition, institutional arrangements for various functions of 
the program also involve a number of other actors, among which collaboration with 
FUNAI/FUNASA for registering indigenous households and monitoring the program in 
indigenous areas.   
Page  7
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Two consultation workshops were held in preparation of this project.  The first one included a 
group of anthropologists specialized in indigenous and quilombola communities and the second 
one included consultations with representatives of indigenous and quilombola populations.  
During the consultations with representatives of indigenous and quilombola peoples, Government 
officials presented the BFP and discussed different aspects of the program that could be of impact 
to these groups.  Furthermore, there were extensive discussions between Government officials 
and these groups, which presented their concerns about the program as currently presented and 
made recommendations on how to improve it.   The project’s IPDP was prepared with inputs 
from both events and reflect the recommendations made by participants in the consultations.   The 
final version of the IPDP was disclosed to the participants of both events and is available at the 
infoshop.
