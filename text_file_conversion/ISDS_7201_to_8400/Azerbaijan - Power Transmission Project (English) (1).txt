Project Objectives 
 
The primary objective of the project is to improve the efficiency of the power 
transmission operation in Azerbaijan through technical and institutional strengthening of 
the generation/transmission utility.  The project has as a secondary objective to contribute 
to strengthening Azerenergy’s financial position.  
A.3. 
Project Description 
 
The components were selected based on urgent needs of the power system and a division of labor among 
IFIs, with EBRD preparing a power generation project, and KfW financing transmission components 
complementary to those to be financed by IBRD.  Azerenerji had international consultants (financed by 
Japan Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD)) assisting in preparing a feasibility study 
in which the Goods components below were proposed. 
 
Component A: Power System Management
 
The first project component includes investments to upgrade the electricity dispatch 
system in the country, which in turn would support the reliable, secure and economic 
operation of the electricity sector, and facilitate financial settlements in a future 
wholesale electricity market.  There are three main subcomponents (described in detail in 
Annex 4
):   
 
ƒ
SCADA/EMS system:  
installation of hardware and software to enable real time 
acquisition of operational information from generating stations and HV transmission 
system substations, analysis and monitoring of the network status at the National 
Dispatch Center, and control and dispatch of the generating plants and the HV 
transmission system.   
Page  2

ƒ
Telecommunications network upgrade
:
installation of communications equipment 
to meet the requirements of dispatch, metering, and HV network operations and 
maintenance.  It will also provide broadband communications facilities between 
major Azerenergy offices and generating plants to support improvements in 
Azerenergy financial management and administration. 
 
ƒ
Station adaptation and metering:
 adaptation of generating plant and substation 
control and metering circuits and equipment to provide alarm, status, and metering 
inputs to the Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and accept control outputs from the 
RTUs.  Fuel meters on each major thermal generating unit will be provided for 
economic dispatch. 
 
Component B: Transmission Network Rehabilitation 
 
The second component would cover priority investments in rehabilitation of high voltage 
transmission lines and selected high-voltage substations. The investments will enhance 
system reliability and help protect valuable system assets from costly damage.  
Subprojects were selected based on priority and economic returns, and include increasing 
transformer capacity at four HV substations, rehabilitation of 12 transmission line 
segments, and some low-cost rehabilitation work on four additional substations.  Details 
of the subprojects are provided in Annex 4
.
Some of the subcomponents may change 
during project implementation subject to additional studies and a changing system 
environment (deterioration of existing equipment or emergence of system bottlenecks or 
weaknesses). 
 
Component C: Management Assistance 
 
The third component will provide technical assistance (TA) to improve the management 
systems of Azerenergy and prepare the company for a future restructured energy sector.  
The TA includes (1) assistance in the company’s transition to International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS); (2) related development of an integrated management 
information system; (3) related revaluation of Azerenergy’s assets; (4) company and 
project audits; (5) development of an updated Grid Code; (6) transmission costing (as 
basis for separate transmissi
on tariff); and (7) a transmission network stability study.  
This component will also will provide TA to help Azerenergy ensure efficient 
implementation of the project.  The subcomponents include (8) dispatch system 
procurement support (started during project preparation); (9) project management and 
technical support; and (10) dispatch system training. 
 
Component D: Project Implementation
 
The fourth component will finance Incremental Operating Costs for the Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU). This subcomponent will be modest in size given that the PIU 
is part of the Azerenergy organization, with funding reserved for translation and 
interpretation work, incremental office equipment, international travel relevant to the 
project, and incremental office operating expenditures.  
 
Also the front-end lending fee is financed from the loan (US$ 0.48 million, less 50% 
waiver if the loan becomes effective in FY2005).

A.4. 
Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The transmission system rehabilitation components include installation of substation 
components inside the fence of existing substations at approximately 8 locations in the 
country, as well as repair work on power lines across the country.  The dispatch system 
upgrade includes laying of fiber optic cables along power line corridors.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. 
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
 
The proposed investments under the project will be confined to existing facilities and rights of way and as such are 
unlikely to trigger major environmental impacts or other safeguard policies.  
 
The impacts associated with the project are for the most part related to potential noise and dust 
during construction.  PCB is not expected to be found on the sites (substations), but testing for 
PCB will be undertaken and any necessary remedial action taken. Replaced batteries will be 
disposed of safely. Ecological reshaping by filling holes, soil leveling, and re-vegetation will take 
place if the ground is impacted by the operations. No pesticides will be used for any land clearing 
operations (e.g. new tower platforms, access roads preparation, etc.). All land clearing will be 
done by manual or mechanical methods. 
 
No potentially large scale, significant, and/or irreversible impacts of the project have been found. 
 
The 
positive 
environmental impact of the project is as follows:

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

The project is expected to lead to a conservatively estimated 1.5 percent reduction in gas and fuel 
oil use at power plants because of more economic dispatch, with a corresponding effect on 
emission of gree
nhouse gases from the plants. An estimated 0.5 percentage point’s reduction in 
transmission losses (from 5 percent to 4.5 percent) has a corresponding positive impact on 
emissions from the power plants. Insofar as the project contributes to increased and more reliable 
electricity supply, it will help to reduce the need for households to consume wood and kerosene 
in order to meet their demands for heat and lighting.  Savings of power plant fuel will be 
monitored under the project, and thus also emission reductions.  Future household surveys will 
monitor developments in electricity supply vs. wood and kerosene use (as well as natural gas).
At the same time, it is anticipated that the tariff increases which form a key part of government 
strategy for the utilities subsectors will encourage more efficient use of energy, and hence reduce 
future growth in greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
D.2 
Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area.
 
N/A 
 
D.3. 
Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
 
N/A 
 
D.4. 
Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
 
As part of the EA, an Environmental Management Plan has been prepared to define procedures 
for mitigation of local impacts of the project during construction (e.g. repair of lines, replacement 
of transformer equipment) and disposal of waste materials and procedures for mitigation during 
operation (e.g. maintenance activities).   
 
D.5. 
Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
 
Key stakeholders are people who live near work sites, and who may be influenced by noise and 
dust.  Announcements of the project have been made, consultation meetings held, and 
Environmental Management Plans disclosed.
