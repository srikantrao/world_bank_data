I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The main project objective is to improve the effectiveness of the policies of the Serbian Road Directorate
(SRD) for road maintenance and rehabilitation through (i) the introduction of new contracting
arrangements with the private sector in two pilot districts; and (ii) the introduction of network analysis to
selected road rehabilitation segments.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The proposed project would consist of the following two components:

        1. Strengthening of SRD Institutional Capacity

Provision of services, training and goods to strengthen SRD: (i) Information Center, including the
improvement of its computerized road and bridge data bases for the main and regional road networks, as
well as the establishment of computerized system for contract management; (ii) systems and procedures for
planning and budgeting road expenditures, which are based on economic optimization methodologies; (iii)
procurement and supervision of road works; (iv) supervision of road maintenance and rehabilitation works;
and (v) road management capability in the SRD.

The provision of services requiured to audit the records, accounts and financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 (b) of the DCA.

        2. Enhancement of Road Maintenance, Rehabilitation, and Safety

The provision of priority rehabilitation needs on (i) about four main road network sections, and (ii) main
and regional road maintenance by contract, on a pilot basis, in the regions of Macva and Kolubara.
Measures to improve traffic safety will be included under the maintenance and rehabilitation contracts,
such as improvements in road marking and signs, installation of crash barriers, modifications to dangerous
intersections, together with the creation of parking/rest areas on those sections of the main network located
in mountainous areas.

characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The key project activities are located in the Western Serbia region. The region's road network is currently
in a very poor condition and access to the country's main centers is difficult. This has had an impact on
both the level of commercial activity in the region, and the level of foreign direct investment. There is
evidence of foreign investors declining to make an investment, after initial substantive interest, due to the
quality of the road network. This has had a marked impact on the value of local land, buildings, and
commercial facilities in the region. Possibly not surprisingly, against such a backdrop, the project is
expected to generate significant social and economic benefits in the region. Western Serbia is rich with
natural resources, natural habitats, historical and sacral sites and is, potentially, a very attractive tourist
destination. When better linked with the Voyvodina province and further north with Hungary, the region
will attract more investors and passengers; the local diaspora living in Western Europe will support their
families and partners in agriculture productions, tourism, and local service industry. In addition, the viable,
but hibernated, local SMEs will flourish.

In accordance with World Bank Safeguard Policies (OP/BP/GP 4.01 Environmental Assessment) the
project is rated environmental category B and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been
prepared by SRD. The project is expected to have only minor negative impacts on the environment, as it
will focus on road rehabilitation and maintenance activities.The project will entail no land acquisition or
resettlement, hence the population adversely affected by the work is minimal. Similarly, the project does
not traverse, or impact, on any protected areas, sites or critical natural habitats and any other culturally or
socially sensitive areas.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The project is proposed for a Category B classification because of its limited potential impact on
the environment.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The project would not have any significant impact on the environment as the road works that it includes
would be carried out on existing roads with no change in alignment nor widening. The project therefore
entails no land acquisition and no resettlement, nor long lasting disruptions to the natural environment and
human settlements and activities.

The only environmental impacts would be small and of a temporary nature, being associated with
maintenance and rehabilitation activities such as movement of materials (mainly aggregates, cement, and
bitumen), removal and disposal of construction wastes, cleaning of ditches and road shoulders,
strengthening structures, and preparation and laying of asphalt.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
NA

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
NA

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
NA

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Draft EMP has been prepared by the Borrower. The Credit Agreement will contain a requirement that
the Borrower agrees to implement the EMP.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Besides the project implementing agency, SRD, there will be numerous other stakeholders in the project,
particularly road maintenance and construction companies, road users represented by the road transport
operators' associations, the chambers of commerce, and the local automobile clubs, and users of other
modes of transport that may be affected by changes in the institutional and regulatory framework. It is
mainly through information sharing and consultation that these stakeholders will be involved in the project.
Bank missions have already had in-depth contacts with road contractors and road users and plan to
continue to do so. MOTC and SRD have provided much help in this and the meetings have shown that
consultation with stakeholders is currently a serious and continuous process in Serbia. A particularity of
Serbia is also that the local transport expertise is well developed thanks to the local universities and
technical institutes, which have bridged the traditional gaps between users and decision makers. The
EA/EMP will be disclosed in the country (in the local language) and in Infoshop (in English) before the
project appraisal mission.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

          management of one or more safeguard areas

         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
         projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
         issues.
