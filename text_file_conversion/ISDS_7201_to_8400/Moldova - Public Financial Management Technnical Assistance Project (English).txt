B.  Project Objective 
The proposed project will facilitate the reduction of fiscal instability in Moldova and improvements in 
effectiveness of public sector agencies through strengthening public financial management as a critical element of 
improving the effectiveness, transparency and accountability of management of public resources. Effective resource 
management is critical to implementing development policies, improving service delivery and reducing poverty. 
 
The main objectives of the PFM are:  
• 
Improving overall fiscal discipline and strategic resource allocation by institutionalizing the MTEF process 
and strengthening capacity for budget preparation and planning at the MoF and line ministries; 
• 
Ensuring effective budget execution and oversight by streamlining budget execution procedures, 
strengthening cash management and commitment controls;  
• 
Improving efficiency of public budget management by replacing the existing patchy and unsustainable 
treasury information system with an integrated financial management system, capable of producing timely 
and comprehensive fiscal reports; and 
• 
Increasing transparency and accountability by strengthening financial controls and internal audit capacity, 
and increasing access of the public to budget documents and reports. 
Through the institutionalization of the MTEF mechanisms and the linkage of policy-making to budget 
formulation, the Government is expected to be able to better prioritize the allocation of public expenditure within a 
fiscal envelope. The debt management function will be better linked with budget planning and execution, thus 
improving the predictability of resource availability for all participants of the public financial management process. 
A new integrated FMIS will connect all the main central finance offices and budget executors thus improving 
reliability, security, transparency, timeliness, comprehensiveness and audit trail of financial management 
information. Improved financial management will pave the way for the eventual introduction of a performance-
based budget process. 
 
(a.) Project 
Description 
Page  2

The proposed project will improve technical capacities of the government in public 
resource management, and stimulate further development of capacity for strategic policy making 
at the center of government and in sectoral ministries.  It is proposed that the PFM project will 
comprise the following five components:  
 
 
(a)  budget preparation component;  
This component will support: (i) further development of the MTEF process; (ii) assisting in 
revising budget processes and institutional arrangements both within the MOF and the line 
ministries and the center of Government; (iii) strengthening the macro-fiscal forecasting and 
analysis functions of the MoF to provide an authoritative resource envelope for the budget 
process; (iv) improving budget classification; (v) strengthening institutional capacity for budget 
analysis and planning across the government, with a special focus on budget divisions of the big 
spending ministries responsible for the social sectors
1
, and (vi) integrating budget preparation 
process within a unified FMIS. 
 
(b)  budget execution and control component; 
This component will focus on developing an integrated FMIS that would allow real-time links between the 
following functions: budget management, accounting, cash management and debt management, financial operations 
of line ministries and local governments, public procurement transactions including the control of payment under 
procurement contracts; internal audit and organizational and information support function. The component would 
also cover the development of the new business processes and procedures for budget execution and financial 
controls.  
(c)  capacity building component;  
This component will assist to develop a sustainable training and skill development capacity in Moldova that would 
allow re-training civil servants in financial management and budgetary issues both in the central and line financial 
offices, including those at the local government level. 
(d)  development of an internal audit system; 
While recognizing the limited reform absorption capacity of the Moldovan public administration, this component 
will create a foundation for a modern internal audit system that will help strengthen internal management controls. 
(e)  project management;   
This component will provide deal with coordination of a wider public finance management 
program, project management, monitoring and evaluation issues.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be implemented by the Ministry of Finance of Moldova in Chisinau. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
The Ministry of Finance will implement the project, a specially established PIU will implement administrative and 
financial management.

 This is expected to compliment the policy dialogue in those sectors driven by Bank investment projects (Health 
Investment Fund, Social Protection Management, potential Education II project), as well as build upon the 
institutional capacity developed through them.
