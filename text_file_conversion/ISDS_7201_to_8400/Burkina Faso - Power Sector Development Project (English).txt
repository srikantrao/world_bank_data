A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) enhance the policy and institutional 
environment for efficient sector development and operation; (ii) improve the availability 
and reliability of electricity supply in the area covered by the national utility SONABEL; 
and (iii) to promote rational and efficient use of energy in public buildings through 
demand-side management initiatives.  
 
The Power Sector Development Project (PSDP) would support the Government of 
Burkina Faso's efforts to increase the competitiveness of the economy by reducing 
production factor costs through the provision and rational use of electricity. The PSDP is 
consistent with the CAS's objective to help improve competitiveness and to support 
broad-
based growth. The key to overcoming the sector’s persistent and worsening supply 
and cost problems is a decisive implementation of least-cost investment options together 
with adequate liberalization and regulation, which will in due time contribute to the 
competitiveness of the economy by reducing the cost and expanding the supply of 
electricity on the main grid, provide the lowest possible prices to end-users and restrain 
claims by the sector on the public purse.   
A.3. Project Description 
 
Page  2
2
The project consists of four main components (i) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity 
Building; (ii) Extension and Reinforcement of Transmission Lines; (iii) Additional 
Thermal Generation Capacity of 14 MW; and, (iv) Demand-Side Management. The total 
project cost is US$130.34 million equivalent (including contingencies) of which IDA will 
finance about US$63.58 million and the balance would be financed by the Government of 
Burkina Faso and other development partners. 
 
Component 1
:
Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$4.44million
1
): 
Direction Générale de l’Energie
 (DGE) needs new skills to be able to function as the 
Government institution in charge of the design and monitoring of the country's energy 
policy; and to play its catalytic coordination role in the upcoming privatization of the 
national utility, and the expansion of energy access in rural and peri-urban areas. The 
objective of this component is therefore to build the capacity of 
Direction Générale de 
l’Energie
 (DGE)  in terms of planning, policy formulation and  
monitoring and evaluation. Specific activities (training, consultant services, monitoring 
and evaluation and impact assessment tools) will be tailored to the needs of the different 
DGE sub-directorates.  This component will also support the capacity enhancement of 
SONABEL (procurement and project management), related to its involvement in this 
project.  Finally, it will retroactively finance the second phase of the institutional study 
for the electricity and hydrocarbon sub-sectors, which could not be covered under the 
IDA Project Preparation Facilities (PPFs) because of the erosion of the dollar against the 
Euro.
 
Component 2: Extension and Reinforcement of Transmission Lines (US$83.44 
million): 
The objective of this component is to support the construction of the Bobo-
Ouagadougou transmission line, and to reinforce the existing transmission lines 
connecting Bagre, Kompienga and Ouagadougou.   
 
Subcomponent 2.1 - Construction of the Bobo-Ouagadougou Transmission Line. 
 This 
subcomponent will finance: (i) the construction of the 338 km-long 225 kV Bobo - 
Ouagadougou transmission line, with all the associated substations and 
telecommunications equipment; (ii) the connection of 5 villages along the transmission 
line, in the region called Pa, using well-known shield-wire technology; (iii) construction 
supervision; and (iv) the implementation of the environmental and social management 
plan (EMP) to mitigate the risks associated with the construction of the transmission line. 
According to the procurement plan, the physical implementation will take 18-21 months 
after contract effectiveness. The objective of this subcomponent is to extend the benefits 
of cheaper power imports from Cote d'Ivoire to the 
Centre Régional de Consommation de 
Ouagadougou
 (CRCO), as  the transmission line from Cote d’Ivoire has a transfer 
capability of about 120 MW under normal operating conditions, but only about 25 MW 
are currently being transferred from that line to 
Centre Régional de Consommation de 
Bobo-Dioulasso 
(CRCB) to meet the CRCB's load.  The Bobo-Ouagadougou 
transmission line will thus improve the capacity utilization of the existing Cote d'Ivoire - 
Burkina Faso Interconnection. This component will be co-financed by IDA, the Nordic 
Development Fund (NDF), the French Agency for Development (AFD), the European 
1
The cost estimates by component are exclusive of physical and price contingencies. 
Page  3

Investment Bank (EIB), the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), and 
the GoBF and will be implemented by SONABEL.
 
Subcomponent 2.2 - Reinforcement of the Existing Transmission Lines Bagre-
Kompienga-Ouagadougou :
 This subcomponent will finance: (i) the engineering studies 
for the mechanical reinforcement of the existing 315 km, 132 kV transmission lines 
connecting Bagre, Kompienga, and Ouagadougou; (ii) the mechanical and structural 
reinforcement of the 941 towers of those transmission lines; and (iii) works supervision. 
According to the procurement plan, the physical reinforcement will take 8-10 months to 
complete, after contract effectiveness. The objective of this subcomponent is to increase 
the reliability of supply from the two hydro-power plants, as these 132 kV lines from 
these plants have experienced several mechanical collapses over the last three years due 
to wind gusts in the line corridors. This component will be financed by IDA and 
SONABEL, and will be implemented by SONABEL. 
 
Component 3 : Additional Thermal Generation Capacity  of  14 MW (US$17.10 
million): 
This component will finance: (i) the construction of a turnkey 14 MW diesel 
power station; and (ii) construction supervision. Because this plant will be added within 
the fence of the existing Kossodo plant, no people will be affected or resettled, and 
impact reduction measures will be limited to monitoring emissions and reducing noise 
disturbances. The objective of this component is to help SONABEL meet the additional 
generation needs while the Bobo-Ouagadougou transmission line is being constructed. 
This 14 MW power plant will also serve as a back-up plant during the operation of the 
line. Because of the urgent need of additional power, it has been agreed with the World 
Bank that this component will be retroactively financed. Under the current agreement 
with the Government of Burkina Faso and SONABEL. SONABEL will purchase the 
power plant of 14 MW under a turnkey contract and will contract for supervision services 
following World Bank procurement procedures. The procurement process is now 
completed and both contracts were signed on April 7, and June 11, 2004, respectively. 
All procurement procedures followed strictly adhered to the WB OP12.10 related to 
retroactive financing
.
This component will be financed by IDA, SONABEL and GoBF 
and implemented by SONABEL. 
 
Component 4: Demand-side Management (US$3.38 million):  
This component will 
finance: (i) the strengthening of the institutional framework to support demand-side 
management and energy efficiency initiatives; (ii)  investment mainly in efficient 
equipment (air-conditioning and lighting systems); and (iii) information, education and 
communication to promote rational and efficient use of electricity. The strategic choice is 
to build on the DANIDA-sponsored DSM emergency program to layout the basis for a 
long term vision on DSM initiatives in the country. This will include the design of 
adequate institutional framework to sustain the development of a coherent program of 
interventions in the short, medium, and long terms. The approach is to start showing 
results from interventions in the public administration buildings and gradually move into 
the commercial, industrial and residential sectors in a learning by doing manner.  
 
Subcomponent 4.1 Institutional and Capacity
Strengthening:
The objective of this 
Page  4
4
subcomponent is to: (i) design a DSM policy framework and regulatory mechanisms; and 
(ii)  prepare, monitor and evaluate  DSM programs. Support will be provided, in 
particular, to the Energy Management Unit, 
Cellule de
 Gestion de l’Energie
 (CGE), to be 
created at the level of Ministry of Energy, as part of the DGE. The CGE will work in 
close collaboration with the Directorate of Equipment of the Ministry of Finance and 
Budget and other key technical directorates of the public administration to define a 
comprehensive demand-side management program. Such a program would include the 
institutional, legal, and regulatory frameworks to sustain demand-side management and 
energy efficient initiatives. In particular the CGE would develop databases from energy 
audits, energy consumption surveys, sites visits, and analyses of electricity consumption 
bills, to eventually produce a building code and appliance standards. 
 
Subcomponent 4.2 Demand-side Management Investments:
 The objective of this 
subcomponent is to support the purchase of efficient air-conditioning and lighting 
systems (including replacement of existing equipment, and changes in procurement for 
additional equipment) in selected public administration buildings to reduce electricity 
consumption.  
 
Subcomponent 4.3 Information, Education, and Communication
:
The objective of this 
subcomponent is to support all information awareness campaigns, workshops, training 
and education on demand-side management and energy efficiency. Demonstrations and 
pilot tests would also be supported to bring about the behavioral changes in electricity 
utilization in the public administration buildings and show potential of energy savings to 
commercial and residential customers. 
 
A.4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project would support: (i)  installation of additional generation capacity at the 
existing Kossodo Thermal Plant Station; and (ii) construction and rehabilitation of 
transmission lines and substations in the Ouagadougou, Bobo Dioulasso, Pa Regions.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
In the context of project preparation, an environmental and social impact assessment 
(EIA) was carried out, approved and disclosed in-country and at InfoShop, in full 
compliance with the National and World Bank environmental and social safeguard policy 
guidelines. The main impacts as identified in the EIA study are summarized below:  
 
For the transmission component, the following impacts have been identified: 
 
¾
Noise (during construction); 
¾
Interruption of power supply to current consumers due to specific construction 
requirements; 
¾
Displacement of people for construction of new substations, due to land 
acquisition and/or loss of economic activities; 
¾
Risk/exposure to electric shock; and 
¾
Movement of heavy equipment to work sites, which may pose danger to 
public; 
¾
Impacts on 
forêts classées
.
For the generation component, the following impacts have been identified: 
 
¾
Noise (during construction and operation); 
¾
Increased NO2, SO2 and ambient NO2 concentrations emissions (during 
operation)
.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
The project will have long-term positive impacts in terms of extending the power supply to new consumers, 
especially along the transmission lines; and supporting the improvement in reliability and availability of 
power to many existing customers. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 The Analysis of Alternatives included the analysis of different routes, in order to avoid as much as possible 
the Forêts Classées and the project systematically considered changes in line corridor whenever possible. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
For the transmission component, SONABEL will undertake the following mitigation measures, as 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas.
 
Page  6
6
identified in the environmental and social management plan (EMP): 
 
¾
SONABEL to adhere strictly to set standards, rules and procedures; 
¾
Conduct works during times that provide least disturbance to the public; 
provide advance notice to consumers before embarking on the work; 
¾
Apply mitigations measures, according to guidelines set forth in the RPF 
(relocation; compensation of project affected people (PAP); 
¾
Strictly adhere to known safety procedures, when work is in progress; 
¾
Ensure that existing work sites have a secure perimeter fence/wall; mandatory 
public warning and precautions such as labels, sirens to accompany 
transportation of heavy equipment. 
 
SONABEL and the Ministry of Environment will hire local consultants, under IDA 
financing, to prepare environmental management plans for the 8 Forêts Classées and their 
implementation. These plans would work out the details of how these forests could be 
managed in a sustainable manner by the local communities (this would benefit the 
communities as well). These plans would be prepared by Burkinabé consultants in 
collaboration with the communities and oversight by the environmental staff of 
SONABEL and the Ministry of Environment. During the operational phase, the 
environmental staff of SONABEL should monitor and evaluate the implementation of the 
forest management plans and evaluate how they benefit the people and the forests. The 
costs of the anticipated mitigation measures have been included in the overall costs of the 
EMP for the transmission line and the Government of Burkina Faso has agreed to finance 
these costs. 
 
For the generation component, SONABEL will undertake the following mitigation 
measures: 
 
¾
to implement noise reduction measures, like planting trees around the power
 
station;
 
¾
to strictly adhere to provisions under environmental monitoring plan. 
 
In addition, the EMP outlines adequate institutional arrangements for implementing and 
monitoring mitigation measures, the roles and responsibilities of the various stakeholders 
in those functions.  The EMP also includes cost outlays and an implementation schedule. 
 
The Environmental Management Capacity of SONABEL has been found acceptable. 
SONABEL’s Environmental Unit has benefited from capacity building programs funded 
by the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA) over the past years and 
has successfully conducted all environmental activities linked to the construction of 
transmission lines, including the Ferkessedougou – Bobo Dioulasso  interconnection.  
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
One of the key principles of this project from the outset was to foster participation of all relevant 
stakeholders.  The environmental assessment study was also carried out according to the same principle.  
The EIA has been conducted  using a broad
-
based public consultation approach, involving stakeholder 
Page  7
7
groups in Government agencies, including Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Social 
Protection, Ministry of Hydraulics, Ministry of Agriculture; private sector institutions, NGOs and local 
communities within project intervention zone.  These stakeholder groups have been systematically 
consulted throughout project preparation in order to foster awareness of, and communication and 
ownership on their part. 
 
Prior to final approval and disclosure of the safeguard documents, a media campaign, and 
a
stakeholder workshop were carried out to foster ownership on the part of  stakeholders 
and to seek their input in order to improve the reports. The safeguard documents were 
publicly disclosed in the newspapers, several ministries and at the World Bank Country 
Office Library in the country, and at the Infoshop.
