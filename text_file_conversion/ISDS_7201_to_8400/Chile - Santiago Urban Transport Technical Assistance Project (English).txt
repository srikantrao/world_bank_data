2. Project Objectives 
The purpose of the TAL is to ensure that finance is immediately available to assist the 
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the reform arrangements, and 
facilitate the implementation of the Transantiago public transport reform.  
 
By doing so, the TAL will contribute to meet the development objectives of the overall 
project. These include among others the reduction in travel and waiting times for public 
transport users, in particular for low-income groups, improvement of air quality, noise 
reduction and efficiency increase of Santiago?s urban transport system to the benefit of 
all residents.  
 
In addition, part of the interventions financed through the TAL aim at optimizing the 
fare structure and bus service design to maximize benefits for the poor, building on the 
conclusions of a study on the distributional effects of the new system. The main expected 
project outputs are:  
 
-
A
wider support for the Santiago Urban Transport Plan and the preventive removal of 
obstacles that could hinder the success of its implementation;  
 
-
A
more in-depth understanding of the impact of Transantiago on users, and the 
definition and implementation of possible corrective actions;  
 
-
Adequately retrained transit worker with greater chances of being reinserted into the 
employment market;  
Page  2
-
Improved public transport network and service planning and thus a more effective and 
efficient system;  
 
-
A
more in-depth understanding of the impacts of Transantiago on air quality and noise, 
and greater compliance with environmental targets;  
 
-
A
better coordination between the transport and land use planning functions;  
 
-
A
number of evaluation and survey tools that will allow enhancing the quality, 
effectiveness and efficiency on the urban transport system on a continuous basis;  
 
-
Institutional strengthening as far as resettlement processes are concerned;  
 
-
Increased skills in terms of system evaluation, planning and improvement.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The TAL will help upgrade the existing guidelines for EMP of infrastructure works, and 
the current involuntary resettlements policy framework   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
NA   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
NA

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Chile has a relatively high capacity and standards for managing environmental and social 
safeguards. There is a well instituted system for environmental impact assessment of 
projects with potentially high impacts, regulated by Law 19.300. Depending on the type 
of projects, and on the anticipated level of impact, projects need to enter the national 
System of Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) with either a full EIA or a 
Declaration of Environmental Impact. SEIA is a single window system operated by the 
National Commission on Environment (CONAMA), where all relevant authorities and 
the public have the chance to provide feedback and recommendations on the proposed 
project.  
 
Similarly, there is a law governing all involuntary resettlements resulting from 
expropriations based on public interest, which sets the legal framework to compensate or 
ensure that the livelihood conditions of property owners are preserved. Other affected 
people (tenants, encroachers and other informal residents) can get compensation if 
mandated by a judge.  All affected households are helped by SERVIU?s social 
specialists, to apply for housing subsidies or low-interest programs existing for low 
income population. To cover the cases not protected by the law, MOP uses the 
environmental legal framework to determine compensation for all other residents.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are municipal and national government institutions (Municipalities, 
MTT, SERVIU, MINVU, Transantiago, SECTRA, Metro S.A.); as well as community-
based associations and community leaders; and bus operators. Meetings and information 
about potential resettlements have already taken place. In addition, communities of areas 
where current land-use patterns are not in compliance with land-use plans are constantly 
being contacted and informed. Open consultation has also taken place with bus operators.   
 
B. Disclosure Requirements Date
