B.  Project Objectives  
  
The project would seek to increase and diversify rural households incomes (both on- and off-
farm) and promote economic opportunities through the development of supply chains for priority 
agricultural, fishery and livestock products.  Specifically the target population would be poor 
rural communities and small-scale rural producers across the country, who are financially 
strapped, have limited off-farm job opportunities, and are poorly organized and not integrated in 
agro-pastoral-markets.   
 
C.  Project Description  
  
The project will be implemented over a period of four years.  Under the proposed project the 
integrated market-driven and supply chain approach would link market
1
 demand backward to 
production by transmitting market requirements to producers and enabling them to respond 
effectively to buyers by bringing competitive products to market.  The project would support the 
supply chains
2
 for selected commodities
3
 with established demand from both domestic and 
international markets and clear comparative advantages.  The proposed project components 
would be as follows: 
 
                                                          
 
1
 "market" includes the local, national, regional and international markets 
2
 
the focus on commodity chains does not preclude the need to improve the productivity and sustainability of the 
various farming systems around the priority commodities
 
3
 the selection process would be made on a regional basis during preparation with the participation of the various 
stakeholders (government officials, producer and private sector representatives)   
Page  2
 
 
Component 1.  Support to market-related equipment and infrastructure.  
This would include provision for the 
co-financing on a demand-driven basis of market related equipment and infrastructure
4
 for the “ mise en marché ”, 
in particular the rehabilitation of agro-pastoral production site-to-market roads; the rehabilitation and construction of 
smallholder trading posts and market collection centers; the rehabilitation and construction of specific livestock 
infrastructure
5
; the support for the development of post harvest/processing/storage equipment and facilities; upland, 
small-scale and participatory irrigation development in support to diversified farming systems. 
 
Component 2.  Capacity building and support services for producer organizations, professional/ 
interprofessional associations, agribusiness micro-enterprises and SMEs
.  This sub-component would include:  
o
assisting the POs to participate in policy making, priority setting and governance of their organizations and 
inter-professions, and advisory service systems;  
o
the strengthening of the capacity of existing farmers and herders associations and national organizations for 
providing efficient services to their members, including pilot activities for the development of a rural trader 
network, the establishment of a marketing services firm,  and producers-private sector partnerships for 
marketing and agro-processing activities; 
o
the strengthening and promotion of agribusiness micro-enterprises and SMEs; 
o
Support to producer-demanded services.
 
This would include the provision of matching grants to producer 
organizations for the contracting of relevant technology adaptation and transfer services (including 
organizational, managerial, technical and commercial support services) to qualified institutions on a 
competitive basis and through performance-based contracts. 
 
Component 3.  Support to Institutional Strengthening.  
 
 
\01
\01
\01
\01
 Institutional strengthening of core public services. 
This would include in particular: 
the strengthening of ministries’ capacity at central and regional levels in critical areas such as (i) 
trade issues and regional market integration; (ii) definition and enforcement of regulations, 
guidelines and standards, in particular in the areas of inputs/seeds, food safety, animal diseases 
and pest management; (iii) agricultural market information system and rural incomes statistics; 
(iv) the preparation (together with producer organizations, the private sector, and decentralized 
collectivities) of detailed strategies/programs for promising crops and livestock products, 
including market and trade facilitation/value chains studies, to identify specific markets and 
markets’ requirements, constraints to be removed to improve competitiveness, and (v) the 
piloting of food safety and standards through a chain approach (also called from farm to fork).  
Various methodologies such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) will 
be tested.

 Strengthening the Agricultural (market-led) Adaptive Research and Transfer Systems.
  
The 
objective would be to establish/strengthen a pluralistic farmers/herders technology generation 
(adaptive research)  and transfer/advisory system involving public and private suppliers, largely 
demand-driven and through performance-based contracts. This sub-component would include:
 
 
o
Strengthening the financial and management autonomy of public research and extension institutions (with a 
governance body including all stakeholders, responsible for undertaking adaptive research and extension 
programs on the basis of stakeholders requests, and financed through a sustainable funding mechanism 
including adequate funding of core functions, adaptive research and extension contracts, competitive grant 
systems,  and cost recovery for some of the services); 
o
Upgrading the scientific and technical capacity of the adaptive research and extension institutions 
and of private services providers, through necessary equipment and facilities, relevant training 
programs, including on-the-job training.
 
 
 
                                                          
 
4
 although some large infrastructures/facilities will need substantial public investment, their management would be 
shared or transferred to private operators and territorial collectivities.

 Such as vaccination posts; livestock markets; slaughterhouse; processing plants and butcheries.

Component 4.  Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, Information and Knowledge Management.  
A Project Management Unit would be set-up for project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.  A Project 
Steering Committee would include Government officials and representatives of producer organizations, the private 
sector, and of the civil society.   
 
D.  Project location  
 
The project intervention area would be nation-wide. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies.    
 
Some EA training modules have already been developed under various IDA-financed project.  The EA will assess 
Borrower’s institutional capacity in this domain.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
The target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS would be  November 2004.  An ESMF (Environmental and Social 
Management Framework) will be prepared as well as an Integrated Pest Management Plan, and a Resettlement 
Policy Framework.  Key social, economic, and environmental indicators will be developed throughout project 
preparation and would be carefully monitored by the Project Management Unit.
