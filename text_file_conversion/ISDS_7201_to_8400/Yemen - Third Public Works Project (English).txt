A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overall development objectives would be to continue supporting the Borrower in the: 
(a) provision of needed infrastructure to improve services and environmental conditions 
(particularly those affecting women and children); and (b) creation of short term 
employment.  The Project would also seek to ensure the sustainability of these measures 
through (i) community participation in project selection, preparation, and 
implementation; and (ii) the development of local contracting and consulting firms.. 
 
Creation of jobs for skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labor will be ensured by selecting 
small, labor intensive basic infrastructure services that will be implemented by small 
scale local contractors and supervised by local consultants.  Services will target areas of 
high poverty to help in Poverty Reduction. 
 
Infrastructure services in different sectors ( health, education, water, waste water, roads, 
water harvesting / irrigation, social security) would be provided to poor communities 
identified through communities, NGO’s, local councils, local government, and the PMU. 
To ensure sustainability, the Project will involve stakeholders early on during 
identification of subprojects and have a plan for future operation and maintenance.
 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 (US$ 46.5 million): Community Infrastructure Projects.  
Subprojects will be selected from proposals that have been or will be submitted by 
communities and local governments with requests for financing.  The subprojects will be 
evaluated and prioritized based on selection criteria, and consolidated in quarterly 
investment programs.  The subprojects should collectively have national coverage, with 
em

hasis on

overt
y
 areas.  The
y
 should also have a hi
g
h labor content and include

community participation.  They will cover rural and urban water supply and sanitation, 
storm water drainage, flood protection, rural roads and sidewalks, schools and health
 
centers.  The subprojects will be small in size, averaging about US$60,000, and be 
implemented over a period of 6-12 months. 
 
Component 2 (US$ 3.5 million): Technical Assistance/Consultancy Services. 
Technical assistance/consultant services will cover: (i) assisting about 50 districts to carry 
out assessment of their infrastructure needs, their capacity for implementation, 
preparation of medium term investment plan, assessment of sources of revenues and 
establishment of management information systems;  (ii) preparation of design and 
supervision including: (a) assisting communities and local governments in the 
identification of subprojects, with preparation of proposals and requests for financing; (b) 
preparation of feasibility studies, engineering design, and tender documentation for 
subproject proposals; (c) construction supervision for subproject execution; (d) benefit 
assessment surveys; (e) auditing; (f) training, including workshops, for consulting firms, 
contractors, and NGOs; (f) training of local communities /beneficiaries in the O&M of 
the infrastructure created; and (g) environmental assessments and other technical 
advisory services as to be found justified; and (iii) carrying out of a study on the future 
options for the PWP including the role of the PMU. 
 
Component 3 (US$ 2.0 million): Project Management. 
Maintaining and further strengthening the Project Management Unit (PMU).  This 
component will include financing of incremental operational costs of the PMU including 
training costs of the PMU staff. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and 
social characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any 
protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive 
areas.) 
 
The main project component – Community infrastructure subprojects would be scattered 
all over the country ranging from extreme remote areas to remote rural, semi urban and 
urban areas.  Selection of sub-projects will be based on such indicators as high poverty, 
high population density, no access to services.  Subproject completion is expected to 
trigger positive environmental impacts access to safe water supply and sanitation, health 
services, paved roads, etc.  Sites selected are not expected to be close to any protected 
cultural, or trigger any socially contentious issues, which would be avoided through 
consensus of the communities on sub-project and site location before implementation.

Comments:  
The Project is not expected to trigger any major negative environmental impacts due to 
the nature of interventions being very small (average cost US$60,000), which mainly 
consist of upgrading, rehabilitation, or additional new services that will not involve land 
acquisition or resettlement. 
 
The Project has been placed under environmental category “B” in accordance with OD 
4.01, which requires preparation of an Environmental Management Plan.  An EA 
document has been prepared by the Borrower (Client) which has been submitted to the 
Infoshop.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1 a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
An Environmental Assessment including EMP has been finalized and is available at the 
InfoShop.  Due to the nature of interventions (provision of basic community services) and 
magnitude (average cost US$60,000) no significant or irreversible impacts are anticipated 
 
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard 
policy or due to multiple project component.  
 
Not applicable
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project 
area. 
The project is not expected to create any long impacts. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not applicable. 
 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The implementation of the EMP  will be monitored through regular supervision by HQ and 
by  staff of the  country office. Furthermore, the implementing agency will ensure that 
environmental issues are properly addresses through conducting EIA’s for any 
environmentally sensitive project.
 
 
Any subprojects that require the involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary resettlement 
of occupants or displacement of their economic activities will be ineligible for funding.  
However, individuals or communities may donate land voluntarily.  The PMU will 
adequately document the process of land donation, verifying ownership of land and that 
there is no dispute over it.  A memorandum of understanding will also be signed between 
those donating the land and the PMU.
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard 
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include target communities in rural and urban areas with high 
poverty, local councils, NGO’s, Local government and Line Ministries. 
 
Consultation with stakeholders and consensus building will be achieved through a Demand 
Driven Approach during the identification stage of each subproject.  In addition, 
environmental awareness programs would be conducted to include all stakeholders 
especially for environmentally sensitive projects (water and waste-water projects).  
 
The EA including EMP has been cleared by the Bank and submitted to the InfoShop.
