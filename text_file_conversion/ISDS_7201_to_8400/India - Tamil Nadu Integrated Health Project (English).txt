I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

The proposed project would assist the Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) in achieving their overall goal of
improving health outcomes for poor and underserved populations, in line with the Millennium Development Goals
in health.

The proposed project would contribute to the achievement of this goal through the following:

·         Increasing access to underserved populations, and redressing regional imbalances; and
·         Increasing effectiveness through institutional development and enhanced quality.

These project objectives would be supported by a package of policy and institutional reforms directed at improving
the quality of services available to address the health needs of the people of TN. The reforms would be in three key
areas : improving financing and resource allocations for the health sector; enhancing the role of private and
voluntary sectors; and addressing issues of human resources in health.

The proposed project would build upon the commitment made by the Government of Tamil Nadu, as stated in the
Tamil Nadu Health Policy, to facilitate the balanced development of health systems and services, responsive to the
health needs of the people. GOTN is committed to strengthening the public health care approach and primary
health care strategies to increase equity in health care outcomes among regions, genders, and disadvantaged and
vulnerable groups. In addition, Tamil Nadu would benefit from the lessons learnt from earlier state health projects
in India, and some of the issues which would be addressed during project preparation and implementation are the
following: strengthening health systems across the primary and secondary levels of health care including the
district-level, participation with the private and NGO sector and performance based monitoring for specific
investments. The proposed project would assist GOTN in achieving the following health and nutritional goals set
out for 2020 including (among others):

Normal              9.4%                 30.0%


Achieving these health outcomes would require concerted action by the health and other sectors such as education,
water and sanitation, and rural development. Important determinants of poor health and nutritional status include
poverty, low educational status of women, and gender and caste-based inequities; these factors cannot be
adequately addressed through interventions in the health sector alone. Accordingly GOTN has developed a policy
document that envisages coordination between the various sectors to achieve better health outcomes. The proposed
project would provide an input into that effort.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

The proposed project would consist of three main components:

·         Management development and institutional strengthening, including strengthening planning,
management and implementation capacity; strengthening district level administration for integrating programs in
primary and secondary health, centrally sponsored schemes for disease control, reproductive health and nutrition;
strengthening disease surveillance and management information systems; developing a health care waste
management system; and enhancing the institutional framework for policy development. The component would
finance professional services, local training, vehicles, equipment including computers, furniture, studies,
fellowships, workshops, operational expenses, and salaries of incremental staff on a declining basis.
·         Improving access and service quality and effectiveness, including renovating and upgrading selected
primary and secondary facilities; improving the quality of curative, preventive and health promotion services and
implementing a quality assurance program; developing an effective referral mechanism between different levels of
care; and enhancing the skills of health personnel through training. Given the high IMR and MMR in a few
districts, and identified pockets within other districts, the selection criteria for investments to improve service
delivery would specifically target these areas. Specific investments in the remaining districts would be based on a
set of agreed outcome based performance indicators at the district/facility level. The component would finance
civil works, professional services, furniture, medical and other equipment, local training, workshops, vehicles
(purchase, hire and maintenance), IEC, operational expenses, and salaries of incremental staff on a declining basis.

·         Strengthening partnerships with communities and the private sector, going beyond the contracting out
of non-clinical support services, such as cleaning, laundry and diet, that has already been successfully implemented
by other state health systems projects. Informal health care providers would be involved in selective service
delivery, based on the recommendations of a study of the private sector to be undertaken during preparation which
would guide the design of this component. Other areas of private participation would also be explored, such as
contracting out of defined clinical services to the private sector; making available public infrastructure for private
provision of services; and building capacity in the private sector with the objective of involving them in the
implementation of public health programs. In addition, the GOTN would experiment, with project support, with
several risk pooling models that are currently being undertaken in TN and elsewhere in India. The analysis being
undertaken as part of preparation would elaborate on the specific mechanisms of how these would be undertaken.
The component would finance professional services, NGOs, local training, IEC, workshops, studies, vehicles
(purchase, hire and maintenance), operational expenses and salaries of incremental staff on a declining basis.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Tamil Nadu is the seventh largest Indian state in terms of population, at about 55.6 million (1991), and the
eleventh largest in terms of land area. It is the most urban of all Indian states, with almost 40% of its population
living in urban centers. In terms of health outcomes, there are significant urban-rural differentials and
inter-regional differences. There are districts and clusters within districts where health outcomes are significantly
lower than in the state as a whole. Further analysis has shown that these areas lack basic health infrastructure and
trained health manpower. This project is expected to provide more efficient and effective health care to better
address the needs of the poor. Approximately 11.5million SC/STs will be directly benefited by the project.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Hospitals and health facilities generate large amounts of biomedical waste, much of which is similar to ordinary
household waste. Only about 10 - 25% of waste generated from average health care facilities is regarded as
hazardous. The wastes of highest concern are sharps (needles, syringes, surgical equipment, IV sets etc) and
biological and chemical hazardous wastes. Poor management and inadequate treatment and disposal of such
hazardous waste can have adverse impact on the environment and on public health through air, land and water
pollution. However such negative impacts are reversible and easily mitigated through systematic management from
source to disposal. Another component which can have potential impact on the environment is related to waste
that will be generated from construction and up-gradation of project facilities. Within the scope of this project, it is
proposed that an Environmental Assessment will be undertaken of representative sample of healthcare facilities of
various sizes and in different geographical areas. The assessment will focus on the existing waste management
practices in the project facilities. It will also provide an understanding of the environmental health related issues in
various districts. Based on the assessment GOTN will prepare an Environmental Management Plan, which will
detail the outcomes and findings of the environmental assessment, identify the environmental impacts of projects

                                                                                                                   ISDS


activities and include a Waste Management Plan detailing good practices and procedures for the efficient
management of the waste lifecycle.


Social Development
The key social development outcomes for the project are to improve the health care outcomes among the more
vulnerable groups in the society including women, ST/SC groups, the poor and populations in remote areas.
Improving the access of these groups to health services and improving the quality and efficiency of services
available for the vulnerable groups and those in underserved areas, are envisaged.

l   Reaching the Scheduled Tribe populations: The public health care infrastructure in the hilly and remote areas
    in which tribals reside is poor. Tribals face socio-cultural, economic and physical barriers in accesing and
    utilizing the public health care systems. A Tribal Strategy and Plan to increase access to health services for the
    tribal populations in remote areas. The plan will also assess the potential contribution of traditional health care
    providers while considering the health care delivery systems for the tribes.
l   Gender Strategy and Plan: Despite favourable health indicators, some issues of concern with respect to women
    include unacceptably high levels of anemia, preventable infections, pregnancy- and childbirth-related mortality
    and morbidity, especially among the poor and disadvantaged. While there has been improvement in the
    delivery of field-based services for women, the major concern is women's access to institutional services, and
    the quality of ante-natal care remain. In addition, female infanticide is still a problem in several parts of the
    state, notably pockets in the districts of Dharmapuri, Salem and Madurai. In order to better understand the
    reasons/constraints for these conditions, and to look at strategies to overcome these and improve health
    outcomes for women, a detailed study will be undertaken and a gender plan prepared. The significant role that
    the large number of women's self-help groups in Tamil Nadu can play in this direction, will also be explored.
    The plan will be based on extensive consultations, whose details will be documented in the Plan. The draft
    plan will be widely disseminated before finalisation. The plan will also provide for participatory monitoring of
    its implementation to track and manage the risks of service provider behaviour.
l   Land requirement: The OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is not triggered and there will be no involuntary
    land acquisition (or use of eminent domain). It is currently envisaged that land will be required in the
    renovation and/or extension of hospitals and facilties and these activities will take place on land already in the
    possession of the Government. However, during preparation, if there are instances of additional or new land
    requirements for construction/expansion of facilities, the Government will purchase land from the market with
    couterpart funds, on the basis of "willing buyer, willing seller". In both, cases the Government will provide
    certificates for each of these facilities documenting that "the land on which these are being built/upgraded is
    free of encroachment and that no resettlement is warranted as no involuntary land acquisition (use of eminent
    domain) or displacement has occurred".

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Increased utilization of healthcare facilities will result in increase in the quantum of waste generated, which if not
adequately managed, could have adverse impact on public health, through spread of diseases and the environment
through land and water pollution.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
None

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An EMP will be prepare for the project. The EMP will detail the outcome and findings of the environmental
assessment, identify the environmental impacts related to projects activities and will include a Waste Management

Plan, detailing good practices and procedures for the most efficient management of the complete lifecycle of the
waste generated at the health facilities.

A Tribal Strategy and Plan would be prepared as per the contents suggested in OD 4.20, detailing the specific
actions to be taken under the proposed project to increase access to health services for the tribal populations in
remote areas. The plan will also assess the potential contribution of traditional health care providers while
considering the health care delivery systems for the tribes. The plan will be based on extensive consultations,
whose details will be documented in the Plan. The draft plan will be widely disseminated before finalisation. The
plan will also provide for participatory monitoring of plan implementation to ensure adequate attention to political
economy and corruption issues.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
End beneficiaries, community groups, NGOs, private providers and local government officials, will participate in
project preparation through consultation workshops and focus group discussions to identify needs and constraints
to obtaining quality care and expanding access, and to define performance indicators for monitoring the project's
progress in these areas. The project will also explore the possiblity and modalities of working with informal health
care providers (including traditional medicine practitioners), especially in areas like emergency obstetrics,
Traditional Birth Attendants and build their capacity, recognising the fact they are the first point of contact for
vulnerable groups. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of the poor, and of women, and project inputs
would be prioritized in part on that basis.

The Department of Health and Family Welfare will finalise the Tribal Development Plan, The Healthcare Waste
Management Plan and also the Gender Plan after widely circulating the draft and also with extensive consultations
with all stakeholders. The Project Implementation Plan (PIP) will also be prepared based on an extensive
consultation with stakeholders.
