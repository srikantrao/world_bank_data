A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is to improve incomes and living standards of 123,500 
rural households through electrification of these households. 
 
Achievement of the objective will be measured by socio-economic surveys in villages 
electrified under the project, the results of which will be compared with the baseline 
studies referred to above. 
 
There are two expected outcomes for the global environmental objective: (1)  substantial adoption of 
renewable energy in GoL’s rural electrification program (growing from a 7-10% share of all newly 
electrified households in SPRE to a 20% share in SPRE II);  and (2) increased efficiency of energy 
consumption for EdL customers, that in turn will result in increased exports of hydropower production to 
Thailand and eventual greenhouse gas savings, as thermal power plants are the marginal production unit in 
Thailand over the project period.
 
Achievement of the renewable energy objective will be measured by the percentage of 
households electrified by renewable off-grid technologies in relation to overall 
households in the proposed project, in comparison to the baseline established by the 
SPRE project.  For the DSM and energy efficiency activities, a detailed M&E program 
will be formulated to estimate the domestic electricity usage and cost savings, increased 
power exports, and regional carbon reductions that comprise the benefits of the off-grid 
and DSM/energy efficiency components of SPRE II.

NGPES and CAS Objectives.
 
In line with the main objective of the government-owned NGPES and the 
existing CAS, the proposed project will support rural and national infrastructure development by targeting 
rural electricity consumers and sector-wide institution building.  In this way, the project will respond to the 
NGPES objectives of poverty reduction and establishment of an enabling environment for growth and 
development while supporting the CAS objective of rural and national infrastructure development.
 
Global Environmental Objective.
 
The GEF financed activities will contribute to two GEF climate change 
operational program objectives 
–
(i) removing the barriers to higher efficiency levels in urban and rural 
power end-use consumption (OP 5);  and (ii) wider use of renewable energy technologies in rural power 
supply, especially off-grid (OP 6). Furthermore, the strategies and outcomes that the proposed GEF 
financing will support are closely aligned with four of the six recently-adopted Strategic Priorities for the 
Climate Change Focal Area, especially creation of power sector policy frameworks supportive of 
renewable energy and energy efficiency (CC-3). The global benefits of the two GEF-supported SPRE II 
components are estimated as 4,150 te CO
2
lifetime for the off-grid renewable electrification component 
and 44,500 te CO
2
lifetime for the DSM and energy efficiency component. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Project Components. 
The Project has two components one to be executed by each beneficiary EdL and 
MIH. 
 
The EdL component
 will contribute to the achievement of project objectives through 
electrification of rural households by grid extension, and indirectly through further 
advancing the commercialization of E
dL, thus increasing EdL’s self-financing capability.  
It consists of the following sub-components:  
 
(a) extension of the EdL grid to about 42,000 households in some 544 villages in 
seven central and southern provinces; 
(b) enhancement of existing EdL loss reduction efforts (covering both technical and 
non
technical losses) through implementation of a program of activities and 
investments developed and piloted under a PHRD financed study; 
(c) furthering integration of EdL headquarters and branch offices (BO) through 
rolling out the existing billing and accounting  system (BAS) installed in 
Vientiane Office and some BOs to remaining BOs; 
(d) implementing a program of Demand-Side Management (DSM) and energy 
efficiency activities in the country, including establishment of provisional 
institutional arrangements for DSM planning and energy efficiency policy 
development within EdL or MIH or both (further definition of this program 
currently underway with ASTAE assistance). 
(e) development of tariff and subsidy policies and associated tariff regime and an 
action plan to implement this regime. 
 
The EdL component will generally be IDA financed, except that DSM and energy 
efficiency activities will be financed by GEF.  In all activities, EdL will provide 
substantial co-financing. The financing by source is provided in Annex 4 and a detailed 
financing plan is provided in Annex 5. 
 
The MIH component
will contribute to the project development objective through 
Page  3
scaling up the pilot off-grid program of rural electrification.  It will also establish the 
enabling environment (together with the EdL tariff/subsidy studies) to encourage other 
participants to develop and finance power sector expansion under the Phase II project.  It 
consists of the following sub-components: 
 
(a) provide electrification to about 10,000 households spread over 1109 villages in 17 
provinces through off-grid technologies (mostly renewables);
 
(b) scaling up the existing MIH off-grid development program through establishment 
of
necessary legal and regulatory underpinnings, strengthening organization and 
management arrangements, offering a wider range of off-grid technologies, and 
conversion of the existing re-flow account into a Rural Electrification Fund (REF) 
to provide a self-financing contribution to the MIH program. 
(c) detailed design of other rural electrification models involving non-traditional 
developers and financiers and development and enactment of necessary legal and 
regulatory arrangements including those necessary to extend REF to other 
participants, and project preparation 
including solicitation documents for “other 
model” projects. 
(d) development of  a rural electrification master-plan (including associated resource 
studies for distributed generation) and an electricity distribution database; 
(e) development of  a sector financing strategy including models for solicitation for 
new generation and preparation of  a  small hydropower IPP project for sales to 
the EdL grid (policy, legal, regulatory, solicitation documents), assuming 
technical feasibility study carried out by JICA.  
(f)  strengthening organizational and management arrangements within MIH to enable 
it to undertake its expanded roles in  the areas of regulation and planning. 
 
IDA financing will generally be used to finance the physical investments in off-grid electrification.  
Substantial self-financing by MIH through re-flows from the REF is also envisaged. 
 
GEF financing will support all of the institutional development components. Co-financing from PPIAF and 
ESMAP is also being sought to supplement GEF financing in some  areas. The financing by source is 
provided in Annex 4 and a detailed financing plan is provided in Annex 5 of the PAD.
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The grid-extension will be in seven southern provinces in Lao PDR, including: 
Bolikhamxay, Khammouane, Savannakhet,  Saravane, Champassak, Attopeu and Sekong. 
The off-grid electrification will spread over 17 provinces in Lao PDR.

For grid extension component, the first year program will include 47 subprojects for electrification of 
42,000 households in 394 villages, only 0.4 ha land areas will be required with 20 percent being farmland, 
and  about 33,000 trees will be affected.  The Phase 1 project will focus on using SHS and VH and GS for 
off-grid electrification of 10,000 households. Limited land acquisition and resettlement impacts are 
expected
 
Significant portion of the project beneficiaries are ethnic villages and populations. For grid extension 
component, 37 percent of the targeted villages have ethnic groups and 31 percent of total project 
beneficiaries are ethnic population. For off-grid component, since most project villages will be located in 
remote areas in 17 provinces, about two thirds of them are ethnic villages.
 
Policy Framework for On- and Off-Grid Components.
 Given the APL approach adopted for the project 
and potential resettlement and environmental impacts, a resettlement policy framework has been developed 
for both grid and off-grid component, and environmental policy framework has been prepared for on- and 
off-grid activities respectively. Both policy frameworks have been reviewed by the IDA project team and 
the East Asia Safeguard Unit and were considered acceptable.   
 
Action Plans for First Year On-Grid Program.
 RAP for 47 subprojects and EMPs for 42 of the 47 
subprojects were prepared in line with the policy frameworks and submitted to IDA. EMPs for the rest of 
the subproject will be submitted to IDA by end July. For off-grid component, since the first year program 
does not include VH and GS schemes, no RAP and EMP is required. The EMPs and RAPs available were 
reviewed by the IDA project team and were considered acceptable.  
 
Ethnic People Development Plan. 
An Ethnic People’s Development Plan (EPDP) was prepared in 
compliance with relevant Bank policies for both components to ensure that affected ethnic populations 
benefit from the project and adverse impacts are avoided or mitigated through a consultative process. The 
EPDP introduces the basic legal, cultural and socio-economic conditions for ethnic groups in Lao PDR, 
particularly pertaining to land tenure and natural resource use. In addition, specific consultation procedures 
and institutional arrangements are proposed to address the particular needs and circumstances of ethnic 
groups during project implementation. It aims to ensure that development progress fosters full respect for 
their dignity, human rights and cultural uniqueness.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  5
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
No major impacts are expected. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Two 115 kV transmission lines financed by others will be constructed in Lao PDR and are associated with 
the SPRE II project. EDL agrees to apply the same resettlement policy to the associated 115 kV 
transmission projects even though they are not financed by IDA. Environment assessment was conducted 
and recorded in the project files. These two transmission line EIAs were reviewed by the World Bank Task 
Team and considered to meet World Bank standards. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Optimization of design for grid extension has gone several round with assistance of 
international consultants and alternative technologies and international experiences have 
been reviewed and incorporated. The off-grid component is design to tap new renewable 
energy technologies while replicating  the successful experience on SHS. All these work 
is aimed to achieve cost-effectiveness and greater impacts on rural electrification with 
limited resources. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has prepared action plans and framework documents
 
as described above to 
address the safeguard issues. The borrower has agreed to implement the 
recommendations of the action plans and follow the procedures outlined in the 
framework documents. EdL has gained experience in environmental and social impacts 
mitigation with the on-going SPRE project, which are also financed by IDA and are very 
similar to the proposed project. EdL has adequate capacity to plan and implement these 
action plans. 
 
For VH schemes to be developed in the later stage of the Phase 1 project, MIH will be the 
interim implementing agency and the future implementing agency will be placed in 
position as a result of the institutional strengthening  program under the proposed project. 
The capacity of these implementing agencies for planning and implementing safeguard 
actions are inadequate and will be enhanced in the early stage of Phase 1 under the TA 
program of the proposed project. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the project affected households and beneficiaries. An extensive 
social economic survey and rural electrification impact assessment was carried out during 
the project preparation, during which the affected households and beneficiaries were 
consulted. Based on the consultation, the resettlement policy framework and EPDP were 
Page  6
developed in a participatory approach, which focus on affected people for compensation 
of lost land and re-establishment of livelihood, and on ethnic people for assurance of 
benefit sharing.
