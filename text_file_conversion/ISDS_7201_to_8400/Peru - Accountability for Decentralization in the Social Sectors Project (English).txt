A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the Project is to strengthen results-oriented and participatory planning, 
monitoring and evaluation, with emphasis on decentralized social programs of The Ministry 
of Women and Social Development (MIMDES).  Specific objectives for the first-phase 
project are to: (i) improve the quality of social policies and programs in the context of 
decentralization; (ii) implement the Performance Agreements and Accreditation Systems 
required for the implementation of the Conditional Transfers Law (this would involve the 
two decentralized social protection programs under MIMDES --food aid and targeted small 
scale infrastructure); and (iii) support the development of basic instruments required for the 
M&E system in a decentralized context. 
 
This Project aims at reducing the risk of deterioration in the targeting and efficiency of 
social programs throughout the decentralization process.  Thus, if the Project is successful, 
one would expect that targeting and efficiency of social programs in MIMDES, initially, 
remain the same and, subsequently, show relative improvement.  In the case of the 
Education and Health Sectors, which are expected to be decentralized in 2006, a clear 
decentralization framework is expected, with each government level being ready to take on 
their responsibilities and functions and with an accountability system installed to monitor 
this transfer. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
1. Lending instrument 
 
The proposed lending instrument is a Technical Assistance Loan (TAL).  This instrument 
was selected as it was considered the most appropriate to assist the Government in 
implementing decentralization policies agreed upon under the Programmatic Social Reform 
Loan.  The Government has requested financing of technical assistance to support design 
and implementation of critical policies that will lead to achieving accountability in the 
decentralization process.   
 
2. Project 
components 
 
Component 1: Improving the quality of social policies and programs 
 
The objective of this first component is to improve the quality of social policies and 
programs in a decentralized context, by focusing on (i) the design of social policies in a 
decentralized context and, (ii) on developing capacity in results-oriented planning.   The first 
subcomponent will contribute to: the development of a social policy framework consistent 
with the multi-annual macroeconomic framework which should lead to improving policies 
related to protecting expenditures for the priority social programs; the development of 
policies leading to improved coverage and efficiency of the pension system; and the design 
of the policy frameworks for decentralization of MIMDES, Ministry of Education and 
Ministr
y
 of Health.  A second subcom
p
onent will include the stren
g
thenin
g
 of existin
g
 
Page  4
 
 
instruments for results-oriented planning and accountability at the national level.  These 
instruments include the sectoral strategic plans (PESEM) and program results framework, as 
well as the results agreements signed between MEF and the social programs.  This 
component will finance national and international consultancies, studies, workshops and 
consultations with stakeholders. 
 
Component 2: Implementation of Performance Agreements and Accreditation of social 
sectors
 
 
The second component will support the implementation of the decentralization process of 
the social programs through: (i) design of pending regulations for the MIMDES programs, 
including improvement of procurement rules.  Although the MIMDES programs are already 
in the process of being decentralized, there are a number of critical regulations needed to 
ensure that municipalities can take on the responsibility of purchasing and distributing food, 
as well as executing small works; (ii) implementation of the accreditation processes.  The 
Project will contribute to the design of the specific accreditation for social programs, 
including the definition of benchmarks, and establishing an assessment mechanism; and, 
(iii) implementation of performance or management agreements (PAs) and capacity-
building at the local level through training and dissemination programs. The component will 
finance national and international consultancies, workshops, training, dissemination and 
equipment. 
 
Component 3: Improvement of Monitoring and Evaluation in the Social Sectors  
 
The component builds on several instruments and initiatives launched by the government, 
CSO and independent think-tanks during the last years.  The purpose is to build M&E 
capacity through the strengthening of existing monitoring instruments, constructing them 
where necessary, and developing analytical capacity. The component will have the 
following subcomponents: (i) expansion and strengthening of SIAF, both in terms of 
geographical coverage to the local government level, and in terms of modules that will 
integrate the budget to the system and that will allow users to monitor inputs and outputs of 
the social programs; (ii) development of a monitoring system for the social programs with 
emphasis on the MIMDES programs; (iii) support to transparency and participatory 
monitoring mechanisms including independent budget analysis, participatory evaluation and 
establishment of feedback mechanisms; and (iv) independent intermediate and impact 
evaluations, including the improvement of household surveys and measurement of user 
satisfaction.  
 
Component 4.  Project Management 
 
The purpose of this component is to support project implementation, monitoring and 
evaluation. The UCPS (Unidad de Coordinación de Préstamos Sectoriales) in MEF will 
operate according to the structure and management procedures agreed with the Bank. A 
capacity assessment was carried out to evaluate procurement and financial management 
processes under the responsibility of the UCPS, and were deemed satisfactory. The UCPS 
will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring the yearly Operations Plan, financial 
Page  5
 
 
management of the project, and procuring goods and services.
