I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

(a)      to improve the competitiveness of the energy sectors in Ghana, Benin, and Togo by promoting: (i)
the use of cheaper and environmentally cleaner gas from Nigeria in lieu of solid and liquid fuels for power
generation and other industrial, commercial, and domestic uses; and (ii) reforms including a modern,
institutional legal and regulatory framework that facilitates private sector participation in the energy sector;
and

(b)      to foster regional economic and political integration that would support economic growth, and in
particular the development of the West Africa electricity market.


I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

The West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP or the Project) is a regional energy infrastructure project for
West Africa.

The Project includes construction of a new high pressure natural gas pipeline, which will supply natural
gas from Nigeria, to markets in Benin, Ghana, and Togo, by a newly created entity called West African
Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAPCo), a Bermuda corporation.

                                                        2
                                                                                                           ISDS




The gas to be transported in the new WAPCo pipeline will be produced and processed in the Niger Delta
area in south eastern Nigeria; the gas will be primarily associated gas from oil production that previously
would have been flared or vented to the atmosphere. From there, it will be transported via an existing high
pressure gas pipeline, the Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS), to the existing terminus of that system
at Alagbado near Lagos, Nigeria, where the new WAPCo pipeline will commence. The new WAPCo
pipeline thus begins physically at the Alagbado T-junction in Ota Division of Ogun State near Lagos. The
Project is one of many customers of the Niger Delta producers, receiving the gas it transports from the
ELPS system.

From that point, the new WAPCo pipeline will run about 56 kilometres onshore, to the Nigerian coast, and
from there straight out to sea. From there it will run in a westerly direction roughly parallel to the coast,
between about 15 and 20 kilometres offshore, in water depths between 26 and 70 metres. The initial
construction of the new WAPCo pipeline will terminate at Aboadze in western Ghana, the site of the
Takoradi Power Station. The total length of the new pipeline will be approximately 690 km, 620 kms of
which is being built offshore.

Lateral pipelines will be laid, to permit natural gas to be delivered along the way, at regulation and
metering stations to be situated at landing points at Cotonou in Benin, Lomé in Togo, and Tema (near
Accra) in Ghana. Once they make landfall, these lateral lines traverse approximately 4 km in Cotonou
(with another 9.5 km of low pressure "link line" downstream of the regulating and metering station), 1 km
in Lomé (with another 0.5 km of low pressure "link line" downstream of the regulating and metering
station), 1 km at Tema, and about 300 meters at the Takoradi Power Station.

The estimated initial construction cost of the new WAPCo pipeline is about US$ 450 million, and prior to
commencing construction the sponsors of the Project will have spent about $70 million, for a total of about
US$520 million. The final cost will be determined via a competitive bidding process. The cost of the
several stages of expansion to achieve maximum capacity will be approximately US$150 million. An

                                                                                                          ISDS


investment decision to construct the new WAPCo pipeline is expected in 2004. This would lead to pipeline
start-up in mid 2005.

The new WAPCo pipeline is expected to be a 20-inch lined pipeline (this will depend on final costings to be
derived from a competitive bidding process, presently underway). The initial installed throughput capacity
of the pipeline is expected to be about 150 MMScf/day. In addition, the pipeline will be sized to cater for
expansion to meet anticipated future growth in demand, up to a maximum capacity of approximately 450
MMScf/day. The pipeline size will be confirmed following the completion of the competitive bidding
process on the basis of overall minimum transportation cost (using the concept of the weighted average
tariff detailed in the International Project Agreement) and other aspects including operational
considerations.

The development plan envisages a compression station being constructed at Lagos Beach, the last point
where the pipeline is onshore in Nigeria before heading offshore. This compression station will
subsequently be expanded as the pipeline capacity is increased in future years to meet additional demand.
The compression installed initially will be approximately 2 x 12,500 HP centrifugal units (one unit as
100% standby). This capacity will be capable of being increased by adding 4 additional 12,500 HP units
in future years to gain the ultimate capacity of about 450 MMScf/day.

Ownership of the new Pipeline System

To date, WAPCo has been sponsored by a six-company consortium (the Sponsors) which in August 1999
was mandated by the Governments of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo to develop the new pipeline.
Chevron Nigeria Limited, the Nigerian affiliate of ChevronTexaco Corporation, is the managing sponsor of
the Project.

A comprehensive shareholders agreement for WAPCo has been executed, under which each member has
ownership entitlements in WAPCo. Final ownership of WAPCo will depend on the participants making the
necessary capital contributions which are provided for in that agreement, but at this stage the following
corporations (or their respective affiliates) are expected to be the participants in WAPCo in the following
percentages:

                            ChevronTexaco:                                            36.7%
                            Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation:                  25.0%
                            Shell Oil Company:                                        18.0%
                            Volta River Authority:                                    16.3%
                            Societe Beninoise de Gaz SA:                              2.0%
                            Societe Togolaise de Gaz SA:                              2.0%

The latter two companies are two small companies based respectively in Benin and Togo, which are
expected to help develop local distribution systems for gas transported in the new WAPCo pipeline.

Gas Markets

The initial (foundation) market for gas transported by the new WAPCo pipeline is the existing
crude-oil-fired Takoradi Power Station in Ghana, plus two small existing liquid fuel power stations in
Cotonou and Lomé. Substantial growth in the market for gas is projected, with several additional new
power generation projects proposed in Ghana, Togo, and Benin. There are also opportunities to develop
new industries in the region that would use natural gas for heat, and for the conversion of existing plants
which presently use other fuel sources.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Impacts include a variety of potential impacts on the terrestrial and marine ecosystems traversed by the
pipeline. Alternatives that have been studied include (a) onshore routing of the pipeline, (b) power
generation in Nigeria with electric transmission to the other countries, and (c) continuation of oil-fired
generation in Ghana, Togo, and Benin (no pipeline or enhanced electric transmission).

To address the issues, environmental experts have been engaged to do a major set of studies including those
for OP 4.01 and OP 4.12. The studies include:

    l Environmental Impact Assessments
    l Resettlement Action Plans

Large scale, significant, and/or irreversible impacts will be determined by the experts.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

TBD


II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

The Project is expected to generate significant long-term positive impacts on air quality as a result of
reductions in gas flaring and venting in Nigeria and from fuel switching from Bonny light crude and jet fuel
to natural gas in Ghana, Togo, and Benin. No long-term adverse impacts are expected, but the EA will
include examination of possible long-term impacts caused by or associated with the pipeline.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

See II.D.1a above for alternatives study.


II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

A Category A Environmental Assessment to Bank standards under OP 4.01 is being undertaken by ICF
Consulting Group, Inc, under contract with WAPCo. The Bank's safeguards specialists have been fully
engaged in the process and have provided detailed guidance and comments to the consultants and sponsors.
In addition, Nexant Limited, under a contract with USAID, is assisting the four States in ensuring
environmental compliance.

A portion of the new pipeline in Nigeria, from the interface near Lagos to the ocean, will require some
resettlement in the right-of-way although physical relocation of affected pople is expected to be low. When
the final route is determined, a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) done to Bank standards under OP 4.12 will
be submitted to and agreed by the Bank, and will be agreed with the Government of Nigeria. RAPs will
also be written for Benin, Togo, and Ghana (Tema only) corridors.

As the new pipeline will cross international waterways, OP 7.50 is triggered. It has been determined that
formal notification is not necessary because all four riparian states are party to the Treaty implementing
WAGP. Environmental aspects of the marine pipeline will be fully covered in the EA.

The EA will ascertain whether policy on Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) is applicable. Under the policy on
Cultural Properties (OPN 11.03), a survey is being carried out in Nigeria to determine whether there are
significant cultural property issues along the pipeline corridor. A report of findings will be part of the EA.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

A consultation process has been agreed with the Sponsors that involves on-site meetings in each country
with affected parties from the government partners to the village and town families who may be affected.
The final draft Regional EA and each respective country-specific EA and RAP will be placed in public
locations in the four countries (TBD), as well as the Bank's InfoShop, in compliance with the Bank's policy
on disclosure.
