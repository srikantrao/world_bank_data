B.  Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the proposed project is to establish a decentralized beneficiary-driven mechanism that 
allows organized landless or poor farmers to acquire suitable agricultural lands and implement investment 
subprojects which puts them on a sustainable, higher-income pathway.  At this point, it is estimated the proposed 
project would benefit between 1,500 and 3,000 poor rural families, which represents roughly 15 to 30 percent of the 
total number of families which have submitted requests for land allocations to Government.   
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project would be financed through a Specific Investment Credit since it is a self-contained initiative to be 
implemented in targeted regions.  It is expected that the project (estimated total cost: US$ 17 million) would have 
three components: (i) land acquisition; (ii) complementary investments to enhance the productive capacity of the 
acquired lands; and (iii) project management, technical assistance, and monitoring and evaluation.   
 
Under the first component, organized groups of beneficiary farmers would identify a farm and negotiate its purchase 
with the owner.  They would submit a land acquisition proposal, along with an investment plan, to a local level 
decision-making body (building on the existing municipal structures, such as the municipal council and oversight 
committee, and incorporating other local stakeholders).  This body would verify the eligibility and prioritization 
criteria (for beneficiaries and lands), review the legal status of the farm to be acquired, verify that the proposed price 
is consistent with local market conditions, and verify other technical, environmental and social project requirements.  
Land acquisition would be financed through a credit line (the terms of which would be determined in the course of 
project preparation) channeled through a commercial bank.  Beneficiary groups would be responsible for repayment 
and the acquired lands would serve as collateral (US$ 6 million approximately).  
 
Once the land acquisition proposal is approved, under the second component beneficiaries would become eligible to 
receive funding, on a matching-grant basis, for investment subprojects and technical assistance to settle on the farm 
and improve its productivity (US$ 8 million approximately).

Finally, project management, technical assistance, and monitoring and evaluation would cost approximately US$ 3 
million. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project activities are likely to concentrate in selected municipalities in the Department of Santa Cruz.  Exact location 
will be determined in the course of project preparation. Once identified, the physical and biological characteristics of 
these areas will be evaluated within the Environmental Assessment (EA) being conducted as part of project 
preparation activities.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
To be determined in the course of project preparation.  The environmental assessment will evaluate existing capacity 
to oversee the project’s environmental aspects and contain measures to enhance the Borrower’s capacity to manage 
environmental issues where needed.  The environmental management plan and the social and institutional 
assessments will develop measures to enhance the Borrower’s capacity to deal with identified social issues.

An EA will be done as part of project preparation to identify the project’s potential environmental impacts, to 
develop appropriate mitigation measures for negative impacts, and to recommend enhancement measures for 
positive impacts. These mitigation and enhancement measures will be summarized in an Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) that will include the criteria, procedures, and institutional responsibilities for: 
environmental screening of lands; environmental management of investment subprojects; mainstreaming of 
environmental and sustainable land management considerations within any project-provided technical assistance and 
training; addressing any pest management issues; standard environmental rules for contractors; and monitoring of 
the project’s environmental aspects. The EA will also evaluate whether other “environmental” safeguards are 
triggered (Natural Habitats, Forests, Cultural Property, Pest Management) and develop appropriate procedures, if 
necessary.  
 
No large-scale impacts are expected given the limited, community-based nature of project activities. However, the 
EA will evaluate potential cumulative impacts stemming from project activities.  
 
As the majority of project beneficiaries are expected to be indigenous peoples, the project appraisal document will 
constitute the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. The project design will draw heavily upon the findings and 
recommendations of the social assessment being conducted as part of project preparation. 
 
Within the context of the social assessment, it will be determined if the safeguard policy related to involuntary 
resettlement is applicable and a resettlement plan will be developed if necessary. The social assessment will 
emphasize consultation toward building consensus for the project and make recommendations for improving 
stakeholder information dissemination.

For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS 
 
Not applicable 
 
C. 
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  The specific 
studies and their timing

 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
Target start date for safeguard assessments is March/April 2004.  Safeguard assessments should be completed by 
June or July 2004
