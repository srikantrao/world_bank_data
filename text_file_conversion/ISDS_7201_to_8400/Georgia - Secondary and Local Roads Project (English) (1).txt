A.2.  Project Objectives 
 
1.  Improve the Economic and Social Well-Being of the Rural Population in Selected Areas Through 
Upgrading of their Secondary and Local Road Networks 
 
Socio-economic surveys by the consultants have confirmed that road improvements will make a significant 
impact on the economic and social well-being of rural Georgia, where the majority of the poor are located.  
The surveys covered a random sample of 400 persons in five districts (Lanchkhuti, Gori, Kaspi, Gurjaani 
and Borjomi).  In rating the various problems they face, the condition of roads ranked second only to health 
services as a problem for rural residents, with 93 percent of respondents rating it an important problem.  
Reduced transport costs, it was felt would increase the competitiveness of local produce, improve access to 
social services, i.e. schools and medical facilities, and to off-farm employment opportunities, and in some 
cases spur tourism development which in the past was an important sector of the Georgian economy.  
Indicators proposed for the baseline and follow-up surveys of villages in the zone of influence of improved 
roads are: (i) reduction in transport cost/time to access markets and social services, and (ii) increases in off-
farm employment income.  
 
2.  Strengthen GERA’s Institutional Capacity to Develop and Maintain a Cost Effective and Sustainable 
Secondary and Local Road Network 
 
GERA’s capacity to deliver an efficient road network will depend on the adequacy of their funding for 
maintenance and rehabilitation, and their ability to stretch available resources by introducing more cost-
effective techniques.  Indicators proposed are: (i) reductions in the unit costs of road works, and (ii) annual 
expenditures on secondary and local road maintenance. 
3.  Develop GERA’s Capacity to Interact with Local Communities and Increase its Responsiveness to 
Local Needs  
GERA’s responsiveness to local needs will depend on the extent to which local communities are made 
aware of road programs, and the extent to which their views and priorities are regularly expressed and 
taken into consideration. This requires well functioning participatory mechanisms, for which the following 
indicators are proposed: (i) Annual publication of road condition, expenditure and future program 
information, and (ii) Preparation of proposed a
nnual road improvement programs by each RMC. 
 
The project will also assist GERA establish regional offices to allow closer linkages with local 
communities, and better monitoring of implementation.

A.3. Project Description 
 
The project has five components: (1) rehabilitation of approximately 250 – 300 kilometers of paved 
secondary roads and procurement of road maintenance equipment for GERA (US$15.7 million); (2) 
rehabilitation of approximately 500 – 600 kilometers of all weather local roads (US$10.0 million); (3) 
establishment of regional offices for the Road Administration to facilitate decentralization of road 
management and community participation, procurement of traffic safety equipment, and support for 
incremental operating costs and project audits (US$ 1.05  million);  (4) technical assistance and training in: 
(i) revision of the geometric design standards for main, secondary and local roads; (ii) development of 
maintenance standards and associated methods specifications for all road classes; (iii) support for training 
and supervision of GERA and other local personnel for developing regional maintenance plans and 
undertaking road maintenance according to that plan; (iv) review and development of GERA organization, 
including administration, technical and data services, asset management and infrastructure operations, 
finance, programming and budgeting, environment and public participation; and (v) support and training 
for the Ministry of Infrastructure Development to accommodate its new mandate and improve its policy 
and oversight functions; and training of traffic police on traffic safety issues (US$1.65 million); and (5) 
design and supervision of the road works, and to produce reports for the Mid-Term Review and the 
evaluation of the first year program (US$2.0 million).   
 
Trust fund support will be sought for the training of traffic police, through a twinning arrangement, in 
traffic safety enforcement, crash data recording and analysis, and traffic police work in general.  Required 
equipment will be acquired under component (3) above.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.   
 
All work represents road rehabilitation following existing alignments, and any impact is likely to be minor 
and of such brief duration as is usually associated with any construction activity.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area.   
 
Mitigation of possible indirect impact is contained in the EMP.  Improvement in the condition of these 
roads will improve access to markets, reduce risk from accidents, and lower emission/pollution levels.   
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
NA 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower will be supported by an existing PIU that is well familiar with bank projects and safeguard 
issues.  A liaison officer has been appointed in GERA for environmental issues.  Training relating to 
safeguards issues and monitoring will be offered to contractors.  Contracts for the contractors have been 
upgraded to ensure compliance with both Bank and Georgian requirements.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
  
The Ministry of Environment and National Resources (MENR), The Ministry of Infrastructure 
Development (MID), and the Georgian Road Administration (GERA) are the key major stakeholders.  
Liaison is especially important between the MENR and GERA, and liaison officers have been appointed. 
Road Management Committees will be established in each Raion where there will be works.  These RMCs 
will assist the screening and selection process.  Further consultation will take place in conjunction with the 
preparation of the EA for each road segment.
