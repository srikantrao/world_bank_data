A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is: 
to improve the productive potential of natural resources and 
increase incomes of rural inhabitants in selected watersheds through socially inclusive, institutionally and 
environmentally sustainable approaches. 
 
The objective encompasses three themes: (i) community participation in watershed development and 
management aimed at integrating land-water use with the objectives of moisture retention and biomass 
production, while simultaneously enhancing incomes and livelihood options; (ii) strengthening 
administrative capacity of Gram Panchayats to manage project financial resources, implement subprojects, 
deliver legally mandated services (in the context of natural resource management), and to sustain those 
services beyond the duration of the project; and, (iii) ensuring equitable participation by all groups -
especially the landless and women who rely disproportionately on common-pool resources for fodder, fuel 
and other forest products.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
(1) 
Participatory Watershed Development and Management  
 
a) 
Promotion of social mobilization and community driven decision making
: This will 
finance participatory watershed planning at the village level using a budget envelop as 
the basis; identification of treatments on arable and non-arable lands; and, integration of 
village level plans into Gram Panchayat plans. NGOs contracted to assist in participatory 
watershed planning will also be financed under this component. Planning will take place 
at the smallest feasible social unit (equivalent to a Revenue Village or hamlet). This will 
result in Village Watershed Development Plans (VWDPs) being produced that will 
ultimately be aggregated into Gram Panchayat Plans.
 
 
Page  3
 
 
b) 
Watershed treatments and village development: 
This comprises of a budget envelop 
provided to each Gram Panchayat (and Revenue Village/hamlet within that) based on a 
formula incorporating the total potential treatable area and total population. Within this 
budget envelop, communities will prioritize (with the help of the environment and social 
management framework), implement, operate and maintain village development and 
watershed investments. 
 
 
(2) 
Enhancing Livelihood Opportunities  
 
a) 
Farming systems improvement: 
This will finance the introduction of improved 
technologies and practices for agriculture and horticulture, and silvi-pastoral treatments 
through demonstration.
 
 
b) 
Value addition and marketing support:  
Under this sub-component, the project will 
establish an agribusiness pilot fund that will be used to: (i) identify potential niche market 
opportunities; (ii) establish links with private sector entrepreneurs who could help in 
exploiting the market potential; (iii) disseminate appropriate information and technology 
to farmers to help them to enter into production; (iv) co-finance with farmers (on a one-
time subsidy basis) establishment costs; (v) co-finance with private sector entrepreneurs 
(on a one-time subsidy basis) storage, processing and or marketing infrastructure needed 
to exploit the market potential.
 
 
c) 
Income generating activities for vulnerable groups: 
This is designed to finance small 
income generating micro-enterprises for vulnerable groups (transhumants, women and 
landless). These groups would be identified during the watershed planning process 
(financed under component 1a) through a wealth/ asset ranking PRA method. Training 
will be provided to vulnerable groups to encourage their entrepreneurial development. 
The entire program will be linked to the overall preparation of Village Watershed 
Development Plans and Gram Panchayat Plans.  
 
(3) 
Institutional Strengthening  
 
a) 
Capacity building of Gram Panchayats and local community institutions:
 This will 
finance training of elected officials of GPs in core administrative functions of planning, 
budgeting, financial management, implementation and reporting. It will also provide an 
incentive fund to GPs to encourage improved performance and development of core 
administrative capacity.  This component will also finance capacity building of all other 
stakeholders on the applications of the ESMF; and training of community representatives, 
self-help groups and community organizations in project related activities.
 
 
b) 
Information, Education and Communication:
 This will finance a communications 
strategy to increase general awareness about the project, terms of participation and 
overall transparency amongst all stakeholders. 
 
 
c) 
Project coordination, monitoring and management: 
This will finance: organizational 
change management initiatives to realign the Watershed Directorate to the new 
implementation arrangements; development of links between the Management 
Information Systems, Geographic Information Systems and impact evaluation; 
participatory monitoring; and, incremental operating costs of the WMD.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The potential environmental and social impacts would arise mainly due to the special biophysical and 
socio-economic characteristics, such as  fragility and inaccessibility of the project area.  A growing 
population is further stressing environmental resources like land, water resources, grasslands and forests. 
No significant, large-scale, irreversible impacts are envisaged due to the small scale of the proposed project 
interventions. If planned, implemented and designed with environmentally and socially sound practices, the 
project activities would result in positive impacts.  
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01) : 
Improperly planned, designed and/or implemented, watershed 
related interventions can adversely impact the hydraulic regime in the area. There may also be cumulative 
effects of several inter-related interventions in the watershed area due to village development activities 
proposed through participatory processes.  Temporary adverse impacts may also be caused due to improper 
construction or other  practices leading to long-term slope instability, changes in surface water flow and 
blight due to improper disposal of debris, changes in water availability etc.  
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) : 
Silvipasture activities may be carried out within protected areas or within 
areas which are habitats of important species.   
Pest Management (OP 4.09)
 : Activities to improve farming systems will require pest management for 
crop protection. Inappropriate application of techniques available for pest management can cause harm to 
the environment, including humans.  
Forests (OP4.36) : 
 Activities in forest areas would affect the health and quality of forests.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
Potential long terms impacts may include changes in land use patterns and occupations of people. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Environment Assessment, Natural Habitats, Forests
: The project mainstreams environment and social 
criteria to assess safeguard issues at all levels of decision making to promote environmental sustainability 
and social equity which are the envisaged project outcomes.  It aims to replace the concept of post-design 
mitigation by an understanding of the use of Environment and Social Assessments (ESA) to select or reject 
sub-projects or modify their design. This decision making process not only applies to a particular 
intervention but also helps understand the cumulative or composite effect of several inter-related 
interventions in the watershed area.  
 
This has been operationalized by preparing an Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) 
and integrating it in the Operational Manual.  The ESMF includes, Environment and Social Guidelines 
providing mitigation measures for adverse environment and social impacts of activities, and monitoring 
indicators that can be used at the local level by the Gram Panchayats.  These have been prepared, based on 
a review of the experience gained from the implementation of the Integrated Watershed Development 
Project – Hills II (IWDP Hills II) and other similar projects, such as the Doon Valley Project, along with 
good practices based on experience and indigenous knowledge.  These guidelines and monitoring 
indicators would help identify and consider the potential social and environmental impacts of different 
interventions early in the decision making process during the preparation of Village Watershed 
Development Plans (VWDPs).  The laws and acts applicable for the mountain ecosystem in general, and 
the  Uttaranchal region in particular including those pertaining to the tribal and transhumant populations 
have also been integrated into the ESMF. 
 
This would promote the ability of communities to select a 
package of sub-projects and activities that will not only  minimize or mitigate the negative environmental 
and social impacts but also enhance the positive ones.  
 
Pest Management: 
An Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Plan, consistent with GoUA policy and 
Ministry of Environment guidelines has been prepared.  The IPM is consistent with the correlated use of 
land, water, crop, animal, flora, fauna, and other resources. It is linked to ICM (Integrated Crop 
Management) and INM (Integrated Nutrient Management).  IPM has been mainstreamed into the VWDPs.  
All chemicals banned by the Indian Government or notified in the WHO list of hazardous chemicals have 
been removed from the Project’s requirements and recommendations.  The project makes systematic efforts 
to discourage the use of pesticides and encourage the use of IPM and local technologies. 
 
Indigenous People: 
A Tribal and Transhumant strategy has been  prepared to provide special attention for 
benefits that are culturally acceptable to the nomadic and settled lifestyles of the Bhotia and Jaunsari tribes 
respectively.  An emphasis has been provided on protection of their livestock and their rights as per law.  
The process of developing VWDPs also ensures that the needs of the vulnerable groups are integrated. The 
Tribal and Transhumant Strategy provides for specific interventions which are culturally compatible. 
 
Implementation
: Investments to be financed at the community level will be decided by beneficiary 
communities through an intensive participatory process including the application of ESMF. The Gram 
Panchayat watershed development plans will be approved by a general meeting of the Gram Sabha. Once 
approved, the investments will be physically constructed by user groups (sub-committees) and the finances 
and procurement will be managed by the Gram Panchayat.  Based on lessons learned from IWDP (Hills II) 
and other watershed projects in India, there is a high probability of investments being maintained if the 
planning is highly participatory and if implementation, operation and maintenance are controlled by the end 
users.  The project places the responsibility for approval of watershed plans with the Institutions at Local 
Level i.e., Gram Panchayats (GPs). It also places implementation responsibility with them and provides 
them with the financial resources to carry-out their responsibilities. GPs in turn, can delegate some tasks to 
their Statutory Committees or sub-committees. Most of these institutions (except the sub-committees) are 
statutory bodies whose existence is enshrined in legislation and will therefore endure beyond the life of the

(

 in turn will include a core team to s

Page  6
 
 
monitor the environment and social dimensions of the project. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include village communities, Panchayat Raj Institutions (Gram Panchayats, Van 
Panchayats), other village level institutions (Gram Resource Management Associations - GAREMA, Self-
Help Groups - SHG), local NGOs, staff of Watershed Management Directorate and other line agencies.  
Stakeholder Workshops were held during project preparation and will be held during implementation as 
well.  Direct dialogue with different categories of stakeholders has been undertaken at the earliest stage of 
preparation to learn their views and objectives, to understand their assessment of the results of IWDP Hills 
II project in the State, and to assist in aligning the different roles and responsibilities of VPs and GPs.  
Workshops have also involved key project stakeholders in discussions of how to improve the design of the 
project.  During implementation project interventions at the micro-watershed level will be defined by the 
communities themselves through preparation of their micro plans. Special mechanisms will further enhance 
involvement of vulnerable sections of the local population in planning, implementing, and benefiting from 
project interventions. Prior to appraisal, the ESMF, the operational manual, IPM strategy and the Tribal and 
transhumant plan will be disclosed in Hindi and English. A key element of the project is to implement a 
communications strategy that identifies specific audiences and develops targeted  communications 
messages to increase general awareness, participation and enhance transparency.
