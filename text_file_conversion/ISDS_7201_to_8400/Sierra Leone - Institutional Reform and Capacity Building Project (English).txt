A.2. Project Objectives 
The proposed Project Development Objective is to help the post-conflict Government of 
Sierra Leone (GoSL) establish a functioning local government system and improve 
inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability of public resource management at all 
levels of government. 
 
A.3. Project Description  
 
Component 1 Decentralization and Capacity Building
 
This component finances the detailed design and implementation of the government 
Decentralization Program.  
 
Subcomponent 1.1 Strengthen policy and implementation capacity for the 
decentralization program 
The objective of this subcomponent is to build and strengthen the policy advisory and 
strategic management role of the Decentralization Secretariat (MLGCD) and the Local 
Government Finance Department (MoF), so they can jointly lead the implementation of 
the Decentralization Program.  
 
The subcomponent will finance the costs of specialists, equipment and vehicles, technical 
assistance and training for both the Decentralization Secretariat and the Local 
Government Finance Department. It will also provide technical assistance, vehicles, 
equipments, and training to the MLGCD (aside from the Decentralization Secretariat) so 
MLGCD can play an active role in monitoring local councils. 
 
Subcomponent 1.2 Start-up investment in local government administrative infrastructure  
This subcom
p
onent will 
p
rovide some modest start-u
p
 investment in office infrastructure, 
Page  3
 
 
communications equipment, and vehicles to local councils. 
 
Subcomponent 1.3  Capacity building to support decentralization
 
The objective of this subcomponent is to support the Decentralization Secretariat to 
manage an ambitious capacity building program to support decentralization. It will 
finance the costs of development and delivery of training modules as outlined in the 
curriculum, as well as technical assistance provided to beneficiaries in building up skills.  
 
Subcomponent 1.4 Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) 
Ths subcomponent is to finance the LGDG system with the objective of helping local 
councils quickly establish credibility and capacity. The LGDG offers them an incentive 
to adopt a transparent and accountable culture of local governance and an opportunity to 
practice participatory planning, budgeting, financial management, and project 
implementation skills.  
 
Subcomponent 1.5 Monitoring & Evaluation  
This subcomponent will finance four categories of M&E activities: 1) monitoring for due 
diligence purpose, i.e., whether project implementation complies with financial 
management and procurement guidelines and social and environmental safeguard policies 
of the World Bank. This would in particular include regular monitoring and audits of 
local governments; 2) monitoring and evaluating for the purpose of improving the 
effectiveness of capacity building; 3) monitoring and evaluating for the purpose of 
ensuring the sustainability of the fiscal decentralization strategy; evaluating the impact of 
fiscal decentralization on infrastructure development and service delivery; This should 
include evaluation by beneficiaries of the project; and 4) evaluating the social impact of 
decentralization, i.e., whether and to what extent decentralization improves social 
cohesion and empowers marginalized groups in local decision-making process. 
 
Component 2 Public Financial Management Reform 
The objective of this component is to support the implementation of a PFM reform 
program. 
 
Subcomponent 2.1 Improve the legal and regulatory framework for public financial management 
The objective of this subcomponent is to establish the core policy advisory and 
implementation capacity for the PFM reform program. It will finance the establishment 
of the PFM Implementation Unit. 
 
Subcomponent 2.2 IFMIS 
The objective of this subcomponent is to implement a new Integrated Financial 
Management Information System (IFMIS), which is able to meet the control and 
information requirements of the decentralized system of financial management. This 
subcomponent will finance the design and acquisition of a new Integrated Financial 
Management Information System (IFMIS), initially to be set-up in MoF to replace the 
current FMAS and then be transformed to support the more decentralized financial 
control and accounting system. It will also finance the staffing cost of the IFMIS 
implementation team, technical assistance and consultancies, equipment and vehicles, 
and intensive trainin
g
 for stakeholders. The com
p
onent will also include the initiation of 
Page  4
 
 
training of line ministries to prepare them for their new responsibilities and the new 
IFMIS. 
 
Subcomponent 2.3 Design and support implementation of interim financial management 
systems for newly elected local governments
 
This subcomponent will finance the development and implementation of an interim Local 
Government financial management system and intensive training for local government 
financial management staff.  
 
The local government FM system will at the beginning be implemented on an manual 
basis. The project will later finance the acquisition and implementation of a small 
standard accounting package for local governments. The experience of using this simple 
computerized system will prepare local governments for operating the IFMIS, when it is 
rolled out to local councils after 2008. 
 
Subcomponent 2.4 Strengthen the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) 
The objective of this subcomponent is to strengthen the MTEF process. It will finance 
technical assistance on how to improve the Cabinet policy process, strengthen the linkage 
between policy objectives and budget proposals, and use the MTEF process as a key 
driver to reward performance of budget entities as well as the vote controllers. This 
subcomponent will also finance intensive training for stakeholders on the MTEF process 
and program budgeting.  
 
Subcomponent 2.5 Procurement reform 
The objective of this subcomponent is to finance the implementation of a new legislative 
and regulatory framework for procurement, which is currently being developed by the 
Steering Committee for Procurement Reform. This subcomponent will finance technical 
assistance, some logistical support, and intensive training to procurement oversight 
institutions, tender boards, and procurement staff. It will also finance a massive 
sensitization program to disseminate the new policy and law and promote transparency 
and accountability of procurement, training of procurement staff on the new regulations, 
annual public procurement forums for all stakeholders, and production of annual public 
procurement reports for public information. The project will also finance, as the case may 
be, an action plan to be developed by the CPAR-IP as described in Annex 8, 
Procurement management.
 
 
Subcomponent 2.6 Monitoring & Evaluation 
The Bank has conducted a HIPC Assessment in January 2004. Using sixteen modest 
benchmarks common for all HIPCs, the assessment has provided the baseline data on the 
quality of government expenditure management system for the purpose of tracking 
poverty-reducing expenditures. In addition, a participatory workshop was conducted in 
Feb 2004 for stakeholders to further assess the quality of the government expenditure 
management system using a set of standard PFM assessment indicators developed by the 
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Secretariat of the World Bank. 
The consolidated assessment results and an action plan to improve high-priority areas 
formed the basis of this PFM com
p
onent of IRCBP. Re
g
ular re-assessment of the 
Page  5
 
 
indicators will be conducted annually so as to evaluate the impact of PFM reform 
initiatives.  
 
Component 3. Development Learning Center 
The objective of this component is to establish an excellent information, 
communications, and training center to meet the demand for capacity building which 
cannot be satisfied through traditional means and existing institutions. This component 
will finance the establishment of a Development Learning Center, combining a Global 
Development Learning Network (GDLN) site and a Development Information Center.  
 
Subcomponent 3.1 Establishment of the DLC 
• 
Construction of the DLC facility with a videoconference room with 30-person 
capacity; a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software 
and Internet hook-up); a Public Information Center; one or two classrooms for 
training; a technical and administrative center; and electrical and telephone 
installations.  
• 
Purchase and installation of equipment: a small aperture terminal (VSAT – 
satellite communication terminal); video, telecommunications, and 
microprocessor equipment; office and classroom furniture; various other 
equipment for operations and security. 
• 
Establishment of the DLC and staffing: legal establishment of the DLC as a self-
supporting and autonomous entity; formal notification regarding the site allocated 
to the DLC; recruitment of the Director and other key staff. 
 
Subcomponent 3.2 Support the operation of the DLC 
The objective of this subcomponent is to assist the DLC begin operation and become 
financially viable in three years. It includes: 
• 
financing of operational costs on a decreasing basis over the first three years of 
DLC operation; 
• 
purchase of a light vehicle to facilitate transport and marketing services;  
• 
technical assistance and staff training;  
• 
the establishment of financial management systems and annual audits. 
 
Subcomponent 3.3
 
Monitoring and Evaluation
 
The objective of this subcomponent is to constantly monitor the DLC operation, draw 
lessons, and improve on DLC operations. The overall Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) 
component should be carried out by the DLC Board.  
 
Component 4 IRCBP Coordination 
The objective of this component is to ensure that IRCBP implementation complies with 
the World Bank Financial Management Guidelines and the Procurement Guidelines, and 
to ensure effective coordination of the first three project components, which will be 
implemented by MLGCD, MoF, and DLC (or the ESO, before DLC is legally established 
as an independent entity), respectively.  
 
Specifically, this component will finance  
• 
an IRCBP Coordinator to be res
p
onsible for the overall coordination of the 
Page  6
 
 
IRCBP implementation;  
• 
a Chartered Accountant as the Principle Finance Officer for the IRCBP 
Coordinating Unit and be responsible for financial management of the IRCBP;a 
Procurement Specialist, to be responsible for ensuring that all procurement under 
the IRCBP comply with the World Bank procurement guidelines;  
• 
a Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, to be responsible for setting up and 
maintaining an M&E system for the IRCBP;

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
No large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are anticipated under the proposed 
project. 
 
Two components involve investments, the Development Learning Center (DLC) component, and the 
Decentralization Component (office buildings, and investment financed by the Local Government 
Development Grant (LGDG)). The project does not envisage displacing any settler within the locations 
chosen for the establishment of a Development Learning Center, the office buildings for local councils, or 
the investment sites financed under the LGDG. Availability of land without any form of encumbrances is 
one of the prerequisites for project site selection and implementation. 
 
Infrastructure investments under the LGDG may have some environmental impact, which 
is unlikely to be significant and is readily manageable. The investments under this 
component fall under various sectors such as water supply, drainage, sanitation, solid 
waste management, access roads, construction of schools and health facilities; but the 
exact nature of the investments cannot be foreseen at this time, as they will only be 
identified and managed by local governments through a participatory planning and 
budgeting process during project execution. The potential environmental and social 
effects of these common community development projects, however, are well 
understood, unlikely to be significant, and readily manageable.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Government has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in accordance to OP 4.12 and has 
received ASPEN approval for the RPF. The RPF has established the resettlement and compensation 
principles, organizational arrangements and design criteria to be applied to meet the needs of the people 
who may be affected by the project activities requiring land acquisition and/or denial, restriction or loss of 
access to economic resources. If land taking is necessary for a sub-project, then a resettlement plan will be 
prepared and presented for ASPEN approval.  
 
Government has also prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) and has received ASPEN approval. The ESMF has  
• 
develo
p
ed an environmental checklist for sub-
p
ro
j
ects, so as to assist local 
Page  8
 
 
governments to carry out environmental appraisal of investments they make; 
• 
prescribed a set of mitigation and monitoring measures during implementation 
and operation of the subprojects to eliminate adverse environmental and social 
impacts, offset them or reduce them to acceptable levels; 
• 
established a screening process for sub-projects so as to enable local government 
staff to identify potential environmental and social impacts of sub-projects and to 
address them by incorporating the relevant mitigation measures into the designs 
of the sub-projects.  
 
Local governments will be required to apply the environmental checklists for appraising 
their investments and comply with relevant mitigation measures. In addition, routine 
checks will be made to ensure that individual investments also conform to nationally 
applicable environmental standards. 
 
The borrower capacity in this area is weak. Under the project, an environmental and 
resettlement training module will be developed as part of the standardized training 
module for local governments.  
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include local councils, local communities, and the National 
Environment Protection Board. All sub-projects financed under the proposed projects 
will be identified through a participatory planning mechanism implemented by the newly 
elected local councils. A screening mechanism designed in the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework will be applied to identify potential environmental and social 
impact. Mitigating measures will be applied if negative impact is identified.  
 
The Resettlement Policy Framework and the Environmental and Social Management 
Framework have been disclosed by Government. When the local councils are elected, 
they will receive training on how to apply the framework. They will also make public the 
screening mechanism and the mitigation measures.
