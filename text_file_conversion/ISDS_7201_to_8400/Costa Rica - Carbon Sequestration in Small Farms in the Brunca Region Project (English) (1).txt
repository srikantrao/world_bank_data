I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The project will support reforestation and agroforestry activities in 4,140 ha, with the participation of 600
farmers associated to COOPEAGRI. Farmers will introduce forestry production activities in their farms,
through the Payment for Environmental Services (PSA) program that is implemented by FONAFIFO in
Costa Rica and that is partially funded by a World Bank/GEF project.

The estimated total sequestration would equal 690,760 t C02e by 2017 (including 454,046 t C02e, or 66%,
by 2012).

As with all BioCF projects, this project represents a unique opportunity to simultaneously promote the
objectives of the United Nations         Conventions on Climate Change, Biological Diversity,             and
Desertification; to improve rural livelihoods; and to contribute to the sustainable development objectives of
Costa Rica.

As indicated above the project would be implemented in the framework of the Bank's current and future
operations in Costa Rica. Through the COOPEAGRI Project FONAFIFO proposes to expand the scope of
the current PSA program in a specific area of the country.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
As indicated above the project will support the introduction of forestry activities. COOPEAGRI is a
cooperative that groups 10,162 farmers that are presently dedicated to agriculture activities, such as, coffee.
sugarcane, and cattle. In a period of three years, 180,000 trees will be planted in agroforestry systems,
1,200 ha will be dedicated to reforestation through natural regeneration, and 2,490 ha to commercial
reforestation, 50% with native species.

Costa Rica, is presently implementing a Program of Payments for Environmental Services (PSA). Through
the implementation of the PSA program FONAFIFO has developed technical and administrative capacity
to promote reforestation projects in the country. Through the COOPEAGRI Project FONAFIFO proposes
to expand the scope of the PSA program in a specific area of the country. FONAFIFO will pay to the
farmers the environmental services of biodiversity protection, protection of water resources and scenic
beauty generated by the reforestation activities, and these payments will be complemented with the
additional incomes coming from the carbon sales. The additional incomes from carbon sales will allow
FONAFIFO: (i) to create a new PSA modality: reforestation of degraded lands through human induced
promotion ofnatural seed sources (natural regeneration), and (ii) to improve the cash flow pattern typical of
reforestation activities, to make it appropriate for small and medium land owners needs.

The carbon purchase funds from the BioCarbon Fund would be spread over a period of 7 years. It is
expected that the Bank's supervision responsibilities will be very limited, as no Bank funds per se flow to
the project, and that this responsibility would not exceed 7 years.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Thc project is situated inthe inthe southwest of Costa Rica. The nearest city is San Isidro de Pcrez Zclcd6n. Project
boundary isthe administrative limits of the Perez Zeled6n County, which belongs to the San Jose Province, Costa Rica.
(see map I inannex 4 ofthe CFD).

A Bank mission in March 2005 met with project sponsors                        of the Cooperative       Corporation
(COOPERAGRI) based in San Isidro and the Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento                 Forestal (FONAFIFO)
based in San Jose with whom technical discussions and field visits to potential       sites were made in the area
of Perez Zeled6n county.        Coimmunity members associated with Coopeagri expressed strong interest            in
supporting the project.


E. SafeguardsClassification(select one). Category is determined by the highest      impact in any policy. Or on basis
ofcumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggeredthe provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts;  or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects          are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
    S3. - No safeguard issues
     SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development        funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach                to address safeguard
issues.
