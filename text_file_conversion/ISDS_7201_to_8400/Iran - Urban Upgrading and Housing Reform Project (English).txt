I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The key development objectives of the Project (APL1) are to: (i) improve the living conditions in
under-serviced neighborhoods in up to five provincial capital cities, and (ii) prepare the systems,
capacity and regulatory foundation, and initiate market based housing sector reforms. To ensure
that investments in upgrading are of high priority to their ultimate beneficiaries, municipalities are
expected to undertake a strategic planning process with significant community participation.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The Project objectives will be achieved through three main components: (i) urban upgrading and
community enabling programs in up to 5 selected cities; (ii) technical assistance for housing sector
reforms; and (iii) technical assistance and capacity building for Project implementation.

Component A ­ Urban Upgrading (US$ 89.62 million)
This Component lays the foundation for launching a sustainable country-wide urban upgrading
program through the implementation of the following sub-components:

     A-1: Design and supervision of upgrading programs in APL1 cities;
    A-2: Implementation of upgrading programs in APL1 cities;
    A-3: Design of upgrading programs for APL2 cities;
    A-4: Design of financing arrangements for upgrading under APL2 and APL3.

Component B ­ Housing Reforms (US$ 3.0 million)
Component-B aims at enhancing housing affordability and efficiency of the housing sector in Iran
in the long term. It will consist of foreign and local technical assistance, training and equipment
for implementing the specific priority actions in reforming the housing sector as outlined in the
Housing Sector Strategy and the ensuing Action Plan:

                                                        2
                                                                                                          ISDS




     B-1: Housing and land management;
     B-2: Housing finance;
     B-3: Housing subsidies;
     B-4: Housing information.

Component C ­ Project Management (US$ 2.0 million)
This Component will finance: (i) the cost of office and ICT equipment required for Project
management and implementation; and (ii) technical assistance for Project management and
implementation, including hiring of individual consultants and consulting firms in areas of Project
management, financial management and procurement, Project monitoring and evaluation including
the documentation of the Project experience and study tours, training to key policy-makers and
others.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Among the potential target cities in the APL1 of the Program are the cities of Zahedan,
Kermenshah and Bandar­Abbas. The Bank team visited the city of Zahedan which is located close
to the far-eastern border shared with Pakistan and Afghanistan. It has more than twenty years of
incoming migration from Afghanistan that have settled in peri-urban areas.                       Community
participation has become the norm and communities have taken various initiatives for upgrading
and socioeconomic development. APL1 is not expected to have any adverse environmental
impacts. Rather it will address infrastructure deficiency in a socially and economically sustainable
manner.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The project has been classified as Category B as per the Bank's Operational Policy 4.01,
Annex C on Environmental Assessment, indicating that there are reversible environmental issues that
can be mitigated. The Project would support environmental and health improvements through
rehabilitation and improvements in roads, drainage, street lighting, schools, clinics, community
centers, water supply and sanitation systems in poor urban settlements. Specific subprojects will
only be defined during the course of the Program. Although the UUHRP is expected to bring
significant environmental and health benefits and no major environmental issues are anticipated,
certain subprojects to be funded under the Project may require special mitigation measures to protect
the environment and enhance health safety.


Component A of the Project deals with the upgrading of dilapidated urban areas and could
potentially have some environmental impacts, particularly for the subprojects dealing with water
supply, wastewater, drainage and roads. In order to mitigate these risks, an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was developed during project preparation.                      In addition, a set of
environmental guidelines for appraising the environmental impacts of any proposed subproject
were prepared as part of the Environmental Guidelines Manual (EGM). The EMP for the Project

                                                        3
                                                                                                       ISDS


was prepared in consultation with the department of Environment (DOE) and the Ministry of
Housing and Urban Development (MHUD) and was disclosed in the country and the Bank's
InfoShop on October 20, 2003.

A number of candidate cities are being considered for inclusion in the APL1 and all proposed
future investment programs and implementation procedures under this project were subjected to
environmental screening in conformity with the EMP and the EGM. Based on the desk screening
conducted by a Bank consultant on potential projects, it was concluded that no irreversible
impacts could arise from these projects. However, the environmental safeguards will be
incorporated in the various program phases. For each investment program presented under the
UUHRP, environmental screening and assessment will be conducted in conformity with the
environmental guidelines manual.           Also, during the first year, environmental screening and
assessment will be part of the Bank's approvals for funding a program. During the second year, an
evaluation of national capacities for approving environmental assessment will be conducted and a
decision on the set up to be followed will be taken.

Both APL2 and APL3 may include investments with more significant environmental impacts,
therefore, the environmental category and requirements will be re-assessed during the appraisal of
both subsequent phases.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

No expropriation of private land or displacement of individuals are expected during the Project.
However, because the Program will involve large-scale construction in several cities during APL2 and
APL3, some expropriation of private land or displacement of individuals or economic activities may
occur. As a result, OP 4. 12 on involuntary resettlement will apply. A Resettlement Policy Framework

                                                       4
                                                                                                          ISDS


(RPF) has been prepared and will serve as a guide for the preparation of any Resettlement Action Plans
or Land acquisition Plans when needed.

To mitigate against potential negative impacts from the APL1 investments, an EMP and an EGM
were prepared in compliance with the World Bank guidelines, as set forth in OP 4.01.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No potential cumulative impacts are anticipated in Phase I.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Long-term impacts are more positive than negative. APL's phasing approach will allow the
Project to deal with physical investments and the policy and regulatory reforms in an integrated
manner. In addition, the Project will facilitate institutionalization of partnership between
municipalities and communities for upgrading and local economic development. This
comprehensive approach will enhance improvement in the living conditions of the target cities and
will serve as a socially and economically sustainable model for upgrading to be used on a national
scale.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N.A.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The EGM describes how sub-projects shall be evaluated to ensure that environmental and social
safeguards are enforced and World Bank policies are complied with. If a sub-project is found to
include substantial environmental impacts it provides further procedures for addressing them or
altering the design of the sub-project.

During the first year, environmental screening and assessment will be reviewed by the Project
Team on a no-objection basis. During the second year, an evaluation of national capacities for
approving environmental assessment will be carried out and a decision on the further set up will
be taken. The environmental category and requirements for APL2 and APL3 will be re-assessed
during the appraisal of both subsequent phases.

Sub-projects involving resettlement and squatter displacement will not be eligible for funding
under the APL1. Any resettlement required in APL2 and/or APL 3 will follow the RPF and
guidelines for the preparation of resettlement action plans developed during preparation.
Appropriate measures for squatter compensation have been agreed upon with the Borrower and
are included in the RPF.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The key stakeholders are the ultimate beneficiaries: urban residents who have substandard housing
and infrastructure, and those who lack security of tenure and access to housing finance. Other
important local stakeholders are municipal councils who often lack organizational capacities and

                                                      5
                                                                                                           ISDS


sufficient resources. A participatory approach to stakeholder consultations will help to bridge the
potential gap between popular expectations of newly elected representative bodies, and the ability
of these bodies to deliver. At the national level, key stakeholders are Ministry of Interior,
Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, Management and Planning Organization, Central
Bank of Iran and other relevant agencies under these ministries and institutions. In addition, the
recently convened presidential committee on informal settlements has a strong mandate to
develop a policy and programs for the informal settlements. However, the committee still lacks
experience and the detailed knowledge to effectively fulfill its tasks. A plan for consultation of
various stakeholders is being developed and tested in three of the participating cities of the
Projects and will be generalized countrywide.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
         management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
         projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
         issues.
