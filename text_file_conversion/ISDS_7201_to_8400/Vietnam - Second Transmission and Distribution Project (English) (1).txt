B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objectives of the project are: 
• 
To alleviate power shortages and improve the quality of power supplies by improving 
transmission and distribution network capacity; 
• 
Raise transmission and dispatch efficiency and improve power system reliability, and  
• 
Promote and support the reform and restructuring of the electricity sector. 
 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
EVN’s transmission and distribution systems have grown very rapidly over the last 10 years 
barely keeping up with electricity demand growing at about 15 % annually. New investments are 
being made by EVN, with support from JBIC ($ 60 m) to strengthen and stabilize the 500 kV 
system between Hanoi to Ho Chi Min city.  Other transmission investments are proposed by 
Belgium ($12 m), and NIB ($ 24m). Ongoing studies by ADB

additional financing ($160m) for reinforcement of the transmission network and to address the 
limitations of the existing LDC and SCADA systems.   
 
Investments under the proposed IDA T&D2 Credit for 2005, to complement investments in 
transmission by other international financing agencies are planned to: (i) reinforce, extend and 
improve system security of existing regional 500/220 kV transmission and 110kV sub-
transmission networks including further extension of the NLDC communications and regional 
SCADA systems to support the development of a power market; (ii) improve reliability and 
quality of supplies to PC1, 2 and 3 consumers; and (iii) install commercial metering at 
transmission interfaces, along with a centralised meter management systems for monitoring and 
settling generation and distribution power market transactions. The proposed IDA Credit would 
also be used for funding Technical Assistance to (iv) assist in the restructuring of EVN, 
particularly targeted at the creation of a single transmission operator and single buyer

Component 1: Transmission and distribution expansion and reinforcement 
 
This component will support investments to alleviate power shortages, and improve system 
reliability and efficiency by upgrading and modernizing the transmission and distribution system.  
For the transmission system, investments are planned in the 500kV, 220kV and 110kV levels.  
At the 500kV level, lines will be built to enable the evacuation of power from the planned major 
generation centers at O Mon in the South and at Quan Ninh in the north  Substation 
reinforcements will be made at 500 kV and 220 kV levels to meet increased demand in Ho Chi 
Minh city and at the new oil refinery at Dung Quat (just south of Da Nang).  Additional 
measures will also be taken to strengthen transmission system control, protection and reactive 
capability so as to improve the quality and stability of the bulk power system   
 
At the 110kV level, about 350-400km of lines will be built to improve capacity, remove 
bottlenecks and meet growing demand from smaller load centers.
The project also includes 
provisions for reinforcements proposed by PC1) to upgrade 6kV systems in 5 towns; PC2 to 
upgrade 31 110 kV substations; and PC3 upgrade 8 110 kV substations and to extend and 
strengthen six 22 kV networks. In order of priority some of this work may have to forgone to 
focus on critical transmission reinforcement investments.

Component 2: System metering and dispatch system strengthening 
 
The component will position the electricity sector for commercial operation, interconnection and 
reform over the longer term.  It will mainly be focused on the future transmission company and 
will provide the physical investments needed to: (i) enable fully commercial relations to be 
established with generation and distribution companies; (ii) expand the capability of the dispatch 
functions to facilitate the future operation of a power market; and (iii) prepare for 
interconnection with other countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion.  A feature of this 
component will be the installation of time-of-use energy meters at the interfaces between the 
generation and transmission network and between the transmission and distribution companies.  
 
EVN has requested about $30 million to upgrade the capability of the existing NLDC and 
Regional SCADA/ dispatch facilities and to extend their capability to provide for the additional 
functions required in the proposed power market. This will include commercial metering 
facilities at designated transmission interfaces with generation, distribution companies and 
directly connected industries. These are required to facilitate the development of an independent 
meter management and financial settlement systems tracking the financial transactions between 
the market participants 
 
Component 3: Technical assistance, capacity building and training 
 
This component will enable EVN, and in particular the transmission and distribution 
company(ies), to manage the transition to fuller commercial operation.  In accordance with the 
Road Map for Power Sector Reform, technical assistance will be provided for studies relating to 
commercialization including developing optimal dispatch strategies, transmission system pricing, 
contractual arrangements, and on the best way to set up financial settlements. In addition a 
review of the staffing implications of reform will be carried out. EVN's management capacity 
will be strengthened, particularly financial and technical, to improve their ability to dispatch 
generation plant based on economic criteria and to establish a financial settlements unit. Training 
in dispatch operations and accounting for dispatch center, transmission and distribution staff will 
be provided, in support of the hardware investments.. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
There are a number of locations of the investments in the high voltage including Doc Soi in the 
center of the country, a new transmission line from Quang Ninh to Soc Son in the North of the 
country, and in the South a number of reinforcements including a new transmission line from O 
Mon to Nha Be. In addition, there are a number of planned investments in the distribution system 
throughout the country, primarily substation reinforcements. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
EVN has implemented a number of Bank credits (TD 1, SEIER, RE 1), and is familiar and 
experienced with the Bank’s guidelines regarding the preparation of RAPs, EIAs, EMPs, and 
EMDPs, as well as mitigating environmental and social impacts as they may arise.
