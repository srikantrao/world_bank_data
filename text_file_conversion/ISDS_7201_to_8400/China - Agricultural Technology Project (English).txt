B.  Project Objective 
 
The objective of the project is to raise rural incomes in selected areas in China by supporting 
restructuring and modernizing agricultural production, processing and marketing through viable 
models featured by a high science and technology content, and sustainable and efficient natural 
resource use. Specifically the project will: 1) strengthen the management of agricultural 
resources particularly in resource constraint areas, 2) improve the efficiency and speed of 
transfer of agricultural technologies, 3) support the emergence, inclusiveness and sustainability 
of new institutional arrangements and 4) make research and technology development more 
demand oriented. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project is designed to pilot novel approaches for setting enabling environments for 
agricultural technology development and transfer, as well as for creating partnerships between 
technology generating institutions, private sector industrial/marketing concerns and small 
farmers for the purpose of increasing rural incomes. The project would include the following 
components: 
 
Page  2
Component 1.
Technology transfer and information markets and services (US$ 16.6 million) 
Financing for this component would include the building of a set of large scale technology 
transfer markets in or near the Yangling Development Zone to be used for exhibition and/or 
trade of agricultural technologies and information. 
 
Component 2.
Promotion of Commercially Attractive Key Technologies and new institutional 
arrangements (US$182.2 million)    
 
a.
 
Researcher-Investor-Farmer Technologies (US$154.7 million), 
which would involve the partial financing of typical tripartite joint ventures with 
the objective of designing successful investment models in which researcher-
investor-farmer partnerships are tested 
 
b. 
Targeted Technology Transfer (US$1.3 million), 
which would finance technology transfers targeting farmer groups who do not 
have adequate access to information, capital or decision making power to enable 
them to adopt technologies on their own. 
 
c. 
Public Sector Support Programs (US$4.5 million) 
This component is dedicated to: a) financing activities that enable the private 
sector to realize its role in commercializing innovative technologies; and b) 
directing public funds to technologies that do not appeal to the private sector on 
commercial grounds, but have a clear public goods nature.  
 
d. 
Innovation Support Fund (US$21.7 million) 
This fund would be available for supporting a second round of proposals under 
the sub-components 2a) and 2b) above. Fund would be allocated on a competitive 
basis with a fixed share going to farmer groups and organizations. 
 
Component 3
.
Capacity Building, Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$8.1 
million) 
Under this component, the Project would finance a range of capacity building and training 
activities at all levels including improved policy support, the provision of vehicles and 
equipment, as well as detailed M&E activities. In addition, the project would pilot several 
insurance schemes for farmer owned assets (e.g. livestock) 
 
D.  Project location 
(Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social 
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected 
areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
 
The project will be located in the Yangling Agricultural High-tech Industries Demonstration 
Zone, -
 China’s only nationally level agricultural high-tech development zone located some 
80km West of Xian in Shaanxi Province, and in the three provinces of Heilongjiang, Hunan, and 
Anhui. 
 
Page  3
Most of the project investment such as construction of technology markets and exhibition 
centers, agricultural processing facilities, or agricultural machinery or input supply facilities will 
be in the vicinity of major towns or cities within the industrial or commercial development areas 
of those towns or cities. The farm outreach (e.g. development of high quality production, 
production of agricultural raw material) will be on existing agricultural land. No new or 
additional non-agricultural land will be reclaimed for production purpose.  While the project is 
intended to address new income opportunities for the entire farming community, some 
components are specifically designed to reach poorer farmers, women or other disadvantaged 
segments of the farming population. The project activities are not located to negatively affect 
minority groups, protected areas or culturally or socially sensitive areas.          
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
[Guideline: Refer to Section 5 of PCN]
 
The borrower and in particular the State Office of Comprehensive Agricultural Development 
(SOCAD), which is the responsible office, has extensive experiences with Bank projects and the 
applicable safeguard policies in such projects. Its institutional capacity is adequate.

Pest Management (
OP 4.09
)
Several proposals if maintained under the project might contain the use of 
pesticides (e.g. the large scale plantation of triploid poplar, or greenhouse 
plantation other than organic production). Such proposals would require the 
preparation and implementation of Pest Management Plans with adequate 
mitigation measures. This has been included in the EIA.

While no major resettlement is expected, a small number of people could be 
negatively affected by proposals, which require acquisition of land or other 
permanent or temporary impacts during construction (e.g. construction of 
technology markets, technology research and demonstration facilities etc.). A 
resettlement policy framework has been prepared.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN] 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
The borrower has been well informed about the Bank’s safeguard policies. The borrower agreed 
to make the environmental and social assessment integrated elements in the design of the project.    
 
Environmental Assessment: The project demonstrates technology transfer mechanisms and new 
organizational ways of farmer-company relationships and will be selective in the types of 
production and processing technologies. Environmentally harmful technologies and proposals 
with potentially environmentally harmful effects will be excluded. Several project components 
would have a clear positive impact, such as the production and propagation of organic 
vegetables, the Integrated Pest Management, or the Organic Food Production Advisory and 
Certification Service component. However, good practice for environmental protection needs to 
be applied
 
in all components (for example high standard water treatment facilities for the agro-
processing plants, safety measures and pollution control during construction, etc.).  The borrower 
also agreed that the responsible Environmental Protection Bureaus would check and approve 
each of the individual feasibility studies and propose environmental mitigation measures in case 
of any negative impact.      
 
At the current stage of project preparation the selection of individual project investment 
proposals is not concluded. The EA has designed adequate mechanisms for appropriate 
environmental screening of those not yet identified proposals. Investments involving GMO 
technology would be excluded from the project. Some of the project proposals include the 
production and processing of medicinal herbs or other plants for the pharmaceutical or other 
chemical industry. All of the presented proposals aim for contractual arrangements with farmers 
to cultivate the plants on existing agricultural land.  The companies involved agreed that they 
would prepare and implement action plans to completely move their raw material supply away 
from collection towards cultivation of medicinal herbs and other plants. Adherence to the 
commitment using only cultivated products would be monitored. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement: No major resettlement is expected to become necessary under the 
project. However, a small number of people could be negatively affected by proposals, which 
require acquisition of land or other permanent or temporary impacts during construction. The 
borrower agreed that the Bank’s policy for compensation of project-affected people would be 
followed and all project-affected persons would be adequately compensated. A Policy 
Framework for Compensation, Resettlement and Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons has 
been prepared and agreed. 
 
Social Assessment: Four focus areas for the social assessment work have been identified: i) the 
interaction of farmers and companies in the outreach models, ii) the participation of women and 
how women could meaningfully be involved in technology transfer mechanisms, iii) targeting of 
poor farmers (and minority nationalities), and iv) the effectiveness of exhibition centers and 
technology markets with an emphasis on what social groups are reached by these facilities. 
Page  6
During fall 2002 an assessment was made of the efficacy of the Yangling Annual Technology 
and Information Market Fair in promoting technology transfer to farmers and recommendations 
made for improving the process. The main objectives of this first phase social assessment were 
to: a) describe the nature of farmer interactions with local companies and Demonstration Zone 
personnel during the fair, b) analyze the strengths and weaknesses of such interactions for 
facilitating the transfer of agricultural technologies, and c) formulate draft suggestions for 
improving such interactions both during future fairs and throughout the year.  
During the summer of 2003, a full Social Assessment (SA) on all current project proposals was 
conducted by a team from Zhongshan University. The Social Assessment work revealed that the 
companies were most concerned about farmer non-delivery of contract-promised produce or 
other items, while farmers were suspicious of the promises of companies to buy their goods at 
fair prices. The need for both a grievance procedure and the good offices of the local government 
as an honest broker between the parties was highlighted, as was the need to support and raise the 
capacity of locally-
generated farmers’ associations.  
 
Indigenous Populations, OD 4.20.  The task team noted that given the presence of significant 
minority nationality populations in at least two of the project counties, as documented in the SA 
Report for both Heilongjiang and Hunan that the Bank’s Safeguard policy on Indigenous 
Populations, OD 4.20, would be invoked for this project. Accordingly, multi-ethnic group 
development plans have been prepared by the PMOs in Heilongjiang and Hunan according to the 
requirements of the Bank’s OD 4.20.  
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
The Social Assessment team consisting of four groups of four researchers met with provincial 
and local officials as well as company representatives and local farmers. Through the collection 
and review of local district and project documents, focus groups with company staff and farmers, 
case studies, and various Participatory Rapid Appraisal approaches, the SA team analyzed the 
potential sub-projects from the perspectives of the various stakeholders, noting their concerns 
and aspirations. The SA team’s work laid the foundation for a “Farmer Beneficiaries 
Participation Framework (FBPF)” for each component which outlines how the farmers would 
participate meaningfully in project design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation under 
each of the project components. The Frameworks will need to be revised and updated as the 
project continues to evolve. 
Participatory monitoring would be used as a tool to provide direct feed-back the interaction of 
farmers and companies in the outreach models.   
The All-China Women Federation would have members in the Project Leading Groups to ensure 
adequate integration and monitoring of gender issues in the project. 
 
Disclosure of project information will be ensured during project preparation in accordance with 
Bank guidelines and policies.
