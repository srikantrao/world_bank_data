B.  Project Objectives 
 
The proposed program aims to strengthen the GTL’s capacity in planning and financial 
management 
in the MPF and financial management functions in line ministries and districts. In 
so doing, it aims to s
upport the GTL’s capacity to use public resources as effectively, efficiently 
and transparently as possible to support service delivery for poverty reduction. To achieve this 
goal, it will target staff at all levels from high and mid-level management to mid-level civil 
service staff. The ultimate goal of the project is to achieve a much higher level of autonomy of 
Timor-Leste’s Government in PFM without endangering current levels of accountability.  
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The proposed program aims to str
engthen the GTL’s capacity in planning and financial 
management 
in the Ministry of Planning and Finance and financial management functions in 
line ministries and districts. In so doing, it aims to support the GTL’s capacity to use public 
resources as effectively, efficiently and transparently as possible to support service delivery for 
poverty reduction. In addition, the program will also include the medium-term training programs 
in priority cross-cutting areas.

The program’s design will reflect the GTL’s overarching goals for the public financial 
management system
,
as defined during an inter-ministerial workshop: (i) a 
strategic approach 
to planning and budgeting in support of the country’s poverty-reduction strategy; (ii) 
realism
 
and sustainability of plans and budgets; (iii) 
efficiency and effectiveness 
in providing value-for-
money and supporting service delivery; (iv) 
participation
,
through which relevant stakeholders 
are involved in decision-making; (v) 
transparency
,
both internal within the Government and 
external to the public, with information available in readable and useable formats; (vi) 
accountability
,
including strong systems for control, monitoring, reporting and auditing; and 
(vii) 
evidence-based decision-making
,
where adequate information is produced and used for 
expenditure policy and management purposes. 
 
Proper monitoring will be crucial to ensuring that the program achieves its intended 
objectives
.
It is proposed that the program monitoring framework encompass inputs (amount 
disbursed) and outputs (capacity development activities delivered, information management 
systems installed, etc.), as well as capacity development outcomes and public finance 
management intermediate and final performance outcomes.   
 
D.  Project location 
 
Project activities will take place mostly in Dili and some overseas training are envisaged and 
location will be determined at appraisal.
