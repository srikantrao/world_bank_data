B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The project objectives are to support the efforts of the Government of the Maldives to carry out a 
program of rehabilitation and reconstruction related to the damages caused by the tsunami of 26 
December 2004. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
This operation will be implemented over a period of three years, with much of the work expected 
to be completed during the first year. IDA support will be routed through the tsunami Relief and 
Rehabilitation Fund (TRRF) established under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury 
with the purpose to assure transparency in the use of funds. The operation will have the 
following components: 
Page  2
Component 1: Restoration of livelihoods 
consists of (a) safety net cash transfers to the affected 
for their subsistence needs, and (b) a program to restore lost or damaged assets of affected 
enterprises.  
 
·
Sub-Component a: Safety net cash grants to households affected by the tsunami 
(US$5.6 
million from the IDA grant). The Government has begun providing one-time cash grants to 
families seriously affected by the tsunami. Under this program, the Government has started 
distributing Rf.1,500 (US$117) per capita to families whose houses were completely 
destroyed; Rf.1,000 per capita to families whose houses were partially damaged; and Rf.500 
per capita to families whose houses are intact but household items swept away. This amount 
is intended to help affected families cover immediate expenses on food and household 
essentials. The Government is also preparing a follow-up safety net program targeting the 
poorest and most vulnerable among the affected population; this new program would provide 
a
small monthly cash payment for a limited period of 10 months to poor and heavily affected 
families. The purpose of limiting the period and narrowly defining the target groups is to 
avoid developing a dependency syndrome.  
 
·
Sub-Component b: Restoration of Livelihoods Program (RLP) 
(US$3.0 million).
 
The 
government has decided on a policy of urgent support for livelihood restoration, the 
Restoration of Livelihoods Program. This program would provide sub-grants for restoration 
of assets (e.g. fishing vessels, fishing gear, fish processing equipment, agricultural tools, and 
other). The RLP is targeted to micro and small scale enterprises in the affected islands who 
lost or suffered damages to their income generating assets. The support under this program 
will help these enterprises restart their businesses, and thereby kick start economic recovery 
and employment at the local level. The eligibility criteria for assistance under this program 
cover enterprises whose assets were damaged or lost from the tsunami, and which were not 
insured.  
 
Component 2: Increase school capacity on islands receiving the population displaced by the 
tsunami 
(US$5.0 million from the IDA Credit). The tsunami has made at least seven islands 
uninhabitable. The population displaced from these seven islands needs to be resettled 
immediately. The receiving islands will need additional schools and facilities to accommodate 
the increasing student population. Temporary classrooms erected to accommodate the students 
will need to be converted into permanent classrooms. Moreover, certain islands including Lamu 
Gan are expected to receive a substantial population increase and at least one entirely new school 
will be needed here. The proposed assistance will finance additional permanent classrooms and 
the new school. The component will be implemented by the line Ministry.  
 
Component 3: Technical skills for implementing the Post-tsunami reconstruction program 
($0.4 million). The post-tsunami reconstruction program currently under planning will add 
considerably to the normal workload of all levels of government. Since this increase in work load 
is temporary, it does not justify additional permanent staff. This component will temporarily 
increase the capacity of implementing Ministries to manage the additional workload by financing 
project management specialists.

An Environmental and Social Screening and Safeguard Framework (ESSAF 
–
the “Framework”) 
has been prepared to undertake environment impact assessments (EIAs) for rehabilitation and 
reconstruction activities with the purpose to ensure that adverse environmental and social 
impacts are minimized, and appropriate mitigation measures are included in subproject designs. 
The Framework which has been developed to ensure compliance with World Bank safeguard 
policies as well as the Bank’s OP 8.50 on Emergency Recovery Assistance, is applicable to all 
subprojects funded under the project. Neither GoM, nor its implementing agencies shall 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  4
undertake any reconstruction or recovery activities that could cause any environmental or social 
impacts in the absence of an environmental assessment conducted in accordance with the ESSAF 
that is satisfactory to IDA  
Recognizing the emergency nature of the project, and the related need for providing immediate 
assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing potential environmental 
and social risks, the Framework is based on: (i) key policy principles for environmental and 
social risk management; (ii) tools to screen subprojects for environmental and social impacts and 
mitigate such impacts; (iii) procedures to ensure that these principles and tools are appropriately 
applied; and (iv) guidelines for capacity building and monitoring. The Framework assists the 
Government and its implementing agencies in screening subprojects for likely environmental and 
social impacts, identifying documentation and preparation requirements through the application 
of standardized guidelines and codes of practice. 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS

ISDS 
 
February 17, 21004 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
