A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed development objective is improved performance (efficiency, effectiveness, quality) 
by public employment, pension and social assistance agencies in providing services to the 
population 
 
Progress towards achieving project outcomes will be determined by the following:
 
 
• 
Evidence of eligible beneficiaries receiving accurate and timely pensions and social 
assistance payments; 
• 
Evidence of improved job placement, especially among the disabled and young workers; 
• 
Evidence of improved user satisfaction regarding service delivery related to pensions, 
employment services and social assistance.  
Output indicators will include the following:
 
 
General social protection:

Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
  (PRSP) identified five themes as priority areas of action:  
 
(i) promoting sustainable economic growth through macroeconomic stability and private 
sector development;  
(ii) enhancing human development and improving social safety nets;  
(iii) implementing prudent fiscal policies and reforming the tax system;  
(iv) improving public infrastructure; and  
(v) improving core public sector functions. 
 
The Project objectives are directly linked with (ii) and (v). 
 
The PRSP recognizes social insurance and social assistance as key elements of the poverty 
reduction framework. Targeted cash family poverty benefits-one of the most successful poverty 
alleviation programs in the region - remains a major pillar of the safety net. The PRSP envisages 
a range of measures aimed at further improving the administration of these benefits, including 
better monitoring and evaluation, more streamlined appeal procedures, and a more streamlined 
appeal procedures, and a more active role for territorial centers in providing social assistance that 
reaches out to the poorest. In the area of social insurance, the PRSP focuses on completing the 
introduction of individual contribution records in the pension system, better collection of social 
insurance contributions, and increase in pensions. In the area of employment, the PRSP focuses 
on the increase of employment as the most socially acceptable and economically efficient means 
of poverty reduction, and well as on the increase of the efficiency of employment programs and 
services.

The focus of the Social Protection Administration Project is to improve administration of social 
and employment programs should lead to achievement of the Government's objective of poverty 
reduction in the country.  
 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS):
 The project objectives are directly linked to the relevant 
CAS objectives that emphasize the need for a sustainable social protection system that is well-
targeted and affordable, and simple to administer and monitor. Key three goals of the 
current 
CAS
 (April, 2001) are:  (i) improving the business environment, (ii) strengthening public sector 
management, (iii) rebuilding human and physical capital. The project objectives are directly 
linked with (ii) and (iii) CAS objectives. The  
new CAS
 for 2004-2008 developed based on the 
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in social protection includes the following key 
objectives: (i) reduce poverty primarily through private sector growth; (ii) reduce inequalities of 
consumption and access to services; and, (iii) improving human capital by ensuring that Armenia 
people have skills and health to take advantage of employment opportunities.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will include civil works (minor refurbishment) and  provision of equipment, 
materials, technical assistance and training for the following five components: (i) general support 
to the social protection; (ii) labor and employment, (iii) pensions; (iv) social assistance; and (v) 
project management, monitoring and evaluation. 
 
Project Component 1: General Support to the Social Protection Sector (US$1.86 million, 
IDA contribution US$1.68 million)
.   
 
This component will help to develop a comprehensive management information system (MIS) 
for the creation, acquisition, storage, maintenance and exchange of digital information required 
for the operation of an effective social protection system. The component includes four sub-
components: (i) the development of a communications network for transmission of information 
between and within the different social protection programs; (ii) the establishment of a related 
technology platform; (iii) review of existing software programs for adaptation to the new 
network structure; and (iv) adaptation of software programs. 
 
Project Component 2: Labor and Employment (US$1.26 million, IDA contribution US$1.16 
million)
 
 
This component will help to increase efficiency and effectiveness of the national employment 
services (NES) in labor market intermediation and will support  reform of labor institutions.  The 
component will include the following four sub-components: (i) development of a management 
information system that will form part of the national information network (Project Component 
1); (ii) introduction of labor market monitoring and piloting of selected active labor market 
programs by employment services; (iii) establishment of a training, advisory and job 
rehabilitation center for disabled persons; and (iv) establishment of a professional orientation 
center for youth on pilot basis. 
 
Project Component 3: Pensions (US$1.27 million, IDA contribution US$1.20 million)
 
 
The pension component is aimed at creating a modern pension administration.  It will include the 
following three sub-components: (i) development of a management information system to 
support the establishment of a client data base of individual records (a central register) containing 
Page  5
 
 
pertinent information on all insurance system clients; (ii) operational improvements in key 
business processes – contributions collections and revenue/expenditure monitoring, 
audit/inspection, pension management and customer services; and (iii) institutional 
strengthening, including general and financial management, actuarial forecasting and policy 
analysis 
Project Component 4. Social Assistance (US$0.77 million, IDA contribution US$0.72 million)
 
The component will help to improve poverty targeting by supporting community-focused 
household surveys and developing in-depth monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of 
poverty targeting. 
 
Component 5: Project Management, monitoring and evaluation (US$0.55 million, IDA 
contribution US$0.39 million) 
  
The component will ensure professional implementation of the project by using appropriate 
mechanisms of project management, and proper tools of project monitoring and evaluation.
