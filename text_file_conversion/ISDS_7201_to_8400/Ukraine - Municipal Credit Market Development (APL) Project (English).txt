B.  Project Objectives  
 
The Program's development objective is to support the initiation and development of a market 
for municipal credit in Ukraine. If successful, such a market would be comprised of voluntary 
private lenders who understand and are prepared to manage the risks of this new line of business 
and an ever-growing number of creditworthy municipalities who can better serve their citizens 
through increased investment in services and infrastructure. There are at least four themes that 
describe how the Program will achieve its objective. First, the policy and regulatory framework 
for intergovernmental fiscal relations, in general, and sub-national borrowing in particular, will 
be strengthened and sustained. Second, municipalities and their utilities will be given the 
opportunity and the incentive to better manage their financial affairs so as to be viewed as 
creditworthy by potential lenders. Third, those same entities will be given assistance to develop, 
prioritize and select better investment projects so as to yield maximum returns and address the 
needs of their communities. Fourth, private financial institutions including commercial banks 
will be assisted and invited to consider these borrowers and these projects for investment where 
the risks of such lending can be minimized and managed effectively.

C.  Project Description  
 
In the context of the reform of the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations, the Government 
has engaged the Bank in extensive discussions on how to make additional resources available to 
SNG without creating undue risk or liability for the central government.  Initial discussions were 
to create a public fund as a semi-independent financial intermediary. The strategy was to have 
this entity mimic a commercially credible lender, only later inviting commercial banks into the 
system. While much of the preparatory work previously conducted remains relevant for the 
proposed operation, both the Government and the Bank concluded about a year ago that no 
design would adequately address the moral hazard of one level of government lending to 
another. On the other hand, in recent years economic growth in Ukraine, low inflation, deposit 
inflows into the banking sector, better financial regulatory policy and an improved legal 
framework have set the stage for dramatic increases in domestic financial intermediation and 
investment.
1
During this same period the commercial banks expressed an ever-growing interest 
in starting lending to SNGs. 
 
In order for banks to lend to municipalities a number of risks they face must be addressed. In 
addition to the legal and regulatory reforms necessary to make this a safe business for lenders 
(and borrowers), the proposed Bank loan would be used to refinance bank lending to 
municipalities to help them manage the maturity mismatch between their short-term liabilities 
(largely demand deposits) and long-term assets (loans to municipalities). The concept
 
underlying this Program, which involves commercial banks taking the full credit risk, was 
therefore agreed with the Government. The fundamental conception of the Program is that banks 
will choose the borrowers and the projects
2
to finance. Since commercial banks will be the 
lenders to municipalities under this concept, the UMDF will work as the PIU. In addition to 
housing those special skills uniquely required to implement and monitor the project, the UMDF 
will prepare reports for the Ministry of Finance and submit them for consideration. The main 
functions of the UMDF are to ratify the selection of participating banks, the eligibility of 
borrowers and to confirm that safeguard policies of the World Bank are being met. The UMDF 
will not consider whether a loan to a municipality should be granted. The lending decision, 
which includes a credit risk assessment and a subsequent responsibility for collection, rests 
solely with the commercial banks. 
 
The process of selecting banks will be carried out jointly with the Rural Finance Project. Banks 
applying to participate will be evaluated on a number of criteria focusing on the safety and 
soundness of their banking practices. Qualified banks will be deemed eligible for one or both 
projects if they wish. This process is presently underway. 
 
An important feature of the Program concept is that the foreign exchange risk should not be 
placed on the municipalities since they have neither the skill nor the financial capacity to manage 
it. It is thought that the commercial banks are in a better position to bear such a risk but in the 
absence of any real market for hedging such a risk, there is a danger they might overprice it. It is 
therefore suggested that this risk should be held by the Government (by MoF lending local 
currency to banks) and included in the price, i.e. the interest rate they charge the banks.

With regard to technical assistance (TA) to banks and municipalities, discussions with six 
municipalities visited during the preparation of this Program
3
revealed that municipalities will 
need some help in one or more of the following areas: improve municipal capacities in budget 
management, strategic planning, local economic development and/or project preparation and 
evaluation. A number of donor-supported projects are already tackling various aspects of this and 
the task team has been coordinating with all of them. TA to banks is more complicated but 
experience on how to do this has been tested in other countries with similar project (Bosnia-
Herzegovina Local Development Project, active). The TA component will also involve further 
support to the Government on legislative and regulatory issues (policy development). 
 
The proposed MCMD program comprises two, three-year phases and would be supported by 
US$150 million APL, (of an estimated US$180 million total program costs). The APL was 
selected because of the phased (Phase I Policy Development and Pilot Investment; Phase II 
Scaling-up) and longer-term goals of creating a credit market. The preference for the APL 
instrument is also because it easily permits adjustment of the loan amount of Phase II based on 
demand. 
 
D.  Project location  
 
The project will be located in urban areas throughout the country. The aim of the project is to 
tackle needs of municipalities that are able to borrow from the UMDF. Depending of application 
process, municipal creditworthiness and capacity tests (as will be defined in the Operational 
Manual), it is not known at the outset of the project which municipalities will qualify. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
Ukraine has a reasonably good legal and regulatory framework related to environmental 
protection, including requirements for environmental assessments and mitigation. As noted 
elsewhere, the Operations Manual will provide the framework for designing the detailed 
environmental mitigation measures, as needed, to be undertaken by the sub-project municipal 
applicant. It will also establish the details of which civil works are to be considered 
"environmentally sensitive", and hence need to be kept out of the investment program.

(Cogeneration system project); Starokostiantyniv (Cogeneration system project) and Komsomolsk (Water rehabilitation project).  
This is not an exclusive list as project proposals can be made in an ongoing basis by municipalities and their enterprises.  More 
applications are expected once UMDF runs the information campaign for municipalities.

The project documents will include some language to the effect that so long as 
actions are in accordance with the relevant Ukrainian legislation, they are 
acceptable to the Bank and, in the event that it becomes necessary, the operational 
manual and contracts with the entrepreneurs who will carry out works will include 
instructions for dealing with any chance finds that may occur.

The investments to be financed under the Project are expected, among other things, to contribute 
to the improvement of municipal services and infrastructure; thus creating better living 
environment for the population of participating cities in the Project. An environmental section 
will be integrated in the Operations Manual which will include a review of Ukrainian EA 
procedures relevant to the project, national and local capacity for implementing these, and 
institutional strengthening measures needed to assure application of safeguards in a manner 
consistent with Bank policy as well as Ukrainian national environmental laws and regulations. 
The Operations Manual will provide the framework for designing detailed mitigation measures 
as needed by the municipal sub-project applicant.  In addition, it will include information on 
social safeguard screening and instructions for dealing with anticipated mitigation measures to 
ensure compliance with World Bank policies. It is likely that subprojects in environmental 
category A may be financed. The environmental section of the operations manual and the policy 
framework will be submitted to ECSSD for review and disclosed in the country (in local 
language) and at the Bank’s Infoshop (In English) prior to Appraisal.
