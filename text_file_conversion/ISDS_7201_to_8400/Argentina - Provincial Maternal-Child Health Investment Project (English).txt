A.3. ProjectDescription

  The project, with a total cost of US$337.4 (US$145.9 Bank fmancing, including US$13 million
unallocated), would include the following components:

 Component 1: Implementation of the Maternal-Child Health Insurance Program
(US$116.3million)

   This componentwouldincludefmancingto assure

         (i)        Capitation Payment for MCHIP services by MSN to participating provinces
                    covering a declining share of package of basic service costs, on per capita
                    basis (US$96.3 million);
         (ii)       EquippinJ];facilities for primary ambulatory healthcare that supplythe MCHIP

        (v)        upgrading and expanding information systems for monitoring the
                   implementationoftheMCHIP(US$2.4million).


 Component2: Strengthening National and Provincial Ministries of Health Stewardship
 Capacity(US$8.2million)

   The main objective of this component is to adapt the provincial and national ministries of
 health to the demands of the MCHIP (information, managerial), including the start up of the
 national and provincial "purchasing" unit, which will act as Project Implementation Unit (PIU)
 (national and provincial) but will continue as "purchasing agency" for the health sector after
 project completion. Project resources would finance consultant services, investments in office
 equipment, and training servicesto improve the performance of theseministries in exercising the
 sector stewardship functions of the MSN and participating Provincial Ministries of Health
 (MSPs) including:

        (i)     reorganizationof services'mandates,staffmgandrelationships;
        (ii)    improving epidemiological information, fmancial and human resource
                managementsystems;
        (iii)   streamliningthe regulatoryand planning capacityof MSN and its dependant
                public healthprogramunits;
        (IV)    completingstudiesessentialfor MSN policyformulation;and
                preparationof APL2.                             .
        (V)

  Annually, the MSN and eachparticipatingprovince would agreeon a technicalassistance
program for the province and the specific resourcesneededfor its implementation.Those
agreementswouldbeincludedinthe annualperformanceagreement.


Component3: Communicationsand Community Outreach($3.0million)

  To improve the coordination of national health policy and commitment to health programs,
particularly to MCHIP, GOA hasre-dynamizedCOFESA. It also needsensurehigh "demand" for
health programs among target populations, particularly of those who have historically feel
marginalized. Project financing would secureconsultant services,incremental ministry operating
costs, event organization, communications servicesto supporttwo main lines of communications

including:

         (i)       dissemination~f detailed information about the program amon.gmajor

                      stakeholdersgroups(provincialgovernmentsandtheirpopulations,COFESA,
                      medicalprofession,insuranceagencymanagersandstaft)includingproviding
                      opportunities for feedbackand dialogue. This would be, primarily, the
                      responsibilityoftheMSN; and
          (n)         communityoutreachto increaseparticipationof the targetedpopulationby
                      providing practicalinformation on beneficiaries'rights to services,services
                      available, methods of inscription, sites, times and names of providers;
                      organizing and supporting community contact groups responsible for
                      disseminatinginformationandreceivingandreactingto feedbackto provide
                      an element of citizen control. It will also support the production and
                      implementationof the campaignelementsspeciallyadaptedto languageand
                      cultural needs of indigenous population. This would be mainly the
                      responsibility of provinces. Provinces would provide details of their
                      communityoutreachactivitiesaspart of theirannualworkprograms,covered
                      byannualparticipationagreementswiththeMSN.

   Component4: Program Monitoring, Evaluation and Continuous Auditing Systems($4.0
   million)

     The project would change the incentive structure for staff and facilities and raise their
   accountability for achieving results. To supportthis, ministries' ability to monitor, evaluate and
   audit performance would be strengthened. Project financing would be used for IT design
   services, software and equipment, training for staff at the MSN and MSPs to upgrade the
   monitoring of health provider perfOffi1ance,aggregationand reporting of information. It will also
   be used for fmancing the costs of the concurrent auditing process as discussed under the
   implementation arrangementssection. In addition to being a renewedbasis for health policy and
   program, the systemis also expectedto generatetracer information that will be accountedfor in
   managingfinancial flows underthe project (seeSectionB2).

   Component5: Project Managementand Administration ($1.4million)

     The project would finance incremental national contractual staffing, consulting services,
   operatingcosts, office equipment, and in-country travel required for project managementthrough
   the PIU and PPlUs. This would include providing sufficient resources supporting fmancial
   management and procurement services. Government would contribute the time of existing
   ministry staff and offices ascounterpart resources.
