B. Project Objective
The main objective of the   project would be to mobilize   and empower rural communities               to
undertake activities that enhance   livelihoods and support social   capital development through
activities that increase agricultural productivity, diversify farm and     off-farm income, and build
local capacity to manage development.

C. Project Description

The project would have three    key areas of intervention:

Component 1: Supporting      Community-Driven Investments.        This component would support:
(a) an investment fund (or a     disbursement window) for community-driven               subprojects that

would     include   environmental     protection   and   conservation        measures,        small rural

infrastructure, and social and productive    investments; (a) building capacity   of village-level
community-based organizations and         their unions for a variety of activities         such as
participatory planning and implementation,      project design, participatory consultation,     and
subproject implementation within the     context of The Gambia's PRSP; and        (a) establishing
linkages with other partnering institutions  such as village savings and credit associations.


The subprojects to be financed under    the component cannot be defined at this     stage, because
it would defeat the demand-driven approach      of the project. However, it can be projected     on
the basis of similar projects in other    countries that the subprojects selected     by Gambian
farmers could include village stores,  small irrigated vegetable schemes   (especially by female
farmer groups), hydro-agricultural  retention pools, pastoral wells, village  wells, rehabilitation
and improvement of small-scale agro-processing        infrastructures, environmental protection
and conservation measures, and   investments for existing and new      agricultural and livestock
production. There would be no meaningful       land acquisition involved in these investment     by
others than the local residents, and the small infrastructure subprojects      would be done on
common village lands, whose use    is traditionally decided by the local  community.


Component 2: Building Capacity      for Service Delivery. The component        would: (a) support
building capacity of identified    NGOs and other agencies in           mobilizing and training
community groups/associations,     and in provision of technical      services; and (b) provide
limited support to strengthen capacity   of key Division/district-level institutions   in planning,
implementation and financial management,           and of coordinating bodies at        the central
Government level, namely the Technical      Secretariat and other key ministry  implementers.


Component 3: Project Coordination.         This component would comprise          of three key sub-
components: (a) Project Coordination       Units: The project would be implemented        at three key
levels: (i) Central Government: the     existing Inter Departmental Steering      Committee (IDSC)
would be responsible for policy,     implementation oversight and overall        coordination with a
Technical Secretariat (TS) supporting       it to carry out the day to day       implementation and
coordination of project activities;      (ii) Division/district level: the Division       Coordination
Committee (DCC) in close cooperation       with the concerned Area Council, will     be responsible for
implementation; and (iii) Village   and community level where the communities           acting through
their associations/organizations would     assume responsibility for grass-roots    level participatory
consultation, planning and implementation      of the demand-based initiatives; (b)     Establishinga
communications network to serve      local communities (including a      registry of potential service
providers and regular market        information for produce commonly             produced by rural
communities); and (c) Monitoringand evaluationto         support project implementation and    periodic
impact assessment and poverty     level mapping in collaboration with      the Strategy for Poverty
Alleviation Coordination Office (SPACO).


D. Project location

The project would initially operate  in a few areas selected on the basis  of criteria that take into
account such aspects as the poverty   level, expected economic benefits,   and likelihood of success
based on the experience of the benefiting    unit in implementing similar investments.    The project

areas and communities would be     selected in consultation with the   stakeholders. The project
would gradually expand countrywide.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity

The Gambia has a weak institutional     and economic structure, especially    at the grass-roots level.
Prior experience in organizing   project implementation in The Gambia       has not been encouraging
in the past, not even when using      independent implementation units      of the AGITIP type. To
countermand these shortcomings,       the preparation team should identify      a potentially capable
organization or agency for the task,  possibly among the existing ministerial    structures.
Furthermore, the coordination arrangements     for this project should be simple.   Also, the project
might need to be proactive to get  the activities started, including advance  identification and
selection of communities and beneficiary    groups and help with designing subprojects.     The
beneficiaries could still be involved through diagnostic discussions. A "menu      approach," which
lists the recommended types of subprojects,    could be considered to start with the  project. At a
later stage, when the project facilitiesare better known among the population,     processes are
adequately experimented, and facilitators   or service providers are trained,  a more clearly
demand-driven approach could be adopted.


II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT               MIGHT APPLY

Applicable?    If Applicable, How Might It Apply?
      [x I     Environmental Assessment (2P/BP           4.01) Some of the subprojects may     have
               minor environmental effects.    These effects and the mitigation   measures should be
               studied before appraisal by preparing    an Environmental and Social Management
               Framework (ESMF), which would          specify the process of identification,
               preparation, review, approval, and    implementation of subprojects.    ESMF would
               also provide guidelines for abbreviated     safeguard studies for some types   of
               subprojects that might require   them.


       []      Natural Habitats (P/BP        4.04)


      [xI      Pest Management (OP 4.09) Vegetable          fields and some other agricultural
               production subprojects could involve      slightly increased use ofpesticides,   but the
                effects would be minor, because    the use of pesticide (and fertilizer) is and will
               remain very low in The Gambia.

III. ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION

A. What actions might be needed during project preparationto                     assess safeguard issues
and prepareto mitigate them?
Preparation of an Environmental and Social Management                Framework (ESMF), which would
specify the process ofidentification, preparation, review, approval,            and implementation of
subprojects, and include guidelines for abbreviated          safeguard studies for the types of subprojects
that might require them.

For ensuring that the social and equity issues will be adequately           addressed, a Social Assessment
has been planned.

B. How might consultation and disclosure requirements                   be addressed?

The ESMF and SA will be disclosed in The Gambia and at the                 InfoShop prior to appraisal.

The preparation process would involve extensive consultations              with potential stakeholders and
include discussions about project areas, types of subprojects,           application and approval processes,
and criteria to be used in various phases of decision making.            Subprojects would be based on
grass-roots level participatory consultation and planning,          and implementation would trusted to
community groups.
All donor agencies, especially IFAD that is planning credit            activities parallel to the project,
would be involved in the preparation process of this project.

     IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS                    AT PCN REVIEW

     At this stage when project preparationis only about to start formally, the Integrated Safeguards
     Data Sheet cannot have all the information and data necessary for obtaining safeguards  clearing.
     However, the PCN review meeting requested    the TTL to fill out the Integrated Safeguards  Data
     Sheet to the extent possible and update it  during the project preparation process   when more
     information will be available.
