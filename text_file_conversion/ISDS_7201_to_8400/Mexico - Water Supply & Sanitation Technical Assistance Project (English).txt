B. Project Objectives
The proposed project objectives are: (i) to assist with the modernization of Mexico's water
supply and sanitation sector through strengthening the sector policies at the federal and state
level and (ii) to develop and execute a series of demonstrative projects to promote sustainability,
efficiency and improved access to these services in middle size municipalities.
C. Project Description
The proposed Project will provide funding for specific studies and activities covering different
areas where technical assistance is needed. The total project cost is estimated at US$ 40 million
(Bank's contribution, US$ 25 million; Borrower's contribution US$ 15 million). The project's
components and activities are as follows:
1. Institutional Development (up to US$ 5 million)
* support the implementation of recent changes to the Water Law, including possibly
through studies on the implementation of the Water Financial System;
* strengthen and expand the existing national water and sanitation information system;
* support State Water Commissions in their planning and regulatory functions;



2. Utilities Management (US$ 35 million or more)
* supporting the development of replicable models for an efficient and sustainable
provision of water supply and sanitation services ("success cases"); and
*  contributing to the existing efforts to promote the training at managerial and operational
levels of the personnel of the sector.
D. Project location
The activities under Component 1 (essentially studies and training) will be undertaken at the
national level and in States that remain to be selected.
The list of municipal service providers to be included under Component 2 remains to be
finalized. Currently it has been proposed to carry out the activities in Guaymas (Sonora), Ciudad
del Carmen (Campeche), Colima-Villa de Alvarez (Colima), Puerto Vallarta (Jalisco) and
Hermosillo (Sonora). This list may be further adjusted during appraisal. In the case of
Hermosillo, it is envisaged to include only activities related to the strengthening of the
governance of the utility and to user participation. In the other cities, in addition to capacity
building and institutional strengthening, modem commercial systems will be introduced.
Furthermore, equipment will be provided and small-scale works will be undertaken to reduce
leakage in the distribution system (mainly by replacing house connections) and to improve
efficiency. The project will not include any works to provide additional bulk water or to treat
wastewater.
E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The implementing agency, the Comision Nacional del Agua (CNA), currently implements two
other Bank-funded projects: the Water Resources Management Project (P007713, PROMMA)
and the Irrigation Modernization Project (P035752, PMIR). The PAD of PROMMA of 1996
indicates that two safeguard policies apply to that project: Environmental Assessment and Safety
of Dams. Compliance with these safeguards has been satisfactory. The PAD of PMIR of 2003
indicates that six safeguard polices apply to that project: Environmental Assessment; Natural
Habitats; Pest Management; Cultural Property; Safety of Dams; and Projects in International
Waterways. Compliance with these safeguards has been satisfactory. Both projects are Category
B projects. Given the earlier positive track record of CNA to comply with Bank safeguard
policies and the limited expected impact of the proposed project (Category C), the borrower's
institutional capacity for safeguard policies is estimated to be sufficient.
In addition, a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for the water and sanitation sector in
Mexico was funded under a PHRD grant in preparation for a sector adjustment loan that has now
been postponed. The Bank will strongly encourage CNA to undertake a SEA that meets Bank
standards. The Bank's Mexico water team will seek the most appropriate way to support a SEA
through one of its projects in the water sector.
