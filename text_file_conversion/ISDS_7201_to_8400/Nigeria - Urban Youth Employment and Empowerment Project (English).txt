B. Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCNJ

The main sector related CAS goal ofthe project is poverty reduction through employment and
empowennent of youth (contributing towards achieving the MDGs in Nigeria).

In line with this goal, the proposed project development objectives (PDOs) are to promote youth
employment, labor market-relevant skills acquisition and youth empowerment leading to self-
reliant activities, innovativeness, participation in policy dialogue and decision-making among
project participants.

Performance indicators for the PDOs (expected outcome) are:

    *   a number (to be tentatively quantified at appraisal, based on more reliable baseline data
        and other background studies) of previously unemployed youths have obtained
        employment or have become entrepreneurs in targeted urban areas, and have acquired
        skill proficiency relevant to the local job market; and

     *  in the targeted urban areas, a certain number (to be determined) of youths, having
        participated in the project-exhibit empowerment, through employing increased socio-
        economic and political assets, increased capabilities to participate in policy decision-
        making, influence and hold accountable institutions that affect their lives.

C. Project Description [from section 4 of PCNI

The proposed operation will address two broad issues:

Support for system-wide coordinated inter-ministerial dialogue (both at the federal and state
levels) on youth/labor/education policy reform. This will build on discussions and dialogue
started/underway in all six participating states (Anambra, Bauchi, Kaduna, Lagos, Plateau &
Rivers) in addition to a youth policy currently being developed by the Federal Ministry of
Women Affairs and Youth Development. These reforms are critical for the success of the long-
term resolution of the youth unemployment challenges faced in all participating states.
Successful, these reforms would constitute the most important complement to a better investment
climate that can contribute to kick-starting the non-oil economy and align Nigeria's economy
behind sustained and well-orchestrated private sector-led growth, thus providing long term
resolution of youth unemployment in the participating states.

The project would support a menu of actions in three areas (employment generation, skills
acquisition, social capital enhancement and empowerment) to provide relief and contribute to
immediate term achievement of the project's development objective.

Component A - National Youth, Education and Labor Policy Reforms

Under this component, the project proposes to address some of the more long-term issues related
to youth unemployment. In particular, it would seek to lay the groundwork for curriculum and
youth employment policy reformns, provide assistance in capacity building (for relevant
ministries and departments) in the development of standards and guidelines at the federal and
state levels. The objective would be to: (i) develop the necessary information systems to provide
data on labor markets; (ii) assist in preparing for policy and legislative reforms related to youth
unemployment; and (iii) review and as necessary reform the current secondary school curriculum
with a view to producing employable youths.

Component B - Employment Generation, Skills Acquisition & Social Capital Enhancement

This component seeks to generate and enhance employment possibilities and also ensure skills
acquisition and social empowerment for the youths with a view to making them more
economically active, self-reliant and enhance their self-dignity. The youths do not need a
handout. What they need is the opportunity to dig themselves out of poverty. This component
proposes to adequately support the youths to enable them to pro-actively seek realistic solutions,
and be active in the social and political life of Nigeria's society. Two major subcomponents are
envisaged: (i) youth employment - public works activity that may be labor based/intensive; and
(ii) grants component to support - skills acquisition and social capital building activities.

D. Project location (if known)

The tentative coverage areas for the proposed project are: Kaduna, Bauchi, Jos, Lagos, Port
Harcourt, and Onitsha.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCNI

The country's ability to address the environmental and social issues identified by the safeguard
policies and the country's institutional capacity to handle the safeguard policies triggered by this
project will be assessed during the pre-appraisal mission (April/May 2004)

11. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY

      Ix]        Environmenital Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)
                 This policy is triggered due to the possibility ofpublic works activities to be
                 carried out under the project. An environmental and social management
                 framework will be prepared to address the issues.

 III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which                             time the PAD-stage ISDS
     would be prepared.

     Scheduled to take place around mid-September 2004.

B. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target                    date for preparing the PAD-stage
     ISDS. Not applicable.

C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related                          studies that may be needed.
     The specific studies and their timing' should be specified in the PAD-stage                          ISDS.

     An environmental and social management framework will be initiated                            at pre-appraisal,
     prepared and be made available for disclosure before appraisal (October                          2004).
