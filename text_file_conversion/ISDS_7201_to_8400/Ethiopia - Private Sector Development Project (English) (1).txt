A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The key objective of the project is to facilitate increased participation of the private sector in the 
economy by creating conditions for improving its productivity and competitiveness. This goal 
will be achieved by helping accelerate the process of divestiture of public enterprises and 
facilitating increased private participation; improving the business environment and increasing 
competition and the contestability of markets; strengthening the linkages and integration of the 
Ethiopian economy into the global markets;  strengthening support for technical and business 
management skills and thus improving the productivity at the firm level. The project integrates a 
set of complementary and mutually reinforcing activities to support enterprise needs, including a 
matching grant fund, tools for business schools to better train managers, and a business plan 
competition to catalyze innovation, and entrepreneurship. The project will also support poverty 
reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of policy measures agreed in the framework of 
the PRSC. 
 
The higher level objective is to facilitate increased growth and competitiveness of the Ethiopian 
private sector. This objective is aligned with the Bank’s CAS and with the Government’s 
commitment to stimulate PSD to attain high and sustainable level of growth needed to reduce 
poverty and realize the MDGs. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
To support poverty reduction strategy dialogue and implementation of agreed policy measures 
under PRSC-II, as well as to build the capacity of the private sector, the PSD CB Project to 
consist of four components (Annex 4).  
 
(i) 
Component One - Accelerating the Implementation of Privatization Program;  
(ii)
Component Two 
-
Improving the Business Environment through Implementation of 
Page  2
Competition Policy;  
(iii) 
Component Three - Strengthening Integration of Ethiopia Into the Global Economy 
Through Support to WTO Accession; and  
(iv) 
Component Four - Strengthening the International Competitiveness of the Private Sector 
and the Capacities of its Representative Organizations. 
 
Component One - Accelerating the Implementation of Privatization Program (IDA US$11.3 
million) 
 
This component will assist the Government in accelerating the implementation of its Privatization 
Program of commercial public enterprises. The Government has recognized that its early 
approach to privatization needed to be revised substantially and outlined the key principles and 
approach to the privatization process in a Privatization Action Plan (currently under preparation), 
which the PSD CB project will help implement over the next five years. The Plan is geared 
towards accelerating the privatization program. To achieve this objective, the Government 
intends to make use of a range of divestiture modalities including asset sale, concessions, leasing, 
joint ventures, management contracts, etc. The Government will adopt process-driven procedures 
in transactions guided by a market-oriented, open, transparent and competitive bidding process. 
Further, in order to address concerns of potential investors related to labor issues, the divestiture 
process will allow the successful bidder flexibility to restructure the labor force of the enterprise. 
However, to mitigate the social impact of possible redundancies that may result, the Government 
will offer the investor an opportunity to voluntary separation package within a pre-determined 
time (e.g., six months) from the initial sale. The exact package (i.e., a menu of options that may 
include retraining, counseling, early retirement, cash option related to seniority, etc.), a defined 
formula in accordance with existing legislation as well as a mechanism that ensures that staff 
benefiting from the program will not be rehired  by Government, will be designed prior to the 
implementation of the redundancy program. This component will provide financial and technical 
assistance in the following areas:
1
(i) 
Institutional capacity building of PPESA
 
–
This activity will cover training of the PPESA 
staff and board members on specific topics such as negotiating skills, contract 
management, public private partnership schemes and corporate governance.  A 
communications campaign aimed at both the general public and investors will be designed 
and executed, and an enhanced information system, building on the existing systems that 
were in use in PESA and EPA, will also be designed and implemented. 
(ii) 
Transaction advisory services to the divestiture process
 –
This activity will support a 
range of services, including: (a) a long term privatization advisor seconded to PPESA; (b) 
transaction advisors to assist PPESA throughout complete transactions from preparation 
through to closing for selected larger and more complex transactions; (c) specific services, 
such as legal and financial due diligence, for simpler transactions where full transaction 
advisory services are not considered necessar
y; and (d) environmental impact assessments 
1
This component has been designed taking into consideration the support ADB has been providing to the 
EPA and plans to continue providing to PPESA.  In selecting activities for IDA support, account has been 
taken of the activities that the ADB has earmarked for funding.  Continued coordination with the ADB is 
intended throughout the life of the project. 
Page  3
and reviews, identified as being required during the environmental pre-audit. 
(iii) 
Excess labor program
 
–
A
program to assist in dealing with excess labor in public 
enterprises slated for privatization.
2
The program will be the first implemented by 
Government and covers payment of a severance package and additional funding for a 
safety net providing a basket of services, such as counseling, retraining and out placement, 
for redundant workers. A short term consultancy will be funded to assist in the design of 
the program.  It is proposed that the government fund the secretariat or agency that will 
need to manage the program as part of its co-financing obligation under the credit.  
(iv) 
Studies
 –
A
limited number of studies on selected topics to be undertaken by short term 
consultants. Proposed studies include the development and publication of detailed 
privatization procedures, the design of a monitoring and evaluation system for public 
enterprises and the design of a contract monitoring system. 
 
Component Two - Improving the Business Environment through Implementation of 
Competition Policy (IDA US$1.5 million) 
 
This component aims at maintaining and encouraging competition, increasing economic 
efficiency and competitiveness, and promoting consumer welfare by ensuring a level playing 
field, fair business practices, and greater accountability and transparency in government-business 
relations for all economic agents. It will provide technical assistance and financial support to the 
GOE in the implementation of the Trade Practices Proclamation. This component will provide 
financial and technical assistance in the following areas: 
 
(i) 
Policy development and implementation.
 This activity would support preparation of 
guidelines for the implementation of various provisions of the Proclamation including the 
administrative procedures for conducting investigations, gathering evidence, protecting 
business confidentiality, measures safeguarding the rights and obligations of parties 
involved in competition case matters, and other related matters necessary for the effective 
implementation of competition law-policy. In addition, review and evaluation of the 
implementation of the Proclamation is included. 
(ii) 
Staff Capacity and Institution Building
 through the provision of  resident and visiting 
international experts/advisers to provide advice on case specific matters, investigative 
techniques, evaluating evidence, and conduct staff training workshops, study tours, 
seminars, participate in public information dissemination program. 
(iii)
Competitive Analysis Studies
covering prevailing competitive conditions in key 
2
The US$5million of IDA grant funding earmarked for this activity is likely to be adequate only for the 
initial phase of the program.  Should the program prove to be successful, additional funding will be sought, 
most probably from other donors. 
 
3
Specifically: (i) it is temporary; (ii) it is partial, although grants are more generous, given a lower ability 
to pay; (iii) it is first-come, first-serve, with the same emphasis on allowing recipient organizations to 
decide on activities, and to select their own service suppliers.   
4
Approximately 75 percent of the students at FBE are teachers or civil servants, while the remaining 25 
percent come from the private sector. 
5
The BIZPLAN methodology will be based on best practice and the cumulative experience of the World 
Bank’s Development Marketplace (DM)
 
Competitions. Since 1998, the DM team has supported over 20 
country-level competitions and 3 Global Competitions worldwide. Another 10 are planned for 2004-05. In 
2003, a DM targeting NGOs and Civil Society Organizations was held in Ethiopia.
 
6
Participation and involvement of private banks throughout the BPC process is a pre-requisite for 
BIZPLAN to be operationalized, as they will ultimately provide loans to the winners. It is the intention to 
finalize the agreements with selected private banks during the appraisal mission. 
Page  4
sectors/industries and how they can be improved through appropriate policies. 
(iv) 
Office Infrastructure for the Competition Secretariat
,
including office equipment, books, 
journals, computers, and software. 
 
Component Three - Strengthening Integration of Ethiopia Into the Global Economy Through Support to 
WTO Accession (IDA US$1.5 million) 
 
This component will assist the GOE in achieving the goal of WTO accession through CB and TA 
to properly manage the process. This component will leverage the resources provided by other 
donors and close key gaps through the provision of financial and technical assistance in the key 
following areas (see Annex 4 for details): 
 
(i) 
Long-term and short-term advisors
 to help the Government to launch the process by 
assisting in the collection of information, preparation of responses to questions from WTO 
members, design and implementation of studies, recruitment of consultants, local training 
and awareness raising. Short-term consultants will be called upon at later stages to advise 
on responses to questions received from WTO members and the preparation of negotiating 
positions.   
(ii) 
Selected studies
 to be conducted notably in the services sectors, to identify the issues and 
options for the GOE. 
(iii) 
Capacity building in the area of WTO
.
In addition to short-term courses and seminars, a 
one-year post-graduate program in trade policy and law will be developed at the 
University of Addis Ababa in order to increase the number of trade specialists available 
for government service.  On a very selective basis, Ethiopian staff will be sent overseas to 
participate in relevant courses.  One study tour will be organized for key senior 
government officials so that they may learn from the experience of another, recently 
acceding country.  Various workshops will be conducted for the private sector, civil 
society and parliament, in Addis and the provincial capitals, in order to improve public 
awareness of the objectives, issues and challenges involved.  
(iv) 
Equipment and materials
.
A
limited amount of equipment and supplies will be provided 
to ensure that staff  in MOTI and one or two other key government ministries have the 
material support necessary to do their jobs.      
 
Component Four -  Strengthening the International Competitiveness of the Private Sector and 
the Capacities of its Representative Organizations (IDA US$6.8 million) 
 
This component will help strengthen human and institutional capacity of the private sector. It 
includes four complementary and mutually reinforcing sub-components for which the PSD CB 
project will provide financial and technical assistance: 
 
(i) FIRMCAP
 
–
aimed at building international competitiveness within private firms. 
(ii) ASCAP
 –
aimed at building the capacity of private business and professional associations 
and of chambers to better serve their members. 
(iii) SCHOOLCAP 
–
Global Business School Network aimed to strengthen the institutional 
capacity of the Faculty of Business and Economics at the Addis Ababa University. 
(iv) BIZPLAN
 –
Business Plan Competition aimed to support and grow private small and 
medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ethiopia. 
 
Subcomponent A 
–
FIRMCAP (IDA US$2.5 million)
The focus of this subcomponent is on building the international competitiveness of Ethiopian 
private firms, so that they can compete in both domestic and international markets. The proposed 
Page  5
basic delivery mechanism is a Matching Grant Scheme (MGS) where an individual firm will 
finance an agreed proportion of the costs of training and/or technical assistance it desires. 
FIRMCAP will build on long World Bank experience of operating similar MGS schemes in many 
developing countries. Three types of activities will be carried out by FIRMCAP: (i) pro-active 
promotion to firms of the benefits of using business development services, in order to build 
competitiveness; (ii) free, on-going hand-holding and advice in preparing their requests for grant 
funding; and finally (iii) the grants themselves including approving requests on the basis of 
compliance with clear eligibility criteria, and monitoring implementation of supported activities. 
 
The MGS concept is different from most traditional approaches to helping firms as the scheme is 
deliberately temporary.  The main “institution-building” achieved will be within each individual 
firm.  The grants will decline over time, so as to reduce the risk of a “grant culture” being 
developed.  The help given is deliberately partial.  The firm must make a meaningful contribution 
to costs.  Experience shows that this is essential to ensure real commitment and ownership.  In 
return, however, it is the firm and not the scheme that decides on activities to be supported and 
that selects the service provider. The firms self-select, and are supported on first-come, first-serve 
basis. 
 
Subcomponent B 
–
ASCAP(IDA US$1.6 million)
ASCAP will provide support to private sector entities such as business and professional 
associations and chambers of commerce, so as to improve their advocacy capabilities, expand 
membership, and where appropriate, regulate professional codes of practice. It operates under 
most of the same principles as apply to FIRMCAP.
3
It consists of a combination of three 
instruments, that are open to any legally registered business or professional association or 
chamber: 
 
(i) 
The Study Fund
 aimed at building capacity in advocacy, a key function for any 
representative organization. The fund can support any study on policy matters affecting 
the investment climate.   
(ii) 
A
series of 
Open Workshops
 aimed at training association and chamber staff and office-
holders in addressing common problems and challenges they face in running such 
organizations (e.g., increasing membership; collecting subscriptions; developing new 
services for members).  
(iii) 
The 
Association Window
 into the MGS, aimed at encouraging the use of outside expertise 
and of travel, to build capacity within associations and chambers.  
 
Subcomponent C 
–
SCHOOLCAP (IDA US$1.5 million)
This sub-component will build on the IFC initiative called the Global Business School Network 
(GBSN) started in 2002 to strengthen the institutional capacity of Business Schools in developing 
countries through a non-profit entity called GBSN Center. In Ethiopia, the GBSN Center will 
bring together top global and regional business schools with the Faculty of Business and 
Economics at the Addis Ababa University 
–
the only institution in Ethiopia that awards graduate 
degrees in management (MBA) and finance (MSc). This will help establish a unique partnership 
and, for the first time, create a multilateral approach to managerial capacity building.  
 
Taking into account the composition of students obtaining their degrees at the Faculty of Business 
and Economics (FBE) at the Addis Ababa University,
 4
 the technical and financial assistance to 
FBE provided through the project will fulfill the following objectives: (i) improved level of 
education available to trainers who teach the private sector; (ii) increased understanding and 
knowledge of the private sector and the principles of market economy by the civil servants; and 
(iii) building networks and strengthening collaboration between trainers, the private and public 
Page  6
sectors. 
 
Subcomponent D 
–
BIZPLAN (IDA US$1.2 million)
BIZPLAN, or Business Plan Competition, will assist GOE’s efforts to support and grow private 
small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ethiopia. BIZPLAN Competitions proved to be an 
excellent vehicle to identify and support promising small-scale projects.
5
Ethiopian BIZPLAN 
aims to provide technical and financial assistance to Ethiopian SMEs thus enabling these 
entrepreneurs to strengthen their skills and increase the availability and quality of services, both 
financial and technical assistance, to them. By engaging the private banks, BIZPLAN will also 
strengthen and develop their institutional capacity to provide better services, financial and non-
financial, to the private sector. 
 
The Ethiopian BIZPLAN will aim to: (i) promote competition among entrepreneurs for new and 
pioneering ideas aimed at increasing efficiency and productivity, (ii) demonstrate to Ethiopian 
banks that lending to SMEs is an attractive and viable business line, and (iii) build capacity in the 
private sector (of private entrepreneurs, business development service providers, and other private 
sector institutions.) Winners of the BIZPLAN will receive a financial award (credit from the 
private banks participating in the scheme) and technical assistance awards (vouchers) designed to 
address the two main constraints to entrepreneurship growth.
6
The process of identifying the 
winners is open, transparent, and highly visible, making it attractive for the participants to put 
their best ideas forward and for the organizers/sponsors to highlight key issues and priorities. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis:

Comments: 
As a category B project, the PSD CB project is required, under the World Bank safeguard 
policies to prepare an Environmental pre-audit, based on the triggering of the environmental Assessment 
Policy (OP/BP 4.01). This environmental pre-audit is currently being carried out, for selected PEs 
scheduled for privatization. The main objectives of the environmental pre-audit are to: (i) measure the 
environmental and social conditions, for both past and on-going activities, of the selected enterprises 
a
gainst the risk of being held responsible for damage; and (ii) determine the need for remedial actions 
necessary to bring a given enterprise into compliance with national and Bank safeguard policies prior to 
privatization. 
 
In addition, the pre-audit will formulate recommendations for partial and full audits for each facility or site, 
as applicable, and suggest a framework for subsequent audits. The study follows a broad consultation with 
stakeholder and interest groups, where the capacity of the proposed executing agency, the Ethiopian 
Environmental Agency and other relevant actors and agencies will be assessed in order to monitor known 
or contingent environmental, health and social impacts and pre-existing environmental problems of the 
selected enterprises.  In addition, the pre-audit report will delineate the roles and responsibilities of various 
parties involved in the remediation action plans and their monitoring. 
 
Upon completion, the pre-audit report will be submitted to ASPEN for review, clearance 
and disclosure in-country and at bank InfoShop prior to appraisal.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The environmental pre-audit will provide more details. The main objectives of the environmental pre-audit 
are to: (i) Measure the environmental and social conditions, for both past and on-going activities, of the 
selected enterprises against the risk of being held responsible for damage; (ii) Determine the need for 
remedial actions necessary to bring a given enterprise into compliance with national and Bank safeguard 
policies prior to privatization. 
 
In addition, as the project unfolds, the capacity for safeguard policies, if necessary, will 
continue to be monitored. The environmental pre-audit will come out with the exact 
measures and the institutional arrangements for implementation. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders include three groups: (i) small and medium enterprises from the 
private and the public sectors; (ii) the meso-level private sector institutions (chambers, 
industry and professional associations) that serve these enterprises; and (iii) public sector 
entities that are implementers of the competition policy, WTO accession and privatization 
program, as well as institutions related to the environmental and social safeguard policies 
and occupational health (e.g., Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Environmental 
Protection Authority, Ministry of Health). 
 
These stakeholders were consulted through direct meetings as well as through workshops 
and seminars, but no particular safeguard policy decisions were necessary.
