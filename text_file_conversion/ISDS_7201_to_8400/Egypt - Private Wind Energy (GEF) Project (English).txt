B.  Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to foster the creation of a sustainable wind power generation 
market in Egypt 
–
based on commercial principles and private sector participation – through the 
removal of market barriers and implementation of technically and economically feasible projects, 
which will assist in meeting the Government’s long-term targets for renewable energy 
production and power generation capacity requirements. 
 
C.  Project Description 
This project will build on the capacity developed by donors who have provided wind energy 
assistance to date.  However, it will also mark a turn in the approach to development of wind in 
Egypt in that it will seek to remove the barriers that make grant funding for wind projects 
necessary today.  This will require support from existing donors to the new approach and donor 
coordination and consultations will therefore be important throughout project preparation.  It will 
do so by taking a phased approach.  The first phase of activities will aim at (i) developing a 
policy, legal and regulatory framework conducive to commercial financing and operation of 
wind projects; (ii) building capacity in the sector for wind projects and organize the sector 
institutionally in a way that commercial operation and competition can develop; and (iii) 
undertaking a number of pre-investment activities aimed at facilitating the investments required
 
in phase 2.  Under Phase 2, the investment facilities, notably the financing mechanisms will be 
tested in a business development case. 
Page  2
The project will therefore comprise two phases and four major components: 
 
Phase 1:  Technical Assistance
a)  Legal and regulatory frameworks development and policy support (US$1 million) 
b)  Capacity building and institutional development (US$1 million) 
c)  Pre-Investment Facility (US$3 million)  
 
Phase 2:  Investment Component
d)  Investment in 60 MW wind farm (US$15 million) 
 
Legal and regulatory frameworks development and policy support (US$1 million): 
 
·
Financial Incentives Study
:
This will look at the real value of diversification from gas 
produced power to wind produced power based on various approaches including options 
analysis, capital asset pricing models, back-casting, netback value of gas exported as LNG 
and compensation from the recently established Renewable Energy Fund.  Furthermore,  
schemes to replace import duty by an Egyptian co-manufacturing requirement (India/Brazil 
experience), identification of accelerated depreciation and other government support schemes 
for wind and elimination of VAT, etc will be considered. 
·
Model Contract for Windfarms:  
This component will develop a standard contract framework 
for wind power, including Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with a definition of a PPA-
tariff based on the principle of pricing according to the true avoided economic cost in the 
thermal power system. 
·
Technical Standards for wind farms and interconnection:
Including the development of 
market rules for wind energy, preparation of standard contracts for grid connection, 
preparation of market rules for wind farms, and preparation of standard contracts for 
wheeling. 
·
Renewable Energy Policy Development:
This will deliver a White Paper that defines the 
government’s long-term policy on the regulatory and financing framework for renewable 
energy in general and wind energy in particular, including an implementation strategy. 
·
Legal and Regulatory Framework:
This component will support renewable energy aspects to 
be incorporated into the Electricity Law that is under preparation and technical assistance to 
the power sector regulator in evaluating wind energy projects and transactions.  
 
Capacity building and institutional development (US$1 million) 
 
·
Institutional restructuring of NREA: 
This component will build on the study supported by 
the GEF preparation funds to define and implement an optimal organizational structure and 
requirements for the change of the agency’s status.  Training will also be provided to NREA 
for sector development and oversight. 
·
Assistance to the national transmission company (EETC)
:
This will cover areas related to the 
impact of connecting additional wind farms to the grid, as well as testing of short-term wind 
farm output forecasting models for reporting to the system operator wind farm outputs, a 
Page  3
feasibility study for grid strengthening and expansion, and the development of technical 
standards for grid-connected wind farms. 
·
Capacity building for financial sector on renewable energy/wind farm investment
:
This will 
raise awareness among major local financial institutions on the techno-economic issues 
related to wind energy. 
·
Capacity building for Renewable Energy Fund
:
This will assist the Ministries of Electricity 
and Petroleum develop this concept further and explore how national and donor funds can be 
channeled through this Fund.  Activities related to strengthening implementing agencies 
capacity to conduct public consultations and awareness raising campaigns will also be 
included here. 
 
Pre-Investment Facility (US$3 million)
 
·
Resource assessment and pre-investment studies
:
This component will finance data 
collection for commercial investments in wind farms at new sites, including a wind 
measurement program, environmental assessment, feasibility study for new wind farm at the 
site, securing provincial government rights for use of the site for wind farm purposes.   
·
Preparation of project concessions
:
This will prepare draft concession agreements. 
·
Innovative financial instruments development and introduction
:
This component will finance 
the preparation and marketing of the new debt/equity instruments to be issued, including a 
financial and legal analysis of the feasibility of introducing alternative financing options in 
Egypt. 
 
Investment in 60 MW wind farm (US$15 million) 
Phase 2 will be implemented once the activities under Phase 1 have been completed.  Under this 
Phase, a 60 MW wind farm will be constructed in the El-Zayt site.  This plant will test out the 
new financing mechanisms and any incremental cost between the proposed project and a 
conventional project will be covered by seeking carbon finance, contributions from the 
Renewable Energy Fund and as needed GEF.  The estimated incremental cost is about US$15 
million to build a wind farm of about 60 MW.
1
In determining the required amount of GEF 
subsidy to this component, the potential for carbon finance and Renewable Energy Fund 
contribution will first be explored.  The Government of Egypt has recently approved the Kyoto 
Protocol which is expected to be ratified by the Parliament in its next session.  This will allow 
Egypt to participate in carbon finance trading mechanism.  GEF funds under this component will 
also be used to underwrite the issuance of the new financing mechanisms. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The best wind resources in Egypt can be found along the Gulf of Suez and covers three distinct 
sites:  Zafarana, El-Zayt and Hurgada.   Together these sites can host up to 20,000 MW of 
installed wind capacity, equal to the size of Egypt’s power system today.  The Zafarana site will 
be at full capacity once already agreed to wind projects with international donors have been 
1
Reference subsidy from Mexico: 1.5 Uscents/kWh = at investment of 
 800/kW and capacity factor of 40% ~20% 
in vestment subsidy or 14-16% if we deduct loss of CDM-project option (CER-revenue) 
Page  4
implemented.  The next site to be developed is therefore El-Zayt and it is in this location that the 
proposed project would be implemented.   
 
The site is south of Cairo and, as is the case with the other two wind sites, there is a potential 
impact on bird migration as this region is of international importance to the Palearctic-African 
bird migration system.  Otherwise the proposed site is expected to raise very few environmental 
concerns given that the site is isolated and not within close distance to human settlements, and 
there is not much alternative economic use of the land such as grazing and agriculture, etc.  
Nevertheless, careful attention will also need to be given to potential issues related to noise and 
visual impacts.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
The Egyptian New and Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) deals with all policy and 
investment related renewable energy activities.  NREA has been in existence since 1986 and has 
demonstrated strong technical capability to develop and operate the 140 MW of wind energy 
currently in existence.  It has also demonstrated capability in negotiating PPAs for the electricity 
generated by the wind 
farms.   Activities to strengthen NREA’s capacity to conduct public 
consultations and awareness campaigns will be included under the proposed capacity building 
component of the project.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
An environmental and social impact assessment will be carried out during project preparation 
and will be required to be finalized in time for the appraisal mission and be satisfactory to the 
Bank.  To protect the migratory birds, careful assessment will have to be undertaken to decide on 
the appropriate height of the wind turbines and the size of the blades to mitigate against harm.  
Likewise, if any negative noise or visual impact is deemed likely, appropriate arrangement will 
need to be put in place for the size and speed of the wind turbines.  
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
Consultations with stakeholders in the vicinity of the project site will be held as will the 
environmental monitoring plans for the wind projects that have been put in place in the Zafarana 
site.  The consultation process will cover a scoping of the EIA to be conducted, consultation with 
stakeholders on the findings and recommendations of the EIA and awareness campaign among 
key stakeholders on the technology to be deployed under the project. 
 
IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN REVIEW 
 
·
The potential impacts of noise and visual effects need to be clearly assessed in the EIA. 
·
Thorough consultation needs to take place including scoping, sharing of findings and 
recommendations, and awareness raising on the wind energy technology. 
·
The capacity building package to NREA should include activities to strengthen its capacity to 
conduct public consultations and information/awareness campaigns.
