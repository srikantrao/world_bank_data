A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective is to improve the organization of the health care system in order to manage public health 
threats; and, to provide more accessible, efficient and sustainable health care services to the population, in 
particular to the most vulnerable groups.  This is the same as for the Adaptable Lending Program and the 
project is expected to make incremental progress towards achieving these objectives. 
 
The achievement of the program objective would be measured by the following key performance 
indicators: 
 
• 
Increased utilization of essential health services, reduction in differences in utilization between the 
poorest and richest income groups of population; 
• 
Reduction of out of pocket payments (OOPPS) for essential health services and for vulnerable 
groups; 
• 
The perceived quality and accessibility of health care services by the population improves; 
• 
Public health expenditures concentrated in fewer hospitals with improved quality and efficiency; 
• 
Key health sector quality and efficiency indicators improve; 
• 
Government is able to demonstrate the impact of health policies on health status and access to 
services from key health policy monitoring documents - Health System Performance Reports and 
National Health Account Report; 
• 
Financial and health services performance of public hospitals is transparent and in public domain; 
and 
• 
Public health system capacity to prevent HIV/AIDS epidemic and other public health challenges 
will improve. 
 
The project contributes to the existing the Bank Country Assistance Strategy objectives that are to: (i) 
improve governance and public services; (ii) create jobs through private sector development; and (iii) 
rebuild human capital.
1
  The discussion on human capital emphasizes the critical role of social 
sustainability and the alleviation of the poverty through improvements in the quality of, and access to 
health services.  The CAS specifically stresses the major challenges that the Government faces “in ensuring 
better access to health services, particularly for poorer groups and regions, reallocation of the health budget

towards primary health care, and health service rationalization, including optimizing excess capacity in 
hospital sector.  Also, both the Structural Adjustment Credit V and the health project aim to improve 
governance of public hospitals.  The CAS also emphasizes the emerging need for supporting the 
Government in developing the comprehensive HIV/AIDS strategy. 
 
The Bank is currently preparing a new CAS for 2004-2008.  At the draft stage, the key objectives of the 
CAS are: (i) reduce poverty primarily through private sector growth; (ii) reduce inequalities of 
consumption and access to services; and (iii) improving human capital by ensuring that Armenia people 
have skills and health to take advantage of employment opportunities.  The project objectives are directly 
linked to the (ii) and (iii) CAS objectives. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component A:  Family Medicine Based Primary Health Care Reform Scaled-up (estimated US$ 6.8 
million equivalent). 
 The project would support further strengthening of institutional capacity for PHC 
reform implementation in the Ministry of Health, academic institutions, financing agency, and family 
practitioner associations.  The project will support modification of the existing family medicine and 
community nursing training programs to increase the throughput while improving clinical quality of 
training; provide incremental support to increase number trained or retrained family physicians and nurses 
(Government plans to train and retrain 1,200 family doctors and 1,200 family medicine nurse to establish 
critical mass of qualified PHC providers in the country by 2010); expand the Primary Health Care 
Development Program  to improve the PHC infrastructure beyond the 81 communities supported under the 
first health project (target will be finalized by appraisal); and, further development of family medicine 
relevant PHC guidelines, including primary and secondary prevention of avoidable mortality.  
 
Component B:  Hospital Network Optimization and Modernization Plans Implemented (estimated 
US$ 8.1 million equivalent).
  The project would support the development and implementation of strategic 
restructuring plans for selected hospital network organizations (up to four in Yerevan and one per region, 
subject to resource constraints) which would include updated service, functional and business plans, 
support to upgrade remaining facilities and equipment, mitigation of social consequences from staff 
retrenchment, basic hospital management information systems to support the new management functions, 
training of the teams in the pilot hospital networks.  The project will also support development of hospital 
waste management regulations for the whole country and train the responsible hospital officials in hospital 
waste management. 
 
Component C:  Government capacity to develop and monitor effective health sector policies 
improved (estimated US$ 1.7 million equivalent)
.  The project would strengthen capacity of the Ministry 
of Health and its key agencies to perform its major functions of policy development and implementation 
monitoring, regulation and oversight of the health sector. It also supports strengthening governance and 
management structures of health care provider institutions and the oversight function of regional 
Government (marz) structures. The project will help to build capacity for evaluation of health sector 
performance by developing core monitoring instruments that are needed to inform decision makers (Health 
Sector Performance Report, National Health Accounts); strengthen legal and regulatory environment, as 
well as institutional capacity conducive to improved supervision, accountability and management of public 
hospitals; improve public expenditure management in health sector; and, improve surveillance of 
HIV/AIDS and other public health threats by complementing the activities supported by the Global Fund to 
fight AIDS.   
 
Component C:  Project Management Support (estimated US$ 0.7 million equivalent). 
 The project 
would support the establishment of a supportive structure for the strategic planning and operational 
management of the project within the Ministry of Health; the capacity to and the actual monitoring and 
evaluation of the reform progress and outcomes within the MOH; organized information dissemination and 
consultation activities; and the operations of a project optimal coordination unit supporting the MOH in the 
coordination and fiduciary aspects of the project unique to Bank-financed projects.
