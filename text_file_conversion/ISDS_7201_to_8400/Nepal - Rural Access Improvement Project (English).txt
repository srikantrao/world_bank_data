A.3. Project Description 
 
The project consists of the following components: 
 
A. 
Rural Transport Infrastructure Improvement Component (Total Cost: US$37.86) 
 
All-season Rural Roads Subcomponent (Total Cost: about US$21 million).
 
This subcomponent 
will support candidate districts to rehabilitate and upgrade about 1000 km of existing district 
roads to all-season standard.  The civil works will include construction of drainage, culverts, 
small bridges and causeways, improving surfaces, and widening (when necessary) to minimize 
closure during the rainy season.   
Dry-season Rural Roads Subcomponent (Total Cost: about US$5.1 
million). 
This 
subcomponent will
 
support candidate districts to upgrade about 340 km of existing trails and 
tracks to dry-season road standard in remote hill districts.  The civil works will be carried out 
following a phased construction method and the environmentally friendly Green Roads 
Construction Method.   
Rural Road Maintenance Subcomponent (Total Cost: US$3.3 million).
 
This sub-component 
will support candidate districts to carry out road maintenance of about 3000 km of maintainable 
rural roads in participating districts. The works will cover routine, recurrent and periodic 
maintenance.  The source of funding will come from districts own resources and Roads Board 
Nepal (RBN).  Participating DDCs will prepare annual maintenance plans and seek funding from 
the RBN; the proposed RAIP will fund any shortfall.  In addition, before seeking funding under 
the above subcomponents, DDCs will have to show that their maintenance requirement is fully 
funded  
Trail Bridges Construction (Total Cost: about US$7.6 million, excluding TA).
 
This sub-
component will be parallel financed with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation 
(SDC).  It will support the construction of about 313 short-span trail bridges in 13 RAIP districts 
and 15 other non-road served districts, and associated technical assistance.  The subcomponent 
will be implemented with SDC TA support to be executed by Helvetas Nepal.   
Demand-driven Community Infrastructure and Pilot Rural Transport Services Subcomponent . 
(Total Cost: US$1.2).
 
This will be an open subcomponent from which qualified communities can 
access RAIP funding for the development of small, rural infrastructure in their communities, such 
as the construction of markets, agriculture improvement, and community trails and roads.  It will 
also support the implementation of a pilot rural transport services, which will come out of a 
recommendation from the rural transport  
B. 
Institutional and Policy Development and Implementation Support Component 
(Total Cost: US$ 5.06 million)  
Training (US$1.25 million).
 
This subcomponent will provide the implementation of the ILO-
sponsored Training Needs Assessment.  It will support the preparation of training course 
materials, training of trainers, and providing extensive training and certification on major aspects 
of 
rural infrastructure development and management.  The course identified by the TNA and to be

DDC and DOLIDAR Capacity Development and TA Subcomponent (US$.70 million)
.
This 
subcomponent will include (a) TA to participating DDCs to support the implementation of 
approved programs, sub-projects and associated local initiatives, including financial management 
and accounting, project development and implementation, design and supervision of works, social 
mobilization and community participation and monitoring; (b) TA and advisory services to 
DOLIDAR for the implementation of ODAP and for various capacity-building priorities and 
longer-term functional and organizational change goals set by HMGN for this sector.   
Accessibility Planning, Investment Needs Assessment and Updating DTMPs (US$0.6 million).
 
This subcomponent will support: (a) the preparation of a GIS-based Transport Master Plan for 
Nepal, and develop a spatial profile of population/settlements that are/are not connected to an all-
season road and undertake a needs assessment to determine the investment requirements to 
connect settlements; (b) support DOLIDAR and DDCs to mainstream the use of Integrated Rural 
Accessibility Planning (IRAP) for multi-sector accessibility planning and, on this basis, prepare 
DTMPs in 30 districts; and (c) support the identification and preparation of a follow up operation 
in the sector. 
 
Rural Transport Services Study and Policy Development (US$0.25 million).
 
This 
subcomponent will support an assessment of the demand and supply of rural transport services.  
The study will assess the mobility and transport needs of the rural population and study travel 
patterns of rural population.  It will examine the industrial organization of rural transport service 
providers, including reviewing institutional, regulatory, and entrepreneurial impediments for an 
adequate and effective rural transport in Nepal.  On this basis, the Study will recommend a Rural 
Transport Policy, which will be discussed widely within Nepal and approved by HMGN during 
project implementation.  Furthermore, the study will make a recommendation to pilot a 
government intervention to promote motorized and intermediate transport services in selected 
participating districts. 
Socioeconomic Impact Monitoring Study (US$0.25 million).
 
Support a study to undertake an 
assessment of the magnitude and distribution of the direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of 
rural access transport interventions and determine the extent to which interventions under the 
proposed RAIP cause changes in the well being of target population.  TA services under the 
supervision of DOLIDAR will undertake the study.  A baseline survey will be undertaken before 
project implementation starts, and two repeat surveys will be undertaken: one after civil works 
are completed; and the second two to three years after project closing.  The funding for the latter 
will come from HMGN, while the first two surveys will be funded under the proposed RAIP.  
The TOR and procurement plan for the consultancy service will be ready by appraisal. 
Goods, Logistical Support, Increment Cost Component (Total Cost; US$1.6 million).
 
To 
facilitate the implementation of the above components, the project will support the procurement 
of goods, and fund logistical and incremental costs by DOLIDAR and participating DDCs during 
Page  4
project implementation. The specific goods to be procured are being identified by DOLIDAR and 
DDCs, and will be ready by appraisal. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
District Selection.  
Participating districts will be selected based on a District 
Participation Framework (DPF), which has been prepared by DOLIDAR and endorsed by 
MOLD and NPC.  The purpose of the DPF is to create institutional incentives and 
competition among districts by setting an objective, fair and transparent rules for 
selecting candidate districts.  The DPF will also help ensure districts’ readiness to 
implement the project and secure continued good performance throughout project 
implementation period.  Accordingly, the DPF comprises a 
District Selection Criteria
 for 
districts to be candidates, an 
Entry Condition
 for districts to participate in the proposed 
project, and 
a
Performance Criteria
 for districts to receive continued funding support 
from the project.  The District Selection Criteria, which includes district’s poverty level 
(as ranked according to HMGN criteria), existing level of accessibility, potential for 
agriculture development, connectivity to the Strategic Road Network (SRN), effective 
participation under RIP, and synergy with other donor development programs, has been 
already applied to select 21 candidate districts shown in the Map below.   
 
Page  5
Specific Road Selection.  
Participating DDCs have submitted their first year works.  
DOLIDAR is completing the environment and social screening for 13 districts for a total 
of 24 subprojects.  All proposed subprojects are part of the District Transport Master 
Plan, which was prepared by DDCs following a participatory process.  Future subprojects 
are also to be drawn from DTMPs and will undergo environmental and social screening 
by DDCs and DOLIDAR.  
 
Salient physical characteristics relevant to safeguard analysis.  
There are two distinct 
physical terrains:  Hill and Terai (plains) found in the project districts.  The geology of 
the Himalayan mountains in the hill districts is extremely fragile and prone to erosion and 
landslides.  The alignment of the roads will be closely coordinated with the 
environmental assessment process to determine the best location. The road improvement 
component of this project will also include slope stabilization and drainage control works 
to prevent further damage.  In the Terai districts, the examining the drainage patterns will 
be important to determine the alignment of the roads.  Most roads will be north-south 
roads, where potential of flooding is less than east-west roads.  Culverts will be placed in 
the appropriate areas to prevent flooding.

Comments: 
 
The project has been categorized as “B” since the project’s civil works will be implemented following 
environmentally friendly “green roads” construction approach, which emphasis phased construction and 
bioengineering for slope stabilization.  In addition the civil works involve small works for:  (i) the 
upgrading of existing dry weather roads to all weather roads; (ii) upgrading existing tracks/trails to dry 
weather roads; and (iii) maintenance of existing district roads.   
 
Environmental Assessment and development of an Environmental Management 
Framework (EMF) has been carried out during the preparation of the project.  The EMF 
clearly defines the environmental screening procedures, environmental impact 
assessment and mitigation mechanism, preparation of environmental management plans, 
monitoring system and institutional mechanism for implementing the EMF.  The 
safeguard policies for Natural Habitats, Cultural Property and Forests have been triggered 
since there may be a some likelihood of a rural road passing close to protected areas, 
forested land or culturally significant sites.  However, the policy under this project is that 
any activity that will adversely affect any of the three areas will be avoided.  In the case 
of unavoidable adverse environmental impact, mitigation measures will be included in 
the design and implementation of the project.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project is not expected to have significant, adverse, large-scale irreversible 
environmental or social impacts. 
 
The type of environmental impacts that will result from road works involve slope stability, erosion and 
landslides on the mountainous terrain caused by improper alignment, inadequate drainage control, and 
inappropriate road construction practices such as disposal of waste material and destruction of vegetation.  
Other environmental issues that may arise are disruption of natural drainage areas; reduction of water 
quality; air and noise pollution during construction; encroachment on culturally sensitive areas; and cutting 
of trees for road widening and fuelwood by the construction workers.  Another issue that the project will 
ensure the proper management of is the health and safety of the construction workers and their labor camps.  
Every sub-project will require either an IEE or EIA that will result in a detailed Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) which will outline the mitigation measures necessary for each site.  All areas 
close to areas designated as protected areas or of cultural value will be avoided during alignment.  The 
environmental assessment process will also include hazard assessment to ensure that the alignment avoids 
any potential landslide areas. 
 
Most of the sub-projects to be financed under the project are expected to be small, and 
cause minimal negative social impacts.  To the extent possible, alternative designs and 
locations will be considered to avoid land acquisition and minimize adverse social 
impacts.  Where minor road alignments widening or other improvements require small 
scale land acquisition, land will be acquired on a voluntary basis.  In the event that minor 
land acquisition is unavoidable the project will be designed to cause the least amount of 
social, cultural and economic disruption. Project affected families (PAFs) will be 
compensated, relocated and rehabilitated, if required, so as to improve their standard of 
living, income earning capacity or at least to restore them to a living standard they are 
likely to have achieved if the project had not taken place.  Special measures will be taken 
to protect socially and economically vulnerable groups such as female headed families, 
ethnic and indigenous groups and people living in extreme poverty.  These include 
mechanisms to ensure their inclusion in decision making throughout project preparation 
and implementation, and social/economic uplift through training on income generating 
activities.      
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Considering the types of sub-projects eligible for financing under the project, and the 
screening criteria (agreed with IDA) used to identify the sub-projects, it is anticipated that 
there will be no cumulative adverse impacts, since the screening process eliminates sites 
that may result in any serious adverse environmental and social impacts.  Multiple 
safeguard policies have been triggered largely as a  precautionary measure, to focus 
attention on potential safeguard issues during implementation monitoring. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Page  8
Key alternatives that have been examined for the project are detailed in the PAD.  To the 
extent possible, alternative designs and locations will be considered to avoid land 
acquisition and minimize adverse social impacts. 
 
At the time of determining road alignment, locations with sensitive sites such as land 
instability, wildlife habitat, bio-diversity, and cultural/historical sites will be avoided as 
much as possible.  Each site-specific environmental impact will be jointly identified by 
the community representatives, DDC officers and DOLIDAR.  Detailed mitigation 
measures will be agreed upon and signed in an MoU as part of the Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP).  The environmental codes of practice for rural roads 
constr
uction has been outlined in the “Environmental and Social Management 
Framework”  (ESMF) document. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has undertaken an Environment and Social Assessment and has developed 
an integrated Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) to identify, 
assess and manage social and environmental impacts in accordance with HMGN policies 
and IDA’s Operational Policy OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, Operational Policy 
4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and Operational Directive 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples.  
To supplement the ESMF, the borrower has prepared local level guidelines in Nepali – 
“Environmental Management Guidelines for Rural Road” to be used by DDCs and other 
local level agencies to ensure effective environmental management implementation. 
 
The ESMF provides guidance on framework to be followed for environmental 
management under the project.  It describes the desk and field screening of sub-projects, 
IEE and EIA processes, preparation of Environmental Management Plans (EMP), 
implementation of environmental mitigation measures for each stage of the project cycle, 
consultation and disclosure process, institutional mechanism for environmental 
management, and capacity building programs.  The local community and DDC will be 
involved extensively in the preparation of the EMP and monitoring the implementation of 
the mitigation measures. 
 
To facilitate the assessment and management of social impacts, the ESMF details key 
social issues and potential impacts of the project and defines the modalities for profiling 
socio-economic conditions, identifying stakeholder groups, conducting social screening 
to assess potential impacts, voluntary land donations, as well as the institutional structure 
to support social impact management, including monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.  
Although no involuntary resettlement is anticipated under the project, a Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared and detailed in the ESMF, in the event that 
minor land acquisition unavoidable, or if project activities result in loss of privately 
owned assets/structures or the displacement of any people.  The RPF defines the legal, 
institutional and implementation framework to guide the compensation for lost assets, 
livelihoods, community property, and the resettlement and rehabilitation of people in 
accordance with OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and relevant
HMGN guidelines 
Page  9
and legislation.  The RPF will be applicable to all subprojects funded under RAIP. 
 
The ESMF also presents policy guidance to ensure compliance with the objectives of OD 
4.20 on Indigenous Peoples.  A Vulnerable Communities Development Framework 
(VCDF) has been prepared to define the policy and implementation framework to ensure 
that meaningful consultations with indigenous, tribal, minority and vulnerable groups are 
carried out throughout project preparation and implementation, that they benefit from 
project activities, and that adverse impacts on these people are avoided or appropriately 
mitigated.   
 
The capacity of the borrower, especially at lower levels, is weak in addressing 
environmental and social issues as is the mainstreaming of such issues in its regular 
business processes.  Recognizing this, the Training Needs Assessment prepared for the 
project includes a specific emphasis on building capacity on environmental and social 
issues and applicable mitigation strategies.  DOLIDAR has also engaged the services of  
a
Social Development Adviser (SDA) and an Environmental advisor as part of the project 
preparation team to provide oversight in the incorporation of social and environmental 
analysis, participatory and community mobilization processes into project design and 
implementation as well as raise awareness of these issues at the local level. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The project will adopt a strong participatory approach in the selection, implementation, 
monitoring and operation and maintenance of project facilities through the direct 
participation of beneficiary communities (Road User Groups/Committees), DDCs, and 
other key stakeholders including local NGOs.  The project is community driven and the 
participation of local civil society organizations to support the mobilization and 
formation of community based organizations is fully integrated into its design.  The 
ESMF (developed on the basis of consultations with communities) provides guidance on 
the overall consultation strategy and public information tools to ensure community 
awareness and involvement in the project as well as participatory monitoring and 
evaluation modalities.  Particular effort would be made, through the social mobilization 
processes and association with local NGOs/CBOs to increase participation of women and 
other vulnerable groups.
