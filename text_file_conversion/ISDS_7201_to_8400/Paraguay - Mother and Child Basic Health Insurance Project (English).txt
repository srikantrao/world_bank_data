A.2 Project Objectives: 
The proposed project is fully 
consiste
nt with both the CAS and the Borrower’s health sector strategy 
and
 
aims at reducing poverty by reducing maternal and child mortality particularly among the rural poor, and at 
introducing changes in the MSPBS financing mechanisms to improve sector financing and health service 
delivery efficiency. Specifically, the Project would contribute to:  
 
i. 
Reduce the National Infant Mortality Rate currently estimated at 29 per 1000 live 
births (baseline data from the 2004 National Demographic, and Sexual and 
Reproductive Health Survey) to a level to be agreed at appraisal. The project would 
substantially contribute to Paraguay’s progress towards meeting it’s the MDGs for 
Health in 2015. 
ii. 
Change the dynamic of financing and providing health care services. The most 
important change relates to the MCBI Program being built around output 
performance and accountability mechanisms (e.g. annual management agreements, 
implementation of quasi-contracts and provider payment mechanisms), which will 
determine the flow of resources. 
iii. 
Increase the voice of the poor in the health sector, strengthening the client-provider 
relationship in line with the 2004 
WDR
;
and  
iv. 
Improve the MSPBS capacity to monitor and regulate sector activities. 
 
The MCBI Program has a strong poverty focus. First the program is initiating its implementation in 
the poorest areas of the country. Second the Program targets the most vulnerable part of the poor population 
(women and children). Finally, the selected departments are eminently rural and have over 50% of the 
co
untry’s indigenous population, both those are traditionally excluded groups. The MCBI Program would 
include special outreach activities targeted to those two groups. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project would have five components for a total o
f
US$26.2 million 
Page  2
2
over a five-six year period (US$21.0 million Bank financing, including 
US$ 1.7 million 
unallocated
,
and the Front-End Fee). The costs and activities presented are indicative and 
will be refined during project appraisal.   
 
Component 1: Financing Capitation Payments for the Mother and Child Health Basic Insurance 
(MCBI) Program (US$ 11.2 million of which BIRF).
 
The objective of this component is to extend effective access to an Essential Package 
of Services (EPS) to women of child-bearing age and children under five years old, in nine 
departments, selected due to having the worst health and poverty indicators in the country. 
The Component would achieve this objective through financing (subsidizing) the equivalent 
of an insurance premium per beneficiary to pay for the services included in the EPS. To 
avoid confusion with private insurance, the premium would be called “Capitation Payment”. 
As per Bank’s percentage financing of this component would be declining as the project 
advances. 
 
The project estimated, trough an in-depth study that considered variable costs (drugs 
and medical supplies) of the EPS, the average per-capita costs for providing the EPS to the 
target population (women on reproductive age and children under five). The costs of the 
benefit has been developed through analysing actual prices that prevail in the markets for 
medical goods, technology improvements and efficiency standards, and expected economies 
of scale. These costs have been brought to a per-capita average according to the numbers of 
the beneficiary population on the basis of the 2002 census update. The present estimated 
average costs of the EPS is about US$ 6.5 (per-capita/month). The Government would not 
introduce changes to this per-capita average, the composition of the EPS, or the population 
to be covered without the Bank’s no-objection. However, all those parameters would be 
reviewed regularly by the Government and the Bank.  
 
This component would be implemented by the Insurance Management Unit (IMU), 
within the MSPBS General Directorate of Planning, and under the direct supervision of the 
Vice Minister of Health. This unit would act as a purchasing agency for the EPS, 
monitoring the Annual Management Agreements between the MSPBS and the Regional 
Counsels, and ordering fee-for service transfers to the service providers. Further details of 
Component 1 implementation are presented in annex 6. 
 
Component 2: Strengthening MSPBS and Public Health Service Providers Capacity to 
implement the MCBI (US$ 8.5 million) 
 
Component 2 would finance activities to strengthen the MSPBS regulatory, health 
service purchasing and MCBI management capacity, as well as the capacity of public health 
service providers up to a level essential to implement the MCBI. The two following 
subcomponents would finance:  
 
Subcomponent A:  Strengthen the MSPBS capacity to regulate and monitor the 
MCBI
:
i.
The establishment, of the MCBI Management Unit (IMU) of the MSPBS (US$ 0.1 
Page  3
3
million). 
ii. 
Technical assistance to the MSPBS to develop their service purchasing capacity, and 
to set up all managerial and administrative systems for overseeing the delivery of 
ESP by authorized
1
health service providers, including, 
inter alia
:
(a) design, 
implementation, and monitoring of performance agreements; (b) reengineer and 
improve selected administrative procedures to improve transparency, efficiency and 
effectiveness of the administrative support systems needed to successfully 
implement the MCBI, including financial management and procurement, logistics, 
social communication, and monitoring and evaluation at the central and department 
level as needed; (c) design and implement a human resources management system to 
certify, contract, train, and motivate health personnel with the skills and new 
operational culture needed to implement the MCBI. including an internal 
communications campaign; (US$ 0.5 million.).  
iii. 
The design and implementation of the MCBI information system (US$ 0.3 million). 
iv. 
Technical assistance to improve financial management and health promotion 
capacity at national and departmental level (US$ 0.2 million).    
 
Subcomponent B: Strengthen the DR and public service network, and extend coverage to 
isolated populations
:
i. 
The Loan would finance technical assistance through start-up/monitoring teams that would: a) 
facilitate the diagnosis of managerial, technical, personnel, investment and logistical (communication, 
transport, building and equipment maintenance) specific needs of each health facility; b) design, 
together with the facility staff, action plans to solve the detected issues; c) support the DR and the 
health services with their annual negotiation of the performance agreements; d) provide on-the-job 
training through regular visit to the services at the project areas; and, e) monitoring the 
accomplishment of the annual agreement. To avoid conflict of interest, start-up groups will be 
periodically rotated between departments. (US $2 million). 
ii. 
Furthermore, this component would finance the remedial actions suggested by the start-up/monitoring 
team, in regards to human resource capacity through: (a) compensated personnel rotation and 
internships in well functioning health services; and, (b) benchmarking between health providers (US$ 
0.2 million). 
iii. 
Finance basic health facility investments, including rehabilitation of health facilities (works) and 
purchase of equipment (medical, waste management, transportation, and communications) directly 
linked and indispensable for basic health care facilities to be able to deliver the EPS package. 
Investment would exclude level four facilities
 (US$ 3.7 million);  
iv. 
Contracting mobile teams to deliver the EPS to disperse and isolated populations including isolated 
indigenous population communities in participating departments (US$ 1.5 million). 
 
Component 3: Communications and Social Management for the Implementation of 
MCBI. (US$ 2.9 million)
.
This Component would ensure that the target populations, particularly those that have historically 
been marginalized, have adequate knowledge and motivation to demand the ESP, and would facilitate the 
enrolment of the population in the Program. In addition, the component would mobilize support of decision 
makers and opinion groups outside the Ministry to support the MCBI and the changes introduced by it. 
Communities would also be empowered to monitor the delivery the EPS and to co-manage MCBI. Finally, 
individuals and communities would be targeted for the introduction of good practices regarding reproductive 
and child health behavior at the household and community levels in the Project area
s. Specifically, the 
1
Authorized providers would be those certified by the Health Superintendence to deliver the EPS on the 
participating departments. 
Page  4

component would finance the following: 
 
i.
Enrolment campaigns and dissemination of detailed information about the program 
among major stakeholder groups providing opportunities for feedback and dialogue. 
Beneficiary communities would be 
provided practical information on beneficiaries’ 
rights to services, and the EPS included in the MCBI (US$ 0.6 million).  
i.
Community outreach to foster social participation the oversight of MCBI services, 
providing technical assistance to: (i) Local and Regional Health Councils to establish 
social monitoring and auditing mechanisms of the MCBI (e.g. Local Councils would act 
as enrolment promoters); (ii) support health facilities with the enrolment and training of 
health workers; and (iii) Local Councils that request support to establish social 
pharmacies; (US$ 0.8 million) 
i.
IEC activities to improve family and community health-seeking behaviors and health 
practices, including indigenous people, regarding reproductive health and mother and 
child care (US$1.2 million). 
v.
Studies to monitor and evaluate the results of the component’s activities (US$ 0.3 
million).  
 
Component 4: Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 1.0 million) 
 
This component would finance the monitoring and evaluation activities of the 
project. It would finance, 
inter alia
,
the Reproductive Health (RHS) survey during the fifth 
year of project implementation, as well as external technical and financial concurrent audits. 
 
Component 5: Project Management.(US$ 0.7 million)
.
The component would finance technical assistance, materials and operational costs 
required for the functioning of the IMU, and National Health Fund
if required, and the 
Project financial audit.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will be initially implemented in 2 departments of Paraguay. Latter phases will 
extend it to 9 departments. There are no cultural sensitive or environmentally critical areas. 
At least 50% of the Paraguayan very small indigenous population (1% of total population) 
lives in Project areas. Most population in Project areas is rural and speaks only Guaraní.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project triggers 3 safeguard policies: environmental, cultural and indigenous. 
 
a) The project will be implemented in the northern and eastern departments of the 
country.  These 
 
departments have the highest percentage of indigenous people in the country; 
b) The project includes small works to rehabilitate existing health facilities, 
consequently there might be a chance to find cultural resources while doing such civil 
works; and 
c) The project also works with medical waste management and with non-medical waste 
management in smaller than hospital health facilities. 
 
D.2.  Describe any potential indirect and /or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  
 
-
The project does not expect to have potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible 
negative impacts. The project proposes to improve socio-environmental conditions by 
correcting existing negative impacts resulting from inadequate waste management, and 
exposure to contaminated waste.  
-
Proposed Project activities are expected to have a positive impact on the health of 
indigenous populations. However, the provision of health care and services to such 
populations needs to take into account their specific cultural diversity and needs.   
-
Although no new construction is expected to take place in the project areas, there is a 
possibility, albeit small, that civil works activities would uncover culturally important 
remains. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
-
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an

assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
In accordance with Bank guidelines, the Government of Paraguay (GOP) has prepared an 
Integrated Environmental, Social, Cultural, Indigenous Evaluation (IESCIE) to address 
the potential ESCI issues related to the implementation of the project and to maternal and 
child health.  
 
a) 
The project includes multiple actions and adaptations to ensure the inclusion of 
indigenous people in the MCBI.  Project design and implementation plans are 
adequate and the GOP is committed to maximize positive impact on poor-rural 
indigenous mothers and children. 
b) 
Civil works contract within the project will include the standard environmental 
and cultural protection clauses.  
 
The project includes financing to improve hospital waste management and general 
biological waste management.  The proposed methodologies for waste management are 
in agreement with the country’s environmental policy and are acceptable for the Bank. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include maternal-infant health support rural and indigenous users, and 
related mother-child support groups; governmental health institutions and health 
facilities, administrations and employees; and health facilities’ neighboring communities.
The IESCIE summarizes results from studies and reports from key Government agencies, 
civil society organizations, and other internationally financed projects, including the 
World Bank financed Maternal Health and Child Development Project (PSM). It also 
includes the results of consultations and individual interviews with key government 
officials, non-government organization staff, and indigenous representatives that are 
working on poor and indigenous populations health issues, advocacy and support, and on 
bio-medical waste management. In addition, the preliminary report for the IESCIE was 
shared with 23 indigenous leaders, and their comments incorporated before the report 
was made available to the public.  
 
The IESCIE was made public through the website of the MSPBS, with feedback 
mechanisms for public comments; several printed copies of the document were also sent 
to public spaces such as libraries, for easier public access. In addition, the MSPBS sent 
letters to major NGOs and other civil groups, multi and bi-lateral agencies, and 
embassies, about the availability of the IESCIE in its website and public spaces, and 
specifying the MSPBS’ invitation for comments to the IESCIE.
