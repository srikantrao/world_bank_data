B.  Project Objectives 
 
The project development objective is to secure the ecological integrity of the Jordan Rift Valley, 
as a globally important ecological corridor and migratory flyway, through a combination of 
integrated land use planning, ecologically appropriate and nature-based socio-economic 
development, and biodiversity protection and management.  
 
The proposed project would be designed as a comprehensive program that will 
mainstream 
biodiversity conservation into land use and development throughout the Jordan Rift 
Valley
.
Principal outputs of the project would be: (i) a network of four protected areas in the 
Rift Valley, safeguarding key habitats through adequate conservation and management; (ii) 
viable nature-based business enterprises in local communities within or adjacent to nature 
reserves; (iii) integrated land use planning for ecological key areas reconciling conservation and 
development needs; (iv) effective institutional and operational arrangements involving key 
Page  2

stakeholders to effectively enforce environmental laws and regulations in the context of 
infrastructure and industrial development in the Rift Valley corridor; and (v) agricultural 
extension services available to farmers, promoting environmentally sound land use practices and 
efficient water use. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project would be co-financed by a GEF grant under the biodiversity conservation focal area 
and operational programs addressing arid and semi-arid ecosystems (OP 1), wetlands (OP 2), 
mountain ecosystems (OP 4) and integrated ecosystem management (OP12).  The project offers 
a
range of alternative development approaches to be refined during preparation and used as 
appropriate given the circumstances (formal protected area designation, informal protection 
mechanisms, community driven development, land use planning, improved law enforcement and 
outreach programs). 
 
The project is classified as a Category B project (Environmental Assessment).  Potential adverse 
environmental or social impacts will be minor and can be avoided or minimized through 
appropriate preventive actions and mitigation measures.  Because the project will promote 
community development and conservation and management of natural habitats including forests, 
the safeguard policies for Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Forests (OP4.36) might be triggered.  
Although no resettlement is expected under the project, preparation might prove otherwise, in 
which case OP/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) would apply. 
 
The following project components (with their indicative costs) are proposed: 
 
(1) Establishment and Management of Protected Areas (U$7.25 million)
:
Four new protected 
areas are to be established along the Rift Valley corridor representing the key ecosystems and 
habitats identified in the Jordan Protected Area Review (RSCN, 1999): (i) the Yarmouk River 
Valley
,
a
wooded river valley in the north and tributary of the Jordan River; (ii) the Jordan River 
near the Baptism Site
(Maghtus), in the central area of the Rift Valley; (iii) the sub-tropical palm 
community at Fifa
,
south of the Dead Sea; and (iv) the mudflats at Quatar
in the far south, close 
to the Gulf of Aqaba.  
 
(2) Community Driven Development (US$4.95 million)
:
As pioneered in the Dana Wildlands 
Project, alternative businesses and livelihoods would be developed around the key protected 
areas in the Rift Valley.  A key element of the approach would comprise developing local 
management structures and business partnerships, including demonstration projects to test 
alternative land use in line with conservation strategies and objectives.  Potential areas for 
business development are ecologically-adapted productive agriculture and horticulture, nature 
and adventure tourism, cultivation of medicinal plants and alternative, high-value food products. 
 
(3) Development of Conservation-orientated Land Use Planning Initiatives (US$1.2 million)
:
Building on current land use initiatives, specific spatial conservation-oriented measures (such as 
buffer and core zones within protected areas and corridors to link separate habitats and protected 
areas) will be developed and, on a pilot basis,  introduced into the overall land-use framework 
Page  3

currently being developed.  The component will facilitate the process of mainstreaming 
conservation measures into regional development and local land use planning exercises through 
technical expertise and capacity building in surveying and mapping, and funding. 
 
(4) Institution and Capacity Building (US$3.15 million)
:
Public awareness and extension 
programs will be developed that are tailored to specific target groups, notably farmers, hunters, 
municipality staff, developers and decision makers.  Emphasis will be on the ecological resource 
value of the Rift Valley and the need for integrated conservation and development in the interests 
of both environmental protection and economic sustainability.  Specifically, an agricultural 
extension program will be developed to promote the use of water-efficient crops, integrated pest 
management, water saving techniques and habitat improvements in agricultural areas.  Improved 
enforcement of existing laws and regulations will also be a priority outcome. 
 
(5) Project Management and Co-ordination (US$0.5 million)
:
The component would 
establishment clearly defined institutional arrangements for project management, co-ordination, 
monitoring and evaluation and handle the critical tasks of managing staff, technical assistance, 
financial management and procurement, and of project monitoring. 
 
Co-financing from bilateral donors will be sought for technical assistance , and possibly for the 
institution and capacity-building component. Indicative total project cost is US$17.05. 
 
The project would be implemented over six years.  Primary coordination would be provided by 
the Ministry of Planning (MOP) and the RSCN, while detailed implementation arrangements 
would be developed during the PDF-B phase.  Key government agencies to be actively involved 
during preparation and implementation of the project would include: the Jordan Valley Authority 
(JVA), the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MOA), the Ministry of Environment 
and Tourism, and the Ministry of Municipalities and Rural Affairs.  The GOJ has a noteworthy 
and commendable record for working through NGOs and the private sector to meet CBD and 
national biodiversity objectives.   
 
The proposed project has already been endorsed by the GOJ, through the MOP, and 
responsibility for preparation delegated to the RSCN, which carries the institutional 
responsibility for the establishment and management of protected areas at the national level.  A 
Project Steering Group would be created to ensure consultation and coordination between 
government agencies and other stakeholders.  Since Jordan is an active member of the IUCN, a 
representative of the Union would be invited to join the Steering Group to provide an 
international perspective. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project areas are situated in the Rift Valley corridor of Jordan and include: the Yarmouk River 
Valley, a tributary of the Jordan River; the Jordan River near the Baptism Site (Maghtus); the 
sub-tropical palm community at Fifa (south of the Dead Sea); and the mudflats at Quatar in the 
far south, close to the Gulf of Aqaba.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Government of Jordan, assisted by the Bank and the GEF heavily invested in adequate 
institutional capacity in recent years to handle preparation and implementation, including 
safeguard compliance, of natural resources management projects.  The Ministry of Environment 
and Tourism and the Ministry of Agriculture, which both are responsible for national 
biodiversity policies and strategies, have a noteworthy and commendable record for working 
through NGOs and the private sector to meet CBD and national biodiversity objectives, thus 
ensuring a broad stakeholder consultation process and commitment.  In order to adequately 
address the scale and multi-disciplinary nature of the project, a series of workshops among 
stakeholders will be conducted during project preparation to develop an appropriate institutional 
plan with clear roles and responsibilities for implementation, including safeguards.
