B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
1. Proposed 
objective(s) 
 
The main objective of the EMTA program will be to help strengthen core economic management 
capacities and contribute to better policy management and better functioning of the public administration 
across a broad range of sectors.  While supporting the main priorities of the development agenda to be 
outlined in the PRSP and reflected in the CAS, the design of this program will include some flexibility in 
order to respond to emerging needs during implementation.  The program will help the Government look 
into the institutional and other constraints that affect the sustainability of the envisaged improvements.   
The preparation of the EMTA is planned to proceed in parallel with the on-going reform initiatives of the 
Government to support the capacity enhancement needs associated with reforms.  It is envisaged that the 
proposed EMTA program will aim to support activities that will strengthen the capacity of agencies to:     
 
\01\02
formulate improved macroeconomic and sectoral policies, and develop and implement the 
sectoral reform agenda effectively;  
\01\02
design programs and projects of high quality, and shift increasingly to a sector-wide program 
approach to sector development;  
\01\02
improve institutions for revenue collection and administration; 
\01\02
improve the efficiency of project implementation and recurrent spending and accountability for 
outcomes;  
\01\02
enhance coverage and improve quality and targeting of public services to the poor;  
\01\02
improve transparency of activities of public and corporate entities and accountability for their 
performance and development outcomes, through timely reporting, effective monitoring, and 
audit and ex-post evaluation;  
Page  2
 
 
\01\02
promote rationalization of activities and role of the public sector vis-à-vis the private sector in the 
economy, including efficient public-private partnership;  
\01\02
improve the investment climate;  and,   
\01\02
improve the information technology in the public sector (e-governance elements).  
 
Better policies and institutions are likely to help Government better meet the objectives of the PRSP. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The World Bank is currently in a dialogue with the government on a medium term program of structural 
reforms that will be supported by an IDA credit. The EMTA program is envisaged as an umbrella 
operation that will provide technical assistance to high priority needs in order to facilitate the 
implementation of the Government’s reform program.     
 
The Government  suggested a range of areas in which they needed technical assistance, including: 
 
\01\02
Strengthening government capacities for better policy formulation and 
implementation, project planning and improving the functioning of the civil service 
and public administration
:  support to the PM’s office, MoF, Planning Commission, 
Ministry of Establishment, Public Administration Training Center and other line ministries.   
\01\02
Support for strengthening revenue administration
: support to the National Bureau of 
Revenues. 
\01\02
Support for improving the accounting and auditing standards and practices
:  support 
to MoF
 
and Ministry of Commerce
 
in implementing the recommendations of the recently 
completed ROSC. 
\01\02
Support for improving the information technology in the Government (first steps 
towards e-governance): 
support to PM’s office and Ministry of Information in establishing 
a government wide electronic network of communication,
 
record keeping and archiving. 
\01\02
Strategic Communication:  
assistance to a country wide effort to create a constituency that 
would support reforms and raise awareness on the benefits associated with  various 
structural measures.   
 
    
 
The project includes a certain degree of flexibility mainly associated with the first component.  Sub-
project proposals that are likely to arise in various sectors during the life of the project will be reviewed 
and supported, if they meet policy priorities and certain criteria agreed in advance with the Government.  
The Government has expressed preference for this approach given their
 
previous experience with TA 
projects that have been overly specified and not able to adjust to changing needs and priorities over the 
project cycle.  .  
 
Co-financing with other donors involved in TA is not being considered but close coordination, 
notably with DFID, ADB, IMF and UNDP is planned. 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The Project will be located in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka.  The implementing agency is the Ministry of 
Finance and Economy.

Comments:  
SASES has reviewed the PCN-stage ISDS and PID for the proposed Bangladesh 
EMTA Program attached to your email of March 8, 2004 and provide clearance to the PCN 
package.  Proposed EA category "C" is acceptable as none of the safeguard policies will be 
applicable to the proposed EMTA program.
