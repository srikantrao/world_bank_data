2. Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to support sustainable environmental services in selected
municipalities. This objective will be met through: (a) development of municipal
infrastructure; (b) strengthening the financial position and operational efficiency of the
selected municipalities and municipal utilities; and (c) institutional strengthening of IB.

 The municipalities that have been proposed by Iller Bank (IB) to be included in the
project are: Antalya, Bergama, Cankiri, Gumusova-Duzce, Elbistan, Erzurum, Gelibolu,
Ilica, Kutahya, Mersin, Mugla, Odemis, Polatli, Samsun, and Serik. These municipalities
were proposed based on a demand survey. The State Planning Organization and Treasury
were consulted by Iller Bank on preparing the list of proposed municipalities which have
to meet the project's Sub-Borrower and Sub-Project eligibility criteria to receive
financing under the Bank loan. No new municipalities will join the project without prior
approval of the Bank.

3. Project Description
The project has the following three components:

 * Component 1: Municipal Development (US$ 277.8 million) - Eligible expenditures
under this category would be for the water, wastewater, and solid waste sectors. From
the above proposed project sites, investment are being defined through feasibility studies.
IB will carry out the due diligence on appraising each sub-project and will also be
responsible for supervision. The expenditures will be financed by the Bank loan and
municipalities;

 * Component 2: Municipal Technical Assistance (US$ 20 million) - Eligible
expenditures under this category will be for municipalities for the following purposes: (a)
feasibility studies; (b) urban planning; (c) preparation of design and bidding documents;
(d) operational improvement plan related to institutional, technical and financial matters,
including financial risk management; and (e) construction supervision. The expenditures
will be financed by the Bank loan; and

 * Component 3: Iller Bank Institutional Strengthening (US$ 6 million) - Eligible
expenditures under this category will include technical assistance to Iller Bank so that it
is able to implement the project in a satisfactory manner. Eligible expenditures under this
category will be: (a) increasing financial and banking capacity; (b) increasing technical
capacity; (c) incremental operating costs; and (d) audits. The expenditures will be
financed from IB's own resources and the Bank loan.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project sites are located throughout the country. Given that the project is related to
water and wastewater investments, the project design ensures that the Bank?s policy on
International Waterways will be addressed.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The project potentially triggers the Bank's policies on Environmental Assessment and
Involuntary Resettlement. To this end, an Environmental Framework Agreement and a
Land Acquisition Framework Agreement were cleared by the Bank and sent to the Bank's
InfoShop. These frameworks are also available on Iller Bank's external site in the
Turkish language.

 On International Waterways, for Sub-Projects on trans-boundary waters, investments
should be for ongoing schemes, involving additions or alterations that require
rehabilitation, construction, or other changes that (i) will not adversely change the quality
or quantity of water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by
the other riparians'possible water use. This applies only to minor additions or alterations
to the ongoing scheme; it does not cover works and activities that would exceed the
original scheme, change its nature, or so alter or expand its scope and extent as to make it
appear a new or different scheme. From the Sub-Projects identified so far this will apply
only for Erzurum which is located on trans-boundary waters where the proposed
investment is only for rehabilitation of the water network.

 All other Sub-Project sites are either located adjacent to the Mediterranean or Black
Seas or on national rivers that discharge to these seas. For these Sub-Project sites, OP
7.50 does not apply. Rather, the project design is required to conform with Turkey's
commitments under the various conventions applicable to these seas to which Turkey is a
signatory.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There are no long term negative impacts expected due to the project.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Not applicable

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has prepared the Environmental Framework Agreement and Land
Acquisition Framework Agreement to address safeguard concerns. The Borrower has
adequate capacity to implement these frameworks. The Bank will review and clear all
category A sub-projects and selectively review and clear category B sub-projects.
Construction contracts will have provisions to ensure compliance with Turkish
environmental regulations, consistent with the Environmental Framework Agreement.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The stakeholders of the project are the relevant ministries, Iller Bank, and municipalities.
The Environmental Framework was discussed on December 21, 2004 with Ministry of
Environment and Forests, State Planning Organization, Polatli municipality, and Union
of Municipalities. The Land Acquisition Framework was discussed on January 1, 2005
with the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement, Ministry of Finance, State Planning
Organization, Cankiri municipality, and the Union of Municipalities. The frameworks
were posted in Iller Bank?s web-site in January 2005 to seek comments from the public.

 The exact nature of the Sub-Projects will emerge after the feasibility study is completed
and as per the above frameworks, the public will have the opportunity to comment on the
investments and information on the project will be made publicly available.
