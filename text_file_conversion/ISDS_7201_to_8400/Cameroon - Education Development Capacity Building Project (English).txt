A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed project is to:  (i) increase the efficiency and equity of 
primary and secondary education, with a focus on the disadvantaged areas (ZEP); and to (ii) 
improve the relevance of secondary and higher education to the needs of th
e
economy.  
Simulation models show that the main outcome of the Project will be an increase in the primary 
completion rate from 63% to 80% by project end, which would be a significant step towards 
achieving the MDGs.  However, as year-to year changes in completion rates are not a reliable 
indicator of efficiency gain, the following indicators have been chosen for their greater accuracy 
and specificity:  by the end of the Project, in 2009, the following results will be achieved:  (i) a 
lower degree of randomness
 
in the allocation of teachers, from 45% to 25%; (ii) primary 
repetition rates reduced from 25% to 15%; and (iii) female to male primary enrollment ratio in the 
targeted areas increased from 0.58 to 0.90.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 -- Reinforcing administrative management
.
The objective of this component is 
to improve the administrative management of the education system through improvements in 
monitoring and evaluation, administrative and personnel management, and planning functions
.
These planned improvements are founded on the provisions for decentralization introduced in the 
new organizational Decree of the MINEDUC.  It comprises the following subcomponents: 
 
(i) 
Subcomponent 1.1 aims to reinforce the administration and management of the system 
and reinforce the capacity of the internal auditing division (
Inspection Générale des 
Services –  IGP) 
and the 
Observatoire de la Governance, 
with a special emphasis on 
curbing corrupt practices. By 2008 the newly developed manuals and guides will be at 
the disposal of all key MINEDUC officials at the central, provincial, and departmental 
levels, and that those officials working within each of these will have been trained to 
utilize and apply the manuals and guides. 
Page  2
(ii) 
Subcomponent 1.2 aims to (i) reduce the randomness in the allocation of teachers from 
currently 45% to 25% by Project end and (ii) reinforce the responsibilities related to 
teacher management of the decentralized structures of the MINEDUC.  
(iii) 
Subcomponent 1.3 aims to improve upon the performance of the planning system, both 
at the national and provincial level.  The outcome will be the timely publishing of annual 
statistics reports and more accurate planning at the provincial level. 
(iv) 
Subcomponent 1.4 aims to reinforce private education by developing a more transparent 
and efficient allocation of public subsidies, with the aim of promoting the quality of 
private education. 
 
Component 2 --  Reinforcing pedagogic management.  The objective of this component is 
to improve pedagogic management in order to make the teaching and learning process 
more efficient.  The key outcome will be to reduce repetition from 25% to less that 15% 
and to improve the relevance of secondary education.  It has the following 
subcomponents: 
 
(i) 
Subcomponent 2.1 aims to reduce repetition rates through (a) building national 
consensus on the elimination of repetition of SIL/Class One, CE1/Class Two and 
CM1/Class Five and reducing them between sub-cycles I, II and III, (b) 
developing new assessment and exam procedures. 
(ii) 
Subcomponent 2.2 aims to implement new structures and streams for secondary 
education.  The outcome will be that all schools, both Anglophone and 
Francophone,
 
will have implemented the new structures and introduced the new 
curricula.  
(iii) 
Subcomponent 2.3 aims to improve the health status of school children by 
developing curricula material on health and life skills, with a special focus in 
secondary education on improving the teachers’ and students’ awareness of the 
HIV/AIDS pandemic and the behavioral changes it requires.    
 
Component 3 
–
Supporting enrollment and reducing the gender inequity in the 
ZEP
.
This component aims at increasing the demand for primary education and promoting 
gender equity in the Adamaoua, Far-North, and North provinces.  The main outcome of this 
component is to increase Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) from 84.4% to 100% and the Gender 
Parity Index from 0.58 to 0.90 in the target areas.    Activities will include:  (a) advocacy and 
mobilization campaigns targeting parents and communities at large; (b) the funding of micro-
projects that help communities build latrines and wells and provide learning materials including 
textbooks, teachers guides, desks and benches, and blackboards to the schools they oversee; (c) 
training to reinforce the planning and managerial capacities of key school council members; (d) 
studies to assess the determinants of the demand for education in those areas and improve the 
system’s ability to deal with them.
 
Component 4
 –  
Building the Capacity of the higher education institutions 
The objective of 
this component is to raise the overall quality and relevance of teaching and research by improving 
the system’s ability to internally generate a critical mass of high quality academics, researchers 
and professionals, particularly in disciplines critical to the country’s development.   This will be 
achieved by:  
 
(i) 
Subcomponent 4.1 : establishing a special fund to support increased academic 
research and professional development;   
Page  3
(ii) 
Subcomponent 4.2 : building and developing an inter-university information and 
telecommunications center (
Centre Inter-Universitaire des Technologies de 
l’Information, CITI
)
to enable improved access to information and global knowledge 
resources and development of capacity for ICT-enhanced distance education;  
(iii) 
Subcomponent 4.1 : strengthening a fledgling research and documentation center, 
(Centre Inter-Universitaire de Recherche et de Documentation, CIRD), and 
(iv) 
Subcomponent 4.4 : establishing a Global Development Learning Network Center 
(GDLN
). 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will include (i) the construction of the 
Centre inter-universitaire de Technologie et 
d'Information 
(CITI) as part of the university of Yaoundé to house the Global Development 
Learning Network (GDLN) which will be established under the project; and (ii) the construction 
of water points and latrines in the Priority Education Zones (ZEP), Adamaona, Far North, and 
North Provinces.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Due to construction activities under project component 3 (water wells and latrines) and 
component 4 (
Centre Inter universitaire de Technologie et d'Information
 (CITI), environmental 
and social impacts  are likely to include the loss of vegetation, soil erosion, water and soil 
pollution, air pollution, noise, and some crop losses, as well as potentially negative impacts on the 
public's health as a result of improper operation and maintenance of water wells and latrines. The 
project has prepared an Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) which will assist project 
implementers in addressing these potential impacts. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
Potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to project activities are not anticipated. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The discussion of alternatives was not deemed relevant in light of the project’s development 
objectives. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As mentioned above, the Borrower has prepared an EMP.  For component 3, the EMP provides 
(i) environmental guidelines for contractors to be included in bidding documents (Annex 2); and 
(ii) environmental guidelines for qualified members of the school councils (Annex 3) to ensure 
that the water wells and latrines are operated and managed in an environmentally and socially 
sustainable manner. Since  these activities will take place within the compounds of existing, 
active schools, there will be no social impacts due to land acquisition. The EMP also includes 
provisions for environmental training and monitoring indicators to ensure effective environmental 
management of these investments. 
 
As regards component 4, the EMP draws on information and recommendations provided in the 
environmental and social assessment report prepared by the Borrower in January 2004 (Annex 5). 
This report discusses the potential environmental and social impacts due to the construction of the 
Centre inter-universitaire de Technologie et d'Information
 (CITI). It recommends, among other 
things, that individuals who had been using the land for vegetable production be compensated for 
crop losses. This has been done, and on June 10, 2004, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that the 
compensation process had been completed to the satisfaction of the affected individuals, and the 
relevant documentation has been provided to the Bank. 
 
Page  5
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include university students, faculty members, the Ministry of Education, the 
population living in the vicinity of the university and persons affected by the construction of the 
CITI.  These affected persons have been consulted and informed about the purpose and 
construction of the CITI and steps have been taken to compensate them for crop losses.  This 
process was completed on June 10, 2004, as confirmed by the Ministry of Justice.  The EMP has 
been disclosed in-
country on November 19, 2004 and in the Bank’s Infoshop prior on November 
22, 2004.
