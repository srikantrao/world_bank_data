B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the proposed project is to assist the Government in dealing with the immediate challenges 
arising from the MDG and in improving the relevance of the secondary and higher education systems.  By the end of 
the project, in 2007, the following results will be achieved: 100% access rate reached and maintained in primary 
education, 75% primary education completion rate in 2008, significant reduction in the gender and regional 
disparities, more relevant secondary education curricula and more diversified technology courses in higher 
education technical training.  Moreover, critically for both IDA and the Government, the operation will be designed 
to enhance the overall sector governance and ensure that the public resources needed to sustain universal primary 
education are available and are used more efficiently. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project will be managed by the MINEDUC, for its basic and secondary education components, and by 
the Ministry of Higher education, MINESUP, for its higher education component.  The proposed lending instrument 
is a SIL, which will focus on a few objectives and themes of the Cameroon long-term program, which is detailed 
and discussed in the PRSP.  This program is designed around 4 main themes, which focus on access to education, 
quality of teaching and learning, management and partnership, and institutional capacity and governance, as well as 
17 sub-programs, each of them focusing on one key aspect of the sector, such as human resources management, 
curricula development and girls’ education.  Some of these subprograms are well defined and their cost has been 
estimated, but other are still not fully operational.   
 
The proposed lending instrument is a SIL.   
 
There will be no construction under this project. 
 
The following project components are being considered: 
 
Component 1
 : This component aims at reinforcing the administrative capacity and improving the governance of the 
education system.  This will be achieved through support to the decentralization of human resources management, 
Page  2
 
 
the improvement of the performance of the auditing department (
Inspection Générale des Services
) and the 
modernization of the planning and information management function of the Ministry of Education (MINEDUC).   
 
Component 2
.  This component aims at reinforcing the pedagogic functions of the MINEDUC through (i) the 
provision of seminars and teacher training programs, emphasizing the teachers capacity to use standardized testing 
and examination instruments, (ii) the improvement of the frequency and efficiency of the pedagogic supervision 
(
inspection pédagogique
) (iii) restructuring the cycles, modernizing the curricula and the examination system in 
secondary education and (iv) adopting and implementing school health policies in primary and secondary education, 
which aim at improving the teachers and students AIDS awareness and at encouraging behavioral changes vis-à-vis 
the pandemic.   
 
Component 3
.  This component targets the ZEP and aims at boosting the demand for primary education and 
promoting gender equity.  It will support the community-based multifaceted approach to early childhood 
development and primary education which had been piloted in the Northern regions with the help of UNICEF, with 
a view to extending this approach to all the ZEP.  This components relies on NGOs for the provision of training and 
awareness seminars to parents and community leaders, allocation of funds for maintenance of facilities and 
distribution of textbooks and adequate materials to school.     
 
Component 4
.  This component supports selected technological higher education institutes.  It follows up on the 
recently closed and IDA-supported LIL, which established and tested a new model of autonomous institution, IUT-
Douala.  Following the satisfactory conclusion of this LIL the Government developed draft laws and regulations 
which aim at granting a broad scientific and managerial autonomy to all the technology institutes, and to encourage 
their leadership to promote changes similar to those made by IUT-Douala.  This component will provide inputs 
necessary for such a change to take place, including training for managers and teachers, establishment of adequate 
procedures and management tools, twinning arrangements with more advanced institutions, and technical assistance 
for the development of new courses and degrees.  
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be implemented throughout the country, with emphasis on the North, Extreme North and Adamaoua 
regions. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
While Cameroon has environmental regulations, the country's institutional capacity for safeguard 
policies is very limited.
