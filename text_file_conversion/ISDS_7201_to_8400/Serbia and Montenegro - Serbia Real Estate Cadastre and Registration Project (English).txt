A.2. Project Objectives 
The proposed project has the following objective: to increase confidence and lower transaction costs by 
building a more efficient property registration and cadastre system, with the purpose of contributing to the 
development of effective real property markets
.  This will be achieved by improving the real estate cadastre 
system that is operated by RGZ and its branch and local offices.  More specifically the project will support 
the phased transfer of the real property registration system - currently operating in some of the municipal 
courts - into RGZ, as stipulated in the Law on State Land Survey, Cadastre and Registration of Real Estate 
Rights (SSCR Law).  The project will support the implementation of many parts of the SSCR law 
including, establishing a one-stop-shop or window for real property registration and cadastre services, and 
providing access to this information for civil society, government, and the private sector.   
 
To achieve this objective, the project will support both operational development – formation of the REC – 
and institutional development for RGZ.  To achieve sustainability of the integrated cadastre and land 
registration system in RGZ and its local offices, the project will support business process improvement, 
better planning of cost recovery, improving RGZ’s out-sourcing approach, the use of publicity and public 
information campaigns, and support the accelerated transfer of the registry system from the courts to RGZ.  
The project will involve many stakeholders, including academic institutions, the private sector, real estate 
support professionals, and other civil society groups.    
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Operational Development and Support
 
($25.73 million - 86% of the Credit )
  
The objective of this 
component is to support RGZ to speed up completion and maintenance of the REC and deliver quality 
services to all constituencies.   This component will therefore support RGZ to complete the REC in an 
accelerated time frame in the priority urban areas identified, and further develop the ongoing real property

maps for the 59 cadastral municipalities (CM) chosen as the project sites.  The direct beneficiaries of this 
component will be the 59 CMs  chosen, property owners, and other real estate/cadastre professionals.  
However the improvements to ICT, strengthening of secondary transactions and control network 
improvements will benefit all RGZ offices and therefore all Serbian property owners. 
 
Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening
 ($4.27 million of the Credit – 14%) )   The objective of 
this component is to provide institutional development and capacity building to RGZ.   RGZ staff will be 
the direct beneficiaries of this component, however the improvements to business processes, legal 
framework, and customer service will benefit all those who use the cadastre and registry systems.  In 
addition, the public information campaign will have several target groups – cadastre and real estate 
professionals, landowners, and the general public, among others. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
