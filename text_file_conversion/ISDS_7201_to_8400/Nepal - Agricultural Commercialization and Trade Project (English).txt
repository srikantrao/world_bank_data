B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the proposed Project is to 
promote commercialization of the agriculture 
sector and prepare for Nepal’s entrance into the World Trade Organization
. This will be 
achieved through (i) strengthening institutions and systems for export quality control and 
certification; (ii) promote investment in local public goods and access to income-generating 
assets; and (iii) supporting, through adaptive research, extension, and agri-business development, 
a broad based move towards commercial crop and livestock production. Performance in 
achieving the development objective can be measured through volumes of trade that pass 
through certified systems, and growth in value and volume of key high value commodities. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Component 1. Quality Control 
 
The output of this component is a system for testing and certification of agricultural commodities 
to meet obligations of WTO membership. Controls, inspection, and approval procedures need to 
be established to account for different sanitary and phyto-sanitary standards imposed by the 
major importers. A rapid and substantial program of investment in physical and institutional 
Page  2
 
 
infrastructure, including laboratories and testing stations, as well as in human resource 
development is required if the country is to meet the WTO preparedness conditions by January 1, 
2007. Aside from hardware and capacity-building, farmers will need to understand and be able to 
comply with standards. A related component activity could be certification of organic produce, 
to capitalize on the fact that much of production in Nepal is 
de facto
 consistent with organic 
standards, given that use of pesticides and chemical fertilizer is so low. This component would 
be implemented by the MoAC and will finance:  
 
• 
Construction of testing stations and laboratories 
• 
Training and staffing 
• 
Grading and standards development 
• 
Creation of regulatory and enforcement authorities 
• 
Organic certification and brand development 
• 
Policy evaluation and reform 
 
Component 2. Investment in Commercialization 
 
The output of this component will address collective investment needs with respect to local 
public infrastructure and income-generating assets that contribute to production of high-value 
commodities and commercialization of the sector. This component is a matching grant fund with 
two windows. The first will support investment in critical local public goods which will be 
owned and managed by district/village authorities, consistent with local development priorities 
and requiring a cash contribution. The decisions of what to finance and the management of that 
investment will be left to the stakeholders themselves, thus departing from traditional supply-
driven and prescriptive approaches of the past. This will help ensure that investment is 
responsive to the needs of stakeholders is locally oriented, and likely to be maintained in future. 
The second window will be open to associations of farmers, fisherfolk, processors, traders, and 
community associations involved along the supply chain for high-value, tradable commodities. 
These commodities may include citrus, fish, meat, dairy products, spices, tea, coffee, and 
vegetables, based on production and market analyses. Attempts will be made to promote organic 
produce, which capitalizes on Nepal’s traditional practices with low use of chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides, and on Nepal’s potential appeal for consumers. Activities considered may be 
risky and innovative but with potentially high and replicable payoffs. As such, these investments 
would not normally be financed by the commercial banking system. Producer groups will be 
expected to contribute a percentage of the investment value in cash and/or kind to demonstrate 
commitment. Coordination of this component would be through the Project Management Unit, 
but implementation would take place through districts (for local public goods) and producer 
groups (for income-generating activities). This component may finance a set of activities 
including, but not limited to: 
 
• 
Market places, collection centres 
• 
Facilities for storage, processing, drying  
• 
Market access (small roads, bridges, transport, etc.) 
• 
Water resource management (tube wells, small-scale canals, water harvesting structures) 
• 
Crop production (cash crops, improved seed varieties, IPM, etc.) 
• 
Medicinal plants, non-timber forest products 
Page  3
 
 
• 
Livestock production (fodder and pasture development, processing, aquaculture, etc.) 
 
Component 3. Producer Organization and Support Services 
 
The output of this component is an enabling environment for commercialization comprising (a) 
social mobilization for market-oriented producer groups; (b) support for technology development 
and dissemination, as well as marketing information and trade promotion networks; and (c) 
facilitation of financing (particularly for working capital) and risk management associated with a 
shift away from subsistence production. Implementation of this component would be through the 
relevant departments (agriculture, livestock, irrigation) in the Ministries of Agriculture and 
Water Resources, National Agriculture Research Centre, other research institutions, and in 
partnership with existing rural finance institutions. This component will cover: 
 
• 
Social mobilization (i.e. assistance in the formation and operation of a group approach to 
production, processing, and marketing of high value commodities) 
• 
Selective and applied agricultural research (e.g. improved seeds, agronomic practices, 
soil and water management, integrated pest management, packaging, processing, storage) 
• 
Selective knowledge dissemination and technical advice (i.e. to ensure that research 
generated reaches and is adopted by beneficiaries) 
• 
Agri-business development (e.g. policy advocacy, and providing entrepreneurs with 
advice, technical assistance, establishing strategic partnerships, and facilitating access to 
financial packages through appropriate financial intermediaries) 
 
Component 4. Project Management: 
 
The output of this component is a management unit capable of operating on schedule, within 
budget, and focused on results. It will be carried out by qualified professionals, recruited 
competitively, with private sector experience in farmer organization, high value crop and 
livestock production, and agricultural marketing. International TA should be considered given 
the emphasis on global trade and marketing. Monitoring and evaluation will be a critical role of 
the management team, and will include assessments of the economic and financial viability of 
investment under component 2 and of environmental assessment of sub-projects.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Location is not known at this time, other than the likelihood of excluding the Eastern Region, 
which is the focus of a similar ADB project. During preparation, the team will discuss with 
Government the high potential areas for project activities, which will likely include areas in the 
Hills and Terai zones. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
This is not exactly known at this time but the Borrower has experience with many IDA-financed 
projects, and in particular the Ministries of Water Resources and Agriculture have been involved 
in recent projects involving (respectively) irrigation and agricultural research & extension.
