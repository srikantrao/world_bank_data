B.  Project Objectives  
 
1. 
The main objectives of the project would be to:  
·
Re-engage with two utilities the Bank has had a long association with and assist them develop a 
strategy to provide a reliable, sustainable and affordable water supply and sanitation (WSS) 
service to meet the Millennium Development Goal (MDG); and  
·
Support immediate improvements of the WSS and storm water drainage situation in coordination 
with other financing agencies.    
 
C. Project Description 
 
2. 
Dhaka WSS
.
The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has approached bilateral and export credit 
agencies to finance an extension of its main surface water production scheme and the Asian 
Development Bank to improve water distribution.  The main components of the project would be:  
·
The rehabilitation of existing sewers damaged by recent floods to ensure full utilization of the 
existing waste water treatment plant;  
·
The rehabilitation of existing drains and natural retention reservoirs and construction of storm 
water pumping stations;  
·
The improvement of the WSS service in selected slums with the assistance of specialized NGOs;  
·
The updating of the waste water and storm water drainage master plans;   
·
The assistance to DWASA performance improvement plan; and 
·
Should a gap occur in the financing plan of the DWASA water supply program, the rehabilitation 
and extension of the water distribution network. 
 
2. 
Chittagong WSS
.
The GoB has approached bilateral agencies to finance an extension of the water 
supply system.  As there is no concrete proposal for waste water collection and treatment and storm 
water drainage, the project would mostly support an update of the master plans and the preparation of 
Page  2
necessary studies for future investment projects.  The project could include a water supply 
component, should a shortfall occur in the above financing plan. 
 
D.  Project location
 
3. 
The project would be located in the Dhaka and Chittagong metropolitan areas whose 2004 
populations are 13 million and 3.5 million respectively.   
 
4. 
In Dhaka, piped water is available to about 70% of the population, even to the four million people 
living in slums, as there is no other alternative, but water points are always remotely located.  The 
Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (DWASA) currently obtains most of its water from an over 
exploited aquifer; for the future, it envisages developing mostly surface water sources, whose quality 
is rapidly deteriorating due to industrial pollution.  The sewerage network serves less than 20% of the 
population.  Trunk sewers suffered major damage during recent floods and, as a result, only about 
40% of the waste water generated currently reaches the treatment plant.  About 50% of the population 
has no access to adequate sanitation facilities.  Industries are supposed to treat effluents before 
discharging th
em in DWASA’s sewers, but this regulation is seldom enforced.  DWASA is also 
responsible for the underground storm water drainage system and associated pumping stations; 
natural channels and wetlands that help Dhaka cope with storm water flows are rapidly disappearing 
due to urban development.  Public health is affected by the limited coverage of the water supply and 
waste water service and recurrent flooding.  DWASA needs to reduce physical leaks in the 
distribution network, estimated to be about 40% of the water produced.   
 
5. 
In Chittagong, piped water is distributed a few hours per day, affecting both the population, which has 
to rely on wells and tankers, and the many industries located in the city and its export processing 
zone.  Chittagong has no sewerage system: households rely on septic tanks, pit latrines or have no 
sanitation facilities.  Storm water is under the responsibility of the Chittagong City Corporation.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
6. 
GoB procedures with regards to the preparation of Environmental Assessment and Mitigation Plan 
(EA/EMP) and Resettlement Plans (RP), disclosure and public consultation are broadly in line with 
Bank guidelines. However, during the project preparation an assessment of institutional capacity and 
training needs would be carried out.   
 
7. 
DWASA has already implemented four Bank financed WSS projects, that have included, among 
other, the construction of large drinking water and waste water treatment plants.  DWASA, which 
would be responsible for preparing the EA/EMP, is thus used to Bank safeguards policies: the PICR 
for the 4
th
 Dhaka WSS project that closed in 2002 does not identify any particular issues on this 
aspect.  The capacity of DWASA unit dealing with EA/EMP would be further strengthened under the 
project, with the aim to create an institutional framework for environmental and social issues within 
DWASA that can be applied to future projects.  Proposals would also be formulated to create a 
capacity within CWASA to deal with environmental issues under future investment projects. A 
similar institutional framework for environmental and social issues for CWASA would be reviewed.

OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment 
is triggered.  The project would mostly include the rehabilitation of 
existing sewers, drains and natural storm water retention reservoirs and the construction of new storm 
water pumping stations and possibly water distribution pipes.  Thus the EA would most likely focus on 
issues related to the proper organization of construction activities, route selection and right of ways of 
new pipes, drains and sewers and compliance with land use regulations.  Disposal of the sludge generated 
by the existing waste water treatment plant would be reviewed, as would septage tipping conditions city-
wide; improvement measures would be proposed.  The TOR for the preparation of the waste water and 
storm water drainage master plans for both Dhaka and Chittagong would include the preparation of a 
comprehensive EA to support the proposed solutions.   
 
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
 is triggered.  Limited involuntary resettlement is likely to result from 
the storm water drainage program.  Social assessment, in parallel with the EA would be carried out during 
project preparation to assess types of social impacts and risks. Based on the EA/SA, an integrated 
Environment and Social Management Framework (ESMF) would be prepared prior to the appraisal. The 
ESMF will provide policy and procedures for mitigating adverse environment and social impacts, 
including land acquisition and resettlement issues for all sub-projects irrespective of sources of funds. For 
sub-projects earmarked for the first year of implementation, potential adverse impacts will be identified 
and appropriate mitigation plans (EMP/RAP) would be prepared prior to the appraisal of the project.   
Assistance would be provided to DWASA, as needed, during preparation and implementation of the 
ESMF and mitigation plans, as necessary.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

Communication Strategy
.
The project is unlikely to include any controversial aspects.  Constant 
communication with external and internal stakeholders would however take place in connection with the 
need for implementing regular tariff increases, outsourcing of commercial operations and resettlement.  
Specialized NGOs would be closely associated to the design and implementation of the improvement of 
the WSS service in slums.     
 
Environmental Assessment Category

[X] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
It is proposed to place the project in category B, as it mostly includes rehabilitation and limited extension 
of WSS and drainage facilities, none of them being expected to have an irreversible impact on the 
environment.
