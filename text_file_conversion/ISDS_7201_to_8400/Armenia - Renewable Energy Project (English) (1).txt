B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The objective of the proposed project is to increase the production of privately owned distributed 
renewable energy in Armenia in a sustainable manner. The project will achieve its objective by 
developing a sustainable, market-based financial mechanism, a Renewable Resource Fund 
(RRF), and by providing technical assistance to build the capacity of project investors, local 
financial institutions and state agencies to reduce barriers, and create the enabling regulatory and 
market environment for developing renewable energy projects. It is expected that the RRF will 
leverage investments from private investors, commercial banks and other financial institutions by 
demonstrating the financial viability of renewable energy projects and establishing a track record 
of commercially profitable projects.  
 
The benefits from the project implementation will include: 
o
creation of a sustainable mechanism for supporting greenhouse gas reductions; 
o
diversification of electricity generation  and  improvement of safety and security of the 
power system; 
o
improvement of balance of payment through reduction of imported fuel; 
o
involvement of the private sector in power project development; 
Page  2
o
stimulation of growth in rural communities where the projects will be developed through 
provision of economic infrastructure and employment. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project includes the following two components: 
 
A. Technical assistance to remove barriers (indicative amount US$4.0 million of which 
US$3.0 million from the GEF and US$ 1  million from the USAID)
:
This component covers 
the following areas: 
·
Support in preparation of sub-pojects
:
field research of potential sites and development of 
a
Geografic Information System (GIS) database for identification and monitoring of 
potential renewable energy projects; establishment of a one-stop-shop where potential 
investors can obtain complete package of required permits and documents, (including 
development of an interactive website); and financing of feasibility studies, and 
preliminary designs (this can be done by providing matching or conditional grants to 
potential private investors).  The cost-effectiveness of the GIS will be assessed as part of 
the PDF-B grant activites. 
·
Capacity building:
stregthening the capacity of the regulator, the ministry of energy, local 
financial institutions, private investors, local engineering and consulting industry to 
support renewable energy projects. 
·
Improving legal and regulatory framework:
development of procedures for transparent 
and fair resource (e.g. land and water permits, licenses) allocation; further streamlinging 
of the regulatons and procedures for allocation of  permits. 
·
Fund administration:
financing of the RRF set-up and running costs during the first two-
three years.    
B. Financing of investments (indicative amount: US$12 million, of which  US$5.0 million  
from the IDA and US$7 from the EBRD):
The RRF will make loans and at a later stage will provide partial risk guaranties to projects, 
which meet a set of criteria established to ensure that appropriate risk will be taken and the most 
promising projects are developed. The RRF will be founded under the corporate law and the 
recently approved law on non-banking financial institutions, and will be regulated by the Central 
Bank. The RRF will be managed by a supervisory board (board of directors) and a professional 
management , and will operate based on an operations manual, which would be developed with 
the support of the PDF-B preparation grant. The RRF should operate on commercial bases and 
meet OP8.30 requirements
.
The same fund (RRF) will also be used for the implementation of 
Armenia Urban Heating investment component. This approach would allow to diversify risks of 
the RRF, achieve economies of scale, and thus, reduce the operating cost for each project and 
attract better quality staff.

D.  Project location (if known) 
It is expected that Project will finance small and medium scale 
renewable energy projects, primarily generation of wind and hydro energy. Exact locations of the 
sub-projects are not known at this time. Decision on specific sites will be made upon review of 
applications in RRF. The screening process in RRF will involve review of site selection, 
including alternative sites, with particular attention to possible environmental and social impacts 
of the proposed project. It is believed that in most of the cases small hydro-power plants will not 
require construction of dams. The RFF will be provided with guidance on preparing its in-house 
procedures for project screening   aimed at identification of any safeguard related issues.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
There is certain level of institutional capacity for dealing with safeguard issues, however, the 
RFF will be a newly set up organization with no prior institutional memory on neither 
environment in narrow sense, nor safeguards in broader sense. Therefore, a substantial training 
of recruited staff on Bank’s safeguard policies will be needed in early stages of project 
implementation.

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The proposed investments, as a rule, will be small in scale with limited and well 
known impacts on environment, which can be mitigated or eliminated by 
adhering to good construction practice. For  most of the projects, preparation of 
Environmental Management Plan would be required which would describe the 
potential threats and the ways of avoid and/or mitigate them. Also, the EMPs will 
contain provisions for habitat protection and for dealing with archeological 
chance finds. In some cases preparation of more detailed site specific 
Environmental Assessment might be needed. The level of detail will be decided 
during the screening of subproject proposals at RRF.

Involuntary Resettlement
(

It is not anticipated that project would involve involuntary resettlement or land 
acquisition. Should the construction of new pipelines or new power transmission 
lines become necessary, all the effort will be made to route them on the public 
rights of way. Nevertheless, If sub-projects that require land acquisition are likely 
to be funded, a Policy framework will be prepared and will be disclosed in 
country and in Infoshop before appraisal that will be embedded into the 
Operations Manual. The PF will basically spell out the screening mechanism for 
land acquisition and steps that must be taken to ensure compliance with O.P 4.12.

·
No construction of dams would be financed by the project, if any 
investment is closely associated with construction of dams then the OP/BP 
4.37 will be applicable and triggered.  The Operations Manual will contain 
a
set of instructions to be followed by RRF if repairs of existing dams 
would be considered for financing.

OP 7.50 Projects in International Waterways. It is anticipated that Project will 
support construction of a number of small scale hydro-power plants, which will 
not involve neither construction of dams, nor resettlement of people. However, 
most of the rivers in Armenia are trans-boundary waterways, as described in Op 
7.50. A guidance from LEGEN will be sought whether the riparian governments 
shall be notified about the proposed Project. 
Disclosure. Project will adopt two stage disclosure approach. First, the Borrower will  draft a 
general Environmental Management Plan, and land acquisition Policy framework (if OP4.12 is 
triggered) acceptable to Bank, containing description of the likely environmental impacts and 
mitigation measures applicable to renewable energy projects. After the QER meeting, public 
consultations with be held with potential stakeholders and interested national and international 
NGOs. After consultation, the EMP and land acquisition Policy framework would be disclosed 
in country and in Bank’s Infoshop. Later on, each subproject will require a specific 
environmental assessment or environmental management plan, depending on outcome of 
screening of project proposal at RFF.

[x ] FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory): 
The project is assigned the “FI” category because the subprojects will be financed by a financial 
intermediary. At this stage of project preparation neither specific projects nor their exact 
locations are known.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
Most projects are expected to be small hydro turbines in existing water pipes/canals.  No hydro 
dams will be involved. Some project may involve wind turbines. Each subproject will be 
categorized separately and the level for the detail of required environmental studies will be 
decided on case by case basis by RFF in consultation with Bank.  
There will be no “A” category 
sub-projects, 
 
In the course of project preparations consultations will have to be held with other co-financiers 
on harmonization of safeguard procedures in order to avoid unnecessary duplication effort by 
borrower. 
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. 
 
QER is tentatively scheduled for February 2005. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
Preparation of EMP would start as soon as possible after the Project Concept meeting so that it 
can be completed, discussed with stakeholders and disclosed within country and in Bank’s 
Infoshop at least 120 days before anticipated Board presentation.
