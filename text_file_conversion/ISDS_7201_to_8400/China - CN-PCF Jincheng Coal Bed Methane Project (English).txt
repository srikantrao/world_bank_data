I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
              The main objective of the project is to reduce China's greenhouse gas emissions
     through effective and efficient Coal Mine Methane (CMM) recovery and utilization by
     applying the latest technologies in CMM drainage and CMM-based power generation. The
     second objective is to serve as an example as how GHG emissions reduction credits can be
     obtained and traded with regard to a CMM emissions reduction project under the clean
     development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol or similar arrangements.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

              The project would consist of the following four components: (i) improved
     underground CMM drainage systems through directional drilling of long in-seam boreholes
     and installation of CMM gathering and drainage facilities; (ii) the construction of a 120 MW
     power plant composing of about 60 internal combustion engines and associated CMM storage
     facilities; (iii) a double circuits 6 km long 110 kV transmission lines to connect the power
     plant to the existing power grid; and (iv) a capacity building program and consulting services
     for project implementation.

Implementing Agency

         The implementing agency of the project is Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Co. Ltd
(JMC). JMC is a corporatized entity fully owned by the Shanxi Provincial Government. It has a
large operation in developing coal mines, sale of coal, power generation and other downstream
coal businesses. It is also a holding company with five majority-owned subsidiaries and two
wholly owned subsidiaries. JMC will establish an independent subsidiary for the construction and
operation of the CMM-fired power plant.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

                                                                                                       ISDS


             The Shihe mine and the proposed power plant are located in Yinzhuang Village,
    Jiafeng Town, Qinshui County, Jincheng Municipality of Shanxi province. The project area is
    mainly hilly dry-land. It is about 30 km away from the city of Jincheng, 500 km from Taiyuan,
    capital of Shanxi province, and 230 km from Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province.

        The Jincheng area is dominated by heavy industries where environmental quality has
    deteriorated over the past several years. Currently, the Jincheng municipal government is
    implementing various environmental improvement activities with the objective to receive the
    Government's designation of `environmental model city' by 2005. The proposed project will
    not produce any significant environmental impacts. Only some minor ones are anticipated
    during the construction and operational phase such noise, dust, erosion, air emissions from the
    proposed power plant. There are 3 villages scattering from 700 - 1000 m away from the plant
    site and there is no sensitive protected area or cultural property within 5 km.
        The construction of the CMM-fired power plant and associated transmission lines will not
    involve any house demolishing or relocation of households. However, they will involve limited
    amount of land acquisition. According to the survey, a total of 5.38 ha land areas will be
    required, including 5.32 ha for the power plant site and 0.06 ha for the transmission line. Most
    of them are dry-land. For the power plant site, the land acquisition will affect 23 households
    and 85 persons in three villages. For the construction of 110kV transmission line, no land
    acquisition is needed for the existing substation, and only 0.06 ha land areas will be required
    for the construction of 18 towers

any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.


II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.


II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)


II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
             Jincheng Anthracite Mining Group Co. Ltd (JMC) is the implementing agency and
    responsible for safeguard policies. JMC has basic capacity to implement the safeguard
    policies, as it has experience in conducting EA for other infrastructure projects such as coal
    mines and small power plants following national regulations.. However, its experience of Bank's
    safeguards policies is limited although EA regulations in China is fairly close to that of the Bank.
    Since the project is part of the proposed project to be financed by the Asian Development
    Bank(ADB), during the preparation of the project by ADB, external environmental and social
    consultants were hired to assist JMC to implement the safeguard polices according to
    ADB/WB's policies.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.


E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
