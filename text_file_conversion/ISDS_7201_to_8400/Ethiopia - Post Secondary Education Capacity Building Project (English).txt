B.  Project Objective 
 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to expand the number of Ethiopian citizens who have access to a 
quality, well-managed post-secondary education.  Key beneficiaries will be post-secondary age students who 
possess the talents and demonstrated competence to enroll in advanced levels of education.  All Ethiopian 
universities will benefit from the project though base grant funding and, differentially, through competitive incentive 
schemes linked to innovation and performance.  The support mechanisms for TVET are yet to be worked out, but 
beneficiaries will be urban and rural youth seeking to develop job-relevant skills and employers who participate in 
the program. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project will have two elements: support for university education (undergraduate and post-graduate) and 
technical and vocational education.  The project will support faculty upgrading, strengthening of fiscal monitoring 
and administrative capacity,  provide policy support and guidance, enhance the quality of instructional materials and 
supplies, and expand and improve the use of information communication technologies for both instruction and 
administration.  Overall the project will help to expand post-secondary education opportunities by achieving greater 
system efficiency and through more strategic use of human and fiscal resources. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be coordinated by the Ministry of Education in Addis Ababa but will involve all six public 
universities and public TVET institutions and policy making/coordinating bodies. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
Centralized procurement for universities (through EMPD) has been a problem under ESDP.  The Ministry has 
committed to reforming or replacing EMPD as a procurement agency.  Training in financial management/ auditing 
will be part of the service upgrading in the project.  As part of the support to management and administration, 
twinning relationships with international universities will be created and skills audits of existing personnel are

planned early in the process for identifying training needs.  Borrower’s capacity to conduct EAs has been 
satisfactory under ESDP I, but no EA will be required under this project.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues and prepare to 
mitigate them? 
 
None.  Design Team has confirmed with government that no construction will take place under the project.  
Government is in the final phase of their physical expansion of universities.  When expansion is completed this year, 
with their own funds, each university will be able to accommodate 10,000 students, the enrollment cap in the higher 
education strategic plan.  Funds for the  
TVET portion of the project will be restricted to non-construction 
activities with parameters clearly spelled out in the Operational Guidelines which define the elements eligible for 
inclusion in funding proposals. 
  
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed?
