B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The project’s main objective is to support Kosovo’s integration with the regional energy market 
through assistance for implementation of its immediate obligations under the Athens 
Memorandum, namely creation of an independent Transmission System Operator, development 
of a Grid Code, institutional strengthening to participate in the market, and developing a policy 
framework and institutional capacity for utilization of its mining resources.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Main Components
.
The project will focus on two key sectors, energy and mining.  
Component 1: Energy sector 
The energy sector component will comprise of three sub-
components: (i) technical assistance for restructuring KEK to create a Transmission and System 
Operator, develop Gridcode and other technical documents for operation of Kosovo power 
system in an interconnected regional system, develop transmission tariff, (ii) an assessment of 
heat demand for space heating, hot water, and cooking in Kosovo, evaluation of alternative 
energy sources, and policy options for implementation of the preferred alternatives, in order to 
Page  2
rationalize electricity consumption during winter and (iii) a review of retail tariffs of KEK to 
develop a life-line tariff that is consistent with EU Directives and improves targeting of subsidy 
for the poor. 
 
Component 2: Mining sector
The mining sector component will comprise of three sub-
components: (i) creating a mining sector plan and building capacity within PISG to implement 
the plan for both large and small mines,  (ii) technical assistance to small scale mining operations 
(SMEs) to improve economic, operational, and environmental performance, and (iii) 
development of a social policy framework to assist in resettlement and rehabilitation, dispute 
resolution processes for mining-land use conflicts, and integrating mining and community 
development issues.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
This is a technical assistance project.  The consultants will work with several institutions in 
Pristina. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
While the project will improve the institutional capacity of the implementing agencies through 
development of a social policy framework and integrating it into the mining policies and 
regulation, the project is not expected to result into any safeguards issues.
