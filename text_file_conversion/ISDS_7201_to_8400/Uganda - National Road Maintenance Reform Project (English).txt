B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
a) 
The primary objective of the project is to put in place a sustainable national road 
maintenance management system in Uganda capable of achieving financial 
sustainability and of delivering timely and cost effective interventions on the entire 
national road network. 
 
b) 
The secondary objective of the project is to carry out a pilot program of area wide 
performance based maintenance management on a network of about 1500 km in 
Eastern Uganda and to determine how and when the scale up to a national 
program in line with GOU policy could be accomplished.  
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
 
It is expected that the project will be implemented over a period of 7-8 years, broken 
down into three interrelated phase as follows:  
 
Page  2
 
 
Phase 1: RAFU / Road Authority Organization, Design of the Project and Preparation 
of Concession Documents 
(i) Recruitment of additional qualified staff (Project Engineers and Specialists in 
Pavement & Bridge Management Systems) and setting up of all required management 
systems needed to bring the Maintenance Division in RAFU (to be ultimately 
absorbed into the road authority) up to the level required to manage the pilot project.  
 
(ii) Engagement of a management consultant responsible for the detailed design of the 
project under RAFU/road authority supervision. This consultant will elaborate the 
Project sub-network; compile and organize inventory data; collect traffic data; model 
the network using road management tools to both define the network maintenance 
performance indicators and budget. The consultant will then prepare bidding 
documents for the carrying out of the maintenance works, using the template of the 
Bank’s sample bidding documents for performance-based management and 
maintenance contracts. This consultant will also assist with bid evaluation and in 
award of contract during this phase. 
 
The contract will include the full scope of existing maintenance works and required 
upgrading/ rehabilitation works so as to bring the whole network within the project 
area to a maintainable state and will be signed with a consortium of a contractor/ 
consultant.  Specific attention in contract design will be given to generating 
employment opportunities for local consultants and contractors. 
 
Duration of this phase is expected to be 12-16 months 
 
Phase 2: Project Implementation, Stage 1 
(i) Execution of the works under the pilot program in accordance with the contract 
agreement requirements in respect to the quality and quantity of civil works needed to 
maintain the network at the required level of service throughout the indicated period.  
 
(ii) Consultancy services for the supervision and oversight of the execution of works 
may be extended to assist RAFU/road authority in this task. Under performance based 
maintenance contracting, there is a heavy requirement for monitoring – which 
activities may be supplemented by carrying out performance technical audits (quality 
assurance control audits), during the whole life of the project. 
 
Duration of this phase is estimated to be up to 6-7 years. 
 
Phase 3: Project Implementation Stage 2 - Evaluation and Replication
 
 
(i) Carrying out a mid term and an end of pilot evaluation exercise in order to capture 
lessons learned and issues to be considered in the replication of the pilot program and 
the completion of the national plan for performance based maintenance. 
 
Page  3
 
 
(ii) Rolling out of one or more additional area based performance based maintenance 
management contracts on the basis of experience and opportunity (funding not to be 
covered for this component under the current proposed project however). 
 
Duration and timing of this phase cannot be determined at this juncture – it would 
however be expected to start prior to the conclusion of the second phase. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The pilot area wide performance based maintenance contract will be carried out in 
Eastern Uganda and will cover about 1500 km of existing national roads.
 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Institutional capacity has been created under prior sector projects for environmental 
management in both MOWHC and RAFU.
  
Most recently these arrangements have demonstrated 
their efficacy in delivering the necessary assessments, review and ultimate disclosure of the 
environmental and social assessments of various road projects to be undertaken under Phase 3 of 
the Roads Development Program.
