A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the Community Development Project is to contribute to the 
improved use of, and satisfaction with, social and economic services in participating rural 
and urban communities. The project also seeks to (i) improve local governance and local 
capacity; (ii) establish participatory and decentralized mechanisms for selecting, funding 
and implementing rural community investment programs; and (iii) implement basic 
infrastructure in rural communities across the country. The implementing agency of the 
project is the 
Fonds d’Intervention pour le Development 
–
FID.  
 
As a result of the passage of the two cyclones (Elita and Gafilo) that hit the country from 
January to March 2004 the achievement of the development objectives were jeopardized. 
The supplemental credit will therefore cover the cost overrun associated with increased 
number of development targets and hence, higher cost of inputs. The additional financing 
will be used to assist in
the post
-
cyclone reconstruction efforts, targeting communities in 
Page  2
the affected areas.    
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed activities are consistent with the original project objectives and components.  The 
supplemental credit will finance: 
 
Component 1: Transfers of funds to community associations
 
(US$42  million 
equivalent):
 
The supplemental credit will finance 5,507 community sub-projects, 60 
percent of which will be rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure (mostly roofs, windows, 
and upper walls), and 40 percent reconstruction of fully destroyed infrastructure. Sub-
projects will include: health facilities, schools, rural water supply and sanitation, feeder 
roads, bridges, markets, and administrative infrastructure. These works will be contracted 
out by the FID to the private sector and/or to qualified and experienced NGOs, or will be 
implemented by community associations directly wherever the capacity exists.  Works 
must conform to FID’s regular anti-cyclone standards or standards that have received the 
prior approval of the FID (in the case of NGO-executed contracts).  
 
Component 2: Capacity Building Activities
 
(US$0.5 million equivalent).  
Under this 
component, the project will finance: (i) Information, Education and Communication 
(IEC) activities to ensure that communities can manage and maintain the infrastructures 
that will be rebuilt or rehabilitated; and (ii) short training on selected themes such as 
hygiene, prevention of communicable diseases, STIs and HIV/AIDS.  
 
Component 3: Transfers of funds to communes
 
(US$0.5 million equivalent). 
 
On an exceptional basis and 
only if local capacities already exists, project funds will be transferred to communes to carry out 
reconstruction and rehabilitation activities, using small contractors or NGOs.  The limited scope of this 
component is due to the fact that the emergency situation created by the cyclones requires rapid action that 
needs to be implemented without prior or parallel capacity building interventions.  Works completed under 
this componen
t
must also conform to FID’s regular anti-cyclone standards.   
 
Component 4:  Project Administration and Supervision 
(US$0.8 million equivalent). 
The project will mainly finance the following elements under this component: (i) periodic 
technical audits of the works implemented under the supplemental credit; (ii) measures to 
strengthen FID’s capacity to ensure compliance with the World Bank’s environmental 
safeguards; (iii) financial audits; and (iv) incremental operating costs.  
 
Component 5: Social Safety Net Activities
 (US$5.0 million equivalent): 
The 
supplemental credit will finance social safety net sub-projects implemented by accredited 
faith and non-faith NGOs and associations, with the objective of creating short-term 
employment and provide revenues for the most affected families. These activities will 
take the form of food-for-work or cash-for-work under the minimum wage. Eligible sub-
projects under this component consist primarily of rehabilitation of damaged public 
infrastructure that can be implemented using labor intensive techniques (such as feeder 
roads). 
 
Component 6: Cyclone Emergency and Disaster Relief Activities
 
(US$0.5 million 
equivalent): 
This component seeks to improve the living conditions of the most affected 
Page  3
households for six months after the cyclones, including reducing the risk of malnutrition 
through distribution of supplements and rice, ensuring availability of drinking water, 
protecting affected households from risk of disease outbreaks and supporting local health 
services. These 
interventions fall outside FID’s standard range of activities, such as the 
limited distribution of food and non food items. International organizations and NGOs 
will be contracted to implement these activities. Free food distribution will only be 
provided on an exceptional basis for the vulnerable population who is unable to work (for 
a
maximum amount of $200,000). 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Project implementation will take place in the zones affected by the cyclones, including 23 districts that are 
severely affected, 53 moderately affected, and 16 lightly affected (according to FID ‘s assessment).

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Sub-projects to be financed under the supplemental credit will mainly entail rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of social infrastructure. As most of the proposed infrastructure is 
relatively small in scale, the potential adverse direct impacts related to the sub-projects 
are limited. Some potential safeguard risks  identified with ongoing sub-projects include 
inadequate waste management procedures for health centers and schools and lack of 
erosion control measures being used for feeder roads, particularly in areas prone to 
erosion. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
There is potential for cumulative impacts associated with improved access to natural 
habitats and forests via rural roads resulting in habitat degradation.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
To address the safeguard issues, training will be provided to FID staff and implementing 
partners, such as NGOs, local consulting firms and subcontractors on the application of 
good practice measures for environmental protection during the construction and 
operation of subprojects; and on monitoring subprojects for safeguard compliance. In 
addition, the FID will revise the Implementation Manual to comply more effectively with 
the World Bank safeguard policies and provide more adequate guidelines for the 
environmental evaluation of small-scale social infrastructure projects. Appropriate good 
practice measures will be integrated into the subproject technical specifications, and 
additional training is planned for FID staff and implementing partners on safeguard 
compliance. These measures will be financed under the supplemental credit. An 
environment supervision mission will be held six months after effectiveness to assess if 
all the necessary measures have been undertaken. 
 
FID is an autonomous implementing agency that has ten years of experience and 
demonstrated capacity to work effectively. The implementing unit is therefore fully 
capable to assume the proposed safeguard measures, particularly as its capacity will be 
further strengthened through training.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Page  5
Kay stakeholders include communes and community associations. The training that will 
be provided to these implementation partners will include modules on safeguard policies 
and best practice.
