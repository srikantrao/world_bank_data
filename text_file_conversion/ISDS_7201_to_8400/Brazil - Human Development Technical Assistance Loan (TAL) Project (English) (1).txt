A.2. Project Objectives
 
 
The development objective of the HD TAL is to assist the government in developing 
institutional capacity to monitor the progress and impact of its social policies, a critical 
step towards institutionalizing performance-based management.  Developing a culture of 
monitoring, evaluation, and informed policy-making is in the interest of both policy 
makers (who will make better informed decisions) and stakeholders (who will be assured 
of better targeted and more efficient social programs). This requires improving the 
quality and depth of available information, increasing accountability, and improving 
governance systems in the social sectors by creating a feedback mechanism under which 
monitoring, evaluation and research programs are used to formulate policies. This 
objective is a deliberate choice among several options, and is the result of identifying the 
most effective medium-term activity for achieving more equitable, efficient and quality 
social programs. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual integration between the HD PSRL 
conceptual framework and the proposed HD TAL assistance strategy.

Figure 2: HD PSRL and HD TAL Integrated Design 
 
 
The specific development objectives of the TAL are to: 
 
\01\02
Enhance monitoring processes and systems, including the systematic collection
of thorough data on social indicators, to permit: (i) stronger, more integrated
and continuous assessment of progress on social programs and policies, and (ii) 
use of performance information in resource allocation decision-making.
 
 
\01\02
Support the development of systematic research and evaluation of the impact of
health, education and social protection policies and reforms as a means toward
institutionalizing a results-oriented culture of accountability in public organizations 
responsible for social sector service delivery. 
 
\01\02
Support the institutional reform agenda as specified by the HD PSRL. 
 
The process of establishing a culture of performance–based management in the social 
sectors is long and complex, and the HD TAL will contribute with critical elements to 
enable the Brazilian Government to aggressively move towards this goal.  Specifically,  
as a result of this Technical Assistance Loan, data availability will be enhanced by 
collecting new critical information with more regularity; relevance and utilization of data 
will be improved through the creation of an institutional vehicle (Social Statistics 
Committee) for deliberation and feedback; monitoring of key education policies will be 
strengthened through the integrated monitoring system to be set up at the Ministry of 
Education; and impact evaluation of health policies will be completed, to guide decision-
making and adjust health programs as needed. Altogether, the Government will have 
stronger information and a sound framework to enhance is assessment of the impact and 
cost-effectiveness of its social policies. Similarly, the Bank will benefit from this 
framework to conduct similar assessments on its contribution to Brazil in the social 
sectors

After the first year of President Lula’s administration, during which important 
benchmarks were achieved on macro-economic stability, Brazil’s attention is now 
focused on the social agenda. Thus, demonstrating progress and impact is becoming a 
priority for the Brazilian Government. The Bank’s HD portfolio in Brazil has been an 
important instrument to support policy reform in the social sectors in the country. 
Innovative investments in health, education, and social protection have been 
accompanied by strong policy dialogue, AAA, and technical assistance, under the 
umbrella of the HD PSRL series which provide the overall framework for reform. Thus, 
the HD PSRL and its corresponding HD TAL are very timely and important instruments 
to assist the Government in maintaining a long-term reform vision while tracking social 
policy implementation progress and impact.  Figure 1 graphically portrays the 
coordinated strategy for assistance in the social sectors, and within it, the strategic role of 
the PSRL series and the proposed HD TAL.

The HD PSRL was prepared as the first of a programmatic operation involving three 
phases and several corresponding technical assistance loans (TALs). Each project’s 
accompanying TAL is designed to provide appropriate tools and technical assistance for 
the Government to progress to subsequent loans of the HD PSRL. The first loan of the 
PSRL series acknowledged Brazil’s achievements in human development, supports the 
continuity of the most effective programs, and protects the budget of these programs, in 
accordance with the recently approved CAS (December 9, 2003). While it is too soon to 
be more specific regarding the second and third HD PSRL structure, it is expected that 
the second loan will stren

flexibility regarding the mechanisms the Government may employ to deliver the 
particular policy or pursue the chosen objective. The third operation is expected to further 
institutionalize and consolidate these policy reforms. The PSRL and TAL programs 
engage the administration in a sustained dialogue on social policies and programs that 
have proven to be effective. These reforms, which involve effective targeting, 
redistribution of resources to benefit the poor, transparent allocation of resources based 
on capitation, and successful conditional cash transfers, enjoy broad political support and 
are within the implementation capacity of the executive branch.  The basic objective of 
the first HD PSRL is to reduce poverty by improving the quality and efficiency of public 
spending in education, health and social assistance, and protecting the poorest and most 
vulnerable groups from adverse impacts of economic crises.  The increased quality of 
public social spending will enable the Government of Brazil to sustain and accelerate the 
rate of human development in the country while maintaining a framework of fiscal 
responsibility.  As further specified in the CAS, the role of the World Bank in this 
process of reform would be to support vital policy reforms and innovative, well-
p
erforming investments, helping to lift the welfare of Brazilians, particularly the poorest.  
The HD TAL complements the CAS’s results-based approach, providing additional 
support for meeting benchmarks for 2007 and 2015 Millennium Development Goals 
relating to human welfare gains, and social and cultural sustainability.  
 
More specifically, the proposed HD TAL will also entail significant synergies with the 
proposed 
Bolsa Família
 Project, which will provide support to the Government’s flagship 
social program.  The proposed 
Bolsa Família
 project will support the design and 
implementation of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system for the 
Bolsa 
Família
 Program.  For example, the activities to support the strengthening of IBGE’s 
overall household survey system under this proposed HD TAL will provide important 
inputs into this system.  The HD TAL’s support for strengthening monitoring and 
evaluation in education and health would entails valuable inter-sectoral linkages for the 
Bolsa Família
 Program. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1:
  
Strengthening Collection of Monitoring and Evaluation Data for the 
Social Sectors.
  
For the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
, technical 
assistance will focus on enhancing national household surveys (PNAD, PME and POF) 
so as to provide strategic, comprehensive and integrated information for monitoring and 
evaluating the impact of key social sector reforms and living conditions of the Brazilian 
population. 
The principal activities of this component include: (i) creation of and support for a Social 
Statistics Committee that will monitor and evaluate the statistical information demands of 
various government agencies; (ii) technical assistance for the implementation of a second 
Household Budget Survey (POF- 
Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares
) in 2005; (iii) 
support for improvement of existing national surveys including the merging of the current 
household survey (
PNAD-Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra a Domicílio
) data collection 
into one continuous monthly survey, (iv) inclusion of the quickly developing North

support for the development of recurring policy-driven questionnaire modules for 
tracking indicators in social sectors; and (vii) financing of analytical research of the 
results of the 2002/03 POF.  Improving the household survey data collection has the 
added advantage of providing independent tracking for social sector policies, taken from 
a different source than those collected by ministries (which are based on information 
collected from service providers rather than the service consumer).  
 
Component 2:  Strengthening monitoring and evaluation in the Education Sector.
 
For 
the 
Ministry of Education
 the technical assistance will focus on designing and developing 
a ministry-wide information system to track and monitor key programs, such as 
FUNDEF/FUNDEB, FIES, 
Merenda Escolar
, Literacy Program, and SAEB and to 
provide support for sub-national governments in their efforts to launch quality 
educational assessment instruments. This Ministry-wide information system will be 
closely coordinated with IBGE’s data collection, as the latter will provide the principal 
data inputs to the Ministry of Education Information System, completing those data 
collected through INEP in the education sector.  
 
INEP’s continued involvement in improving student learning assessments and program 
evaluation is centered on the task of improving existing instruments, attending to the 
demand of states in developing their own universal systems (to be compatible, where 
possible with the federal-level, sample-based assessments), and improving the 
dissemination and use of existing evaluation systems. The HD TAL complements this 
effort by creating mechanisms by which INEP’s and IBGE’s data can be used in 
decision-making and policy-design processes in the Ministry of Education.  
 
The Ministry-wide monitoring system will provide up-to-date policy feedback 
mechanisms for project implementation agencies and units.  This Monitoring and 
Evaluation Unit will be located in the Executive Secretariat in order to permit constant, 
real-time monitoring of program and policy impact. This vision will be tested through the 
implementation of the TAL and the creation of the M&E unit which foresees the 
continuous monitoring of nine programs that account for nearly 80 percent of the 
education budget (seven of which are included in the PSRL targets for the second phase).  
 
Component 3:  Strengthening and consolidation of Health System reforms.
  
For the 
Ministry of Health
, technical assistance will be directed at: (i) developing effective inter-
government planning and budgetary instruments; (ii) strengthening monitoring and 
evaluation capacity; (iii) reorienting the federal grant transfer subsystem; and (iv) 
supporting measures to improvement accountability practices and quality of care. 
 
Developing effective planning and budget instruments will entail improving existing 
systems and provision of technical assistance for the development of new monitoring and 
evaluation programs.  The creation of these programs will in turn assist in improving the 
equity of federal transfers to the local political level as well as facilitate the introduction 
of systematic monitoring and evaluation. Finally, in order to better respond to patient 
needs and reduce system inefficiencies that result in low quality the project will support 
the continued develo

and costing of treatment protocols and evaluating the quality of care, the project will 
assist in setting standards and institutionalizing quality measurement and monitoring.
