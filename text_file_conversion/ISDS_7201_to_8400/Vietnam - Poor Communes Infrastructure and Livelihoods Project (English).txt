B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The proposed operation would reduce poverty and foster secure and sustainable 
livelihoods for those living in the country’s poorest and most marginal communes. In particular, 
it would enhance performance of GoV’s targeted programs with respect to local-level 
empowerment, transparency and accountability; poverty targeting; and monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E). 
 Expected 
key performance indicators
would include (to be further specified during 
preparation): 
·
Empowerment of local communities and ethnic minorities, assessed against their 
demonstrated capacity in directly managing investments and use of citizen report cards; 
·
Instrumental benefits of empowerment seen in higher quality and cost-effectiveness of 
basic infrastructure investments in participating communes, by comparison with those in 
non-program communes; 
Page  2
·
Poverty targeting as shown by the percentages of poor people included and non-poor 
excluded, and percentage of program investments that reach or benefit the poorest 
quintile of the population; and 
·
Improved process monitoring and impact evaluation mechanisms applied in practice and 
used to inform ongoing implementation. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Alternative financing modalities
.
The proposed operation seeks to exploit a unique 
window of opportunity to work directly with GoV and interested donors in the re-design of and 
support for the country’s NTP for the period 2006-2010. It could support an ambitious SWAp, a 
repeater project, or some hybrid of the two, the choice of which would depend on: (a) the quality 
of the collaborative re-design process among concerned GoV agencies and between GoV and 
donors; and (b) the degree to which GoV and donors reach a common understanding on technical 
design considerations including fiduciary risks and mitigation strategies. For a SWAp to be 
feasible, Bank and other donors would agree to support GoV’s NTP budget. GoV’s own 
implementation procedures would be followed, with appropriate modifications to address jointly-
assessed fiduciary risks. Whether through a SWAp, a repeater project, or a hybrid, the Bank 
would seek to support the same development objectives and apply similar key performance 
indicators.  
 
Preliminary components
.
The following preliminary components are envisaged, although 
detailed technical content would become clear only through the collaborative process of program 
or project preparation: 
Institutional and Human Capacity Building (US$ 15 million):
 strengthening of 
institutional and human capacity, particularly at commune and village levels, in participatory 
budgeting and investment planning, community participation in procurement, construction 
supervision, and O&M. It would also include sensitization and training of higher-level (e.g. 
district) government staff to better equip them to facilitate local development efforts. Public 
information dissemination and awareness-raising campaigns would be supported to ensure 
gender and ethnic minority inclusion, transparency and accountability, with materials developed 
to meet their specific needs (e.g. in minority languages in addition to Kinh). 
Livelihoods Support and Commune-Level Infrastructure Improvement (US$120 
million):  
support for investments in village- and commune-level basic infrastructure and 
activities aimed directly at enhancing the livelihoods of poor households. The balance between 
basic infrastructure investments and improved service delivery would be determined during 
preparation. Early indications suggest that GoV is concerned to see greater support for: 
promoting access to and use of market information; rural and micro-finance including crop or 
livestock insurance; skills training; and start-up investments in support of farmer associations or 
other rural producer groups. 
Monitoring and Evaluation, and Project Support Services (US$ 5 million)
:
support for, 
inter alia
:
(i) a participatory M&E system; (ii) a computerized management information system 
(MIS) permitting tracking of inputs, outputs, and processes; (iv) internal and external auditing, 
including technical/ cost-effectiveness audits as well as financial audits; (v) periodic impact 
assessments; and (vi) development and institutionalization of a complaints-handling procedure to 
enhance program transparency and accountability.

D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Not yet known, since area- and commune-selection would be determined during program 
design. However, improvement in poverty targeting is one of the strategic areas in which Bank 
support would be expected to add value under the proposed program. Recent poverty mapping 
work to the commune level suggests that there are particular concentrations of deep poverty in 
northwestern and northeastern Vietnam, and in parts of the Central Highlands, and these might 
be expected to be included in the proposed program. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Based on ongoing experience under the IDA-supported Northern Mountains Poverty 
Reduction and Community Based Rural Infrastructure Projects, the Borrower has limited but 
growing institutional capacity to apply policy frameworks to ensure compliance with the Bank’s 
environmental and social safeguard policies. 
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[X] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The safeguard policy is likely to be triggered, given that a large number of small-scale 
investments would be made in village- and commune-level infrastructure. While 
individual sub-projects are expected to be small and limited in environmental impact, 
their cumulative impact could be significant. The risks are expected to be technically and 
institutionally manageable, and would be addressed through the application of a program- 
or project-specific Environmental Management Plan and screening procedure to ensure 
that environmental impact assessment is carried out where necessary and to the standards 
indicated. 
[
]
Natural Habitats
(
OP
/

[
]
Pest Management
(
OP 4.09
)
[X] 
Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
This safeguard policy may be triggered, if GoV’s re-designed targeted program(s) for 
2006-2010 continue to include resettlement and ‘sedentarization’ of ethnic minority 
groups. Much depends on precisely how such activities are to be supported, if at all. This 
will be determined during preparation and appropriate mitigation measures applied where 
relevant. Small-scale infrastructure schemes financed under the program could also entail 
loss of small amounts of land, trees, crops or other productive assets for individual 
households, and a Resettlement Policy Framework would therefore be prepared by the 
Borrower during preparation and applied during implementation. 
[X] 
Indigenous Peoples
(
OD 4.20
)
The safeguard policy is likely to be triggered, since the project activities would be 
concentrated in areas of highest concentrations of ethnic minority populations. The 
impact of the project is expected to be strongly positive, in that it specifically sets out to 
promote ethnic minority inclusion in GoV’s poverty-targeted programs. This would be 
further ensured through the application of a program- or project-specific Ethnic Minority 
Page  4
Participation Framework including, 
inter alia
,
public information dissemination and 
awareness-raising campaigns to ensure ethnic minority inclusion, with materials 
developed in minority languages in addition to Kinh.

C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
Interim 
work is planned to be carried out by EASES on Government of Vietnam’s policies and 
programs concerning resettlement and ‘sedentarization’ of ethnic minority groups, in 
order to determine their scope and implications for the World Bank’s social safeguard 
policies. A preliminary report will be made available by the time of the planned PCN 
continuation meeting scheduled for November 2004.
