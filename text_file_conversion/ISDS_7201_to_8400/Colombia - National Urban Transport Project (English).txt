A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overall purpose of the project is to improve long term sustainability, efficiency and quality of 
urban transport in selected cities by assisting the Government of Colombia (GOC) in the 
implementation of the National Urban Transport Program. 
 
Specific objectives of the project are to: (i) implement high quality Bus Rapid Transit Systems 
(BRT) in selected cities; (ii) improve accessibility to the poor through feeder service and fare 
integration  and; (iii) build greater institutional capacity at the national level in order to formulate 
urban transport policies and strategies (regulatory, operational, economic, environmental and 
social aspects), and at the local level for urban transport planning and traffic management
.  
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1- Implementation Capacity Building (USD3.5 million): This component is aimed to 
support: 
  
1) 
GOC efforts to formulate national urban transport programs and strategies that will 
improve public transport services in Colombian cities. This component will incorporate 
activities intended to: (i) define a national urban transport institutional map; (ii) support the 
formulation of a sector policy and the definition of operational, regulatory, institutional, 
environmental, social and road safety strategies within the urban transport and urban 
development context; and (iii) provide support and technical assistance to large and 
medium size cities to identify transit solutions, and to improve traffic management and the 
institutional strengthening of local authorities. This includes the concept design, and the
 
financial and technical structuring of BRTs in new selected cities. 
2)    Improve institutional capacity of the participant cities to ensure adequate implementation of 
the BRTs b

implementing agencies (in charge of promoting the development of BRTs; of monitoring 
and managing the overall BRT operation; and of owning and maintaining the 
infrastructure).  The component also includes the definition of institutional organization, 
technical assistance, equipment and training. 
3)    Development of greater technical and operational capabilities of the cities to implement 
urban development and transport strategies in areas such as land use developments, road 
safety, traffic management, and environmental and social management issues related to 
urban transport projects (EIAs, management plans, resettlement plans, etc.)
 
 
Component 2- BRTs Development (USD244 million):  
This major component will support the 
development and implementation of BRTs and feeder routes in selected medium and large-sized 
cities according with the eligibility conditions previously agreed. Candidate cities being targeted 
for the project include Bogotá, Pereira, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Soacha, Bucaramanga and 
Medellín.  The scope of each specific BRT will depend on the results of feasibility and 
engineering studies for each city.   
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Candidate cities being targeted for the project include Bogotá, Pereira, Barranquilla, Cartagena, 
Soacha, Bucaramanga and Medellín; the individual projects for each city include the development 
of BRT generally in the central areas, where most travel demand is generated, and where activity 
concentrates. There are some critical points in each city which require a close consideration at the 
early planning and design stage; and specially during the infrastructure works.  These include the 
potential effect on historic and cultural heritage sites in Cartagena; on wetlands in Barranquilla, 
Cartagena, and Soacha; on the already stabilized talus slopes in Bucaramanga; on socially 
vulnerable spots such as a market in Cartagena, or a community park in Pereira; and on 
involuntary resettlements in most of cities.

Comments: 
No new roads will be built under the project. All civil works under the project will 
follow closely the alignments of existing roads. The works will include limited land acquisition 
and resettlements. The overall impacts on environment are expected to be minor and confined to 
the construction period. Overall, the project will generate long-term positive impacts, as access 
and road safety is improved, urban space enhanced, and emissions and exposure to air pollutants 
reduced.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. 
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
OP 4.01 
The policy 4.01 is triggered due to the potential adverse environmental impacts associated to the 
construction phase of the project, related to (a) management of materials and waste; (b) restriction 
of traffic flows and access to homes and businesses; (c) increased noise and emission of 
pollutants; (d) management of work camp sites; and (e) interference with urban infrastructure 
(phone lines, piping, electricity wires, sewage). The Task Team performed an initial screening for 
the potential environmental effects of upgrading the bus lanes, and recommended that an 
Environmental Management Plan for each city to be developed as part of the project’s 
preparation.  The elements to be considered should include: (a) housing and business relocation 
needs; (b) potential interruption or limitation in the access to housing and businesses, both 
temporal and permanent; (c) reduction and impact on green areas, parks, and other entertainment 
and public spaces; (d) impact on historic and local heritage buildings; (e) potential deterioration 
of the urban quality of life and potential decrease in the value of property in the neighboring 
areas; (f) potential increase of accidents;  (g) impact and potential interference on urban 
infrastructure (pavement, phone lines, electricity wiring, water pipes and sewage mains, etc); and 
(h) potential unacceptable nuisance during construction (noise, dust, waste, and traffic 
congestion).  
 
To facilitate the development of EMP for each participating city, and ensure quality and 
consistency, Guidelines for Design, EMP, and Monitoring or urban infrastructure projects were 
developed during project preparation, using the existing Guidelines at IDU as a basis. 
Environmental Management Plans will be required for each city to mitigate the potential 
environmental impact on the project sites and surrounding areas during construction, will be 
addressed to all infrastructure works (trunk lanes, transfer stations, and bus stops), and will be 
aimed at integrating environmental criteria into the design phase.  All potential impacts that 
cannot be averted in the design will have to be mitigated through EMPs.  The EMPs will be 
carried out either by the same contractors in charge of developing the final infrastructure designs, 
or as separate studies for each city, in close coordination with the specific designs.  The EMPs 
will follow guidelines to be developed during preparation to ensure consistency amongst cities.

chance finds; (iii) management of borrow materials and sites; (iv) management of wastes and 
disposal; (v) traffic management; (vi) public participation; (vii) management of green areas; (viii) 
risk and occupational health and safety; (ix) management of drainage, pavements and concrete 
structures; (x) management of chemicals, liquid waste, oils, and fuels; (xi) water management; 
(xii) management of equipment and machinery; and (xiii) control of emissions and noise. 
 
The DNP will be in charge of coordinating the development of the EMP for each city and the 
environmental authority at each metropolitan area will be in charge of leading the contracting and 
supervision of their studies.  The Financial Agreements will include provisions for ensuring that 
the EMPs are fully complied with, and that their implementation is properly monitored and 
evaluated.  All bidding documents for the infrastructure works will require not only the EMP, but 
also plans for monitoring their implementation. Pereira has already prepared its EMP and has 
submitted it for Bank’s review. 
 
OP 4.12 
The project intervention triggers OP 4.12, the Resettlement Policy. Despite the positive social 
impacts of the project for the urban population, the project will cause involuntary displacement in 
some cities.  For the above reason, a Resettlement Framework will be developed according to the 
Bank Operational Policy 4.12.  All the cities are aware of the Resettlement Policy of the Bank, 
and the local authorities as well as the responsible institutions are willing to adhere to the 
Resettlement Framework.  Based on this Framework, each city will design Resettlement Plans 
before the bidding process for the construction of the corridors. As for Bogota’s NQS, a Plan of 
Action will be agreed on before appraisal. 
 
OP 4.04 on Natural Habitats, and OPN 11.03 on Cultural Property get triggered due to potential 
impact on wetlands in Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Soacha; and to potential impact on cultural 
heritage in Cartagena. In the first case, the BRTS passes nearby body waters of important natural 
ecosystems. In the second case, there is potential for chance finds when upgrading some of the 
roads in Cartagena. In both cases the project is not inflicting direct impact, but the construction 
works pose potential adverse impacts. To mitigate them, the Environmental guidelines for the 
Design, Construction, and Monitoring of Infrastructure Projects prepared already have the right 
provisions for Environmental Management Plans. EAs for each project should evaluate the 
potential direct and indirect impacts of the project on natural habitats. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project is expected to provide net environmental benefits in the long run, derived from a 
more efficient transport system with lower emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases.  The 
project will invest in upgrading existing urban roads to enable BRT systems in all participating 
cities, which in most cases are linked to urban space improvements in the form of upgraded 
pavements and adjacent green areas.   
 
The project will improve the standards of life of the population of the main cities of Colombia.  
As was mentioned above, due the implementation of the BTR system, and the fare integration, 
families will spend less of their income on transportation.  Additionally, the urban  public 
transport users will have access to a safe and improved transport system.   Families will be able to 
use the money and time that they currently spend in transport to satisfy other needs.  The BRT 
system will also allow the use of mass transportation to the disabled population.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
For developing the RTS, articulated to the whole public transport system, and determine which 
corridors should become trunks and which should remain or become feeders, formal economic 
evaluation has been undertaken of the system as planned. This involved, among others, the use of 
transport planning models to estimate likely flows on the public and private transport networks 
under different scenarios. Therefore, the alternatives selected are the ones offering better 
environmental, economic, and technical conditions in the long run. They also considered existing 
land-use plans and urban development strategies. Potentially adverse environmental impacts will 
result from the construction phase. Involuntary resettlements have been kept to a minimum, in 
order to minimize associated costs.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As described above, the borrower has developed Environmental Guidelines for the Design of 
Urban Infrastructure Projects, for EMP, and for Monitoring related civil works. All cities will 
have to prepare EMPs, following the guidelines. Pereira, the first city, has already prepared an 
EMP for the project. 
 
Also, a Resettlement Framework has been prepared and agreed with the Bank, according to which 
Resettlement Plans will be prepared  for each participating city, before bidding of works. A Plan 
of Action to update the resettlement plan for Bogota NQS will also be agreed on before appraisal. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The project has been extensively discussed during the years of preparation. The cities started the 
process of concept development about 2 years. Affected populations include those living or 
working along the bus routes, informal vendors, users of the bus system, bus drivers and 
operators, and the people traveling by other modes and affected by the new transport 
configuration. Stakeholders involved in consultations during preparation include bus owners, 
private transport associations, local government, and central government officials.  
 
During implementation, collaborating with the government agencies and civil society to share 
information and consultation through periodic workshops and focus group discussions.
