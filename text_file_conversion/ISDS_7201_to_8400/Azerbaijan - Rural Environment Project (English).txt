A.2. Project Objectives 
 
Project Development Objective:
 
The Project Development Objective is to introduce 
improved natural resource management and related economic activities in two 
mountainous areas of Azerbaijan, in order to enhance the ecological quality and the 
sustainable productivity of high elevation forests and pastures.   
 
Global Objective:  
The Global Objective is to protect biodiversity in two globally significant biodiversity 
areas within the Caucasus and Zangezur mountains, and introduce and pilot an inclusive model of Protected 
Area management in Azerbaijan. 
 
The project will contribute to the restoration, protection and management of globally 
significant mountain forest and alpine meadow ecosystems, including a number of 
endemic and endangered species and transboundary migrants.  The main instrument for 
achieving the project objectives will be the establishment of Shah Dag National Park 
(SDNP) and enlargement of Ordubad National Park (ONP).  The introduction of a 
multiple-use Protected Area (PA) model will allow existing residents of the park areas to 
remain in place, retain ownership of their land, and to engage in environmentally 
Page  2
sustainable agriculture and other activities, based on jointly developed zoning and 
management plans.    
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
COMPONENT 1.  National Parks Establishment and Management (US$ 8.72 
million):  
This component will support the legal establishment and expansion of the two 
national parks.  The project will support measures to modernize and improve park 
management capacity and increase participation of stakeholders in both parks.  The 
multiple-use model will be implemented by establishing different management zones 
within the parks, including: core conservation zones, restoration zones, sustainable 
natural resource management zones, tourism development zones, and residential and 
economic development zones.   
 
COMPONENT 2.  Community-level investment in sustainable agriculture and 
natural resource management (US$ 4.21 million):  
This component will assist 55 
communities living inside or immediately adjacent to the two national parks to shift their 
traditional agricultural and natural resource use practices towards more modern and 
efficient approaches that place less pressure on natural resources and ecosystems.  
Communities will develop village investment plans, drawing upon a menu of options 
(seeds, fertilizers, agricultural equipment, small scale irrigation, milk collection and 
storage facilities, artificial insemination services, fencing material for pasture 
management, etc.).  Support will also be provided for community-based reforestation of 
badly degraded municipal and State forest lands and demonstration of fuel-efficient 
heating stoves.   
 
COMPONENT 3.  Rural Enterprise Development (US$ 1.96 million):
 
This 
component aims to stimulate economic diversification in the project areas by assisting 
local entrepreneurs to start or expand small and medium commercial enterprises. 
 
The 
project will (i) fund small mobile business advisory teams to help interested clients 
identify and assess the viability of commercial ventures and prepare business plans; and 
(ii) provide matching grants (ca. $2000-$10,000) to help start up businesses.  Priority will 
be given to activities that are linked to national park objectives.   
 
COMPONENT 4.  Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and 
Communications (US$ 1.78 million):  
This component will support overall 
management, monitoring and administration of the project through a Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU).  In addition to managing the project, the PIU will coordinate 
(i) development and implementation of a communications plan to increase public 
awareness of the project and its objectives; (ii) detailed socio-economic studies to 
improve targeting of project benefits; and (iii) development of a cross-sectoral, multi-
stakeholder tourism development plan for the greater Shah Dag area.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Page  3
SDNP will be located in the Greater Caucasus mountains, and ONP is located in the 
Lesser Caucasus mountains of the Nakchchivan Automous Republic (NAR).  The total 
area of the SDNP will be about 343,000 ha, and the ONP will be enlarged from 12,200 to 
137,000 ha.  The Caucasus mountains have been identified by the World Wide Fund for 
Nature (WWF) as a Global 200 Ecoregion, and by Conservation International as one of 
the world’s 25 biodiversity “hotspots” (the only one in the ECA region).  The Caucasus 
“hotspot” spans six countries and has one of the highest levels of endemism in the 
temperate world.  The flora is particularly rich in endemic and relict plants, with over 
7,000 plant species, of which 4500 can be found in Azerbaijan (along with 600 species of 
vertebrates and at least 14,000 species of insects).  Both the SDNP and ONP include 
elements of important transboundary migratory corridors.   
 
Deforestation, overgrazing and hunting as the three greatest direct threats to biodiversity 
in the Caucasus.   The end of importation of wood from Russia and elsewhere in the 
USSR, the collapse of natural gas supply systems and the presence of large numbers of 
internally displaced people from the war with Armenia, all contribute to rapid ongoing 
deforestation in the project areas.  Overgrazing of pastures at all altitudinal levels has 
become a serious threat in the project areas since the late 1980’s, as growing 
unemployment and declining alternative economic opportunities led to increased herds.
Creation of the SDNP and expansion of the ONP will require and create a mechanism for 
imposition of greater restrictions on natural resource use on the state-owned forests and 
pastures.  Some areas that are particularly rich in biodiversity or vulnerable to erosion 
will be declared fully protected core conservation zones (closed to any habitation or 
economic use).  Certain other areas will be identified as high priority for restoration 
and/or improved ecological and natural resource management.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
 
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.  
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The project is expected to have an overall positive environmental impact by conserving globally and 
nationally significant biodiversity, protecting rare, transboundary ecosystems and the enhancing the 
sustainability of natural resource use in the project areas.  Other likely environmental benefits include: 
reduced soil erosion (improving downstream water quality), flood moderation (protecting downstream 
infrastructure such as roads, bridges and irrigation systems), and carbon sequestration in improved pastures 
and forests.  Barn improvements (sanitation and ventilation) under Component 2 will improve 
environmental health conditions both for livestock and for the people who handle them.   
 
The Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)
undertaken during project preparation identify 
the following potential environmental impacts from the project:  (a) degradation of flora 
and fauna, erosion and waste disposal caused by construction and/or rehabilitation of 
infrastructure within the National Parks, including checkpoints and guard stations, visitor 
centers, roads and trails, etc.; (b) disturbance of wildlife, generation of solid waste, 
overuse or pollution of surface water and various social disruptions due to increased 
tourism/recreational use; and (c) impacts associated with construction, waste disposal, 
over-harvesting of vulnerable species, etc. caused by some micro-projects under 
Components 2 and 3. 
Mitigation measures to address these impacts are outlined in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), 
and will be incorporated into the Project Implementation Plan, and into the Operational Manual for 
Components 2 and 3.  These include assessing proposed construction sites for potential biodiversity or 
environmental concerns, including waste management measures and site clean-up
 
requirements in 
construction designs and contracts, environmental screening of micro-project proposals, etc.  The EMP also 
lays out responsibilities of the MENR and other government agencies, the PIU and micro-project 
beneficiaries.  These include carrying out the appropriate level of environmental screening or assessment, 
and obtaining required clearances and environmental permits and monitoring compliance and impact
.
The Natural Habitats Policy (OP 4.04) 
and the Forest Policy (OP 4.36)
are triggered 
because the project areas include relatively pristine natural habitats, a large part of which 
is indigenous forest, for which management plans will be developed and implemented.  
However, the project will result in improved protection of these areas, not result in any 
destruction or increased exploitation.  Natural areas with high biodiversity value, 
including the existing PAs, will be incorporated into the two new National Parks as core 
conservation areas, and their pr
otection is expected to improve as a result of the project.  
Support for livestock husbandry are not expected to increase livestock numbers in the 
area, as it will introduce and support methods that promote intensified (fodder and stall-
fed) rather than extensive grazing approaches.  There are no important endemic local 
livestock or crop varieties at risk of being displaced by introduction of improved 
varieties.   
 
Although no villages or households will be relocated and land ownership and rights will 
Page  5
not be affected, the W
orld Bank’s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12)
is triggered 
because the establishment/ enlargement and improved enforcement of the two National 
Parks will reduce access to pastures and forests that are traditionally used and important 
for local livelihoods.  In the long term, restoration and sustainable management of these 
ecosystems will benefit the users, but the short term impacts need to be mitigated, as 
detailed in the project’s Access Restriction Process Framework.  These include involving 
local users in park zoning and management planning, phasing in of grazing restrictions, 
and support for developing alternative livestock rearing methods, sources of wood, and 
income sources (including some employment in the parks themselves).  Development 
assistance provided under Components 2 and 3 will be particularly targeted to villages 
that are most affected (those nearest areas which become closed to grazing).  Matching 
requirements for grants will be reduced or eliminated for applicants from the highest 
elevation (poorest and most vulnerable) villages, and for enterprises with particularly 
high social benefits.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project areas have been in economic decline for over a decade, losing both 
commercial enterprises and population as capital and people leave to take advantage of 
better opportunities in the growing oil sector or lowland irrigated agricultural areas.  
While some government investment to improve basic infrastructure and services may be 
expected, there is little risk of a substantial increase in industrial, commercial or urban 
development in these areas.   
 
The long term objective of the project is to develop community/user-based management 
systems and to trigger a shift from traditional, low-input livelihoods based on mining of 
natural resources (forests and pastures) towards more value-added economic activities 
that are less dependent on these resources or use them more efficiently.  This shift can 
involve some risk of negative impacts, such as unregulated tourism development or 
increased pressure on particular species of high commercial value.  The risk of negative 
longer term impacts is mitigated by the establishment of the national parks, under the 
overall jurisdiction of the MENR.  This provides a (currently absent) legal and 
institutional mechanisms for planning and regulating development, as MENR has a clear 
mandate to ensure that conservation and environm
ental sustainability objectives are met.  
The creation of a multi-stakeholder Governing Board (which will include local 
communities, environmental organizations and other interested stakeholders) will 
reinforce this mandate, as will educational/outreach and monitoring programs supported 
by the project.   
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The current project design represents the best alternative for minimizing the impacts 
associated with the triggered safeguards.  An alternative design was considered that 
would have created two large, conventional nature reserves that exclude human 
habitation and all economic activities.  This design would have involved relocating more 
Page  6
than 60 villages (over 40,000 people), transferring ownership of private land to MENR, 
and taking large areas of valuable pasture and forest permanently out of economic use, 
perpetuating the unsustainable and increasingly unacceptable 
status quo 
of isolating local 
communities from the valuable resources and economic potential of the Protected Areas 
(PAs).  The current project design minimizes negative impacts on the local population.  
Establishment of large, multi-purpose national parks requires no resettlement or transfer 
of land ownership, and specific measures are being taken to ensure that local users are 
provided development assistance to compensate for any loss in access to pasture and 
forest resources.   
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An Environmental Assessment/Environmental Management Plan (EA/EMP) and an 
Access Restriction Process Framework (ARPF) were prepared during the preparation 
phase of the project.  Extensive public consultations were held during preparation of 
these documents to obtain stakeholders feedback on the project design.  The final 
EA/EMP and ARPF will be made publicly available prior to appraisal. 
 
During project implementation, the Borrower, through MENR and other institutions 
implementing the project, will carry out project-specific EAs as needed under each 
project component.  The requirements and procedures for environmental and social 
impact screening and assessment will follow Government laws (e.g. the Law on 
Environmental Protection, which specifies EA screening and approval procedures), and 
World Bank requirements.  They will be detailed in the Project Implementation Manual 
and subsidiary Operational Manuals, which will be approved by the Bank prior to project 
effectiveness.  The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), on behalf of the Borrower, will 
report on the status of all EAs carried out under the project.  The PIU will also put in 
place a program to monitor socio-economic impacts of the project.  The results will be 
used to modify project components and implementation where needed, for example to 
address the needs of any subgroups (e.g. women, youth, internally displaced people) that 
are identified as particularly vulnerable. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The proposed SDNP area includes some 60 villages with a total population of about 
27,000.  The expanded ONP will include 33 villages (total population about 23,000)
 
located within or very close to the park boundary.  Public consultation during project 
preparation included over 30 meetings in both project areas, involving over 700 local 
stakeholders.  Consultants preparing the project EA/EMP and the ARPF met with local 
public officials, elected municipality leaders, NGOs, representatives of the scientific 
community, school directors and teachers and other community members including 
elders (
aksakkals
), shepherds, farmers, small business owners, handicraft makers, youth 
and women.  
Discussions included communities’ perceptions and concerns, which mainly 
focused on 
restrictions on access to pastures
,
their priorities for development assistance 
Page  7
and mechanisms for project implementation at the local level.  A second phase of public 
consultations will take place in February, 2005, when the EA/EMP and ARPF are 
finalized and publicly disclosed, in accordance with WB Safeguard policies.  This round 
of consultations will focus on proposed mitigation and management options.  The 
consultations will be carried out by the Project Implementation Unit, with the assistance 
of several NGOs that have expressed their willingness to help facilitate such meetings.     
 
Public involvement and participation will continue during project implementation.  The 
project has been designed so that local populations can, to the extent feasible, participate 
in all aspects of park management planning, including the delimitation and demarcation 
of park boundaries, zonation of park areas, the determination of resource-use restrictions 
and compensatory measures, and in the monitoring of both socio-economic and 
biological changes due to project interventions.  The PIU will prepare and implement an 
outreach strategy, and will have local offices in the project areas to facilitate 
communication with beneficiaries and stakeholders.
