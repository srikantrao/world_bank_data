A.2. Project Objectives  
 
The Project Development Objective has been designed be address the existing constraints 
to access, utilization and quality of health services in Tamil Nadu, and thereby contribute 
to improving then health outcomes in the state.  The Project Development Objective is 
“to significantly improve the effectiveness of the health care system, both public and 
private, in Tamil Nadu through: (i) improved service delivery particularly for the poor, 
disadvantaged and tribal groups; (ii) development of effective interventions to address 
key health challenges including non-communicable diseases; (iii) improved oversight and 
management of the health care system; and (iv) increased effectiveness and efficiency of 
public sector hospital services.” 
A.3. Project Description  
The Project will comprise the following four components: 
 
Component I
:
Increasing Access to and Utilization of Services aims to improve access to critical services 
with an intensive package of interventions, including:  
(i) Reducing Maternal and Neonatal Mortality by establishing at least two comprehensive emergency 
obstetrical and neonatal care centers (CEMONCs) in each district that can provide definitive treatment for 
all types of obstetrical and neonatal emergencies, including Cesarean sections. CEMONCs will first be 
established in disadvantaged districts and will act as “hubs” to improve quality of obstetrical care in 
referring facilities. (ii)  Improving Tribal Health by strengthening existing primary and secondary services 
in tribal areas through PPPs with experienced NGOs. (iii)  Facilitating Use of Hospitals by the Poor and 
Disadvantaged by providing counseling and support through a PPP with NGOs and local self-help groups 
to poor and disadvantaged hospital patients. 
 
Component II
:
Developing Effective Models to Combat Non-Communicable Diseases and Accidents 
(i)  Supporting Health Promotion by undertaking population-based health promotion activities focused 
primarily on controlling non-communicable diseases (NCDs) through: (a) policy and advocacy, (b) 
behavior change communications (BCC) interventions through the mass media, (c) community-based 
interventions focusing on enabling environments and targeting specific groups such as women, (d) school
-
Page  2
based health promotion; (e) workplace-based health promotion; and (f) life-style counseling centers aimed 
at controlling cardio-vascular risk factors in district hospitals based on PPPs with experienced NGOs.  
(ii) Pilot Testing Clinic-Based NCD Control by financing large scale operational research, via two pilots, 
for screening and treatment of specific NCDs and risk factors in primary and secondary care settings. (iii) 
Accident Prevention and Treatment interventions will be implemented in close coordination with the 
D
epartment of Transport.     
 
Component III
:
Building Capacity for Oversight & Management of the Health System 
(i) Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation by (a) strengthening HMIS and (b) evaluating & assessing 
innovations including surveys on NCDs, patient satisfaction and quality of care. (ii)  Improving Quality of 
Care through (a) protocol development for improved management of key problems (b) regulation of public 
and private hospitals/facilities by building on the existing regulatory system, and helping GOTN implement 
a
strengthened oversight system for both private and public facilities. (iii) Strengthening Health Care Waste 
Management through implementation of guidelines that call for proper segregation, color-coding, 
transportation, and appropriate disposal. (iv) Building Capacity for Strategy Development and 
Implementation by (a) establishing a Strategic Planning Cell to act as a think tank for the GOTN and to 
conduct studies on important health systems issues; (b) establishing a public-private partnership (PPP) wing 
within the GOTN in order to manage and monitor all the PPP contracts signed under the project; (c) 
conducting a Health Insurance Pilot to explore the feasibility of providing community-based health 
insurance on a reasonable scale and (d) strengthening Project Management with a small increment in 
resources will be required to track progress and carry out procurement and financial management activities 
directly associated with project activities.  
 
Component IV
:
Maximizing Efficiency of the Public Sector to Deliver Essential Services 
(i) Rationalization of Secondary Care Facilities by supporting the refurbishment and upgrading of 
secondary care hospitals including the assurance of basic amenities such as water and electricity.  
(ii)  Rationalizing of Equipment by conducting one time repair followed by implementation of a proper 
maintenance system, much of it through TNSMC, equipment suppliers, and local hospital officials. 
(iii) Human Resource Planning and Development by establishing and implementing staffing norms and 
conducting extensive training of government staff by reputable organizations, likely through a PPP.  
(iv)  Enhancing Management of Public Facilities by: (a) ensuring that hospital  
administrators can effectively use the funds collected from patients and visitors. 
Twinning arrangements with well known private hospitals will also be implemented and 
high performing hospital administrators will be provided with incentives; and (b) in areas 
where public facilities are facing difficulties and no private facilities are available, a 
number of options will be considered and tested, including: the administrator and hospital 
committees being given a limited budget to improve performance, NGOs on a PPP 
operate facilities with the same budget, recruitment of individual hospital managers or 
consultants on a contractual basis linked to performance. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The project will include healthcare facilities in the entire state of Tamil Nadu.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Environmental Assessment (OP
/BP
4.01):  
 
Hospitals and health facilities generate large amounts of biomedical waste, much of which is similar to 
ordinary household waste. Only about 10 - 25% of waste generated from average health care facilities is 
regarded as hazardous.  The wastes of highest concern are sharps (needles, syringes, surgical equipment, IV 
sets etc) and biological and chemical hazardous wastes. Poor management and inadequate treatment and 
disposal of such hazardous waste can have adverse impact on the environment and on public health through 
air, land and water pollution.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20): 
Despite a number of interventions by the state government, the vulnerable tribal community is still unable 
to access basic health care owing to inadequate health service infrastructure in the vicinity, inadequate 
accountability and monitoring of health service delivery to tribal populations, lack of or incorrect 
knowledge dictating inadequate health seeking behaviour and financial constraints in accessing health 
services. Poor database of tribal population based disease burden/health care utilization and special 
problems like sickle cell anemia and malnutrition have rendered the health services ineffective. In the 
absence of measures to address the constraints in tribal communities seeking health care, they will continue 
to suffer high rates of morbidity and mortality.
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
If the infectious and hazardous waste from healthcare facilities are not treated and disposed adequately, 
there can be negative impacts on public health through spread of contagious diseases and on the 
environment through land, water and air pollution. However negative impacts are easily mitigated through 
systematic management of waste from source to disposal.   
 
If the issues related to providing quality health care for the tribal communities by the Government are not 
addressed factors and the tribal populations are not equipped to seek health care, then they will continue to 
have poor health status. However, providing for interventions to address these and also the integration and 
strengthening of existing health interventions like the RCH, the RNTCP, the NLEP and other on-going 
government welfare schemes, will improve the health services and the health seeking behaviour in the 
tribal areas. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
.
NA
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
OD 4.01: Environmental Assessment
:
The GOTN has developed an Environmental Management Plan, referred to as a Healthcare Waste 
Management Plan, under the scope of the Project. The Plan details the outcome and findings of the current 
situation, identifies e
nvironmental impacts related to the project activities, and includes a cradle to grave 
Page  4
waste management plan detailing good practices and procedures for the most efficient management of the 
complete lifecycle of the waste generated at the health facilities. The plan of action will include training, 
awareness and information generation, institutional development, and a reporting and monitoring system. 
Environmentally friendly technology for waste treatment and disposal will also be provided under the 
scope of the project. PPPs with interested NGOs will be set up for waste transportation and treatment; as 
w
ell for the development of training manuals, training of trainers and monitoring/supervision.
 
OD 4.20: Indigenous Peoples: 
A
tribal development plan has been prepared by the gotn which has outlined, based on consultations with 
tribal populations, ngos and local health staff, a broad range of interventions that will provide quality health 
care to the tribals. the effort is to integrate and appropriately
 
strengthen existing health services and 
improve access for tribals to these, while taking up specific interventions under the project. Traditional 
health providers are to be trained and involved in provision of basic health services as part of an action 
research in one tribal district. The lessons will be used to scale-up the activity.   
 
Borrower Capacity: 
 
The Project will be implemented within the Department of Health and the project 
management unit (PMU) will report directly to the Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, 
GOTN. A district project management cell will be established in each district and will 
assist the PMU in local procurement, monitoring, logistics, and training. Oversight for the 
Project will be provided by a State Empowered Committee (SEC) headed by the Chief 
Secretary whilst at the working level, a health sector Program Steering Committee will be 
headed by the Secretary, Health and Family Welfare. Though the GOTN has weak 
institutional capacity to undertake reforms, several institutional strengthening measures 
are planned under the project, including training, HMIS, establishment of a Strategic 
Planning Cell, and a PPP Management Cell to address these issues.       Capacity 
building, both technical and managerial, will be undertaken at all levels.    
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders under the project are end beneficiaries, community groups, NGOs, local authorities, 
private providers, community organizations, government officials, the private sector, academic institutions.   
and health staff, all of whom were part of project preparation.    
 
The draft Tribal Development Plan 
–
translated into Tamil (the local language) was extensively shared with 
different stakeholders and various health centers at the District, Block and Panchayat levels. The  Tamil 
Nadu Government also hosted the document in Tamil and English on its website www. tnhealth.org  in 
February 2004.  The suggestions and comments obtained were incorporated and the Plan finalized.
