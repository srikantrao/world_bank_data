A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the project is to develop the productivity and profitability of the private 
agriculture sector. This would be achieved by facilitating the access of Georgia’s mainly 
small and medium-scale farmers to supply chains, improving the competitiveness of the 
supply chains and strengthen the capacity of selected agricultural and financial 
institutions serving private-sector agricultural market activity. This would increase 
incomes and employment and reduce poverty in rural areas. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project has four components.  
 
Component 1: Agricultural Supply Chain Development (Estimated Cost US$ 4.38 million)  
With the agriculture supply chain development component, the proposed project aims to support the 
development of marketing/supply chains for commodities that have a demonstrated market potential, with 
the view to expand profitable domestic and export market opportunities. The proposed project would also, 
through a competitively allocated Agricultural Supply Chain Development Fund (ASCDF), work with all 
agents in selected, potentially profitable agricultural supply chains to develop and implement a holistic 
strategy for identifying and addressing weaknesses and bottlenecks. The project would also assist farmers 
and communities to deal with commodity supply chains through linkages to farm community programs.

Component 2. Rural Finance Services (Estimated Cost US$ 27.22 million) 
This component aims to increase the capacity of participating financial institutions (commercial banks, non 
bank financial institutions and credit unions) to lend to the farmers, processors, traders and agri-business 
enterprises involved in the marketing/supply chains of selected agricultural commodities by (a) providing 
them with additional capital for lending to agriculture, particularly medium- and long-term loans for 
i
nvestment and (b) strengthening their capacity for sustainable rural lending.
 
Component 3: Institutional Modernization (Estimated Cost US$ 4.0 million
). 
This component would focus on specific key legal and institutional reforms that impact directly on the 
competitiveness of Georgian agriculture and the marketability of its products and enable Georgia to meet 
its international sanitary and phytosanitary obligations. Project interventions would be strategically focused 
on (a) modernizing the legal framework, (b) developing strategies and action plans for institutional 
change,(c) supporting selected programs that fit specific needs of the selected commodity chains and 
(d) continuing to support the land cadastre and registration. 
Component 4: Project Implementation. (Estimated Cost US$ 2.12 million) 
The proposed project would be managed under the umbrella of the existing World Bank Project 
Coordination Center (PCC) within Ministry of Agriculture. The PCC would be responsible for all aspects 
of project administration, including program management, TA, goods and materials procurement, and 
financial control. The day-to-day management of the project would be with the technical Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) within the PCC. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) including representatives 
from government, private sector and donor agencies would provide project oversight and ensure national 
program integration.

Comments:
 Environmental and safeguard issues are foreseen in the investments in agro-
processing and public sector infrastructure (such as storage facilities, collection points, 
wholesale markets and possibly feeder roads), some of which are likely to be 
Environmental Category B and others Category C. There would be no Environmental 
Category A sub-projects financed under the project. Agro-processors would have 
potential environmental impacts from solid and liquid waste emissions, smoke, airborne 
particles and gaseous discharges, transport, and machinery noise that would need to be 
mitigated to National and Bank Standards. Also National safety measures for personnel 
in the vicinity of operating machinery would have to be incorporated. Some investment 
may also involve minor environmental issues related to the use and storage of agricultural 
chemicals, waste management at farms, site preparation for facilities and natural 
resources management in rural areas, including forests, biodiversity, soil and water.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project would not finance any major infrastructure, and sub-projects are unlikely to 
involve the acquisition of land through eminent domain. The project would not directly 
finance purchases of fertilizer and chemicals. Farmers are able, of course, to purchase 
them in the market or through farmer groups. Training would be provided for farmers 
under the project in appropriate application techniques and timing for fertilizers and 
pesticides, as well as handling of residues. This would be expected to contribute to 
reducing the negative impact of increased input use. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
None 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Sub-projects financed through project credit lines must be in compliance with the environmental laws and 
regulations of Georgia and with World Bank safeguard policies. Environmental risk management of sub-
loans would become a part of sub-loan appraisal by the participating financial i
nstitutions (PFI’s). Loan 
officers should be able to verify that sub-loans are in compliance with Georgian laws and regulations and 
would not cause enduring harm to the Georgian natural environment. The Bank environmental guidelines 
require financial institutions to undertake environmental screening of sub-projects. Loan officers (or 
environmental specialists employed by the PFI) would make decisions on environmental and safeguard 
compliance, providing that there are no complex environmental issues involved in the proposal. The 
Environmental Chapter of the OM provides guidelines that would assist PFIs to determine to what extent 
various project activities would affect the environment and to ensure that sub-loan applicants have 
incorporated all necessary measures to keep their proposed sub-projects compliant with Bank safeguard 
policies and Georgian environmental law.  
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
“Environmental Management Plan and Environmental Guidelines for Project Loan 
Activities” has been prepared. The document includes a description of the project, a 
description of possible activities that the project might finance, potential environmental 
issues for each type of activity the project could finance, a description of the guidelines 
the financial institutions would follow in evaluating the impacts of each sub-project, a 
description of the World Bank and Georgian safeguards and EIA systems, and sample 
forms to be used in environmental monitoring. The document has been reviewed and 
cleared by the project environment specialist. It has been translated into Georgian and 
discussed with the staff of Georgian commercial banks and the Georgian Environmental 
Department, whose recommendations have been incorporated in the manual. The 
environmental report has been distributed in Georgia (placed in central and regional 
libraries and credit union offices) and sent to the Info Shop on July 9, 2004.
