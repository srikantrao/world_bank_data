A.2. Project Objectives 
The project aims to assist GOB in the implementation of its Strategic Investment Plan 2003-2010 
(SIP) for the HNPSP.  It will do so in cooperation with a large group of DP through a SWAP of 
support. To achieve these objectives, the program will focus on three major areas: (i) 
Strengthening Public Health Sector Management and Stewardship Capacity
,
including 
development of pro-poor targeting measures as well as strengthening sector-wide governance 
mechanisms; (ii) 
Health Sector Diversification
,
including the development of new delivery 
channels for publicly and non-publicly financed services; (iii)
 
Stimulating Demand
 
of
essential 
services by poor households, including health advocacy and demand-side financing options. The 
project will measure success of its support by a sub-set of the indicators of the SIP. 
 
HNPSP has a particular focus on services geared to the achievement of the four PRSP social 
development goals and targets that are within the mandate of the MOHFW and are likely to 
contribute most to its Millennium Development Goals and emerging HNP challenges: 
·
Reduce infant and under-five mortality rates by 65%, and eliminate gender disparity in 
child mortality; 
·
Reduce the proportion of malnourished children under five by 50% and eliminate the 
gender disparity in child malnutrition. 
·
Reduce maternal mortality rate by 75%; and 
·
Ensure access to reproductive health services to all (PRSP March 2003). 
·
Reduce Total Fertility with a view towards achievement of replacement level fertility by 
2010; 
·
Reduce the burden of TB, HIV/AIDS, malaria and other priority diseases (MDG 2000) 
and begin to tackle newer health threats and improve health risk protection by 
·
Improving emergency services; and 
·
Improving the prevention & control of non-communicable diseases. 
 
Page  2
IDA will measure the success of its support by the same indicators as used in the GOB SIP. The 
results framework will contain some key indicators for inputs, outputs, and health outcomes. 
Some of the outputs will be mayor benchmarks selected to measure progress in the health sector 
reforms supported under HNPSP. 
 
At Appraisal GOB will decide with DP on a results framework which will include targets for 
some key indicators and some major program outputs for the various components, on the basis of 
which disbursements will be made to support the annual work program.  
 
Country Assistance Strategy (2001-03).
The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for 
Bangladesh places special emphasis on poverty reduction and aims to consolidate gains in human 
development by strengthening priority health interventions. To effectively fight poverty it further 
supports the forging of partnerships between the public and the non-public sector and proposes (i) 
exploiting comparative advantages of agencies; (ii) improving regulation and supporting 
community-driven approaches; (iii) fostering private-sector-led solutions and forging partnerships 
for health service delivery; and (iv) improving health sector financing and adopting performance-
based lending.
 
The HNP Strategic Investment Plan (2003-10). 
The HNP Strategic Investment Program is consistent 
with both the CAS and the I-
PRSP, in that it aims to improve the health system’s responsiveness to the 
HNP needs of the poor by: 
 
ƒ
Better targeting of public subsidies to the poor, by increasing community partnership and ownership of 
health services; and by increasing intersectoral collaboration for improved environmental health, 
nutrition, HIV/AIDS, injuries, water and sanitation – in rural and urban areas. This strategy includes 
exploring demand-side financing initiatives (such as voucher schemes and community health 
insurance). It also involves investment in improving staff capacity, motivation and organizational 
commitment to deliver affordable and client-oriented, quality services to the very poor -- both rural and 
urban, including secondary level care. 
 
ƒ
Strengthening the stewardship and governance role of GOB as the coalition builder, pace setter, strategy 
formulator and driver of reform. This policy includes harnessing the comparative advantage of public 
and non-public service providers in the health care system and developing public-private partnerships 
where relevant. It also involves fostering a culture of learning through pilots and establishment of a 
strong and fully functional monitoring and evaluation system with clearly defined input, output, 
outcome and process indicators to track progress over the duration of the program as a key strategy to 
moving towards a more results-based funding approach. 
 
ƒ
A
similar base and high case scenario is apparent in the financing plan for HNP SIP. DPs will provide a 
baseline financial support as a proportion of the total actual expenditure of MOHFW. The proportion of 
DP contribution will increase if agreed upon performance criteria are met, but decrease if the 
expenditures are not realized. The unutilized funds will be channeled to alternative uses for HNP 
services to ensure full utilization of these funds. 
 
ƒ
The HNP SIP is to be widely disseminated in the sector and the country to enhance ownership by the 
local stakeholders. The initial momentum for reform is to be sustained throughout the duration of the 
program via the implementation of a communication strategy. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project will have three components, which are closely interlinked in their 
implementation. While the first component focuses on objectives for service delivery in 
the classical PHC domain and achieving the HNP MDGs, the second responds by 
developing policies and strategies to the ch
anging disease burden due to urbanization and 
Page  3
aging of the population. The third component addresses major policy reforms and 
strategies envisioned in order to achieve more overall equity and efficiency in the HNP 
sector.   
 
Component 1: Accelerating achievement of health-related MDGs and PRSP strategies 
and of population policy objectives
.
The component supports the delivery of the essential 
service package (ESP). Such a package would focus on (a) reduction of 
maternal 
mortality
,
through public information campaigns to raise awareness about the importance 
of antenatal care and maternity services to reduce problems during pregnancy, labour and 
the postnatal/neonatal period and obstetric complications. Expansion of the skilled birth 
attendance program, a competency-based six-month training on basic midwifery for 
community health workers (FWAs and female HAs).  Strengthening emergency obstetric 
services, as foreseen in the 2001 National Strategy for Maternal Health, by properly 
equipping and staffing  EmOC services. Finally, a voucher programme 
to increase 
demand for maternal and neonatal health services and to insure against the costs normal 
delivery by a skilled provider and emergency obstetric care is being piloted and will be 
expanded under the program as part of a wider strategy to address demand-side financing 
(see Comp. 3).  (b) All the interventions of this subcomponent will also be beneficial for 
the reduction of 
neonatal mortality
.
(c) Reduction in 
childhood morbidity and mortality
 
would be supported by strengthening the routine EPI program, including polio 
eradication campaigns as needed, and scaling up IMCI to a national level after evaluation 
of the pilots. (d) the program will support the following strategies to support maternal and 
childhood 
nutrition
:
(i) public information campaigns to support the important role of 
nutrition at national and community level; (ii) education of families on nutritional needs 
and proper household-level feeding for children; (iii) initiate Infant and Young Child 
Feeding (IYCF) interventions, which promote exclusive breast feeding for 6 months and 
continue breastfeeding until 2 years with appropriate complementary feeding;  (iv) 
strengthen the community IMCI package and linking it with regular health services; (v) 
further improve the coverage of vitamin-A supplementation every six month for all 
children 1-5 years of age; (vi) improve iron folate supplementation for adolescent girls 
and pregnant women, and (vii) IDD control through salt iodization. (e) 
Reducing fertility 
to replacement level (by 2015)  through public information campaigns and service quality 
improvements, by increasing selective outreach services  to urban slums and other hard-
to-reach and low-performing areas, and by actively promoting cross-sectoral efforts to 
provide alternative roles to young women outside of early marriage and childbearing. (f) 
Reducing the burden of TB and malaria and preventing and controlling HIV/AIDS. 
For TB, MOHFW will focus be on increasing case detection while maintaining a high 
cure rate,  improving the compliance of the private sector and academic institutions with 
the DOTS strategy, and ensure uninterrupted supplies of drugs and laboratory supplies. 
For Malaria, IDA will support the implementation of the Revised Malaria Control 
Strategy, i.e. early diagnosis and prompt treatment (EDPT); selective vector control; 
promotion of Insecticide Treated Mosquito Nets (ITMN); surveillance, information 
management and outbreak preparedness and control; and community involvement and 
partnerships with NGOs and private sector under the Roll Back Malaria whose goal is to 
halve the burden of malaria by 2010. For HIV/AIDS, Bank’s present support through the 
HIV/AIDS Prevention Project (HAPP) will be folded into HNPSP after HAPP closes. 
Page  4
The support will continue to focus on four major components and strategies:  high-risk 
group interventions, communication and advocacy, blood safety and institutional 
strengthening.  
 
Component 2: Meeting emerging HNP sector challenges.
(a) 
Reducing injuries and 
implementing improvements in emergency services
.
The project will support the 
development of policies and strategies focusing on the following areas: public 
information campaigns to improve road, water and industrial safety and to raise 
community awareness of domestic injuries, including injuries due to violence, advocacy 
for violence prevention, medical, counselling and legal assistance to women victims of 
violence, establishment of emergency care facilities in high risk locations, and  publicly 
financed insurance against catastrophic treatment costs, particularly for the poor.  (b) The 
prevention and control of major non-communicable diseases
 (NCD). Five key 
strategies for improving the prevention and control of NCD will be supported under 
HNPSP: an assessment of the disease burden of major NCD and their common risk 
factors should be carried out; public information campaigns to increase awareness of the 
risks of smoking, unhealthy diet and benefits of physical inactivity; improved screening 
for the early detection of obesity, hypertension and diabetes; and improved diagnosis and 
management for the major NCD. Finally, policies need to be developed for publicly 
financed insurance against emergency treatment costs of NCD especially for poor 
families. (c) 
Urban health service development. 
Over the next five years, IDA will 
support MOHFW to move forward on the following fronts: 
improve liaison between DGHS and DFP and municipal authorities; provide clinical staff 
to the Ministry of Home Affairs for prison services; open discussions with MOLGRDC 
with a view to developing an integrated urban health development plan, and consider the 
case and carry out a feasibility study for a Centre of Excellence to be established at the 
National University of Dhaka by 2010. (d) 
Improve the HNP response to disasters
.
A
broad, co-ordinated inter-sectoral response is required. However, within the HNP sector, 
a
number of measures can be initiated quickly and sustained over the next five years: (i) 
improvements in inter-sectoral liaison and co-ordination,  (ii) improvements in co-
ordination within the HNP sector through strengthened communication and co-ordination 
mechanisms within DHS and between DHS and municipal authorities, the armed forces, 
NGOs and civil society, (iii) improvements in the management of emergency stocks, and 
(iv) maybe most importantly the development of a co-ordinated risk management plan, 
including training. 
 
Component Three: Advancing HNP sector modernization
.
This  component will deal 
with: 
 
(a) public 
health sector management and stewardship
 capacity. Improving sector 
management will focusing on improving institutional and personal skills in the following 
functions:  (i) planning and monitoring, in close liaison with the Financial Management 
and Audit Unit, to ensure that PIPs and Operational Plans are prepared in line with this 
Strategic Investment Plan and implemented according to agreed performance indicators; 
(ii) improved budget management through an MTEF process; (iii) reform management, 
including developing reform proposals and design, initiating them and assessing the 
results in terms of efficiency improvements; (iv) improved aid management responsible 
Page  5
for the co-ordination of aid proposals, the proper use of pooled aid funds and the 
provision of activity and expenditure reports; and (v) the management of contracts and 
commissions with private and NGO providers. (vi) information management, most 
importantly the management and HNP information required to monitor the performance 
of the sector and to identify priority interventions to improve its efficiency, equity and 
effectiveness;  improved surveillance systems form part of this area (routine surveillance, 
priority communicable disease surveillance, emergency or outbreak related surveillance, 
institutional surveillance, and sentinel surveillance). 
 
Decentralisation and local level planning. 
Major targets have been established, agreed and accepted for 
the 2003/04-05/06 period covering maternal and infant/child mortality, fertility rates, malnutrition and 
communicable disease control. The next step is to ensure that each of the various departments, directorates 
and administrative bodies that comprise the health sector in Bangladesh understand clearly and agree on 
their contribution to achieving these stated goals, on the basis of step-wise delegation of responsibility 
against agreed work plans and budgets beginning with the management of the recurrent non-staff budget, 
followed by the small-item capital budget, followed by the recurrent staff budget and with it delegated 
authority for staff recruitment and management. Progress to each next step will be preceded by training and 
accreditation and demonstrated competence at each level.  Improvements in organisational and individual 
performance will require capacity building at all levels, which will take time.   
 
An umbrella bill for Hospital Autonomy is in the final stages of drafting.  In terms of decentralisation to 
districts, a pilot programme in six districts represents the first steps in this process. Budgets are being 
prepared on the basis of Local-level Planning with stakeholder participation. HNPSP will provide support 
for capacity strengthening.
 
(b) 
Health sector diversification. 
In order to diversify service provision, MOHFW and 
municipalities need to develop capabilities to become active service purchasers in 
partnership with NGOs and private providers.  MOHFW will begin to tackle this 
important and complex issue, in collaboration with the BMA, NGO networks and private 
sector providers. The pattern of service provision will be adjusted over time by the 
increasing use of contracts and commissions for NGOs to provide primary care in areas, 
where they have a comparative advantage, and for private providers to offer secondary 
and tertiary services for poor people where they can do so cost-effectively and at high 
quality. 
 
(c) 
Stimulating demand 
for HNP services.  This will be achieved through: (i) a greater 
attention on effective communication, education and information strategies for key health 
problems; . public information campaigns, and active multisectoral health promotion to 
deal with determinants of poor health.  The comparative advantage of NGOs and the for-
profit private sector in providing communication services will be exploited to the full; (ii) 
expansion of demand-side financing. This is already included in a number of local and 
community financing schemes.  In addition, an important trial has been started by the 
MOHFW with support from Development Partners, including WHO, in the use of 
vouchers, which allow eligible poor pregnant women to purchase maternal health 
services.  These and other schemes will be expanded in geographical scope and extended 
to other priority services for poor people.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
HNPSP is a nation-wide health sector program, and includes some regional variations, both in terms of 
geography and demographics. The north-east and south-west are hilly areas inhabited by tribal populations. 
Bangladesh is mostly a delta, with massive rivers causing regular floods, which could affect nearly 60% of 
land area and 50% of the population during bad floods (comes once in every 10 years). Land erosion by 
rivers is a major cause of poverty in Bangladesh.  The funnel shaped coastal area is also affected by 
periodic cyclones and tidal waves, causing serious loss of human lives and property. The project 
investments will target all, especially the poor, women and children, tribal, people with disabilities, 
disadvantaged groups,  and people living in disaster prone areas.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Two safeguard operational policies are triggered for this project: Environment (OP 4.01) and 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20).  The impacts related to this project are site-specific and not 
irreversible but require adequately managed mitigating measures to compensate for any adverse 
impacts and to improve project performance.    
 
Tribal population: According to the 2001 census, tribal consist of about 1 percent of the 
population of Bangladesh. Among the tribal groups, majority are Chakma (21%), Marma (13%), 
and Santal (17%). Majority of tribal population (42%) reside in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in 
South west of Bangladesh, others are scattered in the hilly areas of north 
–
Sylhet, Dinajpur and 
Mymensingh. They usually live along side the mainstream population but still with separate 
identity and languages. Tribal population living in rural areas work as agricultural labor and some 
of them are among the poorest. Consultations with tribal groups living in hilly areas and plain 
lands reveal that they are increasingly marginalized and economically deprived, have limited 
access to health and education services due to language barrier and social stigma. They face 
discrimination in accessing social services and resources as indicated by lower literacy rate and 
higher mortality and morbidity. Health care utilization by tribal groups is low due to physical, 
economic and social constraints. Disease burden of tribal is mostly infectious e.g. TB, leprosy, 
diarrhoea, skin ailments and malaria. The major factors behind high disease burden are illiteracy, 
poverty, malnutrition, poor sanitation and access to safe water. They usually are superstitious and 
believe that diseases are caused by hostile spirits, ghosts or taboo and their health seeking 
behavior has not changed due to shortage of health workers working with tribal groups for 
awareness raising, motivation and promotion of modern healthcare. The hilly terrain and dense 
forests also make the delivery of health care services difficult. There are few government and 
missionary health facilities in tribal areas, and these also are unable to ensure adequate and 
reliable availability of medical personnel and drugs. Ministry of Heath and Family Welfare has 
undertaken a social assessment and the Project Implementation Plan includes a Tribal Healthcare 
Plan (THP) for improving the health outcomes of the tribal population. 
Environment:
Biomedical waste can have adverse impact on the environment and on public 
health through air, land and water pollution. However, since only about 10 - 25% of waste 
generated from average health care facilities is regarded as hazardous,  its potential negative 
impacts can be adequately mitigated through systematic management of waste from source to 
disposal. Within the scope of this project, it is proposed that an efficient and sustainable health 
care waste management system (including segregation, storage, treatment and final disposal) will 
be developed and implemented at all the project facilities.  
Civil Works. 
This project would carry out some extensions and/or renovations of health 
facilities. New constructions are not foreseen and no land acquisition is required; the additional 
extension and construction work will only be done on land in actual possession of the government 
and where encroachers and squatters do not exist. The resettlement policy (
OP 4.12)
,
therefore, 
does not apply.
 
If, for extension purposes, private land is donated, proper documentations will be 
required. The waste management plan which has been developed includes systematic procedures 
to ensure that all the civil works will follow applicable construction building codes, including 
those for water supply, sanitation, ventilation, safety and hygiene, as per relevant national codes.

Addressed below.
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A. Tribal Population
.
The project implementation plan includes a Tribal Health Plan (THP), 
which identifies constraints faced by tribal population in availing healthcare services and 
interventions to address their specific health needs by improving access and availability of 
services.  The key development outcomes sought through the THP are increasing healthcare 
services for tribal, change in healthcare seeking behavior and improved health outcomes of tribal 
women, children and men. The Line Director (ESP), together with district Civil Surgeons will be 
responsible for the timely and effective implementation of the THP.    
 
The THP is aimed at increasing the demand for health care services by tribal populations, and 
would include the following activities: 
 
·
Strengthening service delivery at district, upazila hospitals, UH&FWC and Community 
Clinics (CC) located in tribal areas
:
This would include improvements in infrastructure and 
equipment, trained staff, and regular provision of drugs and supplies.  
 
·
Increasing outreach, partnership and referral
:
Convergence with On-going Health Programs
:
In order to address high level of 
malnutrition and potential risk of HIV infection, HNPSP will develop culturally specific 
nutrition and HIV/AIDS prevention programs. These will be implemented at the village 
level in tribal areas with the involvement of informal practitioners as outreach workers 
for treatment and referral.  
 
Contracting of NGOs:
 NGOs will be contracted and trained and given responsibility of 
providing a package of essential curative and preventive care.  
 
Reducing barriers to accessing health care in tribal areas by strengthening satellite 
clinics:
 
Satellite clinics and EPI camps would be strengthened in tribal areas through: (i) 
training of outreach workers in the provision of an essential package; (ii) strengthening a 
referral network between the satellite clinics and public health facilities at the primary 
and secondary level and ensuring adequate follow-up; (iii) strengthening the monitoring 
and evaluation of the impact of such clinics; (iv) enhanced management and supervision 
of the quality of clinical services provided at such clinics.   
 
·
Developing an incentive package for doctors and other medical staff, from public 
and private sectors, to encourage them to work in these areas
:
Another option is contracting 
local private doctors to provide services in government facilities in tribal areas.  
 
·
Training tribal women as health and FP workers and volunteers
:
The project is 
Page  9
proposing to recruit tribal women  as  village level Community Health Volunteers (
Sevika)
,
who 
would be trained to fill the gap between the FWA, FWV and the trained Traditional Birth 
Attendant.  
 
·
Increasing utilization of non-tribal medical systems through appropriate BCC
:
A
Behavior Change Communication (BCC) strategy will be developed and implemented, providing 
information on the services available at various levels and motivating the target groups to utilize 
the services. The actions will include interpersonal communication, audio and visual methods, 
fact sheets, use of tribal language/dialect, and involvement of local tribal artists/cultural groups. 
 
B. Environment
:
MOHFW has prepared a Health Care Waste Management (HCWM) Action 
Plan. The key activity to be carried out under the Action Plan will be the finalization of HCWM 
Guidelines, development of facility specific Health Care Waste Management plans, the roles and 
responsibilities of various departments. Other activities include establishment of institutional 
frameworks at the various levels, implementing a training program for staff and workers of 
healthcare facilities and establishing monitoring and reporting systems. Other activities detailed 
in the Action Plan include support to the implementation of facility specific HCWM Plans, (in 
phases as appropriate) and provision of basic infrastructure, in accordance with the wider system 
enhancement activities under the project   The Line Director (Hospital) will be responsible for the 
timely and effective implementation of the Action Plan and developing long term HCWM 
strategy and Program. Monitoring and evaluation systems will be established for reviewing the 
overall progress of the Health Care Waste Management program and the performance of facilities 
in implementation of their individual Health Care Waste Management Plans.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
A
Social Assessment (SA) study was carried out in Bangladesh to gain operationally relevant 
understanding of the social underpinnings and incentives determining behavior and needs of 
various actors, specially the poor communities, vulnerable groups, tribal popultion, NGOs, 
government and the private sector. The study used qualitative method of data collection such as 
focus group discussions with the vulnerable group population (i.e., women, poor, tribal and 
under-served population), discussions and consultations with the government sector, NGO sector 
and private sector. Quantitative data was also collected from available literature. Relevant social, 
gender and participation issues were identified and incorporated in the project design. Workshops 
were conducted with different stakeholder groups for taking feedback and consensus on the 
design of the program. 
 
For the Environmental Assessment and medical waste issues, consultations were held with key 
stakeholders during an initial assessment of health care facilities. The stakeholders included 
department officials at various levels, health care providers, development partners and NGOs. 
The critical feedback that was received was that there is very little awareness with regard to the 
high risk related to handling of health care waste and the existing systems for implementing good 
practices are weak.
