B.  Project Objectives  
 
1.  The objectives of the project are to rehabilitate and close the four uncontrolled Municipal 
Solid Waste (MSW) dump sites over the next four years in an environmentally sustainable 
manner including control of methane gas emissions to take advantage of Carbon Finance 
opportunities. 
 
2.  The proposed project activity would not only contribute to India’s efforts to curtail 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, but also would result in significant local environmental and 
social benefits. The project will have a substantial demonstration effect for other states 
throughout India where little progress has been made in implementing the Government of India’s 
MSW 2000 Rules for landfill closure.  
 
C.  Project Description 
 
3.  The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) will be closing four uncontrolled MSW dump 
sites over the next four years. MCD has four active dumping sites at Gazipur, Bhalaswa, 
Bhalswa Crossing and Okhla, which at present do not have any infrastructure to collect landfill 
gas emissions. The year of start and the projected year of closing of these four landfill sites are as 
follows:

Bhalaswa Crossing landfill is currently being closed by MCD and may be too small to consider landfill 
gas collection. 
 
4.  All the 4 sites mentioned above fall under the category of uncontrolled solid waste disposal 
facility. Many of the tip faces are steep and unstable and methane generation in the uncovered 
waste piles is spontaneously igniting causing smoldering surface fires. The proposed project 
plans to stop uncontrolled dumping on the site, control fires and re-contour and stabilize slopes 
so that a final cover can be installed and landfill gas emissions brought under control.  There is 
evidence that leachate from the landfills are contaminating surface waters in the vicinity of the 
sites and will be brought under control through the project. 
5.  Although a significant portion of the material in the dumps has already decomposed or has 
burned, it is estimated that considerable amounts of biodegradable material remain, which will 
continue to generate methane after dumping at these sites has been halted.   Appropriate closure 
of the dumps with capture and destruction of methane can produce major reductions in 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the sites.  Closure plans will therefore be designed and 
implemented specifically to reduce these emissions. 
6.  With the assistance of consultants, MCD have prepared a draft Master Plan for MSW 
treatment and disposal in Delhi and the neighboring regions of the State of Delhi . This Master 
Plan includes a number of assumptions about waste quantities, composition and gas generation 
potential that should be reviewed and refined in order to optimize the Plan for GHG reduction 
and earning Carbon Emission Reduction (CER) credits.  It is proposed to undertake this work 
concurrently with the current project, which would then form the basis for a potential second 
carbon credit application to implement the final Plan over the short (5 years) and medium term 
(10 years). 
7.  Options that will be considered and analyzed for closure/rehabilitation of the landfills will 
include conventional waste capping and gas collection systems as well as an alternative Evapo-
transpiration Cover (ET)/bio-filter approach.  The later approach, which is coming into 
increasing use in the US and Europe, is based on the provision of a layer of organic material, up 
to 1m thick, over the final waste contours.  This layer supports the growth of methanotropic 
bacteria which oxidize the methane to carbon dioxide.   Available information indicates that 
inclusion of a high portion of compost material in this layer greatly enhances its methane 
oxidation performance.  Afforestation of closed landfills with native timber species is also part of 
ET landfill cover design. 
8.  Some of the compost plants (with solid waste as input) owned or contracted by MCD are 
running under capacity due to various reasons.  In case the later technical option is preferred, 
these plants could provide the additional compost required for capping the landfills. 
Alternatively establishment of additional composting facilities may be considered if the demand 
or location considerations warrant. A detailed techno-economic feasibility study will be 
undertaken to select the preferred technical option. 
9.  If landfill gas collection proves to be the preferred option, the technical specifications for 
closure will impact on the operations at the landfill leading up to closure. These specifications 
will also be influenced to some extent by the design of the landfill gas collection system, which 
MCD envisages to contract out to the private sector under a competitive design-build-operate 
(DBO) tender. Thus the technical design of the project will be divided into two parts for each 
Page  3
landfill as follows: (1) landfill closure, which will be the responsibility of MCD; and (2) landfill 
gas collection and end-use, which will be carried out by the private sector. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
10. The project is located at four existing MSW landfills sites (Gazipur, Bhalaswa, Bhalswa 
Crossing and Okhla), within the Municipality Corporation of Delhi. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
11. The capacity of the Department of Sanitation of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) 
will be strengthened through the appointment of a coordinator to assist MCD for project 
management, monitoring and evaluation, including safeguard issues.

would be triggered. An environmental and social

environmental and health and safety conditions at the sites and in the adjoining properties. 
Special provisions will be made in the composting operations to control odors and dust emissions 
and to prevent leachate from contaminating local water sources. Closure of the sites with 
provisions for methane capture and control will result in a substantial reduction in other air 
pollutants that are causing health and nuisance problems for nearby residents. Leachate control 
will be achieved by installing a capping system that will prevent rain water from entering the 
deposited waste, but provisions will be made for periodic monitoring of observation wells to be 
installed at critical points around the sites.
