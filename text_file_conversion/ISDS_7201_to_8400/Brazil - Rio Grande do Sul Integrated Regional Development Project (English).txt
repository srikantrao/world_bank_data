B.  Project Objectives 
 
To adopt a territorial approach to development as a means to promote sustainable development 
and poverty alleviation in the least developed areas of the State.  This holistic approach to 
development is expected to identify and address the main constraints to development both in the 
agricultural and non-agricultural rural sectors, as well as define the mechanism required to 
strengthen the technical capacity of the territory to promote development, tap the development 
potential of secondary and tertiary urban centers (as potential regional engines of growth), and 
incorporate social capital as integral part of the State’s development strategy.  Additionally, the 
project would have a catalytic role in as far as it would contribute to concentrate other related 
State programs in the project area to complement project activities (EMATER, SEAI, 
Education). 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
Project Area:  
The project would be implemented in the 14 less developed COREDEs of the 
State, which cover an area of just over 200,000 square kilometers (75.5% of the State’s total 
area), have a rural population of about 1.0 million, or about 57% of the State’s total rural 
population, plus some 2.5 million who live in the secondary and tertiary urban centers in the 
rural areas, thus resulting in a potential project target population of about 3.5 million distributed 
in some 275 municipal areas. These COREDEs generate over 60% of the State’s agricultural 
production and less than 15% of total industrial production, but contribute to about 30% of the 
State’s GDP. 
Page  2
Project Components:  
Total project cost is estimated at US$ 300 million, which will be financed 
through a loan of US$ 180.0 million to BANRISUL, US$ 84.0 million of State Government 
counterpart funding, and US$ 36 million of municipal counterpart funds.  
The project components would be as follows: 
 
a. 
Territorial Development Fund.
 
The Fund would finance four main lines of activities:  (i) 
the development of demand-driven private sector investment projects; (ii) municipal 
investment in infrastructure and services to support the development of private investment; 
(iii) micro-credit to support the transition to commercial farming of beneficiaries who have 
graduated from the RS-Rural Project; and (iv) natural resources management and 
environmental protection measures. 
 
b. 
Investment support activities. 
 These would be activities aimed at increasing the 
sustainability of investments financed under the Territorial Development Fund, and would 
include, among others:  (i) technical assistance for the preparation and execution of 
investment subprojects; (ii) a foundation for the promotion of innovative development 
activities; (iii) training programs for both private entrepreneurs and labor force; and (iv) 
studies to improve policies, regulations and planning. 
 
c. 
Social Inclusion and Poverty Alleviation activities.
.
These would include:  (i) expansion 
of main poverty alleviation activities that so far have been implemented by the RS-Rural 
Project; (ii) technical and financial assistance to promote the development of non-agricultural 
income-generating activities in the rural areas; (iii) technical and financial assistance to 
promote the development of small business; and (iv) municipal investment in infrastructure 
and services to improve quality of life of the poorer segments of the population. 
 
d. 
Project Management.  
The project would finance the creation and operation of a Project 
Executing Unit, which would have as its main responsibility the implementation of project 
activities and the coordination of other relevant State programs which are not financed by the 
project.  Additionally, it would have the responsibility for the development and operation of 
the Project Monitoring and Evaluation System. 
 
D.  Project location 
 
Rio Grande do Sul (RS) is located in the south-western corner of Brazil.  With a total area of 
280,000 square kilometers, or about 3.2% of Brazil’s total area, and a population of about 10.5 
million (about 6% of the country’s total), the State contributes about 8% of Brazil’s GDP and is 
the fourth largest State from an economic viewpoint.  Within the State’s economy, the industrial 
sector contributes more than 36% of value added, the agricultural sector is responsible for about 
13%, while the services sector accounts for the rest. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The project will rely, both during  preparation and implementation, on the capacity developed 
during the implementation of the Natural Resources Management Project (1998-2005).  The 
Project Unit responsible for the Natural Resources Management Project includes specialists in 
environmental assessment, indigenous people, natural habitats and pest management.  The roles 
Page  3
and responsibilities for assessment of demand driven proposals to be managed by project would 
be defined during project preparation. 
 
In addition, the State and the Borrower will hire an environmental consultant to assist the project 
preparation team on safeguard-related issues.  An Environmental Assessment will be conducted 
at the early stages of project preparation, to identify potential negative environmental and social 
impacts, and propose the relevant mitigation measures. 
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Given the demand-driven nature of the project, the specific investments to be made will only be 
determined during project implementation, and for this reason it is still too early to determine 
both the Environmental Category and which safeguard policies might be triggered by the project.  
However, based on past operations of a similar scope and the preliminary ideas of the State and 
the Borrower, this project most likely will trigger the Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 
4.01), and might trigger the Forestry (OP/GP 4.36) and the Safety of Dams (OP/BP 4.37).  The 
State and the Borrower will hire an environmental consultant to assist the project preparation 
team on safeguard-related issues. An Environmental Assessment will be conducted at the early 
stages of project preparation, to identify potential negative environmental and social impacts, and 
propose the relevant mitigation measures.

FI   [X] TBD (to be determined) 
 
If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory): 
 
The project will most likely be classified as “B”.  Depending on the nature and severity of 
potential negative impacts of specific infrastructure to be financed under the project individual 
environmental assessments will be required.  Detailed criteria will be included in the Project 
Implementation Manual. 
 
As part of project preparation, an initial Environmental Assessment will be conducted to 
examine the current capacity of the Borrower to manage the environmental and social issues 
associated with the project, and to evaluate the history of past investments regarding their 
environmental and social impacts.
