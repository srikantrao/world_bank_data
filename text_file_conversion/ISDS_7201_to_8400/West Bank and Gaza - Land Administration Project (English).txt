A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of this project is to assess the feasibility of introducing reforms in land 
administration within an emerging government structure by enabling the formulation of 
policy, legal and institutional changes to achieve efficient procedures for the issuance of 
land titles and registration of property transactions, and transparent processes for the 
management and disposal of public land.  
 
It is envisaged that this project would be the first phase of a long-term Land 
Administration Program, which aims at enhancing economic growth by improving land 
tenure security and facilitating the development of efficient land and property markets in 
rural and urban areas through the development of an efficient system of land titling and 
registration based on clear, transparent and coherent policies and laws and supported by 
an appropriate institutional structure.  
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project aims at introducing reforms in land administration and management 
by way of building consensus, through a broad-based public consultation process, on 
land issues leading to the formulation of a national land policy framework accompanied 
by an action-plan for implementation, and the review and consolidation of the regulatory 
framework governing land administration and enactment of a new land law.  In parallel, 
pilot projects for systematic land registration are intended to test proposed policy and 
regulatory recommendations and inform the policymaking process, activate the demand 
Page  2
for land registration, build existing surveying capacity, test the land title settlement 
process, understand the nature of contested land rights (both those that get resolved 
through the land settlement process and those that remain unsettled) and develop a 
strategy for dispute resolution.  Pilot projects for the modernization of the Palestinian 
Land Authority (PLA)’s functioning are intended to establish and test service standards 
and clarify capacity requirements for the PLA.   
 
Overall, the project is intended to assess the PA’s commitment to reforming land 
administration and the capacity requirements of the PLA, court system, local authorities, 
and the private sector serving the sector, in addition to testing proposed recommendations 
for strengthening the land administration policy, regulatory and institutional framework 
and capacity building strategies. 
 
The project will include the following components: 
 
Component 1: Land Policy Formulation and Development of Regulatory Framework 
(US$1.3 million) 
This component would support consensus building, though consultations and public 
hearings, for the formulation of a national land policy document and an action-plan for 
implementation, and the revision of the regulatory framework governing land 
administration.  Priority land policy areas under study include: (i) land registration to 
identify the registry’s current degree of accuracy and the factors limiting its use, (ii) the 
functioning of the land markets to identify land market distortions and policy options, 
(iii) land disputes and resolution mechanisms, (iv) management and disposal of public 
land to identify reforms in priorities, standards and processes of public land management, 
(v) property valuation, and (vi) the legal and institutional framework for land 
administration to identify areas of legal and jurisdictional ambiguity and/or overlap and 
recommend policy options and improvements to the legal framework.  
 
Component 2: Piloting of Systematic Land Registration and Modern Land Office 
(US$1.9 million)  
This will include: (i) piloting land surveying, systematic titling and registration in areas 
A
or
B
under PA jurisdiction in and around Ramallah, the West Bank, using several pilot 
locations selected respectively in urban/residential, peri-urban and rural areas and 
covering in total some 10,000 dunums (1,000 hectares); (ii) pilot establishment of 
modern land offices in two locations in Ramallah, the West Bank, and Gaza with the goal 
of establishing clear, monitorable service standards through re-engineering office 
functions, staff training, and introduction of technologies to improve efficiency and 
transparency. 
 
Component 3: Piloting of Public Land Inventory and Management Strategy (US$0.70 
million) 
This component would support the establishment of an inventory of public land in areas 
A
and B in two municipalities, one in the West Bank and the other in Gaza, and the 
Page  3
development of a public land management strategy and instruments.  The public land 
inventory would primarily focus on State land, but also on municipal land holdings 
where feasible.  This component would complement the ongoing work financed by CIDA 
and undertaken by the M
inistry of Planning’s Geographic Center and Technical Support 
Directorate involving the digitization of Jordanian cadastral maps (until 1967) and 
development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) database of State lands, along 
with procurement of some computer equipment and staff training. 
 
Component 4: Institutional Development (US$1.7 million) 
This component would support: (i) institutional development to the PLA to be able to 
undertake its mandate efficiently and effectively; (ii) strengthening education programs 
in land administration/management and surveying; (iii) strengthening private sector 
capacity in surveying; (iv) public awareness and community participation campaigns; 
and (v) project management support for both the MOP and the PLA, including 
performance monitoring and evaluation and distillation of the lessons learnt. 
 
Unallocated Funds (US$0.4 million)
 would support: (i) any additional technical 
assistance that may arise through the project; and (ii) any increase in the cost of the 
project components
.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The three locations for the proposed land titling and registration pilots—covering a total 
area of about 10,000 dunums (1,000 hectares)—will be selected in Areas A & B (under 
the jurisdiction of the PA) in and around Ramallah, the West Bank, respectively in 
urban/residential, peri-urban and rural areas.  The exact location of these pilots including 
which villages will be covered will be decided at the early stages of implementation.  The 
selection process will be undertaken in coordination with the key government 
stakeholders (MOP, PLA, local authorities, etc) so as to identify areas that are 
representative of the different territorial conditions (urban, peri-urban and rural) yet 
where the rate of contested parcels is anticipated to be limited, so as not to cause social 
conflict.

Comments:
 
Most land administration projects financed by the Bank are rated C or B (i.e. no environmental impact 
assessment is required), with the rating depending on the size of land titling activities, whether the project 
covers areas close to protected areas or forests, and whether the construction of land office buildings is 
envisaged.  This project is rated C for the following reasons: (i) there will be no new construction; civil 
works will be limited to minor internal office set-ups; (ii) the land titling pilots will only cover a small area, 
totaling 1,000 hectares in three different locations in urban, peri-urban and rural areas in and around 
Ramallah; and (iii) the selection of these pilot locations will be done such as not to trigger other 
environmental safeguard policies such as on forestry (non-existent in the project area), natural resources or 
habitats.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
With its focus on policy, legal, and institutional reforms to land administration in the West Bank and Gaza, 
the proposed project does not trigger any safeguards policies.  Specifically, the project focuses on land 
policy formulation, development of a regulatory framework for land and property rights, institutional 
strengthening and capacity building of the Palestinian Land Authority (PLA), conducting an inventory of 
public land, and piloting of systematic land titling and registration and the re-engineering of office 
functions in the PLA to enhance efficiency and customer service according to established service standards.   
None of these activities is expected to have any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impact.  
 
Even though the general experience with systematic land titling and registration projects suggests that they 
tend to cause or result in social conflicts (contested rights to land between heirs in un-subdivided parcels or 
between owners and tenants, conflicting ownership claims, multiple layers of rights, etc), the current 
proposed project is designed in such a way that ensures detection of potential social conflicts at an early 
stage of the project. This is accomplished through the involvement of a social development specialist in the 
PLA’s Project Management Team who would also be responsible for carrying out a social assessment in 
the piloted areas as well as playing a key role in advising the PLA on dispute resolution and conflict 
mitigation process. First, the scale of the pilot projects for systematic land registration is purposefully 
small, covering a total of 1,000 hectares (about 5,000-10,000 parcels) in three locations selected to 
represent different conditions: an urban/residential area, a peri-urban area, and a rural area.  The three pilot 
locations will be selected in and around Ramallah, in areas A and B that are under the PA control.  The 
selection of the specific locations will be undertaken in coordination with the key government stakeholders 
(MOP, PLA, local authorities, etc) so as to identify areas that are representative of the different territorial 
conditions (urban, peri-urban and rural) yet where the rate of contested parcels is anticipated to be limited.   
 
Indeed, rather than seeking to undertake the most challenging areas where a high volume of contested lands 
is found and where the potential conflict is high, the pilot projects’ inherent aims are to: (i) stress the 
benefits of land titling and registration and thus activate demand for the use of the land registry; (ii) achieve 
tangible results so as to build stakeholders’ momentum towards the project and limit the potential for 
opposition (especially by those special interest groups with a vested interest in blocking the reform 
agenda); and (iii) develop the manuals, tools and capacity for surveying and title settlement.  In addition, 
the pilot projects will provide an opportunity to analyze the nature of land disputes, test the dispute 
resolution and title settlement mechanisms that will be put in place (this includes identifying and 
capitalizing upon the existing semi-formal and informal dispute resolution mechanisms found in Palestinian 
society today), and understand the nature of contested rights to land (both the cases that get settled and 
those that are not settled) in order to explore possibilities for settling these in a subsequent large-scale 
program.   
 
To further reduce the potential for conflict, the project will not
issue land titles to contested land parcels 
that have not been resolved by the settlement process or through the formal and informal dispute resolution 
mechanisms that will be put in place.  Given the uncertainty of the extent of contested parcels until the pilot 
locations are selected and the pilots launched, and in the aim to contain any opportunity that might escalate 
into conflict, it was decided to use a conservative target for the number of titles expected to be issued 
through the pilot projects (60% of all land parcels), although it is hoped that the careful selection of the 
pilot locations will help to achieve a higher ratio of settled and registered titles.  Pending cases will be 
referred to the subsequent phase of the land titling program, which will be launched in the future at a larger 
scale on the basis of the structure developed and tested in the pilots.  The usefulness of the contested lands 
that will be uncovered during the pilots (whether resolved or pending) is in testing the effectiveness of the 
settlement process and the different dispute resolution channels and proposi
ng strategies for more effective 
Page  6
adjudication of rights based on the lessons learnt from the process.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
Not Applicable. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not Applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the Grant Recipient to address safeguard issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
With respect to land titling and registration pilots, in addition to the small pilot size and 
careful selection of pilot areas that would not have a high rate of contested lands in 
consultation with key public officials (as described in Section D.1), other mitigation 
measures are envisaged to minimize any potential for conflict and to build the 
implementing agency (the PLA)’s capacity to address safeguards policies.  
 
To this effect, a qualified social development specialist
will be recruited as a member of 
the PLA-PMT and will play a key advisory and assistance role in the dispute resolution 
and conflict mitigation process. In addition she/he will undertake a small social 
assessment during the first year of project implementation, after the definition of the pilot 
project areas and prior to the launch of the pilots. The social assessment will draw on the 
findings of the land disputes study on the nature of land disputes and conflict resolution 
mechanisms, the analysis of the socio-economic factors and other obstacles limiting 
people’s utilization of the land registry, the feedback obtained by then from civil society 
and community organizations into the land policymaking process, in addition to 
undertaking focus group meetings in the selected pilot areas.  The purpose of the social 
assessment is to inform the pilot projects’ design and the awareness and community 
participation campaigns on how to strengthen, respectively, the settlement/dispute 
resolution mechanisms and demand for registry utilization.   
 
The study on land disputes and the effectiveness of dispute resolution mechanisms, which 
is intended to inform the policy formulation and pilot projects design processes, will be 
completed within months from implementation start so as to inform the pilot project 
design.  The second component of the study on the nature of land disputes encountered 
during the pilot projects implementation and the effectiveness of the titling settlement and 
land dispute resolution mechanisms that were put in place through the pilots, which is 
intended to inform future policy reforms and the design of the large-scale titling program 
and recommend improvements to the titling settlement and land dispute resolution 
mechanisms will be undertaken in parallel with the implementation of the pilots and 
completed shortly after the pilot projects’ completion towards the end of the project. 
 
The PLA—the institution entrusted with the implementation of the land titling and 
registration pilots—was established by decree on June 5, 2002 to consolidate the two 
functions
of surveying (formerly under the Ministry of Housing) and registration 
Page  7
(formerly under the Ministry of Justice).  The PLA employs about 300 staff (200 in the 
West Bank and 100 in Gaza) who have been carried over from their previous departments 
but who lack the necessary training and resources to efficiently implement their expanded 
mandate.  As such, the proposed project will support institutional capacity building and 
training to the PLA and pilots for the modernization of office functions and service 
delivery in two offices.  The capacity building and training of PLA staff will focus on the 
framework and skills needed for the efficient delivery of land titling and transaction 
registration services and will also cover the implementation of safeguard policies 
(including a sensitization on the issues of conflict and resettlement, their causes, 
implications and mitigation framework and measures, operational framework in special 
areas such as natural habitats, protected areas, etc).  The pilots will also support the 
training of settlement officers and the set up of effective dispute resolution mechanisms 
(including the mobilization of effective semi-formal and informal dispute resolution 
mechanisms identified by the social assessment and land dispute studies), including the 
delivery of all training and resources required.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The first project component dealing with formulating key land policies (aimed at 
increasing the rate of land titling and transaction registration, land dispute settlement, 
development of efficient land and property markets, and effective, transparent processes 
for the management and disposal of public lands) and elaborating a corresponding 
regulatory framework relies strongly on a consultative process
.
The land policymaking process includes a series of public consultations and workshops 
with various public, private and civil society stakeholders
(including representatives from 
key government ministries and agencies, parliament, business associations, Chamber of 
Commerce, universities, NGOs, etc) to discuss the findings and recommendations of the 
key land policy areas (land registration, land dispute settlement, land markets, public land 
management, review of the institutional and regulatory framework for land 
administration, etc, which will be studied by local, regional and international expertise).  
The next stage involves broad-based public consultations involving among others 
professional associations, communities, NGOs and civil society organizations
to discuss 
and review the consolidated draft policy document which synthesizes the 
recommendations of the different policy area studies.   
 
The policymaking process will be overseen by a high-level Land Policy Task Force
,
which will be chaired by a senior Ministry of Planning (MOP) official designated Project 
Director and will comprise senior officials from key stakeholder ministries and agencies 
(including Ministries of Local Government, Finance, National Economy, Public Works 
and Housing, Justice, and the PLA) and one representative from each of Legislative 
Council, the private sector and civil society organizations.  The mandate of the Task 
Force is to review policy recommendations, oversee the policymaking process, its 
adoption and recommendations and endorse policies to be forwarded to Cabinet for 
approval.   
Page  8
In the final steps, the revised draft policy document will be submitted with a summary of 
consultations and an implementation action plan to the Land Policy Task Force for 
review and endorsement.  Subsequently, the endorsed policy document and action plan 
will be forwarded to the Cabinet for formal approval and distribution to the various 
government entities responsible for the adoption or implementation of these policies.
