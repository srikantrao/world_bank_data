Component 1
 will finance US$ 11.42 million worth of international and local consulting 
services, training, information systems, and office-related equipment, in three 
subcomponents.  They are: 
1.A   Budget 
Formulation 
Methodology 
1.B 
 
Budget Execution Methodology 
1.C 
 
Financial Management Information System (FMIS)  
This component will yield the following outputs: (i)revised budget legislation; (ii)revised 
Chart of Accounts and Budget Classification System for all government expenditure and 
revenue; (iii)streamlined and strengthened process of preparation on the national budget, 
including standard requirements for budget submissions for social insurance and health 
insurance budgets; (iv)revised methodology on annual budget preparation; (v)increased 
line ministries’ capacity to develop medium-term budget plans within the approved 
policy and resource framework; and (vi)improved medium-term macroeconomic and 
fiscal forecasting capacity in the Ministry of Economy and better coordination with the 
Ministry of Finance and the National Bank on establishing medium-term resource 
framework.   
In the area of budget execution the planned results include: (i)improved expenditure 
management information and improved controls of expenditures throughout the 
Government; (ii)consistency of fiscal accounts data with the GFS standards; 
comprehensive reporting on cash and modified accrual accounting basis; (iii) a warrant 
system preventing overspending and generation of arrears; and (iv) new accounting rules. 
An integrated FMIS will be made operational in 2009 and it will provide comprehensive 
real-time recording of financial transactions through the Treasury system and on/off-line 
electronic data exchange between the Treasury, ministries, central agencies rayon 
financial departments and pilot municipalities.  
Component 2
 will be financed by the Dutch Government.  The Internal control and audit 
component will help develop the system of internal audit based on international auditing 
standards and make audit units in ministries staffed with trained auditors, properly 
equipped and operational by the end of the project.  Some big rayons will also pilot 
development of internal audit units.  The system will be coordinated centrally to up hold 
auditing standards and methodology across the public administration. 
Component 3
 Training Capacity and Training will be financed by SIDA, Sweden. This 
component will help develop the national in-service training system at the Academy of 
Public Administration and actually deliver training in project related areas thus 
developing necessary skills and facilitating the sustainability of financial management
