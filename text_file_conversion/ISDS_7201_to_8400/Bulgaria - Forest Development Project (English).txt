.2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective is to increase the contribution of forests to the national economy and to 
the benefit of rural populations through sustainable management of state, private and communal forests. 
The Global Development Objective is to improve conservation of forest ecosystems through mainstreaming 
biodiversity into forest management, and through improved conservation of critical ecosystems. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1: Strengthen Public Forest Sector Management 
 
The project will support capacity building of the forest administration by assisting in building and 
strengthening nationwide forest extension and inspection services. The forest administration will be 
equipped with a modern national database and information system providing the basis for strategic decision 
making as  well as for monitoring and control of forest management by all actors in the forest sector. 
Capacities of forest professional schools will be upgraded and their training capacities strengthened.  
 
In line with the National Fire Strategy, the project will support various activities aiming at improving the 
forest fire prevention and management capacities. The project will address illegal logging and engage all 
stakeholders in a strategic dialogue to improve forest governance. It will also help to finalize the draft 
national forest certification standard prepared by a National Working Group.  
 
As an innovative tool for improving forest financing the project will help to create the capacity within MAF 
to leverage sustainable financing from Joint Implementation (JI) and Green Investment Schemes. Concrete 
investment proposals for submission to potential donors would result from this activity.  
 
This component will be mainly financed by IBRD funds but GEF will provide incremental funding under 
the various activities to enhance biodiversity conservation in forest management planning and forest 
management.. Of special importance will be the  identification and mapping of high conservation value 
forests and habitats without special protection status.  
 
Component 2: Strengthening Capacity of Non-State Forest Owners 
 
The project will provide support to new private and municipal forest owners by helping to establish a 
national umbrella organization, he Bulgarian Association of Forest Owners.  It will also support the 
establishment of owner associations in those regions without owner representation. This support will 
include the development of guidelines for forest management / business plans for municipal and private 
owners. This component will also include assistance to new forest owners in accessing EU SAPARD funds 
(EU pre-accession funds).   
 
This component will be mainly be financed by IBRD funds but GEF will provide incremental funds to 
address conservation and biodiversity management plans in critical habitats and watershed protection areas. 
A GEF funded small grants program implemented through the State Forest Extension Service and the 
Nature Park Directorates will help strengthen public participation in forest biodiversity conservation and 
restoration of habitats especially in areas adjacent to protected areas.  
 
Component 3: Supporting State Forest Management Transition to Market Economy 
 
The project will finance core investments to enhance and rehabilitate the functions of the forest resource 
base as well as strategic investments linked to the new National Forest Company (NFC) to ensure 
sustainable management of forest and biodiversity resources.  
 
This will include the design and implementation of a GIS based forest information management system,  
supply chain analysis, business planning, business process re-engineering and human resource 
development. Support will be provided for the development of senior management capacity and specialist 
training for HQ and Region staff. The project will support the cost of an international Co-chief executive 
for the first three years to ensure access of international best practice approaches.

There are about 27,000 km of forest roads in Bulgaria. The low road density of 7.9 m/ha (compared to a 
mean road density of 45 m/ha in commercial forests and 9 m/ha in protection forests in Austria) is leading 
to increased extraction costs and environmental damage through partial over-exploitation, driving with 
heavy tractors inside forest stands, non-accessibility in case of forest fires etc. Since only little investments 
in the forest road network have been made in recent years the project would support the (i) development of 
a national forest road master plan  which incorporates environmental and biodiversity aspects (ii) 
development of a Code of Best Practice for the design, construction and maintenance of forest roads and 
(iii) upgrading (about 120 km) and construction of forest roads (about 30 km) in pilot areas identified under 
the master plan including the cost of environmental assessment. 
 
The project will support the thinning of some 10,000 ha in the priority regions. Under the condition that 
carbon credits can be obtained the project will also finance reforestation of 600 ha. It is expected that the 
area of reforestation and rehabilitation of burned and degraded land could be significantly enlarged to up to 
10,000 ha by attracting investors under “Green Investment Schemes” by selling AAUs form the national 
carbon budget. Both thinning and reforestation will generate significant employment opportunities in poor 
and underdeveloped regions. 
 
The project would also assist the NFC in testing and establishing a pilot certification project in State 
forests.  
 
Component 4: Strengthening Protected Areas Managed By the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests 
 
This component will assist, mainly with GEF funding, the strengthening of the system of Nature Parks. The 
project will support (i) office and field equipment to improve the effectiveness of the Nature Parks, (ii) an 
independent annual assessment of the Nature Parks’ management effectiveness as a whole, (iii) priority 
investments and conservation programs in Nature Parks, and (v) preparation of management plans for 
selected Nature Parks and Protected Sites. 
 
This component will also provide counterpart funding of about US$ 1.9 million for an endowment element 
in a Protected Areas Fund (PAF) that would provide long-term revenue to complement direct budgetary 
support for protected areas, including Nature Parks. Through the PAF, the project would support activities 
in) biodiversity protection, restoration, and monitoring in protected areas . (see Section 6 below).   
  
Component 5: Project Management and Monitoring 
 
To provide project oversight and policy guidance during implementation, a Project Oversight Committee 
will be established at the level of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in collaboration with the 
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Environment and the State Forest Administration and NFC. 
 
The project will finance the establishment of a Project Management Unit (PMU) which will assist the MAF 
to implement the project. The PMU will be staffed by a small number of project consultants which will 
assist the MAF’s PMU director in day to day management of the Project, especially with procurement and 
financial management. The PMU will ensure continuity and sustainability of project operation in times of 
institutional reforms and establishing of new structures in the SFA and the NFC.The PMU will monitor the 
progress of the project with support of stakeholders,  provide quarterly implementation reports and activity 
plans and will be responsible for dissemination of project results. 
 
The GEF will finance incremental costs for the implementation of the project to ensure coordination of the 
biodiversity conservation activities under the project. An Integrated Inter-Sectoral Training Program will be 
implemented to broaden and deepen the biodiversity capacity of forest managers in the public and private 
sector.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The project will be implemented nation-wide. Bulgarian forests cover 3.91 million ha or circa 34% of the 
national territory. Ownership is 86% state, 8% private individuals, 5% municipalities with the remainder 
split between religious, schools, co-operatives etc. Approximately 80% of forests are in the mountain 
regions and 85% of streams and watercourses in the country originate in forest lands. Bulgarian forests 
have suffered extensive fires damage over the last 11 years with 133,000 ha burnt between 1991 and 2001. 
Illegal activities in the forests continue to cause concern in civil society. 
Annual harvesting averages some 4.4 million m3 (about 84% of what is envisaged in the forest 
management plans), of which 73% is for the forest industry and 27% for local populations. About 35,000 
employees work in the forest and furniture industry sector. Forestry plays an important role in rural 
Bulgaria as a provider of employment, recreation, tourism, water and public purpose activities. 
Bulgaria is located on the crossroads of three broad bio-climatic regions – the mid-European continental, 
Eurasian steppe, and Mediterranean – which creates a diverse range of transitional climatic conditions. The 
complex topography of mountain ridges, foothills, lowlands, and plains provides a high degree of variation 
in habitats from alpine forest belts, lowland grasslands and river plains to the dune communities along the 
Black Sea coast. The combination of habitat types and biogeography results in a level of biodiversity that 
ranks among the highest in Europe, and includes a wide range of relict and endemic species. 
The priority areas to benefit from the FDP investments in forest roads are not yet selected. A national forest 
road master plan will direct future investments and ensure compliance with environmental values and will 
include a Code of Best Management Practices to maintain ecological values. Within the scope of forest 
road master plan, a methodology and criteria will be developed for prioritizing roading works by taking 
into account forest management plans, harvesting methods, economic and cost benefits, non-timber forest 
products, protection status of forests, areas with high conservation values, fire management requirements 
and effects of illegal logging. 
Criteria for the selection of stands for thinning were agreed at a thinning workshop held for stakeholders 
and exclude areas in protected or high conservation value areas. Priority will be given to stands (a) 
specified for thinning in forest management plans, (b) with roading access, and (c) proximity to markets. 
The FDP will fund reforestation of approximately 600 ha in the project years one and two. A combination 
of economic, ecological and social criteria were developed and agreed as the basis for site selection.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The FDP was screened for its potential environmental impacts and assigned an environmental category A. 
Consequently, an independent EA was prepared during project preparation and adopted by the GoB. The 
EA helped to address the safeguard-related and other impacts and its findings were used to refine the 
project design. 
 
The overall impact and cumulative impacts of the FDP is evaluated to be positive by the EA. Since the 
internationally adopted principles of sustainable forest management underlie the FDP, the production, 
ecological and social functions of forests receive equal consideration and ensure long-term sustainable 
benefits from multifunctional forestry. Environmental issues have been recognized and addressed in the 
design of the project, and mitigation measures have been identified regarding significantly potential 
adverse impacts. The need for complementary mitigation and enhancement measures of environmental 
impacts was summarized in the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) as part of the EA. 
 
Safeguard issues are as follows: 
 
Natural habitats
. The Project area encompasses critical and non-critical natural habitats and activities which 
can potentially have an impact on them. Hence, this Safeguard Policy is triggered. The FDP includes a 
number of activities which will enhance natural habitats conservation (identification of High Conservation 
Value Forests and action plans for their protection and restoration, training of forest actors, fire 
management, restoration of critical habitats in Nature Parks, surveillance of illegal logging, etc.). Adequate 
measures have been incorporated in the project design for forest roads, thinning and afforestation to avoid 
loss or degradation of natural habitats, including exclusion of investments in protected areas and high 
conservation value areas. Therefore, the project will not lead to significant loss or degradation of critical 
and non-critical natural habitats. The project is more likely to enhance conservation of natural habitats. 
 
Forest
. The Bank’s Policy is triggered since the FDP aims to bring about changes in the management, 
protection and utilization of natural forests and plantations. The project incorporates measures to strengthen 
the fiscal, legal and institutional framework. The FDP does not contravene international environmental 
laws. In accordance with the Bank’s requirement on certification to finance industrial-scale commercial 
harvesting operations, the project will fund the finalization of the national forest certification standard, the 
certification of a pilot forest area and training of local assessors. Last, to promote the development of new 
markets and marketing arrangements for forest-related goods and services, the project includes small grants 
for the introduction of sustainable patterns for the use of biodiversity (including non-timber forest products) 
and capacity building to bring carbon credits to Bulgaria. 
 
Pest Management
. This Safeguard Policy applies to all projects involving pest management, whether or not 
the project finances pesticides. In forest management practices, resistance to pest is achieved through 
selecting mixed species adapted to local conditions, realizing timely thinnings to ensure the health of forest 
stands, sanitary felling, etc. On another hand, the project will support the development of a Joint 
Implementation and Green Investment project pipeline. Energy plantation on agricultural land may be one 
constituent of this pipeline. Energy plantations are often monocultures susceptible to pest and fungi 
diseases. Should energy plantation represent a substantial part of this pipeline, the project should take 
potential attacks of pests and fungi into account and prepare a Pest Management Plan during project 
implementation. 
 
Involuntary Resettlement
. The construction and rehabilitation of access roads is envisaged on municipal 
and state-owned land.  Hence, the project does not envisage land acquisition nor expropriations.  However, 
the Involuntary Resettlement policy is triggered due to potential adverse impacts from reduced use of 
ille
g
all
y
 harvested fuel-wood and restrictions of access to forest resources in Protected Areas.  While the 
Page  7
 
 
Social Assessment study and field interviews ruled out the possibility of any households relocating due to 
the restrictions on illegal acquisition of forest resources, it confirmed that the restrictions of access are 
likely to result in a negative impact on the livelihood of some population groups living in the vicinity of the 
forest. The exact location and scale of these activities is not known at this stage.  Hence, the Government 
has developed a Process Framework which will be applied to identify the scale and nature of the adverse 
impacts on livelihoods, their mitigation and monitoring in a transparent and participatory manner. 
 
It should be noted that in none of these areas is there any potential for large-scale, significant, and/or 
irreversible impacts as a result of the project. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
As mentioned, the internationally adopted principles of sustainable forest management underlie the FDP 
and ensure long-term sustainable benefits from multifunctional forestry, i.e. economic (increased value-
added and contribution to the GDP), social (increased employment and sources of income, increased 
recreation value of forest, etc.) and environmental (increased carbon sequestration, watershed protection, 
protection of biodiversity, etc.) benefits. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The “without project” alternative was analyzed and rejected in view of the urgent need to address the key 
issues of the sector. Failure to take action through a comprehensive project would result in unsustainable 
forest management practices, continued degradation of forests and loss of environmental values. Lack of 
biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and employment generation in rural areas would follow, 
and the forests would continue to suffer from high levels of illegal logging. It is unlikely that there would 
be any significantly positive environmental impacts of the ‘without project’ scenario, and the likelihood for 
occurrence of the present negative environmental impacts would remain high. 
 
Reform of the national forest administration is an important element in the transition process of the forest 
sector towards a market economy and Bulgaria’s access to the EU. Without restructuring the 
administration, a lack of resources, corruption and illegal logging would continue to negatively influence 
the forest environment in a manner that would eventually put the overall sustainability of forest 
management in Bulgaria at risk. Three models for the reform of the forest administration were analyzed. 
The model selected by the Government and supported by the project foresees the separation of management 
and supervisory functions through the establishment of a National Forest Company (NFC) with an 
essentially commercial mandate and a State Forest Administration (SFA) with a control and supervisory 
function. This model puts more emphasis on the economic functions of forest, which entails the danger that 
environmental functions are given low priority, but the independence of the control function as well as the 
projection on expanding (environmental) revenues are expected to counter this threat. Increased 
responsibility for management decisions is also likely to enhance staff motivation and enhance their 
capacity to manage the forest resources sustainably and combat illegal practices. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The EMP summarizes the key findings of the EA, including mitigation and enhancement measures with 
reference to significant environment-related issues, responsibilities, schedules, cost estimates and 
monitoring indicators. The EMP will become part of the Legal Agreements for the Project. Most of the 
mitigation or enhancement measures concern additional specifications of planned actions already included 
in the FDP and therefore require no additional capacity and funding. Nevertheless, the realization of the 
EMP still contains two high cost-intensive actions, namely the environmental and safety training of actors 
in the forest sector, and the compensation of the National Forest Company for the management of Nature 
Parks.  
 
N
o additional costs are allocated and ca

 in the EMP, since 
Page  8
 
 
Component 5 of the FDP includes provisions for such activities. Specifically, with respect to the EMP, it is 
recommended that the FDP review plans and conducts field inspections, in collaboration with interested 
NGO representatives, regarding: (i) rehabilitation and construction of forest roads, (ii) thinning, (iii) 
rehabilitation of forest fire sites, (iv) establishment of energy plantations, where appropriate. Review of 
plans and field inspections, including observed non-conformities should be recorded. The implementation 
of corrective actions should be followed, and checked in the field, if deemed necessary. 
 
With regard to the Process Framework, the process to be followed during project implementation will 
consist of the following key steps: (i) Participatory Community Assessment (PCA) surveys will be 
conducted - with special emphasis on potential negative livelihood impacts - on a regular basis as part of 
the FDP monitoring and evaluation procedures, (ii) a Community Mitigation Action Plan (CMAP) will be 
prepared with an active participation of representatives from affected communities, targeted at individuals 
and communities whose livelihoods will potentially be adversely affected by project activities, (iii) for each 
of the communities considered affected by livelihood impacts, a  Local Consultative Forum (LCF) will be 
established, (iv) the annual socio-economic surveys as part of the monitoring of social development 
outcomes will be tailored to measure impact of the CMAP, and the PIU will hire a short term consultant to 
carry out bi-annual spot reviews of the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures, (v) the Project 
will put in place conflict resolution mechanisms at the LCF level by which potential conflicts between 
resource users and the NFC can be resolved. A coordinator for the Process Framework oversight will be 
appointed in the SFA. In addition, a contact person will be nominated in the NFC to take responsibility for 
the implementation of the Process Framework and the CMAP. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Public participation and support - which is based on the awareness about the objectives of the FDP - will be 
critical for the success of the project. Numerous consultations have been carried out with forest sector 
stakeholders during the conception and preparation of the FDP, during the development of the National 
Forest Policy and Strategy and, again, during the EA preparation process.  
 
The objectives of stakeholder consultation during the EA were to improve the quality and relevance of the 
EA process, and to contribute to the openness, transparency and dialogue in the preparation of the FDP. A 
special effort was made to ensure that communication with the public be efficient and well balanced. The 
main stakeholder groups were identified during the inception phase of the assessment project, and 
additional groups were invited to participate in the assessment during the whole process. The first two 
stakeholder consultation workshops were held on October 13 and November 13, 2003, and gathered 
respectively 45 and 58 participants from the government, NGOs, academia, donors, and media. The draft 
EA report was made publicly available in Bulgarian and English on December 8, 2003. A specific 
consultation meeting was held with six local environmental NGOs on December 16, 2003. The stakeholder 
consultation workshop to discuss the draft EA report took place on December 17, 2003. The requests 
received from the individual stakeholders and the outcomes of the workshops were taken into account by 
the project EA team. Consultations reflected certain concerns on forest road constructions and 
consequences of the restructuring of the National Forestry Board in general, and the subsequent ways and 
means for the management of Nature Parks. The final EA report was made publicly available in the 
Infoshop and in Bulgaria (on the project website) on January 28, 2004. The Process Framework will also be 
disclosed in the Infoshop and in Bulgaria before appraisal. 
 
In addition, a Social Assessment study is being conducted by local social science experts with a strong 
focus on risk and vulnerability. Relevant field surveys were conducted using quantitative and qualitative 
research methods. The results of the Social Assessment will be used to refine the design of the project, 
enhancing positive impacts and mitigating likely adverse effects.
