.  Project Objectives 
[from section 2 of PCN]
The project development objectives are:  
(i) to provide secure containment of the toxic waste 
plume that is contaminating the groundwater of Ust
-
Kamenogorsk, thereby preventing the 
plume’s discharge into the r
iver as well as protecting the city’s drinking water supply; (ii) to 
broadly address all water quality issues around Ust
-
Kamenogorsk by building strong institutional 
mechanisms for water quality monitoring and for control of ongoing pollution by local muni
cipal 
and industrial water users.
The project is expected to benefit the present and future population of Ust
-
Kamenogorsk, by 
improving the quality of the local environment, and also to benefit the residents of downstream 
communities by averting a signif
icant risk of toxic wastes entering the Irtysh River.
C.  Project Description 
[from section 3 of PCN]
The project will have three main components:  

 
clean
-
up of groundwater contamination in Ust
-
Kamenogorsk, and mitigation of 
downstream pollution of the 
Irtysh River;

 
safe storage and disposal of hazardous and industrial waste;
Page  2
2

 
development of a water quality monitoring system for  the Irtysh Basin.
There are a number of possible technical interventions that would meet the project objectives 
–
although p
erhaps to differing degrees.  The technical consultants have been asked to evaluate 
alternative solutions based on a detailed cost
-
benefit comparison, including a risk assessment for 
each proposed option.  The total project cost is estimated initially at a
pproximately US$45 
million, of which US$35 million would be financed by an IBRD loan and the balance by the 
Borrower.  
The Government has taken significant steps indicative of its commitment to the proposed project.  
State National Company “Kazatomprom”,
 which operates a metallurgical plant in Ust
-
Kamenogorsk, has been assigned responsibility for the remediation program, in coordination 
with the Committee for Water Resources under the Ministry of Agriculture.  A Japanese PHRD 
Grant has been approved to fi
nance project preparatory works, including technical studies and 
environmental and social assessments.  An international consulting firm has been selected to 
carry out the technical studies, and expressions of interest solicited for the Environmental 
Asses
sment. 
D.  Project location (if known)
The project is located in Ust
-
Kamenogorsk, a city of approximately 300,000 persons in 
Northeastern Kazakhstan.  The city lies on the Irtysh River which flows from the Xinjiang region 
of China through Kazakhstan and
 into Russia (Omsk Region).  As a result of past industrial 
activity, the groundwater supply of the city is badly polluted by toxic materials.  In addition, 
some of the existing toxic waste disposal sites fail to meet standards sufficient to provide 
protec
tion against ongoing pollution of the groundwater and Irtysh River. 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
The government has assigned project management responsibility to an existing and highly 
qualified Project Managem
ent Unit under the Committee for Water Resources.  The Committee 
and the PMU staff have extensive experience in the preparation and implementation of World 
Bank projects, including those involving Safeguard issues. 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPL
Y
Applicable?
Safeguard Policy
[x]
Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01)
The project is rated as Category A, and will require a full EA and EMP to be 
completed and publishe
d prior to Appraisal.  The rating is based on the need to 
deal with existing deposits of toxic materials and the potential environmental risks 
to workers and population both during the clean
-
up and after. Specifically, 
the 
assigned A category rating is jus
tified on the following ground: (i) the project will 
finance a new tailings 
landfill 
facility of nearly 500,000 cub.m of sludge/residues; 
(ii) the project will finance closure of an existing tailings 
landfill
 which is a 
Page  3

sophisticated engineering project  t
hat has to take account of safeguards to 
prevent secondary contamination during construction; (iii) the project envisages 
dewatering of contaminated sludge and therefore requires on site wastewater 
treatment facility.

Current and proposed tailing landfills are 
contained in places with embankment
s which do not constitute dams. Should the 
design change we will reexamine the applicability of this safeguard policy.

While the project is intended to improve water quality and reduce future pollution 
of the Irtysh River, Safeguard Policies will be reviewed to determine the 
appropriate courses of action with respect to advising and
 consulting with 
neighboring countries.

project is rated with an “A” environmental category, 
two consultations will be required 
before appraisal as following: (i) one consultation will cover the Terms of Reference for the 
EA; (ii)
 another consultation will take place when the draft EA is available.  Also, given the 
project rating, the EA needs to be prepared by specialists independent from the project 
designers.
