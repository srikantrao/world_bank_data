B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
1.  The proposed loan would finance technical assistance to strengthen and reform social 
insurance (covering losses from old age, disability, survivorship, health) in Paraguay.  Further, 
the proposed loan would support the steps Paraguay must take to extend coverage as broadly as 
possible, without threatening fiscal sustainability. 
2.  The specific development objectives of the proposed loan are: (a) to improve institutional 
functioning and structure of social insurance, private pensions and health insurance; (b) increase 
the medium and long term fiscal sustainability of public expenditure on pensions and health 
insurance; (c) improve administration of the funds and management of their reserves through 
uniform regulatory structures; (d) re-examine existing reform options and design a 
comprehensive integrated strategy for public and private pensions and health insurance; (e) 
propose options for extending basic protection against losses from old age, disability and 
unanticipated death, through design and progressive implementation of non-contributory benefits 
and measures to strengthen delivery of social assistance.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
3.  The proposed project would be financed with a technical assistance loan, as the majority of 
the project activities entail transfer of knowledge and capacity; undertaking studies of best 
practice and feasibility; training; and investment in information technology.  In the middle term-
and only if the Bank’s lending to Paraguay should enter a “high case” scenario (as presented in 
the CAS)-the proposed project would be critical in helping Paraguay to design legal and 
regulatory reforms that would be the basis of future development policy lending.  
4.  The amount of the proposed loan has not yet been discussed with the Government.  However, 
US$10 million has been allocated in the CAS for technical assistance in Social Protection.  The 
amount of the proposed loan will vary considerably, depending on the final composition of the 
project (a matter on which the Team seeks guidance, in Section 5 of this note).  In preliminary 
project-identification discussions with counterparts (Ministry of Economy, the Instituto de 
Prevision Social, and Secretaria de Accion Social), the following project components, and 
relative weights for loan financing, have been considered.

5. 
Administrative Improvements to Existing Social Insurance Funds (30%)
.
Several 
measures must be taken to increase administrative capacity and efficiency of pension funds.  The 
list of required measures will vary across the eight existing funds, and in the case of IPS will 
have to take account of the Institute’s leading role in health finance.  However, a common set of 
necessary actions,
 
…which would be pursued under this component, include:
 (i) institutional 
audits to identify administrative strengths and weaknesses; (ii) review of current 
information infrastructure, and development of a common information protocols 
and platforms; (iii) measures to standardize and improve contribution collection 
and benefit payment; (iv) measures to increase transparency and eliminate fraud; 
and (v) review of investment policies and development of common risk 
management and investment regime.

6. 
Establish Common Supervisory Structures for Pensions and Health Insurance (20%)
.
In 
addition to the eight public social insurance institutions currently operating in Paraguay, there are 
as yet modest, but growing, unregulated private pension and health insurance industries, offering 
financial services and products directly for households to take up on a voluntary basis.  Although 
there are differences in the objectives and structure of public and privately provided pensions and 
health insurance, as well as between mandatory coverage and instruments offered voluntarily, 
1
The preliminary project structure described in this section is the product of two, brief pre-identification missions, 
and is, therefore, subject to considerable change.  It is intended only as a very general reflection of the Bank team’s 
discussion with counterparts in Asuncion. 
2
Several of the more immediate activities in this component would be financed through a grant from the IADB of 
US$150,000.00, which has been negotiated between IPS and IADB through the Ministry of Economy, and was 
signed 28 March 2004.  This component would be designed with close attention to content and timeline for 
implementation of the IADB grant – and close cooperation with managing IADB staff in Asuncion – to avoid 
duplication.  IADB’s grant would finance: (i) elaboration of a strategic plan for institutional strengthening; (ii) 
develop a master plan for IT requirements; and (iii) the formation of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within 
IPS.  The PIU for the IADB’s grant would be the point of contact to ensure activities under the proposed Bank 
project are appropriately designed and timed.

there would be important benefits from consolidating a consistent (if not a strictly uniform) set of 
regulatory structures and institutions.   
Actions under this component would include:
 (i) identification of current 
weaknesses in the regulatory framework; (ii) design of legal reforms required to 
strengthen the regulatory framework; (iii) development and eventual enforcement 
of minimum industry standards; (iv) studies to examine optimality of a single 
regulatory agency; (v) creation of a single regulatory agency (if deemed optimal). 
7. 
Design of Structural Reforms (30%)
.
A
number of pension and health finance reform 
proposals have already been prepared and extensively debated in Paraguay.  Existing proposals 
differ mainly in the extent of “structural” versus “parametric” reforms to the institutions 
currently in place; what affiliates should expect from government; and in the role given to the 
private sector.  The Government is interested in a thorough re-examination of its needs and 
options, and the elaboration of a coherent middle-to-long term set of objectives and reform 
strategy for pensions and health finance.  As stated earlier, Paraguay can benefit from a long 
experience with social insurance reform in Latin America.  Additionally, any further analytical 
efforts to design pension and health finance reforms, can build on existing analytical work and 
current reform proposals, and need not be undertaken “from scratch”.   
Activities under this component would include:
 (i) propose an improved 
division of labor between the public and private sector in covering risks to income 
from ageing, disability, and unanticipated death, taking past analytical work and 
existing proposals into account; (ii) design a “guaranteed health package” of 
interventions for the currently insured (through IPS and private insurers, that is 
consistent with efforts underway to develop a package of interventions for the 
uninsured); (iii) propose an improved division of labor between the public and 
private sector in health finance, taking past analytical work and existing proposals 
into account; (iv) develop a clear middle and long term objective for social 
insurance provision; (v) develop a plan for staged alignment and integration of 
public social insurance institutions; (vi) design and implement means to extend 
basic, minimum coverage against risk to income to a wider segment workers and 
their dependents through non-contributory instruments, in a manner consistent 
with broader efforts to strengthen social assistance; (vii) design and implement a 
professional public information, awareness, and consensus-building campaign on 
the need for and objectives of social insurance reform, that also takes into account 
the strengths and weaknesses of existing reform proposals. 
8. 
Assist in Developme
nt of Paraguay’s Social Protection Safety Net (20%).
Related to item 
(vi) in the component immediately above, there are a large number of design and institutional 
strengthening measures (to develop/improve auditing, targeting, monitoring, impact evaluation, 
transparency and governance) required to administer non-contributory benefits  to cover the risk 
of poverty from old age, disability and survivorship effectively and efficiently. Given the lack of 
a
coherent social assistance “safety net” system in Paraguay, these are the same design and 
institutional strengthening measures that are required to deliver non-contributory forms of social 
protection against risks not directly related to the contingencies that are the main focus of the 
proposed project (a good example, is a new conditional cash transfer being developed to tackle 
Page  4
child labor and school desertion).  Further, these are the same items on the institutional agenda of 
Paraguay’s new poverty reduction strategy.  In direct coordination with the IADB
3
and activities 
already underway at the Secretaria de Accion Social (SAS) – the Executive Secretariat of 
Paraguay’s Gabinete Social-… 
…
activities under this component would include:
 (i) defining target 
populations; (ii) define and design a targeting strategy; (iii) develop targeting 
systems (including required information systems with links to other data 
platforms being developed under the proposed loan; (iv) design and implement 
monitoring processes; (v) design and implement impact evaluation procedures; 
(vi) design and implement pilot programs; (vii) expand programs based on 
evaluation of pilot and any required changes in design.

IADB is and will remain more actively involved in social assistance, although it has expressed a preference to 
focus on programs covering risks to mothers and infants, opening an opportunity for the Bank to focus on other risk 
areas, primarily the contingencies covered by social insurance for the population that currently goes without 
insurance.
