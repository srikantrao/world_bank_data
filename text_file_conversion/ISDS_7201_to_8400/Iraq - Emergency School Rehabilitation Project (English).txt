A.2. Project Objectives
The principal objective of the Project would be to improve conditions of learning in primary and secondary
schools through (a) emergency rehabilitation of schools in need of major repair, and (b) the urgent
provision of primary and secondary school textbooks.
A.3. Project Description
Component 1 would finance the rehabilitation of schools, focusing in the first instance on schools that do
not meet minimum safety standards in five governorates selected by MOE on the basis of need. This
project would not target schools requiring minor repairs, which would be covered by the MOE small grants
project and other donors' programs. Component 2 would finance the printing and distribution of
textbooks and teaching and learning materials for primary and secondary schools for the school year
1004/05. Component 3: Project Management would finance project management support, including the
provision of furniture, equipment, technical assistance and training necessary for the management of the
project, as well as operating costs of the Project Management Team (PMT).
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: N/A
Component I would cover the governorates of Souleymania, Basra, Karbala, Nadjaf and Baghdad.
Component 2 would cover the whole country and Component 3 would be limited to the Project
Management.

Comments: This project is an emergency project in accordance with OP 8.50, hence the environmental
mitigating measures (if any) will be carried out during project implementation under provisions
incorporated in the construction contracts. Project appraisal will highlight possible environmental issues
that the MOE would need to address

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. N/A
Despite the fact that schools would only be rehabilitated and there would be no new construction, the
Project would fall into the Environmental Category B because of the difficulties for Bank teams to visit
Iraq to assess sites. However the requirement to carry out limited Environmental Analysis as part of
project preparation will be waived but, for sub-projects with adverse impacts, a limited Environmental
Analysis should be done during project implementation but before the sub-project approval. At the same
time, before appraisal the implementing agency should agree to apply the following minimum standards
during implementation: inclusion of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) in the repair and
reconstruction bid documents of all sub-projects; review and oversight of any major reconstruction works
by specialists; implementation of environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and
provisions for adequate budget and satisfactory institutional arrangements to monitor effective
implementation and adequately maintain sanitary facilities after completion.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area. N/A
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. N/A
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. N/A
