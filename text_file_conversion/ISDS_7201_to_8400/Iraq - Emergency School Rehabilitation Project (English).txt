A.2. Project Objectives
The principal objective of the Project would be to improve conditions of learning in primary and secondary
schools through the emergency rehabilitation of schools in need of major repair This project was initially
integrated to the Emergency Education Rehabilitation Project (EERP). The initial ISDS and PID for EERP
were approved and send to Infoshop on March 8, 2004.
A.3. Project Description
Component I would finance the rehabilitation of schools, focusing in the first instance on schools that do
not meet minimum safety standards in five governorates selected by MOE on the basis of need. This
project would not target schools requiring minor repairs, which would be covered by the MOE small grants
project and other donors' programs. Component 2 would finance project management support, including
the provision of furniture, equipment, technical assistance and training necessary for the management of the
project, as well as operating costs of the Project Management Team (PMT).

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. N/A
Despite the fact that schools would only be rehabilitated and there would be no new construction, the
Project would fall into the Environmental Category B because of the difficulties for Bank teams to visit
Iraq to assess sites. However, the requirement to carry out limited Environmental Analysis as part of
project preparation will be waived but, for sub-projects with adverse impacts, a limited Environmental
Analysis will be done during project implementation but before the sub-project approval. The
implementing agency agreed to apply the following minimum standards during implementation: inclusion
of standard environmental codes of practice (ECOP) and in the repair and reconstruction bid documents of
all sub-projects; review and oversight of any major reconstruction works by specialists; implementation of
environmentally and socially sound options for disposal of debris; and provisions for adequate budget and
satisfactory institutional arrangements to monitor effective implementation and adequately maintain
sanitary facilities after completion.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area. N/A
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. The borrower will follow the
Environmental and Social Screening and Assessment Framework. Capacity building activities on
environmental and social safeguards and environmental and social monitoring will be implemented.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. The Environmental and Social
Screening and Assessment Framework has been discussed with the Government and disclosed in Iraq in
key ministries.
