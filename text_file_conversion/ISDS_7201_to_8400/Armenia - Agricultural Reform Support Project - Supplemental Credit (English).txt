A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed Supplemental Credit is for SDR 1,200,000 (approx. US$1.75 million), as 
the second step in responding to the frost emergency.  It is intended, firstly, to replenish 
the US$1.3 million in Credit funds reallocated last year to import fertilizers as an early 
response to the frost damage and will therefore ensure the support needed to sustain and 
complete the ARSP work program.  In addition, it would spearhead the effort to put in 
place a more lasting and sustainable response to Armenian horticulture’s vulnerability to 
frost by financing the replanting of about 1,130 hectares of orchards and 370 hectares of 
vineyards
 
destroyed by the frost with more resistant and productive varieties. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed additional funds would be used to finance (i) continued operation of the 
newly established rural extension service and the ten regional agricultural service centers 
(approx. US$450,000), (ii) the adaptive and applied research program, comprising the 
technology assessment program (TAP) operated jointly by researchers and extension 
agents, and the competitive research grants program (approx. US$155,000), (iii) the

market information service for the first 18 months after its privatization, under a service 
contract with the Ministry of Agriculture (approx. US$12,000), and (v) the operating 
expenses of the Project Management Unit, including audits (approx. US$140,000).  In 
addition, it would finance, at a cost of about US$915,000, about 1,000,000 grapevine 
seedlings and 400,000 fruit tree seedlings for the rehabilitation of about 370 ha of 
smallholders’ vineyards and 1,130 ha of smallholder’s orchards.  Beneficiaries of this 
replanting support program would be smallholders operating no more than 1 hectare of 
vineyards and orchards combined, and support for any beneficiary would be limited to a 
maximum of 0.25 hectare.  Between 7,500 and 10,000 of the most severely affected 
smallholders would be assisted.  Beneficiaries will receive the new planting material on 
grant terms and will bear all other costs of the rehabilitation themselves.

Comments:  
 
The original project was rated “B” in June 1996, with no significant environmental 
impacts anticipated.  The project’s rural finance and agricultural extension components 
were expected to induce the use of agro-chemicals and fertilizers, but in full accordance 
with the provisions of OD 4.03 (replaced since then by OP 4.09).  This has been the case. 
 
The environmental impact of the activities funded by the proposed Supplemental Credit 
are expected to be small, but positive.  Rehabilitation and replanting of areas under 
perennial crops will restore vegetative cover lost as a result of frost damage.  The 
intensity of fertilizer and pesticide applications on the areas affected is well within 
agronomically recommended limits, considerably below those practiced during Soviet 
times and in full accordance with updated national environmental and safety provisions.  
The social impact will be decidedly positive, by supporting the recovery of smallholder 
farms and reviving demand for labor in orchards and vineyards.  An Environmental 
Management Plan for the Supplemental Credit has been prepared and disclosed in the 
country.  A public consultation meeting was held and the minutes are attached as an 
annex to the EMP. The EMP was disclosed in the country (in the local language) and in 
the InfoShop prior to project appraisal.  The amended legal agreement will have 
appropriate language committing the Borrower to implement the EMP.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Project will not entail any large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The only 
possible direct impact is introduction of plant diseases though imported seedlings. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Indirect impacts associated with the supplemental credit are those related to the use of 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides to help establish young plants, which might result into 
nutrient enrichment of water bodies from run-off, causing eutrophication of water bodies 
and contamination of potable water sources. Another indirect impact is related to the use 
of pesticides to protect young plants during establishment. This might cause impaired 
health of handlers, including those who store, sell, transport and apply pesticides, as well 
as soil contamination and surface and ground water contamination. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An Environmental Management Plan was developed, which specifies roles and 
responsibilities for implementation and enforcement. Mitigation measures are related 
mostly to the observance of phytosanitary regulations in the country, application of safe 
quantities of agro-chemicals and pesticides at proper times, and use of integrated pest 
management. The EMP also mentions handling and use of pesticides in accordance with 
applicable environmental and safety regulations.  
 
The same institutions and agencies implementing the original project will be responsible 
for the supplemental credit as well.  The Borrower’s institutional capacity is 
demonstrated by the satisfactory implementation of the ongoing operation. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are farmers receiving vine and fruit seedlings. Consultations were 
held in extension centers, where farmers come for advice and extension services, as well 
as during extension agents’ routine visits to communities. The advertisement about the 
EMP was placed in a public place and made available to beneficiaries and NGOs.
