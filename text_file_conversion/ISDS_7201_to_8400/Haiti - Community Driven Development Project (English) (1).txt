B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project would seek to improve the well-being and incomes of the Haitian poor (in 
mainly rural but also peri-urban areas), following a tested and successful CDD approach under 
the pilot project, by:  (i) financing small-scale community investments to improve access to basic 
social and economic infrastructure and support income-generating activities; (ii) strengthening 
the social cohesion and building social capital of local communities to organize collectively to 
better meet their own needs; (iii) improving local governance by greater citizen participation and 
transparency in open-decision making processes through the creation and strengthening of 
community associations and project municipal councils; and (iv) fostering closer integration of 
development programs and projects for poverty reduction at the central and local level. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Total project cost is estimated at US$60.0 million. An IDA-funded Specific Investment Loan 
(SIL) of US$38.0 million is proposed.  The proposed project would have three components: 
Page  2
Community Subprojects
would finance small-scale investments which are identified by 
community associations and later prioritized in representative project councils (COPRODEP) as 
a
function of available resources under the project.  Two funding windows are envisioned under 
this component: (i) Window 1- micro subprojects
(up to US$50,000) would mainstream the 
financing mechanism tested under the CDD pilot experience, and (ii) Window 2 - small 
community subprojects
(ranging in size from US$50,000 to US$150,000) would be carried out in 
conjunction with the Rapid Employment/Labor-Intensive Basic Infrastructure Rehabilitation 
component of the ICF.  The former are expected to be largely productive in nature (following the 
experience under the CDD pilot) while the latter would comprise mainly investment in public 
works.  Funds for subproject execution under Window 1 would be transferred directly to 
community associations, which are then responsible for subproject financial management and 
expense reporting, in the form of Statements of Expenditure, following subproject completion.  
Under both Windows 1 and 2, subproject selection would be demand-driven and would follow 
procedures detailed in a revised project operational manual, updated from the lessons learned 
from the CDD Pilot project and expanded to include the addition of Window 2 investments. 
Capacity-Building and Technical Assistance
would finance (i) training and technical assistance 
to prepare community associations and project councils to fulfill their responsibilities related to 
subproject execution, monitoring, operation and maintenance; (ii) consultant services to study, 
inter alia
,
how
the Haitian Diaspora might be mobilized to both co-finance and provide 
technical expertise to the community subprojects;
1
and (iii) capacity-building to strengthen 
governance at the local, department and central levels in Haiti. 
Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation
would finance incremental costs 
associated with project implementation by the project coordination unit (PCU), which will be 
housed in the existing PL-480 Management Office and operate under the oversight of the 
Ministry of Planning.
2
This would also include the establishment of a Monitoring and 
Evaluation subcomponent, which would accompany project execution.  Impact evaluation would 
also be financed under this component.    
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be implemented in rural and peri-urban areas of the country.  Actual 
municipalities to be targeted will be defined during appraisal. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
To be assessed during preparation. 
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
1
Annual remittances are estimated at US$1 billion (25% of GDP) and some evidence already exists of such 
collaboration in the case of one of the pilot municipalities 
–
Ounaminthe.   
2
Also the implementing agency for the LICUS Trust Fund program.
