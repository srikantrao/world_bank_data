B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project development objective is to support private sector led growth through the 
provisioning of a legal, physical and business environment in three selected regions (called 
“growth poles”), conducive to private investment. The overall outcome of the project for these 
regions will be increased employment and skills development opportunities, improved access to 
infrastructure, more efficient supply chains and thus increased household incomes leading to 
poverty reduction. The proposed project is also expected to have catalytic effect in the growth 
poles areas and demonstration effects on other regions in Madagascar. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN]  
 
Component 1: Export led growth in Antananarivo 
 
•

Supporting education and vocational training programs especially for MSMEs in 
collaboration with QMM and the donor community. 
 
Component 4: Provision of an enabling environment for private sector entry 
 
• 
Establishing a separate policy and regulatory regime in the growth poles through special 
legislation to enhance the investment conditions (special zone status)
 
prior to project 
implementation;
 
Page  3

Facilitate outreach to the local and international private sector; 
• 
Improving the business environment for private enterprise, especially MSMEs, in areas such 
as business registration, contract enforcement, commercial arbitration, equipment leasing, 
lowering corruption, improving air accessibility, reduction of logistics and other costs and 
removal of administrative barriers; and 
• 
MSME Development (through the joint IDA/IFC MSME Initiative) with the following 
activities: (a) Improving access to finance by strengthening local financial institutions and 
micro-finance networks with the provision of training and technical assistance, establishing a 
risk capital fund, promoting the expansion of leasing activities; (b) Providing firm-level 
Business Development Services (BDS) through a combination of TA and matching-grant 
type schemes in the area of technology upgrade, management and marketing knowledge, 
strengthening the capacity of local BDS providers and Business associations to deliver BDS, 
promoting linkages to improve MSMEs access to sub-contracting opportunities, improving 
MSMEs access to information; (c) Complementing on-going and planned regulatory reforms, 
in close collaboration with CAPE and the PDSPII. 
 
Component 5: Implementation arrangements 
 
• 
The IG2P will be implemented by the Vice Prime Minister’s office as the project-executing 
agency and will draw on existing capacity of AGETIPA, including for procurement and 
financial management. A steering committee including the private sector will provide support 
to the design and implementation of the project. A monitoring and evaluation system will be 
established.
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations 
under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
 
Three potential growth poles have been identified: (i) Antananarivo (ii) Nosy Be and (iii) Fort 
Dauphin. In the three growth poles, there are on-going or proposed economic activities with clear 
prospects for expansion of private investments. 
 
The three selected growth poles were identified based on (a) their specific economic growth 
potential (based on competitive advantages and natural resource endowments for productive 
sectors), (b) identified prospects and existing private investment and public private partnerships 
in the short- and medium-term (interest and needs expressed by private sector); (c) the 
identification of infrastructure and regulatory gaps that represent bottlenecks for the realization 
Page  4
 4
of the regions’ growth potential; and (d) the potential for poverty alleviation which is particularly 
relevant for the Fort Dauphin region, one of the poorest in the country with recurring famine. 
 
In each of these growth poles, a combination of investments and technical assistance will be 
provided around the following themes: (a) strategic infrastructure
 
in the selected growth poles 
areas as well to connect them to the national infrastructure, (b) policy and regulatory reform, (c) 
institutional capacity strengthening, (d) skills development and (e) development of micro, small 
and medium enterprises (MSMEs). 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
 
 
The Government has sought assistance from the WBG to support the IG2P and has established a 
high level Growth Poles Task Force headed by the Director of Strategic Prospects in the office of 
the Vice Prime Minister.

Environmental Assessment Category:
    
[X] A   [ ] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that 
EA category (mandatory): 
 
The triggers on Safeguards Policies on Forestry and Pest Management are set TBD as it is not 
clear at this stage what would be the backward linkages that are considered by the project.  
Moreover, the project will basically finance the regulatory framework and concrete markets 
more than agricultural intensification.  
 
The trigger on Cultural Heritage is set TBD because of the planned activities and the fact that 
ESIA will assist to establish a cultural property policy and cultural inventories for Nosy Be and 
Fort Dauphin.
