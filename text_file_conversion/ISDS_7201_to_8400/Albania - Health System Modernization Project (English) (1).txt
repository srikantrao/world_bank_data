B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project would aim to (i) help establish a health finance system which streamlines financing 
and provides incentives for increased efficiency in service delivery while affording financial 
protection to low income groups; (ii) help improve the quality of health care with particular 
focus on primary care to help stem the continuous rise in cases unnecessarily treated at higher 
cost at the secondary care level; and (iii) help improve governance and management capacity.   
 
Performance indicators would include: 
·
Legislation enacted and implemented, providing a sound basis for sector financing  
·
%
public sector funding for health care flowing through single purchaser (HII) 
·

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would be an investment operation, although a possible move towards sub-program 
based financing will be explored around mid-term, as woul
d
a
move towards the use of MoH’s 
systems.  The project would be implemented over a four year period.  The potential role of local 
governments in the financing, management and quality assurance functions for primary care 
providers will also be explored.  Project components are as follows: 
Component 1 
–
Strengthen Efficiency and Sustainability of Health Finance System
 would 
assist the Health Insurance Institute to develop its functions and capacity as sole purchaser of 
health services.  It would support the phased introduction of direct contracting with primary and 
ambulatory care providers, coupled with increased provider autonomy and appropriate payment, 
performance and accountability mechanisms; and would also support the development and 
introduction of revised hospital financing mechanisms.  Activities would include (i) capacity 
building in the HII and its local branches; (ii) broad based enrollment of the population with a 
primary care physician, registration with the HII, and related public information campaigns; (iii) 
development and introduction of accounting and internal control structures for directly 
contracted primary and hospital care providers; (iv) development of health information system 
capacity to support payment and management reforms; and (v) development and implementation 
of a system to monitor provider performance (quality and financial management).  
Component 2 – Support to Health Care Quality Improvement Program 
would support 
institutional reforms and limited investments aimed at improving quality of care among health 
care providers and in health facilities.  The program would (i) develop and introduce clinical 
guidelines with an initial focus on primary care and the primary-secondary care interface and the 
most pressing issues (e.g., child health); (ii) retrain existing general practitioners and 
pediatricians in evidence based treatment of common conditions and rational drugs use, based on 
the clinical guidelines;
 (iii) provide basic equipment to PCP’s who complete the retraining 
program; (iv) establish a re-licensing scheme for physicians; (v) establish a continuing medical 
education system (CME) and linking this to the re-licensing scheme; and (vi) establish a grant 
facility to fund proposals from primary and secondary care providers in support of quality of care 
and continuum of care improvement initiatives.  
Component 3 
–
Health Sector Governance and Management 
would be closely linked to the 
health finance reform component and focus on (i) building practice management capacity at the 
primary care level; (ii) developing the regulatory framework, including by-laws and regulations 
to support the move of MOH facilities to the status of autonomous public entities; (iii) reforming 
hospital management and governance structures for selected hospitals; (iii) strengthening sectoral 
policy formulation and performance monitoring; and (iv) building up MOH capacity in financial 
management and procurement and project coordination.
