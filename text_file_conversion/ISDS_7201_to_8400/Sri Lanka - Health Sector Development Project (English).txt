Progress towards achieving the project outcomes will be measured by data coming from both the existing 
information system in MOH and specific household and facility surveys. 
 
The broad objective of the Sri Lanka Health Sector Development Project (SLHSDP) is to support the health 
system in Sri Lanka adapt to the challenges resulting from the double burden of disease by improving 
equity, quality and efficiency of the health system. The specific objectives are to support GOSL to:

continuing health problems (infant and maternal mortality, communicable diseases, malnutrition) 
and new and emerging issues (NCDs) through strengthening preventive activities in the health 
system; 
\01\02
reduce inequalities in access to public resources for health and health outcomes by further 
strengthening basic health services and increasing resources allocated to district and peripheral 
services, especially those with higher rates of poverty and vulnerability; 
\01\02
promote synergy of service delivery and convergence of curative and preventive care at the 
district, provincial and central level; 
\01\02
improve capacity for planning, management and monitoring at all administrative levels by shifting 
the focus from inputs to outputs and outcomes and rewarding performance;  
\01\02
support innovation, notably towards improving efficiency, quality and equity. 
 
The objectives, the design and implementation framework of SLHSDP are fully aligned with the recently 
approved Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Sri Lanka, which is built on RSL and is focused on three 
main pillars: Peace, Growth and Equity. Specifically, the proposed project would contribute to equity by 
transferring more IDA resources for health to poorer areas with worse health indicators and would 
contribute to growth by reducing the direct and indirect costs associated to inefficiencies in the health 
system and increasing productivity in the country through a healthier population.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
COMPONENT 1. ADDRESSING PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS  
The first component addresses the continuing issues of maternal and child health and the emerging needs 
associated to NCDs by financing three coordinated subcomponents: (1) strengthening of the health system 
delivery in the periphery by transferring additional resources to the district health authorities and improving 
their capacity for planning, management and monitoring. The focus is on reducing inequalities across and 
within districts and on preventive care: (2) promoting  program synergy and convergence at the district, 
provincial and central level; and (3) improving of hospital efficiency and quality in providing care for 
maternal and child issues and selected NCDs. 
 
Sub-component 1.1. Support to District Health Authorities to Improve Service Delivery and 
Outreach  
Through this component the proposed project would support all district health authorities in Sri Lanka to 
strengthen the delivery of the existing health program. Special focus is on prevention and outreach 
activities to reduce disparities in maternal and child health indicators in disadvantaged areas and among 
vulnerable groups and to address issues that each district identifies as priority through a structured process 
of analysis and planning. SLHSDP will address the disparities in maternal and child health observed across 
districts and the imbalances in per capita spending on health across districts by transferring more resources 
to poorer districts with larger prevalence of vulnerable people. The transfer of IDA resources will follow a 
flexible program approach according to which the flow of funds follows the institutional steps of budget 
planning, transfer of funds and accounting/reporting processes. The additional IDA resources will be 
executed by the district health authorities through their own arrangements. In order to be eligible to receive 
IDA funds, each district must prepare a District Health Development Plan (DHDP) that provides a health 
situational analysis of the district, identifies all sources of financing, outlines the priorities for the years to 
come and identifies the objectives to be reached and the corresponding monitoring output indicators. As 
part of the preparation of the DHDP an annual procurement plan is also prepared. In order for the district 
health accounts to be replenished with IDA funds, satisfactory financial and physical monitoring reports 
need to be sent to IDA regularly. The Central Ministry of health has been supporting the district authorities 
to prepare their DHDPs by providing guidelines and technical assistance. All districts will be given 
additional US$100,000 IDA funds to be used in fiscal year 2005. Part of the funds allocated in 2005 will be 
used by the District Health Authorities to be accredited as Program Management Centers (PMCs), i.e. 
administrative units that manage their budgets to achieve planned outputs and receive resources according 
to their performance. Criteria for PMC accreditation include capacity for planning, management (including 
procurement) and monitoring and the preparation of a complete 4-year DHDP with output indicators for

fiscal year 2006 according to a needs-based formula. The Central MOH will provide the necessary 
technical assistance to support the accreditation of the districts as PMCs. A procurement company will be 
hired for the first 2 years to support capacity building in procurement at the central, provincial and district 
level. 
  
Sub-component 1.2. Support to Central Programs  
This component aims at promoting synergy across selected central programs and their convergence at the 
provincial and district level. It focuses on three priority programs. 
  
Family Health Program
. 
The family health workers under the Family Health Bureau (FHB) are responsible 
for the remarkable achievements of Sri Lanka in maternal and child health. However, the FHB 
interventions and internal organization still reflect the needs of a population at the early stage of the 
epidemiological transition (for example, the job description of midwives was prepared in 1926). SLHSDP 
would support the Family Health Bureau to better address the current health needs of Sri Lankan families 
by (i) strengthening its technical and managerial capacity; (ii) revising the objectives, strategies and 
guidelines of the existing maternal and child health program in collaboration with selected professional 
medical associations (e.g. pediatricians, obstetricians); and (iii) strengthening the delivery of preventive 
health services related to children, adolescents, women and other vulnerable groups, including the existing 
interventions for maternal and child nutrition and the introduction of a preventive, life skills approach for 
schoolchildren, which will be designed jointly with the Ministry of Education and the Director of the NCDs 
program and the Health Education Bureau. 
 
Immunization
. Sri Lanka’s immunization program is one of the strongest performers in the region and 
coverage in areas with historically unequal access to immunization are now approaching those in the rest of 
the country. However, recent findings reveal large disparities in the quality of immunization services 
provided, which could result in a loss of confidence in the program and eventually undermine the 
achievements to date and impede progress towards consolidation of these gains. Therefore, the support of 
SLHSDP for immunization would focus on improving quality. The expected outcome will be a major 
reduction in unintended variation between districts in immunization service quality, as defined by standard 
guidelines in the MOH. The reduction in Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) will be used as 
the primary indicator of quality improvement. In collaboration with the Family Health Bureau and the 
district health teams, the Epidemiological Unit will follow a systematic approach to improving quality that 
includes a baseline situational analysis and needs assessment, strategic planning with all stakeholders, 
implementation of selected quality-enhancing activities, effort monitoring, effectiveness evaluation, and 
dissemination of lessons learned. 
  
Non-Communicable Diseases, including Mental Health
. The Bank’s support of NCD prevention and 
control in Sri Lanka is a strategic intervention in the ongoing reform of the health sector. Capacity building 
in NCD prevention and control will better align the health sector with the emerging health needs of the 
population by directly addressing the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Increased attention to 
primary prevention and to cost-effective, evidence-based clinical interventions for NCDs will promote 
allocative efficiency in the health sector. Targeting resources and health development to the provincial and 
districts levels for NCD prevention and control will improve opportunities to tailor solutions to local needs 
and circumstances. Objectives of the NCD subcomponent to be financed by the Bank over the next five 
years include: (i) develop a National Action Plan for the prevention and control of NCDs; (ii) increase 
knowledge and skills of central staff in the performance of essential public health functions and 
stewardship functions related to NCD prevention and control; (iii) increase knowledge and skills of 
provincial and district staff in design, implementation, and evaluation of NCD prevention and control 
interventions, especially in primary prevention; (iv) develop partnerships with stakeholders from both 
within and outside of government for the prevention and control of NCDs; (v) improve morbidity and 
mortality statistical capabilities with an emphasis on death registration; (vi) develop and implement a 
behavioral risk factor (baseline) survey that can lead to an ongoing nationwide surveillance system; (vii) on 
a strategic basis, develop and expand public health infrastructure to support prevention and control of 
NCDs; and, (viii) develop a national social marketing strategy. 
 
Sub-component 1.3. Improving Hospital Efficiency and Quality  
Page  5
 
 
Through this component the proposed project would take the first steps in addressing the structural issues 
of efficiency and quality in the hospital-based health care delivery system, including: (i) the excessive use 
of curative care, (ii) the imbalance in the quality of services within and between different categories of 
hospitals, (iii) the pattern of bypassing district and provincial facilities and consequent overcrowding of 
larger, higher level facilities located in large municipalities (Colombo, Kandy, Galle), (iv) the absence of 
modern hospital management, and (v) the little attention placed on consumer satisfaction. SLHSDP would 
address the issues mentioned above through a multifold approach that takes advantage of the overall 
capacity in the health system. Specifically, MOH will carry out two major activities: (i) modernize hospital 
management, including the information system, and (ii) take the first steps to develop country-wide service 
delivery networks that provide responsive services to customers within and across provinces. In order to 
develop the latter activity, the proposed project would finance several studies to assess stakeholders’ 
perceptions, knowledge and behavior with respect to facility distribution, development, utilization and 
satisfaction levels. Service delivery networks development would focus initially on maternal and child care 
and in the second year on selected NCDs (diabetes, hypertension and injuries). 
 
COMPONENT 2. SUPPORTING POLICY, INNOVATION AND MANAGEMENT  
The second component of the SLHSDP aims at strengthening the capacity for stewardship of the Central 
MOH and increase the credibility, transparency and accountability of the public health system. 
  
Sub-component 2.1. Annual Health Forum  
Policy-making for the health sector in Sri Lanka remains an obscure process that is driven by incremental 
budgeting and 
ad hoc
 investments financed by different donors rather than by an open, transparent process 
of allocating resources based on priority objectives and rational planning. The preparation of the Health 
Sector Strategy is an initial positive step in this direction but the process of policy formulation needs 
additional support. The proposed project would finance the preparation of Annual Health Forums to 
encourage participation of different stakeholders, including the private sector,  civil society, the External 
Development Partners and patients in the policy making process. The specific objectives are: (a) to 
strengthen planning, performance management and resource allocation for health by presenting annual 
reviews of the performance of the health sector in the previous fiscal year and presenting the priority 
objectives and associated plans for the years to come; (b) to improve coordination among External 
Development Partners in assisting MOH to deliver the health sector program for Sri Lanka; and (c) to 
monitor the implementation of SLHSDP.  
 
Sub-component 2.2. Innovations Fund  
Although there is an abundance of ideas within the health sector on how to improve the health care delivery 
system in the hospitals and at the community-level, there is a lack of resources and mechanisms to 
implement them. For example, many professionals have ideas as to how to introduce a referral system in 
the hospitals where they work. Both NGOs and public health professionals in the districts have ideas as 
how to improve services to disadvantaged groups. Micro credit societies have talked about expanding into 
health insurance. The Government itself has talked about social insurance but has not commissioned the 
detailed studies necessary to see whether it is a viable option in Sri Lanka. 
 
Through this component SLHSDP would encourage change and creativity in the health sector by financing 
proposals through a competitive bidding process to address issues of equity, quality, and efficiency. The 
proposal  would cover the following areas: (i) inequalities in maternal and child health outcomes; (ii) 
inefficiencies in the health system; and (iii) quality of care in either the public or private health sector for 
disadvantaged or vulnerable groups. An explicit agenda of this component is to harness the extensive body 
of knowledge and implementation capacity beyond the public sector and the Fund will encourage 
participation of NGOs.  
 
Sub-component 2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation for the Health System  
The utilization of the information collected through the current system for knowledge-based decision 
making remains very low due to lack of capacity and incentives. The M&E component will support 
capacity building by providing technical assistance at the central, district and provincial level (e.g., 
sensitization, training) and supplying necessary logistics (e.g., computers, software) required to develop a 
user-driven M&E s
y
stem at the central level. In 
p
articular, at the central level, the 
p
ro
j
ect will su

development of the M&E cell within the Department of Planning of MOH by strengthening the capacity of 
the Director of Health Information to coordinate all data-related activities in MOH and by encouraging 
coordination between MOH and different health information collection and presentation agencies. 
  
Sub-component 2.4. Other Institutional Strengthening  
As part of its activities to strengthen the health system, SLHSDP will also support the development and 
implementation of an environmentally sustainable health care waste management system in a pilot province 
(details can be found in Section D.5) and the technical assistance needed to review the existing processes of 
procuring and distributing drugs for the whole country and prepare an action plan to improve them. 
 
COMPONENT 3. PROJECT MANAGEMENT  
This component would support project management for all activities, including the technical assistance 
needed to upgrade the District Health Authorities into PMCs and the design and implementation of a 
Monitoring Information System (MIS) to supervise project implementation. This component would also 
support the collection of baseline, mid-term and endline data and issue-specific studies related to seeking 
solutions to implementation problems. It would also finance the consultant services and equipment needed 
for the maintenance of the Project Coordination Team. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
Since the proposed project is to assist the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Welfare (MOH) in development 
of the Health Sector in the country, project activities would cover the entire country of Sri Lanka. No civil 
works other than minor remodeling of existing peripheral facilities is planned.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Health care waste management (HCWM) has been an area of critical importance that had been neglected 
by the authorities in Sri Lanka in the past. Health care waste (HCW) had been disposed of with municipal 
solid waste with little or no precautions taken to ensure minimization of adverse environmental and public 
health risks. The Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a National Policy on Health Care Waste 
Management, which was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers in 2002. The underlying objective of the 
policy is to ensure that every medical institution in Sri Lanka is responsible for taking care of all HCW 
generated in the respective institution in a manner that does no harm to public health and the environment. 
In addition, the policy identifies the institutional mechanisms for implementation of the policy at the 
national level as well as the provincial levels; it addresses regulatory issues and the need for specific 
HCWM plans at various levels of the health care system in Sri Lanka; and identifies the need for an 
effective monitoring system to ensure that the objectives of the national policy are met at the national and 
provincial levels. The national policy was complimented by the preparation of National Guidelines for 
HCWM which was accompanied by a Situation Analysis and the preparation of a National Action Plan. 
While policies, guidelines and action plans are available for a nationwide HCWM program, based on 
ground realities, MOH has decided to implement the program on a phased basis.  Phase I, which focuses on 
implementation of a HCWM program for public hospitals within the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) 
area and a nationwide program to manage health care waste from Chest clinics, STD clinics and Blood 
Banks is to be commenced in 2004, with financial assistance from the National HIV/AIDS Prevention 
Project.   Phase II involves dealing with the rest of the public hospitals in Colombo and the 22 surrounding 
Local Authorities (which comprise the Colombo Metropolitan Area) as well as all private hospitals in the 
Colombo Metropolitan Area without their own health care waste management facilities, who will be 
directed by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to use a privately owned hazardous waste disposal 
facility.  Having called for Expressions of Interest from the private sector to construct and manage a 
hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility on a BOO basis in 2003, GOSL has currently obtained the 
approval of the Cabinet of Ministers for negotiating a suitable contract with a selected bidder.  It is 
anticipated that construction of the hazardous waste treatment and disposal facility will commence in the 
third quarter of 2004.  Phase III of the Health Care Waste Management Program, is to treat and dispose of 
health care waste produced by hospitals and medical institutions in a selected province, North Central 
Province (NCP), as a pilot project, with an intention of expanding the program nationwide on the longer 
term, based on the experiences of the pilot program.   
 
The situation analysis shows that approximately 15 tons per day of hazardous health care wastes are 
produced in major health facilities in Sri Lanka, of which approximately 25% is from facilities within the 
Colombo Municipal Council (CMC).  At present, there is no segregation of wastes, therefore, the amount 
of mixed waste discharged from health care facilities contaminated with hazardous health care wastes is in 
the range of 45 tons per day.  Virtually all of this waste is currently disposed of with municipal solid wastes 
in “open dumps” with no precautions taken to reduce public health or environmental risks and biological 
hazards associated with such disposal practices.  The exceptions being anatomical wastes, which are 
generally buried within hospital premises, albeit with no precautions taken to prevent public access to such 
burial sites and the small amounts of radioactive wastes generated are stored in the respective hospital 
premises.  The proposed project will assist the MOH in improving its overall management capabilities, 
which means that project should ensure that Sri Lanka’s health care waste management problem is 
addressed in a manner to reduce the environmental pollution risks and biological hazards that the public is 
exposed to at present. 
 
While health care waste can be regulated under the prevailing regulations of the National Environmental 
Act of Sri Lanka (NEA), specific regulations are being drawn up by the Ministry of Environment and 
N
atural Resources (MENR), in consultation with MOH and the CEA, for hazardous waste management.  
Health care waste is bein
g
 included in the definition of “hazardous waste”, for this 
p
ur
p
ose.  However, until 
Page  8
 
 
the hazardous waste management legislation is approved, adequate provisions are available under the NEA 
for regulating the management of health care waste. 
 
The environmental objectives of the proposed project are: (i) to assist MOH in advancing its phased 
approach to health care waste management in the country to prevent pollution and biological hazards 
resulting from the ad-hoc approaches to health care waste management that is being practiced at present; 
(ii) Assist MOH in implementing Phase III of the Health Care Waste Management Program, which is to 
treat and dispose of health care waste produced by hospitals and medical institutions in a selected province, 
North Central Province (NCP), as a pilot project, with an intention to expand the program nationwide on 
the longer term, based on the experiences of the pilot program; and (iii) to ensure that a proper legislative 
environment exists for enforcement of an integrated health care waste management plan in Sri Lanka.   
 
A Social Assessment was carried out at the early stage of project preparation (May 2003) in order to (i) 
identify the poor and other vulnerable populations in underserved areas and highlight priority health issues 
facing these communities; (ii) identify gaps in the existing knowledge and would propose means to address 
these; (iii) propose as a preliminary step the strategies to improve access and quality of health services for 
these; populations; (iv) propose mechanisms for continuing collaboration and involvement of stakeholder 
groups in monitoring and evaluation and implementation of the proposed operation; and (v) make a 
preliminary assessment of the compatibility of the project’s objectives with the World Bank social 
safeguards policies. 
 
No land will be acquired and no displacement is expected to occur as a consequence of project activities. If 
displacement does occur, the National Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, which was agreed by the 
Government, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank in 2002, would apply. The project is not 
expected to affect the Veda community, the only group in Sri Lanka to which the Bank policy on 
Indigenous people applies. If the Veda community is affected, the Bank policy would apply. 
 
The scope of the project will not involve the triggering of any safeguard policies other than the 
Environmental Assessment safeguard policy, hence, this will be the only safeguard policy that will be 
triggered. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
Since only the Environmental Assessment safeguard policy is triggered under the project, there are no 
cumulative impacts anticipated due to the application of more than one safeguard policy and due to 
multiple project components.  There are no civil works environed under the project, other than small scale 
waste management systems. Since this is a sector development project, financial and technical assistance 
will be provided to existing health care facilities to manage HCW, therefore, any long term environmental 
impacts due to future activities will be beneficial in the environmental and public health sense. Currently, 
the environment as well as local communities are exposed to environmental and public health risks due to 
ad-hoc disposal of health care wastes.  The project will finance the implementation of a comprehensive 
health care waste management system for a pilot province, North Central Province, in accordance with 
MOH’s program for phasing in HCW management in Sri Lanka.  The North Central Province pilot 
program will complement Phases I & II that will be implemented in 2004.  This will ensure that the HCW 
management system is improved in keeping with MOH’s program of implementing the national policy and 
guidelines on HCW.   
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The environmental issues that arise as a result of the proposed project are with regard to the need for proper 
management of health care waste. The health care waste management policy, guidelines and action plan 
prepared in 2002 examined alternative options for waste treatment. Based on the option analysis, the 
Government will select the treatment option most suitable for Sri Lanka, which will be environmentally 
acce
p
table as well as affordable and that has the 
g
reatest 
p
ossibilit
y
 of effective im
p
lementation.  The 
Page  9
 
 
technologies of choice, as recommended in the national policy and guidelines after a a comparative 
evaluation, is steam sterilization for public hospitals within the CMC area, while the public and private 
hospitals in the GCA will opt for HCW disposal at the proposed “engineered” hazardous waste disposal 
facility, while the larger provincial hospitals will opt for steam sterilization facilities and the smaller 
provincial hospitals will opt for “deep burial” in accordance with WHO guidelines for deep burial of HCW. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The scope of the project will not involve the triggering of any safeguard policies other than the 
Environmental Assessment  safeguard policy, hence, this will be the only safeguard policy that will be 
triggered.  Considering the demand driven nature of the investments of the project, a specific environmental 
assessment for the project cannot be conducted at this time.  The National Policy, Guidelines for Health 
Care Waste Management, the Situation Analysis and the National Action Plan prepared by MOH during 
2002/3 provides adequate basis for assessing the situation with regard to health care waste management in 
Sri Lanka.  Specific guidelines are being prepared for health care waste storage, collection, transport, 
treatment and disposal options as well as Planning Guides will be prepared for Special Institutions and 
Hospitals with Specializations and Hospitals without Specializations, by May 31, 2004.  These guides will 
then be used be respective health care facilities to develop individual HCWM Plans for implementation, 
initially in the GCA and in the pilot province.  Subsequently, the program will be expanded island wide.  A 
sub-project specific EIA and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared prior to the 
construction or procurement of any of the pilot program activities.   
 
Based on the situation analysis, it is likely that a central steam sterilization unit will be procured for the 
main hospitals in the province, with the sterilized residue being subject to deep burial in lined pits in 
accordance with WHO guidelines.  Considering the minimal amounts of waste being generated in the 
peripheral hospitals in the province, the most economically viable solution is to subject the waste to deep 
burial in lined pits in accordance with WHO guidelines.  Needle destroyers will be provided for selected 
health care facilities in the province.  The program will be supported by technical assistance for training 
and awareness raising on health care waste management for health care personnel.  A specific 
environmental impact assessment will be conducted for locating the steam sterilization unit and prevalent 
WHO deep burial guidelines will be adhered to by the peripheral hospitals. 
 
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has the responsibility under the National Environmental Act 
to monitor and regulate any institution discharging waste into the environment. Therefore, CEA will be 
responsible in enforcement of HCWM Plans through the relevant regulations under the NEA.  The CEA’s 
enforcement capacity was strengthened under the IDA financed Environmental Action 1 Project, which 
supported the decentralization of the CEA into the regions so as to increase their effectiveness in 
enforcement of environmental regulations.  The CEA has established a Regional Office in the North 
Central Province and will use this office for monitoring the implementation of Phase III of the Health Care 
Waste Management Program.  While staff deployed in the Regional Offices of the CEA have the basic 
training in monitoring and enforcement, continued capacity building will be provided through technical 
assistance financed by IDA and the Government of the Netherlands.           
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
There are six main groups of stakeholders: (i) politicians and policy makers at central and local levels; (ii) 
health officials and personnel working in the public sector; (iii) professional associations and consumer 
groups; (iv) private providers; (v) NGOs providing health services and involved in community 
mobilization; and (vi) poor and other vulnerable populations (i.e. tea estates and internally displaced). 
During formulation of the country’s health strategy, extensive consultations (in the form of technical 
working groups, national and regional workshops and dissemination of the Health Sector Strategy in 
En
g
lish, Sinhalese and Tamil
)
 were held with officials in the 
p
ublic health sector at 
p
rovincial and central

levels, and representatives from the professional medical bodies and unions. Consultations also included 
representatives from private hospitals, such as Durdans, Nawaloka, and Asha Central, and from NGOs 
including Sarvodaya and others actively involved in health services and health promotion activities. Input 
from the communities, especially the poor and vulnerable populations were obtained during the preparation 
of a situational analysis, which relied on focus groups and in-depth interviews.  In addition, members of the 
general public were invited to comment on the National Policy and Guidelines through advertisements in 
national newspapers  (in all three languages) during a 30 day period.

 Considering the demand driven nature of the activities to be supported under the project, sites for health 
care waste management facilities cannot be identified at this stage.  Therefore, no stand alone EA can be 
prepared for the project at this stage but sub-project specific EA’ s will be prepared for any health care 
waste management facilities to be financed under the project.  Review and approval of the sub-project EAs 
by the Bank will be a pre-requisite for fund disbursement for health care waste management activities.
