2. Project Objectives
The Social Welfare Development Project will strengthen the quality, targeting and
administration of social benefits and services being provided to those most in need.

3. Project Description
The SWDP will be implemented around three components:
 Component 1: Improving Social Service Delivery
 Component 2. Strengthening of the Social Welfare Management Information
 Component 3. Upgrading of Social Services Facilities
 The proposed project would be financed through a Specific Investment Loan (SIL) of
US$ 40.0 million, a SIDA grant of US$2.0 million, and by a Government contribution of
US$ 18.4 million. The project would finance civil works, goods, consultant services and
training, incremental operating costs and an innovation grant facility.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The planned civil works at the Centers for Social Welfare and residential institutions will
involve renovation of 106 existing facilities and a limited number of contracts for new

construction not exceeding Euro 3 million per contract. New construction will take place
to build facilities for the Centers for Social Work at nine identified sites. The selection of
these institutions was based on an assessment by the Ministry of Health and Social
Welfare.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Under the SWDP the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare will use a portion of the loan
to renovate the Centers for Social Work, to undertake a limited number of contracts for
new construction not to exceed EUR 3 million, and to upgrade residential care facilities
to ensure that they meet minimum standards. In order to ensure that there are no adverse
environmental impacts from this work, an Environmental Management Plan has been
prepared.

 The Centers for Social Work are the main point of delivery of social benefits and social
welfare assistance in Croatia. Under the project the administration of the CSWs is being
reformed and the functioning of the offices will change. As a result it is necessary to
make some changes to the layout of the CSWs to better serve the population. In addition,
some of the existing buildings need additional renovations to address general
maintenance issues. The works concentrate on the re-figuring of the internal
configuration of offices in order to provide better services. Other rehabilitation includes
repair of roofs and upgrading of plumbing and installation of accommodations for
disabled clients. A portion of the residential care facilities (institutions for disabled,
elderly, and children) will also be renovated to upgrade the sanitary and hygienic
conditions and to facilitate new services through internal reconfigurations.
 New construction will take place to build facilities for the Centers for Social Work at
nine identified sites. These nine identified sites are all public lands owned by the

municipalities/cities and are unencumbered; therefore, O.P 4.12 is not triggered. Possible
safeguard impacts relate to environmental issues for the disposal of possible hazardous
materials in the buildings and disposal of construction waste. No large scale, significant
and/or irreversible impacts will occur.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
None. New construction will take place to build facilities for the Centers for Social Work
at nine identified sites. These nine identified sites are all public lands owned by the
municipalities/cities and are unencumbered; therefore, O.P 4.12 is not triggered.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Alternatives would be to leave the buildings in their current state. This would not allow
the CSWs to improve the services to the population and the improvement of facilities for
those in residential care.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The borrower has prepared an EMP to address the potential impact of the project and the
proposed mitigating measures. This was completed by the staff of the investment section
for social welfare in the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. This section is
responsible for all investment works (including capital repairs) in the social welfare area.
It oversees about 2000 contracts per year on minor renovations at the facilities. The
assessment is that there are no significant additional duties for the staff related to the
proposed activities under the project. They will oversee the contracting of the work and
ensure that the work is done according to regulations.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders and primary potentially affected people are the staff and
populations served by the CSWs and residential institutions. Throughout the preparation
process, representatives of these facilities were consulted on the project design, including
the inclusion of civil works. They were supportive of the work being done to improve
their work environment. They will make necessary arrangements to ensure that all
services are provided during the construction phase. The EMP will be available at all
CSWs and residential facilities in the country in the Croatian language.
