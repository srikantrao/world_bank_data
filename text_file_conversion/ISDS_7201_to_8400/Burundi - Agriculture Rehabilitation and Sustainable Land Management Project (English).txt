A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed Agricultural Rehabilitation and Support Project (PRASAB) would directly improve 
food security by revitalizing and diversifying agricultural production and establishing sustainable 
land management. The Project is fully consistent with the strategies and activities of the 
Government’s IPRSP, the Agricultural Rehabilitation Program for War-Distressed Persons, and 
the World Bank’s Transitional Support Strategy. The Project is also consistent with the priorities 
and initiatives of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), particularly the 
agricultural, market access, and environmental initiatives. 
 
The proposed Project would specifically address the following issues: 
 
(a)  Poor agricultural production and productivity.  
(b)  Reintegration of war-stricken distressed population into agriculture.  
(c)  Excessive dependence on a few crops and the need to diversify income sources in rural areas. 
(d)  Introduction of sustainable land management.  
(e)  Inadequate agricultural services. 
(f)  Institutional strengthening, especially for subproject planning and policy formulation.  
 
The Project would establish explicit links with IDA’s Second Social Action Project, BURSAP II, 
now under preparation. In particular, it would link with the building of such new agricultural 
infrastructure as markets, slaughterhouses, small irrigation canals, and seeds for vegetable 
gardens in select area
s. The Project would also establish links with the Burundi Road Sector 
Page  2
Development Project, whose rural roads component covers feeder roads in the northern, western, 
and southern parts of the country and whose feeder roads are chosen by socioeconomic criteria. 
And the Project would link with the agricultural and environmental activities of the Emergency 
Rehabilitation Credit (ERC I), especially for facilitating proper implementation and accelerating 
disbursement of non committed funds (US$5.5 million). PRASAB would organize annual 
meetings with all Project authorities to ensure that its priorities are taken into account in their 
annual work plans. 
 
The World Bank will work with other donor agencies to focus on activities and areas not covered 
by their support in order to revive and strengthen rural productive capacity and to improve land 
and natural resources management.  
 
The GEF financed component on Sustainable Land Management (SLM) will help the 
Government of Burundi strengthen its human resources and institutional capacity to develop 
sound policies, programs and tested guidelines to rehabilitate degraded lands in watersheds, curb 
further degradation and reduce the pressure for encroachment into fragile ecosystems, and 
maintain the ecological values of  wetlands and watersheds under agricultural production. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
1. Project components
:
The proposed project has three main components:  
 
1. 
Support for production and sustainable land management investments. 
2. 
Support for capacity building and institutional strengthening.  
3. 
Support for Project coordination and management. 
 
Component 1. Support for production and sustainable land management investments 
 
This component would finance demand-driven subprojects and their effective planning and 
implementation by producer organizations and local communities.  
 
Subcomponent 1a. Production and sustainable land management investments 
 
The subprojects, to be selected on a demand-driven basis using participative approaches, include 
infrastructure investments and related extension activities initiated by producer organizations and 
local communities, and other extension activities that are not directly related to these investments 
but are well targeted and contribute to the Project’s objectives. Selection criteria, a list of non-
eligible investments, and the conditions and mechanisms for subproject preparation, submission, 
appraisal, and implementation are detailed in the Project Implementation Manual. Examples of 
typical subprojects are in annex 4 of the Project Appraisal Document. Financing would be 
through grants, with an upfront beneficiary contribution (cash or in kind) of at least 5 percent of 
the subproject cost. This component would finance civil works, equipment and materials, 
training, and technical assistance for subproject preparation and implementation. 
 
This subcomponent would also support the technical assistance required for the preparation and 
implementation of subprojects that increase the productivity of existing farming systems, improve 
the quality of service delivery (including input supply and training services), and expand farmers’ 
access to high quality seeds and planting material. The National Project Coordination and 
Page  3
Management Unit (NPCMU) will contract out these services on a competitive basis to local 
implementing agencies
—competent international and local nongovernmental organizations 
(NGOs), community groups, cooperatives, and producer organizations. If no local implementing 
agencies are available, the NPCMU will contract to the Provincial Agricultural and Livestock 
Departments of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock.  
 
Local implementing agencies would provide information on Project activities and processes 
(obtaining funds, reporting) to the groups. Service providers would help producer organizations 
and local communities that have limited capacity to implement subprojects, if necessary (the 
subprojects would budget up to 10 percent of subproject costs for implementation). Particular 
attention would be paid to subprojects that help the population’s most vulnerable segments. 
Support would also be given to producer organizations that have mechanisms for women to retain 
their earnings and actively participate in subproject decision-making. The Project would ensure 
that committees at different levels are strengthened and maintain the necessary independence and 
autonomy in their operations.  
 
Activities to be supported include scaling up the successes of the FAO-supported program that 
piloted an integrated approach to agricultural productivity enhancement and sustainable land 
management. The ‘Chaine de Solidarite’ tested community monitoring of land management 
activities that were promoted with such incentives as provision of livestock. But as a pilot 
program, it was limited in scope. Replication of the successes would be done gradually, based on 
available capacity, social stability, and drive, and would expand to include swamp and hillside 
management in an integrated microwatershed approach.  
 
The delivery of extension should ensure that the provided technologies are locally applicable and 
customized for rehabilitating degraded lands, conserving biodiversity, and improving the 
sustainability of land use in wetlands currently under production. The Project would also build 
awareness of other sustainable land management subprojects and strengthen the capacities of 
local communities to manage natural resources.  
 
GEF resources would support the incremental sustainable land management components of 
subproject proposals that are clearly defined and comply with GEF selection criteria. Sustainable 
land management activities would address the key land degradation concerns in Burundi’s five 
agro-ecological zones. 
 
Specific, technical recommendations for on-the-ground investments eligible under the GEF have 
been identified by agro-ecological zone and are listed in the Project Implementation Manual.  
 
Subcomponent 1b. Emergency support for returnees and internally displaced persons 
 
PRASAB would contribute to the Government’s emergency program by supporting returnees and 
internally displaced persons in select Project areas by helping include them in local producer 
organizations, where possible, and by financing agricultural startup kits with seeds, planting 
materials, and inputs and implements for farming and cattle rearing. This subcomponent would 
join with the National Commission for the War Distressed Persons (NCWDP), and its provincial 
and commune-level organizations. The Project would also seek the guidance of the technical 
committee’s subcommittee for returnees and displaced people.  
 
Page  4
Component 2. Support for capacity building and institutional strengthening 
 
Subcomponent 2a. Enhancing the capacity of local communities, producer organizations, and 
local implementing agencies 
 
The Project would enhance the access to information and capacity of producer organizations and 
local communities. Demand-driven support would be provided for strengthening their 
participation by renewing local networks and cooperative relationships frayed during the conflict. 
Other activities include (i) strengthening the organizational, technical, and management capacities 
of local communities and producer organizations and (ii) promoting an understanding in producer 
organizations and local communities of the broader environmental management issues related to 
land degradation and swamp land utilization and benefits. 
 
Capacity building of producer organizations and local communities would be based on training 
needs and resulting training plans, linked to the productive and sustainable land management 
subprojects, and offered by contracted local implementing agencies. This subcomponent would 
support the preparation and implementation of training plans, workshops, and study tours for 
managers and committee members of producer organizations and local communities. This 
subcomponent would also strengthen, when necessary, local implementing agencies’ capacity to 
provide services to producer organizations and local communities. The NPCMU has conducted a 
capacity assessment of local implementing agencies before negotiation and will develop a 
training plan to address gaps in organizational, technical, and business skills with training, 
workshops, and study tours.  
 
GEF resources would be made available to strengthen information management by local 
implementing agencies at the commune level in order to support decision making on sustainable 
land management and dissemination of good management practices, technologies, and lessons 
consistent with GEF Operational Policy No. 15. Activities would include: 
 
·
Developing training manuals and field guides in local languages on sustainable land 
management methods in watershed management, wetland management, agro-forestry, 
soil stabilization, and improved water management. 
·
Disseminating methods and building awareness of the sustainable land management 
program of PRASAB. 
·
Creating demonstration plots and exchanging information at the local and regional levels, 
including site visits, and farmer-to-farmer exchanges and visits. 
·
Providing local implementing agencies with training, equipment, and supplies on modern 
land management methods.  
 
Subcomponent 2b. Support for institutional strengthening of key public services 
 
While the broad support needed for institutional development of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
Livestock and the Ministry of Land Management, Tourism and Environment is beyond the scope 
of this subcomponent, assistance would be provided for select activities directly tied to the 
achievement of expected sector operation results. IDA support would be provided to the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Livestock and the Ministry of Land Management, Tourism, and Environment 
to strengthen their capacities for program planning and to develop effective management systems 
for monitoring agricultural investments. The Project would finance the purchase of vehicles, 
office equipment, consultants, services, training, workshops, and study tours. 
Page  5
This subcomponent would finance the rehabilitation of a limited number of research stations, 
small equipment, vehicles, and agricultural inputs as well as training, workshops, and operating 
costs associated with research.  
 
GEF resources would help the Ministry of Land Management, Tourism, and Environment and the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock identify acceptable and functional priorities of sustainable 
land management and develop integrated approaches adapted to each region’s agro-ecological 
zones. The GEF would also support analysis and advisory activities to design a modern, national 
institutional framework for land management and to strengthen national planning for land 
resources, including a national land management plan. This would involve close coordination 
among the ministries and their agencies and would include improvements in monitoring and 
coordination of the use of natural resources, and planning and resource allocation. 
 
Activities to be financed include: 
 
·
Developing a national framework for sustainable land use planning through studies, 
workshops, and consultations. 
·
Strengthening participatory institutional and legal mechanisms to ensure close 
collaboration and information exchange on sustainable land management by agencies 
under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, notably Burundian Institute for 
Agricultural Science (ISABU), Institute for Agronomic and Zootechnical Research 
(IRAZ), Provincial Agricultural and Livestock Departments (DPAE), Geographical 
Institute of Burundi (IGEBU), National Institute for Environment and the Conservation 
of Nature (INECN), and Department of Rural Infrastructure, Planning and Land 
Management (DGRPPF) through regular workshops. 
·
Implementing the recommendations of the special report
1
on the program for evaluating 
land degradation and sustainable land management in the areas covered by PRASAB.  
 
·
Publishing an annual State of the Environment report by the Center for Environmental 
Information.  
·
Supporting an environmental monitoring framework by conducting periodic evaluations 
of land degradation in PRASAB sites, strengthening laboratory facilities of the INECN 
for soil and water analysis and ISABU for field mapping, and providing technical support 
to PRASAB. 
·
Training staff in wetlands and sustainable land management, with site visits, among other 
tools. 
·
Setting regional priorities for land conservation in dry land areas with the National 
Program for Erosion Control. 
 
This subcomponent would also finance improvements in agricultural research. Given the limited 
research capacity in the country and the specific needs of producer organizations and local 
communities, the Project would support focused, short-term (two to three years) applied research 
aimed at solving productivity constraints in agriculture. The Project interventions would 
complement assistance from the Belgian Technical Cooperation (BTC), which has already helped 
rehabilitate research infrastructure and equipment (ISABU), to support continuing education, 
training, study tours, and workshops for researchers. Once rehabilitated, the institutes would 
focus on the local application and development of lessons and research carried out elsewhere 
rather than duplicating fundamental research   
1
Under preparation by Buursink, Bikwemu, and Habonimana. 
Page  6
GEF resources would support research targeted at sustainable land management with an emphasis 
on field testing and package distribution including:  
 
·
Agricultural practices that improve the fertility and physical and chemical conditions of 
soil and systems that intensify fodder production to counter overgrazing.  
·
Economically valuable wood species that cause less soil degradation than agricultural 
crops (trees for fodder, fuel wood, construction timber, fruit, medicinal plants, and the 
like). 
·
Assessment of the economic impact of land degradation in the agro-ecological zones of 
PRASAB and the benefits of early intervention to prevent or control degradation. 
 
Component 3. Support for Project coordination and management  
 
This component would finance Project management and monitoring and evaluation. The main 
costs relate to establishing and supporting the NPCMU and three decentralized Inter-provincial 
Project Coordination and Management Units (IPCMUs) responsible for coordination and 
continuous monitoring, audits and periodic evaluation studies, and reporting. The Project would 
support the salaries of a small team of experienced technical specialists, as well as office 
rehabilitation, vehicles, consultant services, and training, workshops, and study tours for NPCMU 
and IPCMU staff. The operating costs of these units and the preparation and implementation of a 
Project completion report would also be covered. 
 
The Project would also support administration and tracking of sustainable land management 
activities and monitoring of the Project’s environmental indicators. Additional resources would 
be provided for training, workshops, and study tours for NPCMU staff to establish the 
participatory processes for community-level implementation.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will support agricultural development and sustainable land management in the 
following  provinces: Ngozi,  Kirundo, Muyinga, Mwaro, Muramvya, Bururi, Makamba, 
Bubanza, Rutana, Cankuzi. While these provinces have potential for increased agricultural 
production, some, like Kirundu and Mwaro, are characterized by water stress. Hence, the project 
intends to increase and diversify agricultural production through improved management of water, 
soils and pesticides as well as agricultural research.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Potential impacts resulting from the project's activities are likely to include soil erosion, soil and 
water pollution, flooding, salinization, loss of flora and fauna. The project has been designed to 
mitigate impacts that might be due to project activities, while also addressing Burundi's broader 
problems such as land degradation and water stress. 
 
D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard 
policy or due to multiple project component.  
 
The project is not expected to generate cumulative impacts, for example, as a result of increased 
pesticide use or ineffective water management, as appropriate mitigation measures have been 
developed.

agricultural economy. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
In order to address safeguard issues, the Borrower has prepared an Environmental Analysis (EA) 
report which includes (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) for Sub-
Projects; (ii) a Dam Safety Analysis; (iii) a Pest Management Plan; (iv) a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF); and (v) an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the entire project. The 
afore-mentioned documents have been disclosed in  Burundi on January 20, 2004,  and at the 
Bank's Infoshop on  January 23, 2004. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultations during preparation of the environmental analysis report were carried out with 
producer organizations, national experts, and representatives of associations, technical services, 
and ministries. The environmental analysis report noted that producer organizations will need 
additional organizational and professional support. In June 2003 a workshop was conducted to 
inform the public of the Project’s objectives and status, to obtain participants’ views and 
opinions, and to formulate recommendations for addressing rural development constraints and 
improving Project preparation.
