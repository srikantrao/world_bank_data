B.  Project Objectives   
Primary Objective: Support income earning opportunities for the unemployed. Secondary 
objective: to Encourage and develop capacity and  competitiveness for effective employment 
services in the public and private sectors. 
 
C.  Project Description   
 
 The SLRP would (1) support access to  income earning opportunities and employment  through 
active labor market programs for individuals who meet an eligibility criteria;  and (2) build 
capacity of institutions responsible for employment services in the public and private sector by 
transferring experience of the PELRP. The PELRP currently contracts private sector “service 
providers” for on the job training as well as skills training programs.  Under the second project 
private sector employment services may be considered as one of the participating agencies 
eligible for submitting proposals for contracts. Such an option would provide for healthy 
competition and incentives for the public sector  (ES) to perform. The proposed project would 
build on the experience of the PELRP but would move a step further in strengthening the 
capacity of a select number of  ESOs in selected regions  to provide a range of services  
including:

 Lessons learned  include (i) PELRP’s demand driven approach to services for clients based on 
skills and needs assessments; (ii) tailoring services accordingly; (iii) counseling services and  
needs assessment prior to retrenchment is advantageous to effectiveness of programs; (iv) 
building trust with clients towards employers in the  private sector takes time because clients still 
cling to the hope that times will revert to large state owned enterprises and assured jobs for all; 
(v) developing an orientation towards a business culture is a process learned through 
demonstration of success; (vi) the development of the capacity of service providers to provide 
timely and quality advise to clients in agriculture and in business development was a key to 
successful support in self employment; (vii) an updated database system of job brokerage i.e. 
unemployed clients; vacancies and other income earning opportunities was vital; (viii) enthused 
and interested extension agents or counselors were central to the multi directional informational 
flow between unemployed clients, employers, other service providers, market information and 
were  pivotal to the success of the project. 
 
The proposed project would build on the experience of the PELRP and continue to provide 
services through the EIs  to a range of clients including: 
 
• 
Counseling Services: providing guidance and advise to active job seekers based 
on their skills profiles. Counseling is intended to provide advice to jobseekers, to 
provide them with vocational orientation, and to provide them with labor market 
information 
• 
On the Job Training (place of clients in existing job vacancies with incentives/fees 
to employers for their training and a portion of their wages for a limited period of 
time.). Under the PELRP a total of 1558 ex-soldiers were placed in existing jobs 
and were trained in these positions. The PIUs identified at least 2500 vacancies 
which remained unfilled and unwanted by ex-soldiers, largely due to mobility and 
expectations issues. 
• 
Self employment (supporting clients in income earning opportunities in 
agriculture, services and business sectors.) Self employment in agriculture 
• 
was the most in demand and therefore successful subcomponent under the PELRP 
and 3939 ex-soldiers with land and family know how were placed in income 
earning opportunities with the provision of livestock and farm implements. 
Another 103 ex-soldiers were assisted with their small business activities. 
• 
Job fare/Public Works: This would be a new area to develop. All applicants would 
first need to agree to taking job fare types of work to show their need for 
employment support. Public works in the context of ECA could include providing 
social services like care for the elderly. This is a proxy targeting mechanism used 
in other ECA countries and will be explored in the second project.  This would 
merit consideration and would be designed to screen for those who are the most 
needy – the poorest – in the economy.  
• 
Business advisory services (assistance through advise on cooperatives, 
registration of business, proposal writing for loans, etc),   
• 
Skills enhancement and training (placing clients in vocational training and skills 
enhancement courses such as computer and language training, retraining and 
higher education). Under the PELRP a total of 167 ex-soldiers were placed in 
Page  3
 
 
institutional training which including English language, computers, driving 
lessons; while 23 were supported to for their higher education. 
• 
Maintaining up dated databases on service providers, job vacancies, firms, 
training institutions and active job seekers. 
• 
Screening genuine active job seekers. 
• 
Building the capacity of employment services  in extension agents/counselors. 
 
 The two PELRP-PIUs (Federation and RS) would be responsible for transferring the experience 
under the first project to EIs; selecting a number of their ES offices; and  monitoring their 
performance against agreed performance benchmarks. Thiswould include the operations manual 
for identifying and selecting eligible beneficiaries, assessing needs according to their skills, 
maintaining updated databases on beneficiaries and job vacancies; contracting and hiring of 
service providers..  The PIUs functions would be to monitor and supervise the overall 
implementation of the project, including procurement and FMS functions of the ESs; training of 
employment officers and reporting to the Government  and the World Bank on progress. The 
proposed project would support the capacity building of competitive employment services both 
in the private and public sector.    
 
 PIUs  would select organizations based on its competitive procurement procedures to act as 
service providers or ‘agents’ on behalf of the projects. These agents (referred to in PELRP as 
service providers) would based on the screen criteria developed by the PELRP/SLRP select  
unemployed clients to assist.  These service providers or agents could include existing 
employment agencies, training companies, NGOs, or all entities with the capacity and experience 
to undertake the provision of services to unemployed individuals. Contracts between 
agencies/service providers would be the same as those currently carried out under the PELRP. If, 
ES/EIS agree to participate then the same terms and conditions and contract would be used to 
engage with them. The strength of the PIUs includes having developed such contract agreements. 
The PIUs would issue tenders for activities nationwide for the provision of services in a number 
of selected locations.  The local ESO  would be eligible to bid for such a contract as well. This  
constructive pressure  would aim to encourage  ESOs albeit in a limited number of localities to 
compete with the private sector.  
 
 The SLRP could have a  strategic approach for impact and demonstration effect by focusing  on 
three areas one each in Central Bosnia,  Herzegovina and in RS, in places such as Zenica or a 
mining town where large retrenchments have taken place or will take place.    
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
 
The project will be implemented nationally through two PIUs located in Sarajevo and Banja 
Luka. Beneficiaries under the project are located country-wide.
