A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to enhance the health and economic potential of 
households by improving water and household sanitation services, which are financially 
and environmentally sustainable, in district towns and large urban centers.  The project 
will construct water treatment plants designed to provide drinking water that meets the 
Clean Water Standard of the Ministry of Health, and pipe the water to households.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project comprises four components: 
 
Component 1 
–
Competition Route Provinces ($62 million). This component will finance 
construction of treatment plants and distribution system to towns not currently served by 
the network. Phase 1 comprises 15 towns in three provinces. Phase 2 comprises up to 120 
towns in 24 Provinces. The population gaining access to water services in Phase 1 is 
estimated at 145,000 people and Phase 2 would reach 850,000 people. This component 
will also establish a micro-credit scheme for households to finance very small scale on-
site sanitation. 
 
Component 2. Performance Route Provinces ($57 million). This component will finance 
improvements in performance levels, coverage, or increase production capacity in Water 
Supply Companies (WSCs). Phase 1 comprises rehabilitation of the Kien An system in 
Haiphong WSC.  Phase 2 comprises work in the WSC of HCMC, Ha Tinh and Binh 
Thuan.

Component 3 
–
Commercial Lending Demonstration Facility ($13 million). This 
component will develop and demonstrate the application of commercial lending 
mechanisms for water supply and sanitation infrastructure.  
 
Component 4 – Institutional Strengthening ($3 million) This component will build 
capacity for improved management practices by all participating PWCs, including 
planning, preparation of water balances, improved leakage competencies, and energy 
audits.  
 
The component will also build capacity in the Central Women’s Union, to improve their 
support to the Provincial Women’s Unions in the areas of IEC (Information, Education 
and Communication) and operationalizing the sanitation funds in participating Provinces. 
This builds on a successful implementation of the same activity under the Three Cities 
Sanitation Project.
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project would be implemented in towns located in up to 31 provinces across 
Vietnam. The four provinces served in phase I (for these, the subprojects will be 
appraised prior to Board approval) are: Ha Nam, Binh Dinh, Thai Binh, and Hai Phong. 
Phase II comprises three identified provinces (HCMC, Ha Tinh, Binh Thuan) plus a list 
of 24 prospective provinces, but it is possible that funding constraints will prevent all of 
the latter from participating.

Comments: 
The environmental category B is justified on the following: the project would 
have positive impacts with regard to the provision of clean drinking water and its adverse 
impacts will be small scale and mitigable.

Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environment
.
The project would not have any significant environmental impacts. The 
environmental impacts during construction will be small scale and temporary (e.g. dust 
generation, noise, surface run-off, disturbance to local traffic and waterways, road 
damage). Water treatment (mostly from groundwater sources) would result in small 
amounts of precipitated solids, but these are minor in scale and their disposal in sanitary 
landfills is sufficient mitigation.  
 
Resettlement
.
The project’s adverse social impacts relate to permanent and temporary 
land-taking for the rehabilitation/construction of Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) and 
transmission and distribution lines. The transmission and distribution lines will be located 
mainly along existing roads and walkways, and generally do not required land 
acquisition. For phase I subprojects, 70 households with about 340 people will be 
affected, none involving relocation. The affected assets are mainly agricultural lands, 
trees and crops. 18 out of 70 PAPs will lose from 20 to 40% of their agricultural land but 
most of them have additional income sources from non-farm activities such as small 
industries, handicraft, commercial  and services.  
 
Indigenous People:
A
socio-economic survey and social assessment exercise have found 
no ethnic minorities in the project areas for the phase 1.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The project would not have important indirect or long term social and environmental 
impacts. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

Environment
.
The Borrower prepared and approved an Environmental Guideline that 
commits it to an environmental review process of all subprojects that includes: (i) 
screening (potentially leading to exclusion based on environmental siting and water 
resource availability issues), (ii) environmental assessment of subprojects that pass step 
(i), and (iii) the institutional arrangements for preparation of EA/EMPs and their 
implementation.  
 
Environmental Assessment/Environmental Management Plans (EA/EMPs) were prepared 
for phase I subprojects in four provinces, and are being revised based on comments from 
the Bank.  Environmental certificates will be obtained from the provincial Departments 
of Natural Resources and Environment (DONREs) before the end of the appraisal 
mission.  
 
The EMPs identify the institutional arrangements and budget for implementing the 
mitigation measures and monitoring plan. Reporting requirements on EMP 
implementation have been developed for contractors, CMC, PMU and MB of MOC to 
report to WB and DONREs on environmental compliance. Due to the weak capacity of 
the borrower in environmental management, the EMP includes a training program 
targeting staff of local PMUs, MB of MOC, contractors, leaders of local communities and 
relevant staff of local governments. 
 
Resettlement
.
Four Resettlement Plans (RPs) were prepared and address resettlement 
issue for Phase I activities in line with World Bank policies OD 4.30, and a Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared to guide resettlement planning in Phase II 
activities. 
 
Indigenous Peoples
.
A
Policy Framework on Ethnic Minorities (PFEM) has been 
developed to guide future planning regarding ethnic minority issues in Phase II. 
 
The Central Project Unit (CPU) and Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) will 
be responsible for monitoring environmental and social development outcomes and 
managing the EMPs and RAPs. These units will be supported by consultants to ensure 
that they can develop and apply POM and procedures under the project as well as work 
with contractors and local authorities . An independent agency will monitor compliance. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The project stakeholders are participating households, including project affected people, 
local authorities and the water companies. Public consultation on the route of pipelines, 
the location of WTPs, and potential environmental and social impacts of the project was 
carried out with the local governments, representatives of DPs and local NGOs. The 
safeguard documents (EA/EMPs/RPF/RPs/PFEM) in Vietnamese have been displayed in 
each of the district towns at a public place. Leaflets summarizing resettlement policies 
have been disseminated to the commune and village levels. Display of the 
EA/EMPs/RPF/RPs/PFEM took place also in the Vietnam Development Information
