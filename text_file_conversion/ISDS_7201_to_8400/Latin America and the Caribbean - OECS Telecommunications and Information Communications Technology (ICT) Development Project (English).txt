A.2. Project Objectives 
The overall development objective of the project is to improve the access, quality and use 
of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve socio-economic development in the 
OECS. 
To measure the progress toward achieving the project outcomes, the following key 
indicators were defined: 
Extended access to advanced ICT infrastructure for community facilities. 
Reduction on leased lines rates, broadband and mobile tariffs. 
 
The successful implementation of the project will contribute to high-level development 
objectives identified in the region, namely economic diversification and competitiveness. 
It will promote universal access to ICT services, provide economic opportunities for the 
region by attracting private investment and employment in ICT services, and foster the 
utilization of ICT to achieve economic and social development.  
The project will promote the development of an information society. ICT can bring the 
people of the Caribbean closer, maximize the flow of knowledge and information within 
the region and provide a gateway to global knowledge resources. Given the correct 
enabling environment, ICT can enable the region to overcome many of its physical and 
economic constraints and compete globally in the expanding business processing services 
market.  
The project addresses three major development challenges defined in the World Bank’s 
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for OECS: economic growth, poverty reduction and 
rural development. The CAS emphasizes the need for improved provision of basic 
services, access to private capital, and development of a resilient and diversified private 
Page  2
sector. More specifically, the proposed project fits into that strategy by seeking to 
increase the rural access to telecommunications infrastructure, to improve the provision 
of basic telecommunication services, and to foster economic diversification by 
developing the ICT services sector. 
 
The project has four main components that were selected considering the client needs, its 
implementation capacity, and the challenges identified by ICT sector assessments. 
 
COMPONENT 1 
–
Support for Legal and Regulatory Reforms 
The objective of this component is to strengthen the national and regional regulatory 
frameworks and promote additional competition in the sector. Emphasis will be given to 
capacity building of ECTEL and the NTRCs through the provision of assistance to 
ECTEL and the NTRCs to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and to 
develop a modern interconnection regime. The goal of the component is to achieve more 
competitive tariffs for consumers and businesses in the region as well as to strengthen the 
institutional capacity of ECTEL and the NTRCs.
 
Subcomponent 1.1 - Telecommunications Act and Regulations: 
The objective is to review 
and update the Telecommunications Act, ECTEL Treaty and tariff regulations of the 
participating countries, in accordance with the new market and technological conditions. 
The subcomponent will also identify areas where new regulations are needed. 
Subcomponent 1.2 - Regional Forum for Consensus Building: 
The objective is to 
establish a regional forum for consensus building and alternative dispute resolution. The 
forum will facilitate resolution of issues that have a commercial and public policy 
dimension and seek consensus on commercial issues among industry players. 
Subcomponent 1.3 - Alternative Disputes Resolution (ADR) Support: 
The objective is to 
build capacity within ETEL and the NTRCs to establish positions and guidelines for 
handling specific anticipated areas of dispute, and based on current draft dispute 
resolution regulations, develop a standard model for review and adoption by each 
member country. 
 
Subcomponent 1.4 - Development of Pro-competition Policies and Procedures: 
The 
objective is to assist ECTEL and the
 NTRC’s to develop a modern cost methodology to 
determine fixed-to-mobile interconnection and related consumer rates, and promote lower 
fixed-to-mobile retail tariffs through reductions in mobile termination charges. In 
parallel, this component will address the high cost of leased lines by C&W, by focusing 
ECTEL and NTRC’s work on extending the existing PCP, and by ensuring a fair 
interconnect outcome. This is a major issue requiring attention when new entrants are 
allowed into the marketplace.  The component will also explore methods to attract 
additional service providers to services currently dominated by the incumbent. 
Subcomponent 1.5 - Regional Collaboration, Training, and Resource and Information 
Sharing: 
The objective of this activity is to support ECTEL and the NTRCs in 
implementing regulations related to interconnection, numbering, dispute resolution 
procedures, and spectrum management. It includes a comprehensive regional program of 
training for ECTEL and NTRC’s staff and government officials.  Another priority will be 
to strengthen ECTEL and NTRC capacities to collect and analyze usage and pricing data 
covering the sector.

COMPONENT 2 - Universal Access 
The objective of this component is to review current universal access policy, create 
related guidelines and provide financial support to establish a Universal Access Fund 
(UAF). The goal of this component is to promote and stimulate private ICT investment 
for under-served communities and public institutions in accordance with the universal 
access policy framework and reduce the disparities in access to telecommunications 
infrastructure including the Internet. 
The implementation of the universal access will use output based aid (OBA) mechanisms 
to deliver services. This component will assist ECTEL in the implementation of the OBA 
auctions/tender processes by selecting service providers to provide services and the 
funding of the subsidy. A UAF and competitive bidding for the subsidy is generally 
viewed as the best option in financing and promoting universal access objectives. 
Variations of this component have been implemented in Chile, Peru, Dominican 
Republic, Nigeria, Uganda, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 
Subcomponent 2.1 - Universal Access Guidelines: 
The subcomponent will establish a 
unified policy, strategy, and implementing guidelines that help ensure the spread of 
advanced telecommunications infrastructure to communities and public institutions (such 
as schools) in the region. It will assist in preparing/updating a comprehensive 
consultation paper to define universal access guidelines (UAG) for improving access to 
information and telecommunications services through a UAF, as well as drafting 
regulations that would address the management of the Fund and Universal Service 
Obligations. The steps to be taken are to define: (a) socio-economic objectives of UA 
policies; and (b) scope of UA i.e. what to fund by identifying  UA projects.. 
An important aspect of implementation is the funding mechanism. In case of the UAF, 
options are: (a) funding from government budget; (b) contributions from all telecom 
operators; (c) proceeds from privatizations or spectrum and license auctions; (d) 
subscriber levy; and (e) funding from international development agencies. 
Other key UAF items that the project will support include fund administration, the project 
selection process, the use of competitive tender process to allocate subsidies, and 
performance monitoring. 
Subcomponent 2.2 
–
Implementation Support: 
The objective of this sub-component is to provide 
skilled support to implement the guidelines and regulation to be defined under subcomponent 2.1. Based on 
one set of ECTEL guidelines and regulations, and coordination the member countries will implement five 
different projects.
 
Subcomponent 2.3 - Support for Universal Access Fund: 
The objective of this sub-
component is to establish and provide a one-time subsidy to the UAF that will stimulate 
private investment in expanding broadband connectivity and access to advanced ICT for 
under-served communities and public institutions.
 
The implementation of the universal 
access will use output based aid (OBA) type schemes to deliver services.  This 
component will assist ECTEL in the implementation of an OBA competitive 
auctions/tender process to select service providers for providing services and the funding 
of the subsidy. A UAF and competitive bidding for the subsidy is generally viewed as the 
best option in financing and promoting universal access objectives. Variations of this 
component have been implemented in Chile, Peru, Dominican Republic, Nigeria, 
Uganda, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. 
The Bank is supervising a pre
-
feasibility study funded under a Dutch Consultant Trust Fund to explore 
Page  4
potential projects that could be candidates to receive funds from the UAF.  
Whereas subcomponents 2.1. and 2.
2
design and implement ECTEL’s general UA policy 
framework subcomponent 2.3 will focus on financing specific projects.  
 
COMPONENT 3 
–
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
The objective of this component is to improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through 
utilization of broadband infrastructure. It includes implementing various pilot projects to showcase the 
application of ICT using broadband connectivity. 
 
Subcomponent 3.1. 
–
Extending the use of broadband applications by governments and the private sector:
The objective of this subcomponent is to identify the regulatory infrastructure required to move the
 
ICT 
Agenda of each of the countries forward and design pilots to encourage regional use of broadband. This 
subcomponent will be based on the identification of the policies required for facilitating the development of 
broadband applications. It includes the following key activities: (a) technical assistance to identify policies 
required for facilitating the development of broadband applications and infrastructure, and drafting 
appropriate regulations that would give effect to these policies; (b) elaborating and recommending a 
common information systems architecture and standards for the Member States and viable mechanism by 
which complex information systems can be supported and maintained. (e.g., using remote applications via 
broadband systems); and(c) designing pilots to encourage regional use of broadband technologies to 
increase productivity and employment through purchase of equipment and services. 
 
Subcomponent 3.2. – ICT Pilot Projects
:
Based upon the consultancy study carried out in 3.1, the project 
will finance up to five pilot projects that demonstrate the viability and business case for ICT using 
broadband connectivity, with a particular focus on regional initiatives 
 
Subcomponent 3.3. 
–
Alternative communication technologies for Radio Spectrum 
Monitoring System (RSMS): 
This activity would establish an alternative 
telecommunications system to transfer data from the RSMS to ECTEL and the five 
NTRCs through the use of satellite technology for the provision of more reliable 
communication and lower recurrent cost while maintaining international and domestic 
links using the incumbent telephone network. This component builds upon the past 
RSMS system that was being satisfactorily implemented by ECTEL under the previous 
OECS Telecommunications Reform Project.   
 
COMPONENT 4 – Project Management 
The objective of this component is to ensure management and administration of the overall project. The 
project would finance related technical assistance by providing complementary resources.  
Subcomponent 4.1. – Support to Project Administration: 
This subcomponent would 
provide resources to support project administration capacity within ECTEL. A dedicated 
person would be hired for the duration of the project. This person would have project 
management, procurement and financial management skills, as well as technical skills.  
 
Subcomponent 4.2. – Audit: 
This activity would provide funding for project audits.
