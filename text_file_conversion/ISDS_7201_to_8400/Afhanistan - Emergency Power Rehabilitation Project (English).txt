A.2. Project Objectives
The broad objective of the Emergency Power Rehabilitation Project is to provide an improved and more
reliable power supply to the people in Kabul and other main provincial cities of the country.
This objective would be achieved by (i) rehabilitating and enhancing the existing dilapidated generation,
transmission and distribution infrastructure, and by (ii) developing the institutional capacity of the MWP
and DABM to initiate improved commercial operations.
A.3. Project Description
The project aims to improve supplies of electricity to Kabul and other cities through the rehabilitation and
expansion of distribution networks, rehabilitating the largest generation station supplying Kabul and the
associated transmission line, commercializing the operations of the power utility in Kabul, and capacity
building for ministry and utility staff. The project consists of the following eight components:
a)    Rehabilitation and Expansion of Distribution Networks in Kabul -AFG/03178 (US$72 million,
IDA.
b)    Rehabilitation and Expansion of Distribution Networks in Other Provincial Cities - AFG/03178
(US$94 million, Co-financing)
c)    Rehabilitation of Naghlu hydropower station-AFG/03146 (US$30 million, 50% IDA; 50% Co-
financing)
d)    Rehabilitation of 110 kV transmission line from Naghlu to the Kabul East Substation and to the
Kabul North - AFG/04721 (US$ 3 million, IDA)
e)    Technical support for rehabilitation & expansion of distribution networks in Kabul - AFG/03230
(US$5 million, IDA)
l)     Technical support for rehabilitation & expansion of distribution networks in Provincial Cities -
AFG/03230 (US$6 million, Co-financing)
g)    Commercialization of DABM-Kabul - AFG/04738 (US$ 4 million, IDA)
h)     Technical assistance for MWP and DABM - AFG/05259 (US$ I million, IDA)



A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
Kabul city and other provincial cities for the distribution rehabilitation. The rehabilitation of Naghlu and
associated transmission lines is approximately 50 miles east of Kabul.
B. Chieck Environmental Category A [] B [X], C [] Fl []
Comments: The environmental category is justified, since civil works will be limited to rehabilitation and
enhancement of existing dilapidated generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, where there
will be no resettlement or land acquisition as a result of the project. Consequently, no Resettlement Action
Plan is required.
An environmental and social screening and assessment framework has been developed specifically for
emergency operations in Afghanistan. The framework will assist project implementing agencies in
screening all the sub-projects not defined at appraisal for their likely social and environmental impacts,
identifying documentation and preparation requirements and prioritizing the investments. In addition
Procedures for Mine Risk Management in World Bank-funded projects has been designed to respond to the
risks caused by the presence of mines in Afghanistan. All risk assessment and clearance tasks shall be
implemented in coordination with the UN Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The majority of environmental and social impacts of power projects are generally related to generation
development and rehabilitation. Because this project will mostly finance the rehabilitation and expansion of
distribution systems, implementation of the project sub-components is not expected to involve any
significant adverse environmental or social impacts. Specifically:
The rehabilitation and expansion of distribution networks in the cities involves the construction of
distribution networks (erecting poles, stringing lines, and installing transformers and sub-stations)
at current locations or along existing roads, streets or lanes. While some disruptions in day-to-day
activities during construction may be inevitable, these impacts will be temporary. Furthermore, no
land or other assets are expected to be required for the distribution lines or sub-stations.
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice thefinal determination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas



*   The rehabilitation of the Naghlu Hydropower Station will involve procurement and installation of
electro-mechanical equipment at the existing dam site without any impact on water flows in the
river.
*   Rehabilitation of the 110 kV Naghlu-Kabul line (involving the reconstruction of transmission line
towers, replacement of insulators/conductor, etc.) will also be along the existing route of the line,
and no additional land is expected to be required for tower locations, right-of-way, etc.
Most potential environmental impacts are related to siting of facilities (such as sub-stations), construction
activities and the possible presence of mines. Assessment and mitigation of potential impacts will be
addressed through the application of environmental codes of practices, mine risk and safety procedures.
Potential social issues include:
*   Land ownership and land acquisition: No land acquisition is expected for the rehabilitation of
existing power facilities, including right-of-way and sub-stations. The risk of involuntary
resettlement or land acquisition is therefore considered to be extremely low.
*   Risk of social tensions during construction period: There are some risks of increased social
tensions related to the planning of the power rehabilitation project, and the hiring of contractors
and their relations with the local residents.
*   Risk of disruption to social patterns and safety issues: For power lines passing through populated
areas, the construction of sub-stations could disrupt regular patterns or introduce safety concerns
for activities such as water fetching by women and children. In these cases, local consultations
with women should identify such concerns and design measures, such as marked crossings and
speed reduction measures will be introduced.
*   Local employment: Employment benefits are expected from the power rehabilitation works.
Mechanisms to ensure that local populations are the beneficiaries will to be defined as much as
possible and realistic, within the social and ethnic context of each component of the project.
While field reviews have shown that no direct impacts on archeological, burial or historical sites are to be
expected, the project will institute "chance find" procedures to ensure protection of such sites if found
when opening borrow pits and material sites.
The project will not include capacity building and training for MWP and DABM on social and
environmental management of power sector projects because it will be provided under a separate and
parallel IDA-funded activity to be carried out during 2004.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
The project is not expected to generate significant cumulative impacts, although this will be confirmed
through environmental and social assessments during implementation, as required.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
There are no alternatives that could provide equivalent power supply to meet the urgent need in Kabul and
other cities within a reasonable time frame.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The safeguards framework will be included in all works contracts and its proper implementation will be the
responsibility of the Contractor(s) with oversight from MWP. The provisions of the safeguards framework
will be specifically applied to the project's sub-components as follows:



Component                        Assessment and mitigation of impacts
Rehabilitation and expansion  Guidelines for:
of distribution systems in      *   environmental codes of practice
Kabul and provincial cities     *   land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation
l   procedures for the protection of cultural property
Rehabilitation of the 110 kV   *   mine risk procedures
Naghlu-Kabul line
Rehabilitation of the Naghlu  Contractor will ensure mitigation of environmental impacts, if any.
Hydropower Station
Sector wide social and      Capacity Assessment and Building for Social and Environmental
environmental management    Assessment (separate, parallel technical assistance activity)
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring, and evaluation of the components will be consistent with
guidelines contained in the project's safeguards framework.
The overall responsibility of project implementation rests with the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP). A
designated Safeguards Focal Officer has been identified with responsibility for overseeing the
implementation of the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework. The Focal Officer will be
assisted by the Program Implementation Support Unit (PISU). The PISU will include a Monitoring and
Evaluation unit with, inter alia, environmental and social specialists' inputs. Implementation. The
safeguards framework will be included in all works contracts and its proper implementation will be the
responsibility of the Contractor(s) with oversight from MWP.
The capacity building activity will be implemented under a separate Technical Assistance program for
Social and Environmental management
As part of the social and environmental capacity building that will be provided for implementation of IDA-
financed operations in Afghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff of MWP and
implementing agencies/Consultants will receive training in the application of the Safeguard Framework. It
is proposed to prepare specific materials, hold a workshop, and arrange site visits to other countries in the
region on similar projects in progress to provide hands-on training to the Ministry and implementing
agency staff. During supervision of the project, the World Bank will assess the implementation of the
Framework, and if required, will recommend additional strengthening.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholders: They include:
*   Residents and local population in the immediate vicinity of Naghlu hydro power station,
transmission lines and sub-stations.
* Power users in Kabul and other affected cities.
*   Ministry of Water and Power
*   Local government officials and civic leaders
*   Contractors and laborers for rehabilitation, expansion and maintenance activities.
Consultation.:
The bank preparation team and consultants held meetings with the Ministry of Water and Power (MWP) to
discuss the environmental assessment process and requirements. Prior to approval of the project by the
World Bank Board, it will be disclosed by TISA in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also
be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop.
