B.  Project Objectives  
 
1. 
The objective of this project is to build government’s capacity to implement its stated reform 
program.  The TA resources would be focused on implementation and would seek to recruit and 
retain skilled nationals wherever possible thus truly building national capacity on a sustainable basis 
while also implementing key elements of government’s reform agenda. 
 
C.  Project Description   
 
Providing Flexible TA Resources 
 
2. 
The Nepal Economic Reform Technical Assistance Project (NERTA) should be structured to provide 
government with flexibility in building capacity.  This can be done in several forms; 
 
(i) 
Hiring skilled professionals, often from the private sector, on a contract basis for extended 
periods of time to help support general ministerial capacity.  E.g. a long term advisor to a 
reform committee. 
Page  2
(ii) 
Hiring consultants, either local or international to address key issues and transactions on a 
project basis.  E.g. consultants to privatize a state-owned enterprise. 
(iii) 
Study visits to learn relevant experience from other countries.  E.g. the recent visit of a senior 
Nepalese delegation to Sri Lanka to learn from the latter’s’ recent privatization experience. 
 
3. 
At the outset of a reform program some of the reform initiatives will be well-defined, while others are 
not foreseen.  In a country like Nepal, it is likely that unforeseen circumstances may mean that 
government is unwilling or unable to implement reforms that at the outset appeared promising.  On 
the other hand a window of opportunity may open for other reforms.  Successful ERTA projects have 
built in a large degree of flexibility to account for this situation.  At the outset any reform initiatives 
that can be identified are developed into detailed proposals complete with a short concept note, terms 
of reference for consultants and a detailed budget estimate.  These proposals are programmed into the 
project and will have funds pre-allocated to them at the project launch.  The areas we propose to 
cover during project preparation are covered below. 
 
Identifying Areas for Support 
 
4. 
The task team propose to cover the following areas during project preparation; 
 
·
State-owned enterprise reform
:
Restructuring and privatization of SOEs in Nepal has 
progressed slowly.  Heavy government intervention in the economy continues with SOEs 
representing a significant drain on the public purse.  The heaviest loss-makers are the state 
banks, RNAC, the utilities and large industrial sector enterprises.  Staff reductions and 
improved corporate governance is sorely needed. 
 
·
Privatization
:
There are indications that government may be interested in privatizing RNAC 
and Nepal Telecom Corporation.  The TA could provide for transactions advisers to support 
government through the due diligence, roadshow and sale stages. 
 
·
Legal and Judicial Reforms
:
The rule of law is vital to a vibrant economy.  DFID and 
DANIDA have been supporting this area largely through strengthening the CIAA 
 
·
Statistical Upgrading
:
Improved statistics will help to strengthen the evidence base for 
improved policy making as well as monitoring and implementation of development 
programs.  The TA could provide important support for National Accounts, Trade Statistics, 
and other statistical series. 
 
·
Civil Service Reform:  
Although Nepal’s civil service is not overstaffed by some measures, it 
suffers from poor incentives, fragmented decision-making, large numbers at the lower levels, 
and inflexible working practices.  Government has implemented a comprehensive Human 
Resource database, established an affirmative action program, improved procurement and 
taken important anti-corruption measures.  Possible TA support will complement existing 
support provided by ADB. 
 
·
Tax Administration Reform:  
This is a key cornerstone of improved fiscal management.  The 
IMF are not able to devote sufficient resources to make significant improvements in this area. 
 
·
Labor Reforms:
 Nepal has one of the most restrictive set of labor practices in the world.  
Businesses have identified labor regulations as a major constraint.  Important labor reforms 
are a key trigger for the PRSC.  The TA could support this process.

5. 
In each area, the team will assess demand for assistance and government’s future plans.  Promising 
areas will be developed through clear concept notes and actionable TORs tied to appropriate budgets. 
 
6. 
Once appraised, well prepared TA requests will form the core of the project.  We aim to appraise 
about US$1 million of TA requests during preparation.  The remainder of the project resources will 
then be placed into a pool of unallocated resources, the “challenge fund”.
