B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project development objectives are to: (i) generate productive employment through labor-
intensive public works; (ii) carry out cost-effective and economically and socially useful public 
works projects by small and medium enterprises; and (iii) enhance the institutional capacities of 
municipalities to identify, prioritize, operate and maintain sub-projects.  
 
The original Development Credit Agreement in the amount of SDR 31.3 million (about 
US$40.0 million equivalent) was approved on January 23, 2001. It became effective on June 29, 
2001, and the closing date is December 31, 2006.  As of June 15, 2005, more than 75 percent of 
the Credit has been disbursed.  Disbursement projections indicate that the total credit amount 
will be fully disbursed by December 2005, a year ahead of the expected closing date.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed Additional Grant of US$30.6 million would retain the same objectives and 
implementation procedures of the original Project, and be completed within six months of the 
current closing date of the Credit.  It would help implement  61 unfunded sub-projects that have 
Page  2
already been identified and appraised, including 11 new markets, 19 primary schools, 4 health 
centers, 62 km of stone paved roads, a 5-hectar new residential site development, a 180 km 
gravity-fed water scheme, and 6 river flood protection facilities.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The 61 unfunded sub-projects that have already been identified and appraised are located in 
Bujumbura city and in the countryside (all 16 provinces of Burundi).   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The procedures laid out in the EMSF will carry on for the execution of sub-projects funded 
through the requested Grant.  The Technical Secretariat (TS), established at the Ministry of 
Public Works and Equipment (MPWE) is responsible for ensuring that sub-projects are demand-
driven, environmentally sustainable and can be properly operated and maintained. The TS is 
responsible for global oversight of the project without interfering with the day-to-day 
management of ABUTIP, the implementation agency for the infrastructure component.  The TS 
has prepared an annual work program of approved sub-projects for transmission to ABUTIP and 
has consolidated technical progress and financial reports of the project.  The annual work 
program has been going through a preliminary screening based on the social and environmental 
impact assessments by international professional consultants. The TS is staffed by a director, two 
civil engineers, a financial specialist, and an environmental specialist. The environmental 
specialist in the TS follows-up on safeguards concerns and also ensures that safeguards 
requirements included in contracts are implemented by ABUTIP.
