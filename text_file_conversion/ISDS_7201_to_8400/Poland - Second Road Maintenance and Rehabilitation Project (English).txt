A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The object
ive of the project is to continue improving the effectiveness of Poland’s national 
road rehabilitation and maintenance systems by (i) further increasing the percentage of 
national roads in good condition, (ii) establishing reliable and stable funding for the national 
road maintenance and rehabilitation network, and (iii) improving the capacity within the Road 
Administration  to operate efficiently and effectively. These objectives form part of the Letter 
of Sector Development Policy endorsed by the Government on [date]. Achievement of the 
project development objective will be confirmed using the following key indicators: (i) 
adoption and continued use of improved road maintenance and rehabilitation practices within 
GDDKiA; (ii) evidence of use of a coherent 6-year rolling roads expenditure program 
together with an adequately balanced maintenance/investment program; (iii) significant 
increase in the percentage of the road network in good condition when compared with pre-
project conditions; and (iv) evidence of high road user satisfaction following rehabilitation or 
maintenance operations when users are polled, both about the quality of the completed 
sections and the inconveniences associated with the rehabilitation or maintenance processes. 
The table below details the project monitoring indicators, including the results expected at the 
end of the project. The indicators build on the outcomes under the current RM&R project:

Acceleration of investment in infras
tructure is crucial to fulfill Poland’s development agenda 
and meet the challenges still ahead. Modern and well-developed communication network is a 
key element of the general investment climate, which in turn determines country’s potential to 
foster a sustainable private sector-led growth. In Poland the inadequate, decapitalized, unsafe 
and congested road infrastructure is increasingly recognized as a main bottleneck to growth. 
Through high transport costs it disables opportunities to further exploit economies of scale. It 
is also believed to contribute to regional disparities as, in Poland, regional income and 
unemployment levels are strongly correlated with road density. Access to a reliable 
transportation networks is a precondition to have a competitive economy, both on regional 
and national levels. With the lowest ratio of roads in good condition in the region, Poland is 
already losing a fair amount of foreign direct investments to its better equipped neighbors. 
The issue is also linked to the composition of public expenditures. Relative to its comparator 
countries, Poland spends too much on current consumption, while public investment is 
heavily neglected.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project loan amounts to about US$130.0 million and includes 2 components: (a) financial 
support to the road maintenance and rehabilitation program (about US$124.3 million) – in line 
with the draft budget framework prepared by GDDKiA for 2005. The financing scheme and 
implementation principles will be similar to the ones applied under RM&R project; and (b) 
implementation of GDDKiA Management Information System (MIS) within (about US$5 
million) – in line with the Strategy for a Comprehensive Information Technology System 
approved by the GDDKiA in February 2004. The complement to the total US$130.0 consists 
in Front-end Fee (US$0.7 million).

The road maintenance and rehabilitation program
has been prepared by GDDKiA within 
the framework of the budget for 2005. The national budget funds allocated to road 
maintenance and 
rehabilitation will be pooled with the resources provided by the Bank and 
1
Monitored under the current RM&R project 
Page  3
EIB loans, to be used for reducing the existing road maintenance and rehabilitation backlog. 
The Bank team received a tentative list of 110 contracts to be executed in 16 regional 
branches of GDDKiA. The National budget funds allocated to road maintenance and 
rehabilitation, pooled with the resource provided by the IBRD and EIB loans amounts to 
PLN0.7 billion equivalent or about US$ 205million. The proceeds of the loans will provide 
additional resource to essentially tackle the current road maintenance and rehabilitation 
backlog. The purpose of this financial support is to maintain a right balance between 
maintenance/rehabilitation, strengthening and reconstruction of existing roads, and with new 
construction of motorways and expressways.

GDDKiA Management Information System (MIS)
.

mplementation of the MIS is included in the 
GDDKiA’s MAP supported by the RM&R project. A specific risk identified under the RM&R project was the 
lack of a modern MIS within the organization, which would integrate financial-accounting information with the 
contract data including planning and physical measures. The system also aims at addressing current weaknesses 
in the financial planning and control systems, together with the project management systems, used by the 
GDDKiA branches/regions.  The current system worked well when GDDKiA only had to manage a relatively 
small program and only had to deal with one donor (the World Bank). Now that the program has expanded 
several fold and there are numerous donors involved – each with slightly different procedures, there is an urgent 
need to update the financial planning and control systems used at the regional level and also to integrate it with a 
suitable project management system.  This will enable the regions to produce reasonable accurate estimates of 
monthly cash flow requirements and also to manage the physical implementation of the national road program. 
The component would support the MIS Strategy to (i) establish Wide Area Network (WAN) to enable 
communication between GDDKiA headquarters, its 16 branches, and the 120 regions; (ii) develop an Enterprise 
Resource Planning (ERP) by adopting SAP or a similar system; (iii) develop a system workflow for the 
management of documents and information; and (iv) procure the system supporting equipment/hardware. 
 
A.4. As a repeater project, RM&R II will provide budgetary support to the Road 
Administration for its FY2005 road maintenance and rehabilitation program. The project 
finances about 100 contracts, and their location is spread all over Poland’s national road 
network. The works to be financed under the proposed project will be limited to the first nine 
standards defined in the Technical Annex (attached). The project will not involve any land 
acquisition, since works will be carried-out within the right of way.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Since no new road segments will be financed, and any small road widening will be 
carried-out within the right-of-way, triggering of the involuntary resettlement safeguards 
is not anticipated.
 
It is confirmed that road maintenance and rehabilitation works 
supported by the project will not involve acquisition of land. 
 
D.2 Given the nature of the interventions supported by the project, the project does not 
trigger any social safeguards. Furthermore, while the project does not finance land 
acquisition, given the Government’s resolve to undertake significant sector investments 
funded in road sector in the future, the preparation of the RM&R project earlier during 
2004 included an evaluation of the legal framework and its enforcement in regard to 
involuntary resettlement and land acquisition. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)  N/A 
 
D.4 In order to ensure that the project will not negatively impact the environment in any 
way, additional due diligence was or will be carried out during the preparation of RM&R 
II, to follow-up the actions undertaken earlier in 2004 for the RM&R project: (i) a 
description of the proposed project has been prepared and made available to the public; 
(ii) a thematic seminar to discuss environmental management and sustainability issues 
related to the development of the highway sector in Poland will be held on January 26-27, 
2005; (iii) an update of the Operational Manual of the RM&R project on environmental 
and social aspects is being carried out, to  include more specific details on environmental 
mitigation and monitoring procedures, and (iiii) a satisfactory ex-post review of selected 
subprojects under the previous project for environmental compliance with the OM and 
Polish regulations was completed in January 2005. The update will be published before 
appraisal. The detailed description of the current environmental legislation, including 
resettlement policy, was prepared in the context of the earlier (RM&R) project. 
 
D.5. Throughout the project preparation process the Government has been heavily involved in explaining 
the pros and cons of various models proposed for road rehabilitation and investment financing
 
to the public 
(particularly the introduction of vignettes vs. fuel price increases). These efforts, involving meetings and 
consultations and bilateral contacts with the relevant parliamentary committees, NGOs, various 
professional associations, media, resulted in high degree of public awareness regarding the Government’s 
determination to focus on road transport sector and the need to mobilize resources for this purpose. In 
addition, as part of its on-going interactions with the leading Polish environmental NGOs, GDDKiA, in 
collaboration with the World Bank, will convene a consultation seminar on the government road and 
railway transport strategy for Poland.  In this context, the government will share the main design 
characteristics of the RM&R II project (including environmental and social safeguards aspects) and 
encourage NGO representatives to provide feedback.  The seminar will take place on January 26-27, 2005 
in Jozefow, near Warsaw.

Technical Annex 
 
Maintenance and Improvement Standards 
 
Definition of Maintenance and Improvement Standards 
 
The Polish computerized road management system (HDM-4) works on the basis of policies for each section whether 
representative or physical, sub-divided into standards and works. Each policy may contain several maintenance and/or 
improvement standards.  Nine maintenance and five improvement standards have been defined for the existing four 
road classes in Poland. These have been further subdivided depending on the thickness and type of material used.  The 
new sections or committed projects are defined separately. The table below describe the technical standards and 
objectives. 
 
The first nine standards are related to maintenance and rehabilitation supported by 
the present project and which does not require any land acquisition
,
whilst the 
following five are related to road improvement with significant changes in the geometry of 
the existing roads. 
STD 
No 
Standard 
Maintenance Objectives 
(1) Minimum 
Maintenance 
The minimum maintenance standard has been designed to reflect the current 
practice in the absence of major maintenance works. These include the following 
items 
Patching:
Repair of surface distresses such as potholing, wide structural cracking 
and ravelling. It is carried out annually.  
Crack Sealing:
This technique treats transverse thermal cracking and even wide 
structural cracking when limited in area. It is carried out annually.  
Routine Works:
Routine works include all works, which do not have any effect on 
pavement performance as modelled in HDM-4. These works include shoulder 
repairs and routine miscellaneous works such as vegetation control, road sign 
repairs and replacement, line marking, guardrail repair and replacem
ent, etc… 
Routine works are carried out annually. An annual cost is specified for each road 
class.  
Winter Maintenance:
Winter maintenance includes all works carried out as part of 
winter maintenance such as salt spreading; snow removal, etc. An annual cost is 
specified for each road class. It applies to all roads. 
(2/3) Surface 
Treatment 
(Single or Double) 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to 
delay major intervention and renewal of the skid resistance.  
(4) Surface 
Treatment 
With Shape 
Correction 
To preserve the integrity of the pavement by sealing the carriageway in order to 
delay major intervention, improving roughness and renewal of the skid resistance.  
(5) Resurfacing 
by 
Overlay 
To renew surface characteristics including skid resistance, to improve roughness 
and to contribute towards the overall pavement strength. Overlay by surfacing 
included thickness between 30 and 50mm and were applied over a roughness 
values varying from 3 to 5 IRI and low rutting level.

Including bridges 
STD No 
Standard 
Maintenance Objectives 
(6) Strengthening 
by Overlay 
 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to reach the critical 
stage (poor or fair roughness condition), improve roughness and renew 
surface characteristics.   Strengthening by overlay concerned the 
application of multi-layer overlays (two or three layers) varying from a 
thickness of 80 to 270 mm applied over a range of roughness values 
varying from 4 to 9 IRI.  
(7) 
Strengthening by Mill and 
Replace 
To strengthen pavements, which have reached or soon to reach the critical 
stage (poor or fair rutting condition), improve roughness and renew 
surface characteristics.    It is achieved by removing the distressed top 
asphalt layer (s) and replacing it (them) with a new (or recycled) asphalt 
of similar thickness but with better structural characteristics. This 
standard was applied over a range of rutting varying from 10 to 35 mm.  
(8) Strengthening 
by 
Reconstruction 
 
To reconstruct pavements
2
,
which have reached the failure stage (poor 
roughness condition). Reconstruction is achieved through removal of the 
old pavement structure down to the subbase course and replacing it with a 
new (or recycled) pavement structure with high strength. Pavement 
structures varied according to road class and were applied over a range of 
roughness values carrying from 8 to 11 IRI 
STD No 
Standard 
Improvement objectives 
(9) 
Widening to 7 m 
To increase the narrow roads to a minimum standard road width of 7 
metres. This standard is applicable to Main roads with 6 metre or less 
width.  
(10) 
2 Lanes addition to Single 
Carriageways 
To add two lanes to a single 2-lane carriageway (not dualisation) in order 
to increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Trunk and Main roads, which are not dual yet.  
(11) 
1 Lane addition to Dual 
Carriageways 
To add 1 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to 
increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways.  
(12) 
2 Lanes addition to Dual 
Carriageways 
To add 2 lane to either sides of a dual two-lane carriageway in order to 
increase capacity.  This improvement standard is applied over a wide 
range of volume/capacity ratios varying from 0.5 to 1. It is mainly applied 
to Motorways, Expressways, and Trunk Roads with Dual Carriageways. 
(13) Reconstruct 
to 
Expressway Single 
Carriageway 
To upgrade GP roads to Expressway single carriageway standard. This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity 
ratios varying from 0.5 to 1 
(14) Reconstruct 
to 
Expressway Dual 
Carriageway 
To upgrade GP roads to Expressway dual carriageway standard. This 
improvement standard is applied over a wide range of volume/capacity 
ratios varying from 0.5 to 1
