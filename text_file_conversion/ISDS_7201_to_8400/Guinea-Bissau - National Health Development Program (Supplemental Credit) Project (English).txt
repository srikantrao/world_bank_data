B.  Project Objectives 
The proposed supplementa
l credit would enable the Government to meet project development 
objectives through increasing the use and effective coverage of primary health care services and 
referral centers, particularly those affected by the war, and developing further institutional
objectives aimed at increasing Government’s capacity to meet the challenges of the sector in 
implementing its strategies.  
C.  Project Description 
The  proposed  supplemental  credit,  in  the  amount  of  US$4.0  million, would  retain  the  basic 
objectives and
 operating procedures of the National Health Development Program.  It would aim 
to complete the portfolio of the original credit. The proposed supplemental credit would have a 
closing date of December 31, 2006, in order to allow enough time to complete all
 its activities.  It 
would finance:
(a) Utilization and coverage of primary health care centers and referral centers (US$2.8 
million)
This component would essentially finance the rehabilitation and equipping of health facilities 
damaged by the war as wel
l as staff housing (Beli, Tumana, Bafatá, Bambadinca, Samba silate, 
Page  2
Canchungo, Beli, Gabú, Paunca), the construction of a storage facility for drugs (CECOME),  
and the provision of medical equipment and materials for the health facilities.  As part of the 
minimum package of activities, this component will also provide for essential drugs and surgical 
materials, technical assistance for the drug procurement agency, and training for Local Health 
Management Committees. 
Environmental assessment under the orig
inal credit was rated a “C”, with no displacement of 
people.  The supplemental will finance rehabilitation of existing health facilities damaged by the 
war and no one is expected to be resettled from any of the investments proposed, including the 
construct
ion of the storage facility for drugs for which the site has already been identified.  
(b) Strengthening of Institutional Capacity at all Levels (US$ 0.7 million)
This component will finance technical assistance, equipment, and training needed to develo
p 
strategic planning capacity at the central, regional, and local levels as well as to strengthen the 
Ministry’s  administrative  and  financial  management  capacity.    In  addition,  it  will  finance 
contractual personnel, technical assistance and operating costs
 for the Project Coordination Unit 
to cover for the supplemental implementation period, as well as technical and financial audits 
and final evaluation of the project.  
(c) Management and Development of Human Resources (US$ 0.3 million)
This component 
will finance technical assistance aimed at improving the quality, efficiency and 
distribution of human resources through the implementation of specific strategies for personnel 
management  and  training.    In  addition,  it  will  seek  to  improve  staff  motivation
,  working 
conditions and career prospects of health personnel as originally planned under the parent credit. 
Outcomes of these efforts that have been neglected so far in view of the country’s political 
instability, will directly contribute to the PDOs and 
more importantly on improving management 
(Directorate of Human Resources) and technical (district health) capacity to respond to future 
health investments in the country.  In addition to technical assistance, this component will also 
finance training, equi
pment, and operating costs.      
(d) Promotion of Better Health (US$ 0.2 million)
This component will provide for the Malaria Control Program through impregnated bed
-
nets to 
be distributed by the Impregnation Centers created under the original credit.  
The component will 
also finance malaria
-
related IEC program as well as IEC activities that contribute to the fight 
against HIV/AIDS through local non
-
governmental organizations (NGOs), which benefited from 
the expertise of an international NGO (PSI) under 
a recently completed contractual arrangement.

Page  3
Experience with the parent project has been that there have not been any significa
nt 
environmental or social issues.  The supplemental does not change the project in ways that would  
increase the environmental impacts beyond the category C limits.  The drug storage facility to be 
constructed (land already identified) is a small structur
e requiring small quantities of material 
and is not adjacent to an environmentally or culturally sensitive area. The rehabilitation activities 
are small
-
scale and are not going to generate hazardous materials, such as asbestos
-
containing 
demolition waste. 
  Finally, the malaria program is based on the provision of impregnated bed 
nets.
