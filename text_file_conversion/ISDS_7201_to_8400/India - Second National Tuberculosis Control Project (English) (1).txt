B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed Second National TB Control project would be implemented for a period of 5 years 
with the objective to “
Significantly increase TB case detection and treatment completion rates in 
the private and public sectors with a particular emphasis on poor and marginalized groups
”. 
This would in the longer term lead to a decline in prevalence and incidence of the disease in the 
country. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
The development objective stated above would be achieved through Central assistance for States 
and Union Territories which would support the following 
components:
 
i) 
provision of TB treatment through the general health services of states and union 
territories and developing collaborative systems for provision of TB services to those 
accessing the HIV/AIDS program to ensure equitable access to all.  
ii) 
communications campaign to create demand for TB services, sponsor community 
mobilization, reduce stigma, support institutional reform and advocate for TB control.  
iii) 
private sector participation to increase early case detection and extend the reach of 
TB control services while widening patient choice; and providing TB services in 
urban areas in the absence of a well developed public sector health care system. 
 
The project proposes to use a 
program lending approach utilizing a Specific Investment Loan.

The operation will utilize the Bank’s technical and institutional expertise to establish a results 
based operation, strengthen internal fiduciary oversight and set up a mechanism for  performance 
based funding to states and districts. The project would undertake donor coordination through 
regular exchanges and coordinating participation in missions. Performance will be assessed 
against agreed indicators at the end of year 2, year 4 and at the end of project.
 
The project would provide resources for minor civil works; drugs, laboratory consumables and 
equipment; consultant services to support government oversight functions, training programs 
monitoring and evaluation, support to private entities (both for profit and non-government 
organizations),operations research, innovative projects; and incremental operating costs. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The whole country will be covered under the project. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The first phase of the project did not include a comprehensive environmental strategy that could 
address the public health and environment impacts resulting from the project. However the 
Central TB Division of the Directorate General of Health Services had developed a Manual for 
Laboratory Technicians which incorporated some elements of Infection Control and basic waste 
management. 
 
Under the first phase of the project, a strategy for addressing TB in the Tribal Areas was 
prepared and a plan of action developed, which is currently under implementation.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
During project preparation, the GOI will undertake an assessment of representative sample of TB  
clinics to assess practices associated with  TB testing, prevention and control activities, namely 
waste generated at testing laboratories and healthcare facilities and needle and sputum container 
usage, sterilization and/or disposal. This will provide an understanding of additional measures 
needed to address environmental issues and public health safety concerns related to TB and other 
related infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS. The findings from the assessment will facilitate in 
strengthening the existing Manual for Laboratory Technicians to include components for 
environmental management and health and safety. The mechanism for the dissemination, 
training, IEC and monitoring the implementation of these revised guidelines will be elaborated 
within an Infection Control and Environmental Management Plan (ICEMP) 
 
The project is currently undertaking a comprehensive Social Assessment ( SA) for understanding 
the constraints/barriers that the poor especially women, the Tribal population, the urban poor and 
others belonging to disadvantaged communities in accessing and utilizing TB services. AN 
understanding of the changes in the TB service provision strategy, and the institutional and 
implementation arrangements for creating demand and meeting the same effectively are also 
being explored. As part of the SA, a Tribal Development Plan (TDP) is being prepared for  
understanding the efficacy of the strategy existing strategy for providing TB services to tribal 
population. The findings from this assessment will provide necessary inputs for 
strengthening/modifying the strategy and plan for implementing TB services in Tribal areas. 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
Workshops and/or discussion groups will be organized to review the findings of the 
environmental assessment. These workshops will be attended by relevant stakeholders to discuss 
and provide inputs for the revised guidelines and the ICEMP.   
 
Consultations with representatives of tribal communities, NGOs, public and private providers 
and also project authorities at the state and central level will be critical in finalizing the Tribal

strategy for project. The plan for implementation will be widely shared to invite suggestions and 
comments across different states and locations. 
 
C.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared.

D.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
E.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
