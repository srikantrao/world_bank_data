A.2. Project Objectives 
The first objective will be to assist in the rehabilitation of the areas affected by the 
flooding in May 2004. 
 
The second objective of the project will be to build capacity in the DPC to better fulfill its 
role in disaster preparedness and response.  Stronger management systems, improved 
technical capacity, an improved and operational National Response Plan and enhanced 
building norms mapping are critical to this objective.   
 
The third objective will be to help communities to identify and reduce risks. About 50% 
of   project funding will be used to for the planning and implementation of disaster 
mitigation works at the local level. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
I. Reconstruction and Risk Reduction in the Areas Recently Affected by the Storm in the 
Southeastern Province.   
The US$1million LICUS funding is expected to be available soon to begin to assist 
recovery operations in Fonds Verrettes and Mapou. This assistance will be mainly used 
for community organization, needs identification and project design. There is a desire to 
relocate Fond Verrettes, but alternatives are few and likely to be uneconomical. Haitian 
authorities and relief organizations are currently considering options and will continue 
doing so during the implementation of the LICUS projects.  The proposed new project 
would contribute an additional US$2.4 towards the reconstruction of these areas. 
 
II. Institutional Strengthening for the Directorate of Civil Protection (DPC) and the 
Page  2
Permanent Secretariat for Risk and Disaster Management (SPGRD). 
These entities will be strengthened to implement the National Plan for Risk and Disaster 
Management (NPRDM).  The DPC is to become a General Directorate.  It will be 
strengthened with a new accounting system to be able to monitor the funds it disburses.  
Its inventory systems will be updated to manage the equipment it already has and will 
receive under the project.  The DPC will appoint a qualified accountant to oversee these 
activities and its officers will receive training in the use of an inventory system.  The 
project will finance a Project Coordinator, a Procurement Specialist and a Financial 
Management Specialist to assist DPC with its new and extended functions. 
 
To enable the efficient functioning of the DPC, the Emergency Operations Center will be 
given the necessary means, material and technical assistance, to operate effectively by 
providing training and dissemination services.  Training space and materials will be 
provided to the DPC for the Emergency Center.  The DPC and the departments will also 
be equipped with radio and emergency equipment.   
 
The project will finance support for the establishment and implementation of building 
codes that take seismic risks into account, with support from SPGRD and the Ministry of 
Public Works.  The project will finance the preparation of building codes appropriate for 
seismic risk for use by the Ministry of Public Works. 
 
III. Support for a Disaster Risk Identification and Monitoring System. 
 
The project will finance two studies: (i) the preparation of construction standards for 
public infrastructure; and (ii) the preparation of high-resolution digital elevation model 
for the country and analyzing flood risks to the population.  This will involve close 
collaboration between DPC and UTSIG, technical supervision by the OAS (more detail), 
all in collaboration with national agencies and the UNDP.  The project will also finance 
the printing and dissemination of information related to disaster risks, especially hazard 
mapping and construction standards, which will be distributed to all the concerned 
government agencies and other groups. 
 
IV. Local Risk Management. 
About 50% of the project funds will be used for risk identification and risk reduction 
activities at the local level.  The project will help DPC to create or reactivate local 
emergency committees and train them in risk and disaster management.  These 
committees, in coordination with community councils (with help of DPC representatives 
in the departments), will prepare local vulnerability maps and identify risk reduction 
activities (early warning systems, retention walls, terracing, drainage works, pilot 
reforestation projects, etc) to be financed by the project.  Some 50 local committees are 
expected to be involved, 50%, of which would be in urban or peri-urban areas.  Some 
NGOs are already helping DPC with similar projects and could be involved in this effort. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
Page  3
The project will have impacts at national level through institutional and policy 
improvements.  In the regions of  Belle-Anse and Fonds Verrettes  where Component I 
will be implemented reconstruction works will be undertaken reconstruction and 
mitigation works will be undertaken.  Component IV will finance disaster mitigation 
works in 50 communities throughout the country.  
 
Haiti lies in a hurricane belt and is subject to severe storms from June to October.  The 
effects of tropical storms and hurricanes include wind damage, flooding, landslides and 
coastal surges. Geological faults also make Haiti vulnerable to earthquakes. 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A
[
], B [X], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
Comments:
 
There are no major environmental or social issues identified. The classification of the 
project is 
Category B due to potential adverse environmental impacts on human populations or 
environmentally important areas but the environmental impacts of reconstruction and 
mitigation works to community infrastructure are likely to be beneficial and to reduce 
environmental risk. 
 
Giving that the project is being processed under OP 8.50 (emergency Recovery 
Assistance) some procedures in OP4.01 will be exempt to facilitate effectiveness and 
timely achievements of the project objectives. Those exceptions will be justified and will 
be outlined in the loan document.  
 
An appropriate EA will be carried out in the first 6 months of the project for all 
components and investments that require it. A regional environmental assessment(REA)  
is planned and it  would cover a majority of all the activities implemented under the 
project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
By its nature, the project will have a positive social impact since is expected to strengthen 
the national structure for emergency response and disaster management.  This goal will 
be accomplished by identifying  hazard vulnerabilities and risks throughout the country, 
developing community level awareness and executing small disaster mitigation works to 
avoid natural disasters. 
 
The environmental issues will be specific to local areas since this emergency project's 
component 3 will focus on Local Risk Management helping DPC to create  local 
emergency committees and train them in risk management  together with some small 
disaster mitigation works. Construction of new infrastructure will be limited to projects 
that are necessary for rapid economic and social recovery.  Any major new infrastructure 
needs would be left for consideration beyond this project.  The small disaster mitigation 
works implemented under this project will have their environmental impact assessed 
according to usual procedures (screening and assessments) for community-based 
development projects as well as screening for cultural property. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
With the possible exception of rehabilitation works in the regions of  Belle-Anse and 
Fonds Verrettes, indirect or long-term impacts will be minimal. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Local capacities for environmental assessment are very limited.  The project will 
therefore strengthen local authorities and to them develop and implement some 
environmental guidelines. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
