B.  Project Objectives.  
The overall development objective of the project is to improve access to high 
quality and economically relevant secondary education on an equitable basis. 
 
There are two key outcome indicators: 
• 
Secondary school graduates of schools receiving new curriculum and related support via the proposed 
Secondary Education Project will have improved performance, as measured by scores on national and 
international assessments and graduate tracer studies, than graduates of schools which do not receive 
project support. 
• 
Secondary schools receiving new curriculum and related support via the proposed Secondary 
Education Project  will have a reduced variance in student achievement between schools in different 
socio-economic regions, between general and vocational schools, and an overall rise in achievement. 
 
 
The objectives of secondary education reform are integral parts of the broader economic and social 
development objectives of Turkey, as well as the European Union which Turkey wishes to join, and are 
supported by the World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. 
 
C.  Project Description.  
There are three major project components, with seven inter-related sub-
components. The objectives are as follows (sub-objectives are contained in Annex IV, and the Project 
Implementation Manual contains detailed activities for each component).

and vocational programs, and provide related in-service training for management and teachers. 
 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT).
 The objective is to provide ICT training as a core 
competency for youth to function in a modern knowledge economy, to improve the medium of instruction 
by using ICT to expand access to learning opportunities, and support better management of learning and 
administrative processes.  The project finances technical assistance, goods and materials to utilize ICT to 
improve instruction, access on-line educational content and services on the Internet, and assess the 
educational impact of the ICT investments. 
Career Guidance and Counseling

information and guidance services to promote informed career choices and related education and training 
decisions and facilitate lifelong learning. The project finances technical assistance, equipment, and 
materials to facilitate interagency cooperation, develop core career information and guidance resources 
and provide them to education and labor institutions, train existing staff and improve pre-service training 
for career guidance and improve the integration of career guidance and counseling into overall basic and 
secondary education programs. 
Component 2.   Post-Secondary Support 
 
Pre-service Teacher Education

Higher Vocational Schools (MYO).
 The objective is to strengthen articulation between revised secondary 
school programs to post secondary technical programs and facilitate lifelong learning by expanding and 
modernizing selected post-secondary technical/vocational programs.  The project finances technical 
assistance, equipment and materials to define procedures to develop programs; select participating Higher 
Vocational Schools (MYO) institutions, develop and implement programs, and provide short term in-
service training to MYO instructors. 
 
Component 3. 
Quality, Assessment and Management  
 
Student Assessment, Evaluation, and Planning

secondary education by developing systems to create and disseminate information on student and system 
performance, and to help secondary schools improve their own performance and their students’ outcomes 
through a school-based strategic planning process.  The project finances technical assistance, equipment 
and materials to modernize the national assessment system; develop assessment instruments, provide the 
inspection system with a more efficient structure, improve feedback mechanisms to stakeholders, support 
national participation in international assessments; improve the university entrance system; assist 
secondary school staff diagnose their schools performance; and assess the impact of the secondary
