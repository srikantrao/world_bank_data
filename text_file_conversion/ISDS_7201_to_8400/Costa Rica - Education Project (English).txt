A.2. Project Objectives  
 
Project Purpose. 
The Costa Rica Education Equity and Efficiency Project is a key implementation tool of 
the MEP’s 
Plan de Relanzamiento de la Educación Costarricense
.  The project aims to reduce existing 
education quality gaps in rural education and to improve the equity and efficiency in the allocation, 
administration and utilization of education sector resources. 
 
Project Objectives and Key performance indicators.
  
The Project will: (i) reduce existing rural 
education gaps in primary education quality, equity, and internal efficiency; (ii) increase access to, and 
improve quality of, secondary education rural modalities; (iii) improve the impact of equity programs for 
low-income students; and (iv) enhance the efficiency of the education sector’s institutional and economic 
resources allocated to the rural sector. These general objectives will be measured by the following Project 
Development Objectives: 
1
 
\01\02
Reduced education quality gap in primary education across municipalities and schools, measured by: 
(i) 6
th
  grade completion rates, (ii) average scores in 6
th
 grade standardized testing for Math and 
Language; and (iii) percentage of overage students in grades 1-6. 
\01\02
Improved coverage and quality of secondary education in targeted rural areas, measured by: (i) 
increased access to secondary education rural modalities (
telesecundaria
); (ii) improved 9
th
 and 
12
th
 grade completion rates; and (iii) increased average scores in standardized Math and Language 
test scores in 9
th
 grade.  
\01\02
Increased equity and cost-effectiveness of demand-based education programs, across regions and 
across income groups, measured by: (i) increased number of beneficiaries from two lowest income 
quintiles, and (ii) increased program provision in municipalities and schools with low socio-
economic indicators. 
\01\02
Reduced per beneficiary cost of key education quality inputs in the rural sector, mainly: (i) 
infrastructure; (ii) technology laboratories; and (iii) allocation of specialized teachers.

A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project will consist of 3 components that—in an interactive manner—aim at closing the gap 
between rural and urban education outcomes, increasing the participation of low-income students in the 
education system, and optimizing educational resources.   
 
COMPONENT 1: The Quality and Equity of Rural Education Component (US$39.5 Million) 
will 
finance the implementation of Annual Operational Subprojects (POA Subprojects)
2
 aimed at improving 
rural education attainment  (
Rural Education Quality and Equity Subprojects
) and institutional 
development (
Institutional Development Subprojects).
  To orient the preparation of the POA Subprojects, a  
menu of strategies and benchmarks to increase the level, quality and equity of basic and secondary rural 
education have been included in the Policy Activity Schedule, PAS.  The POA Subprojects will be 
prepared each year by the MEP’s central technical units—with participation of education stakeholders at 
the regional and school levels—and will be included in the MEP’s Annual Operational Plan (POA).   
 
Objective (related to section A1):
  The 
Rural Education Quality and Equity Subprojects
 
will improve 
the targeting, education quality and organizational efficiency of rural education modalities in the country, 
including both supply and demand side education services.   The 
Institutional Development Subprojects
 
will strengthen the institutional capacity of the MEP, regional departments and schools, initially to support 
the rural education modalities, but in the medium and long-term will contribute to general institutional 
efficiency.  These objectives will be measured by the following indicators:
 
\01\02
Increase primary completion from 69.9% to 72% in rural areas; 
\01\02
Increase three-fold the enrollment in Television-Supported Secondary Schools in rural areas 
(
telesecundaria y telebachillerato
) from approximately 2,000 to 6,000 students; 
\01\02
Decrease by 2 percentage points repetition and dropout rates in targeted rural primary and 
secondary (
telesecundaria
) schools (approximately 1,400 schools);  
\01\02
Raise the passing scores in standardized tests in targeted multigrade (6
th
 grade), 
telesecundaria
 (9
th
 
grade) and 
telebachillerato
 (11
th
/12
th
 grade) schools, by 5 percentage points in Spanish and 5 
percentage points in Mathematics; and 
\01\02
Integrate education quality investments in targeted rural schools networks, specifically for school 
construction, technology laboratories, allocation of Second-Language and Technology Teachers, 
and improve execution of resources transferred to school councils (
Juntas Escolares 
and
 Juntas 
Administrativas
). 
 
 
COMPONENT 2: Improved Equity of Education Services (US$6.5 Million).  
This component will 
increase the capacity of the MEP to reduce equity gaps by supporting activities to identify, reach and 
monitor the delivery of pertinent supply and demand education services to regions with low education 
indicators and students from low income households.  The component will finance the development and 
implementation of strategies, tools, and institutional improvements to target and monitor education 
services—through a layered approach at the municipality, school and beneficiary levels.  The goal of these 
targeted services is to close existing regional and income quintile gaps and to reduce transaction costs.  The 
component will be divided in two subcomponents: The first subcomponent will develop and implement an 
integrated information system that can track the diverse education outcomes across municipalities, 
communities and schools:  
Sistema de Información de Desarrollo Educativo
 (SIDE).  The second 
subcomponent will provide technical support, tools, and improved processes to integrate and raise the 
capacity of various MEP units managing the MEP’s demand-based equity programs: scholarships, 
vouchers, transportation and school meals.

 The Term “Annual Operational (POA) Subprojects” does not refer to a time-bound period of execution 
(one year) but rather it refers to the institutionalization of subprojects through their inclusion in the Annual 
Operational Plans (POAs) of the MEP.  A subproject’s implementation period may be longer than a year.

of education services to regions and schools with low socio-economic and education indicators, including 
rural areas, while improving the administration, monitoring and evaluation of demand–side equity 
education programs. The objectives will be measured by the following indicators: 
\01\02
99% of the lowest quintile students in targeted schools (approximately 1,400 schools) covered by 
the demand-based equity programs (scholarship, transportation, meals and vouchers);  
\01\02
Approximately 75% of beneficiaries of the demand-based equity programs focused on the lowest 
socio-economic regions; and 
\01\02
Integrated institutional structures for the administration of the demand-based equity programs, 
evidenced by increased cost-effectiveness and reduced transaction costs of the administration of 
equity programs. 
 
COMPONENT 3:  Improved Institutional Efficiency (US$4 million)
.  This component will improve the 
institutional capacity of the MEP through inter-departmental integration strategies and working alliances 
across central, regional and school organizations.  The component will strengthen the capacity of education 
staff, both of pedagogical and administration units, through training and technical assistance in 
participatory diagnosis, strategic planning, program implementation and monitoring and evaluation.  The 
MEP’s coordination, fiduciary and monitoring and evaluation activities for the Project will also be 
supported.   
 
Objective (related to section A1).
  Increased institutional capacity of the MEP, especially—but not 
limited to—those related to the delivery of rural education services, as well as effective and efficient 
coordination, administration, and external monitoring and evaluation of the POA subprojects and the 
Project in general. This objective will be measured by the following indicators:
 
\01\02
Successful integration of technical units of MEP, evidenced by high quality diagnosis, strategic 
and action plans, and monitoring and evaluation of Rural and Institutional Development 
Subprojects (POA Subprojects); 
\01\02
Improved satisfaction with the participatory management process by MEP’s central and regional 
staff  administering rural education programs; 
\01\02
Increased public awareness and support for the MEP’s education development strategies; and 
\01\02
Satisfactory project implementation ratings. 
 
  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The project will support the renovation of dilapidated infrastructure in rural areas throughout the country. 
An abbreviated environmental assessment template (QAT-HD) will be incorporated by the MEP into their 
own environmental criteria for school infrastructure.  It will include appropriate screening criteria capable 
of detecting the possibility of environmental or social impacts of construction activities such as involuntary 
resettlement, presence of historical monuments or other cultural aspects, flood-prone or otherwise 
hazardous areas, and critical natural habitats.  The screening criteria will describe which situations will be 
excluded and which will be mitigated, by whom and how.  The Social Assessment further identified 
populations that might be affected by the Project, including indigenous and Afro-Costa Rican peoples 
living in rural areas.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
The Safeguard policies that are triggered by the project are the Environmental (OP/BP/GP 4.01) and the 
Indigenous Peoples (O.D. 4.20, being revised as OP 4.10).  A Social Assessment was carried out in April-
September 2003 and full details are presented in Annex 10 of the PAD.  Additionally, a stand-alone 
Environmental Assessment framework was prepared and it is also described in detail in Annex 10 of the 
PAD.  Both studies concluded that the project’s impact will be positive, especially since it will be managed 
in accordance with the Bank’s and the Country’s environmental guidelines. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
Groundwater and soil pollution, as well as soil erosion have been identified in previous studies as potential 
environmental impacts of rehabilitation and construction.   
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not applicable. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Given that the Project will support construction activities a stand-alone EAF was prepared, which includes 
the following components: 
 
a. 
an abbreviated environmental assessment template (QAT-HD Education Guidelines), which 
the MEP is incorporating into their own environmental criteria for school infrastructure.  This 
template includes appropriate screening criteria capable of detecting the possibility of 
environmental or social impacts of construction activities such as involuntary resettlement, 
presence of historical monuments, cementeries or other cultural aspects, flood-prone or 
otherwise hazardous areas, and critical natural habitats.  The screening criteria will describe 
which situations will be excluded and which will be mitigated, by whom and how. 
 
b. 
A resettlement framework, to use if and when required; and 
 
c. 
Environmental guidelines to be used by contractors for any civil works component of the 
project or POA subprojects. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Both the Environmental and Social Assessments benefited from the input and collaboration of key 
stakeholders, including the Multi-grade and Indigenous departments of the Ministry of Education, 
providers of education services, school principals, teachers, parents, school boards, Administrative boards, 
and parent associations.
