B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Through implementation of the law and reform of the revenue administrative system, the government aims to: 
\01\02
Improve service to pensioners and taxpayers  
\01\02
Provide consistency and fairness for businesses and individuals 
\01\02
Provide greater transparency and integrity in the administration’s operations 
\01\02
Reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and pensioners 
\01\02
Improve revenue performance 
 
Given the government’s broader objectives, the current policy and institutional context, the project’s key objectives 
ought to be focused primarily on: 
(i) 
improved collection of pensions and social contributions  
(ii)  developing capacity and providing support for administrative reform in the key institutions of pension 
administration. 
 
These efforts should result in better service to pensioners and taxpayers as well as improved compliance rates that 
help in the long term sustainability of the system. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Based on the dialogue so far, the government is keen to address the administrative and policy issues, and recognizes 
that capacity and investments need to be built in the following five areas: (i) tax and contribution collection and 
information management, (ii) pension fund modernization, (iii) policy analysis and evaluation, (iv) supervision 
capacity for private pension funds, and (iv) developing a public education and outreach program.   
 
As such the project’s key components ought to support:  
 
A. 
Increasing Tax and Contribution Compliance.
 
This component will serve to improve 
compliance by 
strengthening the DPR capacity in a timely and efficient manner
 to assume 
Page  2
 
 
the role of (i) social contribution collection in addition to income tax collection; (ii) 
integrated data collection for income tax and social contributions.  This would involve: 
\01\02
Consolidation of contribution collection, control, and enforcement functions in DPR.   
\01\02
Creating a central registry on tax and contribution payers including central registration of new companies, 
self-employed and farmers with data dissemination to all involved institutions. 
\01\02
Implementing integrated and more frequent reporting on personal income tax and social contributions. 
\01\02
Installation of new accounting and control procedures, and new management information systems. 
 
B. 
Restructuring and modernizing the Fund PIO 
with a view to: (i) improving services to clients, both 
contributors and beneficiaries; and (ii) focusing its operations on core capabilities and processes.  This would 
involve: 
 
\01\02
Reviewing the core functions of the Fund PIO in light of the new law and establishing core processes and 
procedures that underlie these core functions (eliminating duplicative functions and streamlining the 
processes to improve services to pensioners would be part of this). 
\01\02
Developing systems to accurately maintain registries of contributors and beneficiaries, database of 
individual earnings history, and contributions paid. 
\01\02
Organization/Application software implementation, i.e. technical assistance for improving basic functions 
of the Fund PIO. 
 
C.  Developing and Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Pension Policy 
\01\02
Develop capacity to supervise private pension funds
 
\01fi
Voluntary pension savings has already been advertised in Montenegro, which 
indicates that regulation of the pension funds industry should take place even if 
private pension savings rates are likely to remain weak.   
 
\01\02
Strengthen capacity to design pension policy within Ministry of Labor 
\01fi
Support development of pension system modeling tools, preparation of analyzes, reports and special 
studies on a regular basis, as well as a comprehensive staff training program.  Establish linkages with 
local and foreign universities and research institutes. Online resources and library to be developed.
 
 
\01\02
Public education campaign 
\01fi
Broad PR and education campaign would aim to promote the goals of the pension reform in 
Montenegro, strengthen public support for a three pillar reform by educating on its expected outcomes, 
and broaden public awareness of the need to voluntarily save for retirement. 
 
D. Project Management.  
The project will be an 
investment operation.
  While some analytical 
work has preceded project development, this is insufficient for putting in place an adjustment 
operation. Therefore, a sector investment operation has been judged the best approach to provide 
the necessary technical assistance and investment needed for modernization of the system.   It is 
expected that, while there may be extensive technical assistance and training to bring systems 
and staff up to speed, the bulk of the costs will be for equipment. So far, no co-financing 
arrangements have been identified, but these will be sought during preparation.

Comments from Gayane Minasyan (ECSSD) via email of Jan 30, 2004:  I have reviewed the PCN and 
Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet for the above mentioned project.  The proposed environmental 
classification as category C is appropriate, given that the project aims primarily at building 
institutional capacity for pension administration with no physical rehabilitation and reconstruction 
works.
