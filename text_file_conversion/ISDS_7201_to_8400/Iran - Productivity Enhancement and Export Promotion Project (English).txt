B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The project development objectives are to enhance the competitiveness of targeted agricultural 
products and increase farmers’ income through the improvement of the local productive capacity 
and the export promotion of high value products.  The project is expected to have a positive 
impact on rural incomes and stimulate growth in focus areas.  It would also contribute to an 
increase in agricultural value added and agricultural exports value.  The development objectives 
would be monitored through:  (i) increased contribution of agricultural exports in overall country 
exports, (ii) increased income of farmers in the proposed project areas. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project has two components: 
a)  Improvement of production and processing systems
.
Through this component, the project 
would finance client-oriented adaptive research and advisory services linked to market 
opportunities and provide direct support to producers organizations.  In particular, the 
project would assist producers and agricultural processors in testing, developing and 
adopting appropriate technologies for identified market opportunities.  It would also 
strengthen service providers and encourage the creation of farm organizations by giving 
producers access to organizational, managerial and legal advice and information. 
 
b) Exports promotion
.
Under this component, the project would contribute to: (i) the 
enhancement of the national policy and regulatory framework leading to an enabling 
Page  2
environment for producers, agribusiness companies, and exporters to take full advantage 
of market opportunities; (ii) the establishment of a market information system for all 
participants in the value chain; (iii) the promotion of generic and specific product quality 
through respectively, support to all participants in the market chain to comply with food 
safety requirements and assistance to local producers and exporters to gain product-
specific premium price as well as protect their share of the market; (iv) the creation 
and/or strengthening of trade and commodity chain associations; (v) the promotion of 
joint ventures between foreign businesses, local exporters and producers; and (vi) the 
improvement of export facilities including cold storage and other infrastructure and 
equipment.
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Project will focus on provinces where potential for high-value product development can be 
identified.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
In Iran, a legal framework for Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) has been established in 
Decree 183 of the Environmental Protection Higher Council 1994, and detailed requirements 
under the law are defined in the Code of Practice 1997.  An administrative framework to 
implement EIA requirements has been established in the EIA Bureau of the Department of 
Environment (DOE).  The legal and administrative framework provides an adequate basis to 
operate an effective EIA system, but monitoring and enforcement are weak.  Recently, DOE 
developed 12 new EIA sectors guidelines in Farsi.  Lately, the DOE has also expanded the 
number of types of projects for which EIA is compulsory, from 18 to 50. 
 
As this project might involve the use of pesticides, the Government would be required to prepare 
a
specific Pest Management Plan (PMP) in order to address the OP 4.09 (Pest Management) 
safeguard policy which could be triggered.
