A.2. Project Objectives 
The development objectives of the Red River Delta RWSS Project are to contribute to 
improving the quality of life and alleviating poverty in selected rural communities by: 
1.  Meeting the demand in these communities for safe, sufficient, and locally 
sustainable water supplies, sanitation facilities for human waste disposal, and 
household wastewater drainage, and 
2.  Increasing the adoption by these communities of hygiene and sanitation practices 
most crucial to improved family health and child nutrition. 
3.  Strengthening the capacity of commune populations in partnership with local 
governments  to plan and manage infrastructure programs, and for local 
governments to facilitate and support community initiatives. 
 
Key indicators: 
·
Number and characteristics of communities and households served (number of 
households and communes/hamlets designated "poor" by MOLISA and/or within 
special social programs for ethnic minorities by CEMMA;  
·
Number of people served with improved access to sustained, safe water supplies; 
·
Number of people with access to sanitation safe sanitation facilities; 
·
Human resource and financial capacities of management organizations for pipe 
water supply systems and other key institutions.

The project will directly respond to the 2003-2006 CAS theme of 
enhancing equitable, 
socially inclusive and sustainable development
.
Within that theme, it will help 
reduce the 
rural/urban development gap, realize gender equality and the advancement of women
,
and 
raise the living standards of ethnic minorities
.
To a lesser extent, it may also contribute to the theme of 
promoting good governance
 by 
increasing the capacity of villages, communes, and local governments to make 
development choices through transparent and democratic processes, and plan and manage 
development initiatives. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project is the first phase of a two-phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL)  
The long-term development objective of the program is to support the Government of 
Vietnam’s efforts to extend coverage of sustainable water and sanitation facilities to 100 
percent of the rural population by the year 2020 and ensure effective use of these 
facilities to achieve enduring economic benefits.  The overarching national program to 
which the RRD RWSS Program will contribute and within which it is firmly set is the 
Government’s 
National Target Program
 for RWSS. The principal applicable governing 
Strategy is the 
National RWSS Strategy to the year 2020
,
issued by Government in 2000. 
Within this context, the RRD RWSS Program will consist of two linked phases, each of 
about five years duration.  It is anticipated that the second phase will begin in the third or 
fourth year of the initial phase.  Together these will focus on up to twelve Provinces in 
the Red River Delta region of Vietnam, spanning 8 to 10 years in total. Government has 
prepared an overall Framework Document describing this 2-phase Program, its place 
within the National Target Program, the impetus it will offer to the implementation of the 
NRWSS Strategy, its broader objectives, and the proposed milestones and triggers to 
initiate Phase 2 (as well as their monitoring, feedback and adaptation implications).  
 
The Phase One project will comprise four components – Water and Sanitation 
Infrastructure Development, Hygiene and Sanitation Behavior Change, Strengthening the 
Capacity of Commune and Local Government Institutions, and Project Management, and 
Monitoring and Evaluation.  The components were selected through consultation with 
central government agencies, provincial and district governments, commune-level 
stakeholders, and other development partners in the sector to determine the areas for 
priority investment and support to make national policies for RWSS work. 
 
Component 1:
 Water and Sanitation Infrastructure Development
will respond primarily 
to the growing rural/urban services gap by improving access to safe water supplies and 
sanitation facilities. It will finance through grants and loans for civil works contracts the 
construction of new piped water systems in communes that do not have piped water 
systems, and to a limited extent upgrading existing schemes.  In areas of the communes 
where piped supplies are either not economically viable, or where demand is low, on-site 
water supply services will be supported through revolving funds and grants for service 
contracts and procurement of goods.  Access to resources for improving sanitation 
infrastructure through a range of technology choices will be made available to all 
households with
in each sub
-
project
.
Infrastructure development plans will include 
Page  3
specific strategies and mechanisms to provide poor households with a basic level of 
service.  Each of the four Phase One provinces will have about 28-30 commune level 
sub-projects implemented.  Inputs will include  
 
Component 2:
 Hygiene and Sanitation Behavior Change
will help mitigate the water and sanitation-related 
disease problems that contribute to poverty in the Red River Delta.  The component will provide a range of 
hygiene and sanitation promotion interventions aimed at optimizing the effective use of improved water 
and sanitation infrastructure and adoption of safe hygiene behaviors in all households within sub-project 
areas through commune and school-based programs.  Particular attention will be directed at developing 
tools and methods for concentrating impacts on poor households.  Inputs will include training, mass media 
campaigns, development and production of health education and promotion tools. 
 
Component 3:
 
Strengthening the Capacity and Capability of Community and Local 
Government Institutions
will address deficiencies in fund transfer, institutional capacities, 
and the effectiveness of commune level investment through training and technical 
assistance.  Inputs will target provincial and district-level government line agencies with 
direct responsibilities for rural  water and sanitation, commune-level consumers and 
water user groups. Piped water supply management entities in the form of joint stock 
companies and cooperatives will be key foci for capacity building.  The component is 
expected to result in efficient and effective planning, execution, and management of rural 
water and sanitation services and sustained capacity for local institutions to play 
supporting roles.  
 
Component 4:
 
Support for Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
will provide 
financing and technical assistance for the establishment and functioning of a Central 
Project Office (CPO) and Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs).  Local and 
international consultants will provide assistance for project management and 
administration, including procurement and contracting of consultants and civil works; 
financial management of large-scale projects, budgeting and strategic planning; 
developing and implementing institutional capacity strengthening programs; and 
developing and implementing monitoring and evaluation programs, and quality control 
procedures.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project is the first phase of a proposed two-phased Adaptable Program Loan.  The 
entire Program is anticipated to include 12 provinces in the Red River Delta region and 
adjacent mountainous areas of Vietnam. The Phase One project includes four provinces 
–
Hai Duong, Nam Dinh, Hinh Binh, and Thai Binh. The project area is mainly an alluvial 
floodplain. Population density is high and agriculture (primarily rice cultivation) is the 
economic base. The population is progressively agglomerating in small and medium 
urban or urbanizing settlements, and small industries such as metal cycling over which 
there is little regulatory control are growing rapidly.   
 
Environmental issues include: 
·
Potential for arsenic contamination in groundwater sources 
Page  4
·
Inappropriate use and management of agricultural pesticides and herbicides 
possibly leading to water source contamination 
·
Surface water pollution from small industries 
·
Point-of-use wastewater drainage from improved water supplies (e.g. standing 
water may increase mosquito breeding)

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
There are no potential large scale, significant, and/or irreversible impacts. There will be 
minor, short term environmental impacts associated with construction activities. Land 
acquisition for construction of water supply and sanitation infrastructure is small in area 
and will have minor impacts.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  
 
The project would not cause or contribute to long term or cumulative impacts.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
For each subproject, a quantitative assessment of potential water sources (surface and 
groundwater) and their quality is carried out. The selection of the water source will 
depend on water availability and quality, and the subproject design will address water 
treatment needs in relation to water quality and standards.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01)
.
The Borrower prepared an Environmental 
Guideline that commits it to an environmental review process of all subprojects and 
Environmental Assessments/Environmental Management Plans (EAs/EMPs) for the eight 
Year 1 subprojects (in Hai Duong, Nam Dinh, Hinh Binh, and Thai Binh provinces). 
These found that that the project will have positive environmental and public health 
impacts through the provision of affordable, clean, and more reliable individual water 
supply connections and on-site demand driven sanitation services. Construction would 
have temporary impacts such as increased environmental pollution (air, noise, vibration, 
surface run-off) resulting from excavation work and workforce activities. These impacts 
are small in scale and will be mitigated through standard measures that have been 
incorporated into the EMPs. None of the phase I projects are located near or within 
protected areas or other important natural habitats. The phase I subprojects will rely on 
surface water, and water quality tests carried out through the EA show that water quality 
in these sources meet Vietnam’s standards.   
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12).
The Borrower prepared a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) for use throughout the project, and Resettlement Plans for the phase I 
subprojects. Land acquisition for construction of water supply and sanitation 
infrastructure is small in area and will have minor impacts. The RPs have been prepared 
in close consultation with Displaced Persons (DP), local authorities at different 
Page  6
administrative levels and other key stakeholders. Potential negative social impacts 
include small-scale land acquisition and resettlement. A detailed survey and inventory of 
affected assets was completed for Year 1 subprojects, which found that 52 households 
(224 people) from 8 communes will lose agricultural land, structures, trees, and crops. 
None of the DPs will be severely affected or require relocation. Resettlement Plans (RPs) 
for the first year investments have been prepared, cleared by the Bank, and disclosed 
publicly. The RPs identify the compensation that is required. All RPs of the subsequent 
phase will be prepared during implementation, separately for each project province, and 
the same RPF will be applied.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.20)
.
The Borrower prepared an Ethnic Minority Strategy in 
accordance with OD 4.20.  The objective of the strategy is to ensure that ethnic minorities 
are well informed, consulted and mobilized to participate in planning, construction and 
operation of all project activities, and services and facilities provided by the project, and 
that they are not adversely impacted by land acquisition. The subprojects are not expected 
to cause any culturally specific impacts on the communities of ethnic minorities. The 
subprojects are not expected to cause any culturally specific impacts on the communities 
of ethnic minorities. Ethnic Minority Development Plans are not needed for any of the 
Year I subprojects, but are expected to be required for subprojects in later years. There is 
one commune with significant concentrations of ethnic minorities included in the 
preliminary list of 120 prioritized communes for the project. This is Thach Binh 
commune, with 3,445 ethnic minority people, mainly Muong.  
 
Typically, ethnic minorities do especially well with demand-driven projects because of 
their strong community organizations. Project management guidelines give prominent 
roles to traditional leadership in sub-project decision-making. TA selection criteria will 
give preference to fluency in local languages. Monitoring will include field visits to 
isolated areas to ensure that all provisions are being implemented. The project will also 
invite NGOs to provide independent monitoring of isolated areas.  
 
Implementation Arrangements
.
The Central Project Unit (CPU) and Provincial Project 
Management Units (PPMUs) will be responsible for monitoring environmental and social 
development outcomes and managing implementation of the EMPs and RPs. These units 
will be supported by consultants to ensure that they can develop and apply procedures 
under the project as well as work with contractors and local authorities. An independent 
agency will monitor compliance. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Target communities as a whole will be directly responsible for sub-project planning, 
decision-making, and financial management. Within these communities, key stakeholder 
groups include the formal community leadership, mass organizations such as the 
Women's and the Youth's Unions, local school and parent/teacher associations, and 
individual families.  
Page  7
Project facilitation, training programs, the participatory planning approach, transparency 
mechanisms, and fiscal decentralization are all elements of the project design to promote 
stake holder ownership of the project. Project beneficiary groups have been directly 
involved in the design of the project using a participatory approach. Particular attention 
was paid to ensuring the equitable involvement of women and poor households in 
planning and decision-making. Prevailing social structures often limits the voice of 
women and the poor, but project field staff will be trained to facilitate their inclusion 
through, inter alia, participatory poverty analysis to identify the poor, separate focus 
group discussions, and preparation of guidelines for village water management groups.  
 
The project stakeholders are participating households, including project affected people, 
local authorities and mass organizations (eg, women’s union). Public consultation on the 
location of works, and potential environmental and social impacts of the project, was 
carried out with the local governments, commune members, and DPs. Summaries of the 
safeguard documents (EA/EMPs/RPF/RPs/EMDS) in Vietnamese were displayed in each 
of the district towns at a public place, and were disclosed through the Vietnam 
Development Information Center in Hanoi and in the InfoShop in Washington DC
