I.A.2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is to generate 588,565 tons of CO
2
e
emission reductions by the year 
2017 through the reforestation of 4,140 hectares of lands privately owned by small and 
medium farmers in Pérez Zeledón County, San José, Costa Rica. It will be accomplished 
by reforesting over a period of three years (i) 1,200 ha of pasture lands using natural 
regeneration, and (ii) 2,490 ha of pasture lands using forest plantations; and by planting 
180,000 trees using agroforestry systems in 450 ha of crop and pasture lands. The project 
will also generate additional ecological, wildlife, and landscape diversity benefits in the 
project area. 
 
Performance indicators. The primary performance indicators are: 
(i) Timely delivery of 393, 953 t of CO
2
e
emission reductions (or anthropogenic GHG 
removals) by 2012 and a cumulative total of 588,565 t of COe
2
by 2017.  
(ii) At least 100 small and medium farmers participating in the project reforestation 
activities. 
 
Project components 
Component 1. Contracting landholders to provide environmental services.  
Under this subcomponent environmental service contracts will be issued with 
participating landholders, mainly for the provision of anthropogenic GHG removals, 
through human-induced promotion of natural seed sources (natural regeneration), forest 
plantations, and tree planting in agroforestry systems. 
 
Component 2. Anthropogenic GHG removal monitoring and evaluation 
The project will support the implementation of a new monitoring system for 
afforestation/reforestation projects that include the participation of small and medium 
farmers in tropical regions. 
 
As with all BioCF projects, this project represents a unique opportunity to simultaneously 
promote the objectives of the United Nations Conventions on Climate Change, Biological 
Diversity, and Desertification; to improve rural livelihoods; and to contribute to the 
sustainable development objectives of Costa Rica. 
 
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)  
Page  2
Costa Rica is presently implementing the Environmental Services Payments Program 
(ESP), mainly using its own resources. Through the implementation of the ESP program 
FONAFIFO has developed technical and administrative capacity to promote reforestation 
projects in the country. Through the COOPEAGRI Project FONAFIFO proposes to 
expand the scope of the ESP program in a specific area of the country (
Pérez Zeledón 
county). FONAFIFO will pay to the farmers the environmental services of biodiversity 
protection and protection of water resources and scenic beauty generated by the 
reforestation activities, These payments will be complemented by the additional income 
from carbon sales. 
 
The additional income from carbon sales to the World Bank BioCarbonFund (BCF) will 
allow FONAFIFO to: 
(i) Create a new ESP modality: reforestation of deforested lands through human-induced 
promotion of natural seed sources (natural regeneration); and 
(ii) Improve the cash flow pattern typical of forestry activities, making it appropriate for 
small and medium landowners’ needs. 
 
The project area is located in the county of Pérez Zeledón, San José, Costa Rica. It covers 
three different geographic locations of the county: the Northern Hillsides, the Southern 
Hillsides, and the Valley. The project will promote the development of a diverse 
landscape of land uses within COOPEAGRI’s area of influence in order to maximize 
social and environmental benefits, including the generation of carbon offsets. 
COOPEAGRI is a cooperative with over 10,000 active members presently dedicated to 
agricultural activities such as coffee, sugarcane, and cattle. 
 
Farmers associated with COOPEAGRI will introduce forestry activities on their privately 
owned farms, through the ESP program. The project will have a total of 4,140 ha 
distributed among three different project activities, which will be established within a 
period of three years (see Table 1).

(Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of 
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or 
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.) 
The project is situated in the in the southwest of Costa Rica. The nearest city is San Isidro de P
érez Zeledón. The 
project area is located in the county of Pérez Zeledón, San José, Costa Rica. It covers three different geographic 
locations of the county: ,the Northern Hillsides, the Southern Hillside,s and the Valley. The project’s geographic 
location is Latitude North: 9.22° to 9.40° Longitude West: 83.28° to 83.81° (Datum WGS84). It covers 4,140 ha, 
spread over 10 districts, 194 towns, and 1 municipality.

n/a 
 
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues 
During preparation the EA confirmed that the proponent operates in line with Bank 
polices, SFC standards, and WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard 
and Guidelines to Classification. 
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
A
Bank mission in March 2005 met with project sponsors of the Cooperative Corporation 
(COOPERAGRI) based in San Isidro and the National Forestry Financing Fund (FONAFIFO) based in the 
city of  San José with whom technical discussions and field visits to potential sites were made in the area of 
Pérez Zeledón county. Community members associated with COOPEAGRI expressed strong interest in 
supporting the project. 
 
On December 13, 2005 a mission to Costa Rica was carried out to supervise and work with FONAFIFO 
and local consultants on project preparation activities for this BioCarbon project. A formal consultation 
with the broad participation of COOPEAGRI representatives and community members is expected to take 
place in early 2006. 
 
The GoCR expressed full support to the project through the OCIC on July 27, 2004, and it is expected that 
this will be officially ratified in January, 2006.
