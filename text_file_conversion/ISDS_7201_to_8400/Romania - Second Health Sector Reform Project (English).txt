A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project will have the following objective: provide more accessible services, of 
increased quality and with improved health outcomes for those requiring maternity and 
newborn care, emergency medical care and rural primary health care. 
 
The principal beneficiary groups would be the users of services targeted for improvement 
by the project: pregnant women and newborn, rural populations, and those needing 
emergency services. This objective is consistent with the overall program objectives 
defined at the beginning of APL phase 1.  
 
In addition to the obvious benefits of reducing maternal and infant mortality, general mortality in rural 
areas, and overall improvement of quality of care, this project would demonstrate the impact of the 
rationalization approach across a vertical program throughout Romania. This would support more extensive 
implementation of rationalization plans developed in Phase I. 
 
Proposed project performance indicators would include: perinatal mortality rate, deliveries attended at 
appropriate level of care, occupancy rate and length of stay in maternity services, utilization rate of primary 
care services in rural areas, survival rates of major emergencies arriving alive at the hospital emergency 
department, response time on emergency calls and dispatch effectiveness.

A.3. Project Description 
The project has five components as following:
 
COMPONENT 1: Maternity and Neonatal Care Component (US$ 129 million)
 
This component will fund facility rehabilitation for maternity and neonatal care units, as 
well as medical and other equipment necessary for high quality neonatal and maternity 
services. Technical assistance and training will be provided to ensure implementation of 
best international practices, building on already existing partnerships between the 
Government and WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA. and bilateral donors (USAID and Swiss 
Cooperation). Support will be provided to improve the capacity of health care authorities 
and provider units to monitor service quality and access. 
COMPONENT 2: Emergency Care Services (US$ 60 million). 
 This component 
would help to develop and implement integrated ambulance dispatch capability and 
upgrade hospital emergency areas. Both interventions are essential to maximizing the 
impact of the investments that have been made to date, and the effectiveness of the 
emergency medical services system generally. 
COMPONENT 3: Primary Health Care and Rural Medical Services (US$ 14.5 
million)
.
This component will focus on improvement of accessibility and quality of basic 
medical services in rural and small urban areas, and will support two of the most 
important activities included in the Primary Care Strategy recently approved by the 
Government: 
COMPONENT 4:  Planning and Regulation (US$ 0.6 million).  
This component will 
support the development of National Health Accounts and the preparation of proposals 
for rationalization and service development projects, under the following two sub-
components: 
COMPONENT 5: Project Management (US$ 2.5 million).  
Component. would 
support the operation of the Project Management Unit and its extensions at the regional 
level, building up on the implementation  arrangements of the first phase project and 
expanding the its responsibilities in order to properly cover the new activities related to 
the physical rehabilitation of the buildings infrastructure and the on site equipment 
delivery.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will support limited minor rehabilitation of around 160 selected hospital 
units, mostly maternities, located throughout Romania as well as 40 hospital emergency 
departments.  No major environmental issues or impacts are envisaged.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project will support the rehabilitation of 152 maternities and 7 Emergency Services 
Units of Pediatric hospitals. The main physical investment components for the proposed 
project are minor rehabilitation of existing maternity hospitals and hospital units, and 
refurbishment and equipping rehabilitated units with medical equipment, which will also 
be provided by the project. Furthermore, the project will provide medical equipment to 
selected primary health care facilities and emergency medical services facilities 
throughout Romania.  
 
The immediate impact on the environment from the envisaged small scale rehabilitation works will be 
limited. Potential adverse environmental impacts are expected to be limited in scope and severity. Effects 
could comprise dust and noise related to demolition and construction; disposal of construction waste; 
inadequate handling of hazardous wastewater, waste gases and spillages of hazardous materials during 
operation of the building; and inadequate handling of medical waste, disposal of expired pharmaceuticals 
and medical equipment. These risks can be effectively anticipated in advance of project implementation 
and will be addressed by appropriate mitigation measures in the design and implementation process. The 
project is expected to have a beneficial impact to access and quality of health care services. The provision 
of updated equipment and renovation of facilities will have a positive impact on reducing energy 
consumption and the use of consumables for diagnostic and analytical procedures. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
No potential indirect and / or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area is expected. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
n/a 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
During project preparation, experts financed from the PHRD grant carried out a survey 
on the expected scope of civil works and rehabilitation needs, including identification of 
the potential scope and nature of environmental impacts and appropriate mitigation 
measures. Furthermore, a review of the environmental laws and regulations relevant to 
the Project was conducted. Similarly, the capacity of the local environmental agencies for 
monitoring and enforcement was assessed. An Environmental Management Plan was 
prepared in consultation with the main stakeholders. The Environmental Management 
Plan has been translated into Romanian and was published on the website of the MoH on 
September 16, 2004.  A stakeholder consultation meeting was held on September 20, 
2004. 
 
The borrower has successfully implemented the first phase of the APL, and appropriate supervision 
measures are already in place in the existing Project Management Unit of the Ministry of Health. In 
addition, an environmental specialist will be identified within the General Directorate of Public Health and 
Sanitary State Inspection, who would be responsible for coordination and supervision of the environmental 
management plan and risk mitigation measures to be undertaken in the project. The specialist would work 
closely with the regional project coordination and supervision staff and the PMU. S/he would (a) 
coordinate environmental training for staff, designers and local contractors; (b) disseminate existing 
environmental management guidelines and develop guidelines in relation to issues not covered by the 
existing regulations, in line with EU standards for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation 
measures; (c) ensure contracting for construction and supply of equipment includes reference to appropriate 
guidelines and standards; and (d) conduct periodic site visits to inspect and approve plans and monitor 
compliance. 
 
In addition, PMU staff does include civil works specialists, who will be actively involved 
in the planning and supervision process of environmental issues during project 
implementation. A separate environmental impact assessment and site-specific screening 
process, as well as supervision of construction, is required by law for all civil works in 
Romania. Further details are described in the Environmental Management Plan, which 
will be part of the Project Operational Manual. Implementation of the EMP and relevant 
provisions by Romanian law would be supervised by the MoH and the District Public 
Health directorates.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders with regard to safeguard issues are the Ministry of Health, the Project Management Unit, 
the National Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, the General Department of Public Health, 42 county 
Public Health Authorities, management and staff of the participating health care providers, local 
communities, patients and contractors for civil works.   
 
An Environmental Management Plan was prepared in consultation with the main 
stakeholders during project preparation.  The Environmental Management Plan has been 
translated into Romanian and was published on the website of the MoH on September 16, 
2004.  A stakeholder consultation meeting was held on September 20, 2004.
