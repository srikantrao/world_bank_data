2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase the productivity and 
commercialization of hillside agriculture targeted for development under the Project. 
Specifically, the key outcome indicators for the project objective are proposed as follows: 
(i) increased productivity of targeted irrigated command areas ($/ha); (ii) increased 
productivity of targeted non-irrigated command areas ($/ha); and, (iii) increased share in 
commercialized products from the targeted areas.   
 
3. Project Description 
This project represents additional financing in an amount of US$ 50 million from the 
Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) to implement an additional 
series of catchment areas within the overall Government of Rwanda (GoR) Land 
Page  2
Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation (LWH) program (Credit No. 4674-
RW).  
 
Component A: Capacity Development and Institutional Strengthening for Hillside 
Intensification  
 
The objective of Component A is to develop the capacity of individuals and institutions 
for improved hillside land husbandry, stronger agricultural value chains and expanded 
access to finance. Component A includes four sub-components:  
 
Sub-component A1: Strengthening Farmer Organizations  
 
Sub-Component A2: Extension  
 
Sub-component A3: Marketing and Finance  
 
Sub-Component A4: Institutional strengthening and Capacity Building: MINAGRI and 
its Agencies  
 
Component B: Infrastructure for Hillside Intensification  
 
The objective of this component is to provide the essential hardware for hillside 
intensification to accompany the capacity development and institutional strengthening 
activities of Component A. Its three sub-components are organized around the L, the W 
and the H of LWH, and support: (i) Land husbandry infrastructure for the development of 
participatory and comprehensive land husbandry practices in sub-watersheds; (ii) Water 
harvesting infrastructure, including valley dams and reservoirs; and, (iii) Hillside 
irrigation infrastructure, including the development of the conveyance structures for 
hillside irrigation. Altogether, the project will develop about 5,000 ha, utilizing a 
participatory sub-watershed approach. Three sub-components will be supported under 
Component B:  
 
Sub-Component B1: Land husbandry infrastructure  
 
Sub-Component B2: Water harvesting infrastructure  
 
Sub-Component B3: Irrigation infrastructure  
 
Component C: Implementation through the Ministerial SWAp Structure  
 
The objective of Component C is to ensure that Project activities are effectively 
managed within the new SWAp structure for Ministerial implementation of programs and 
projects at MINAGRI. With the very recent restructuring of MINAGRI, both as part of a 
Government-wide rationalization and to facilitate the implementation of the agricultural 
sector's nascent SWAp, the World Bank is committed to helping MINAGRI effectively 
manage and implement its programs and projects without the creation of new project 
implementation units (PIUs).   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Preliminary site selection for the Project takes place in six watersheds in four Districts, 
covering about 5,000 ha. Selection of the watersheds is based on the specific criteria 
developed with Government as part of their Common Framework for Engagement (CFE). 
These include: (i) social criteria (responsiveness/interest of beneficiaries; district 
leadership and ownership; level of social impact, including the number of beneficiaries 
Page  3
on the site, the proportion of female-headed households therein, rainfall and livelihood 
factors such as flood risk and drought prevalence; and the number of displaced 
households relative to the site size); (ii) economic criteria (site-specific rate of return, 
year-round access to markets); and (iii) technical and environmental criteria (sufficient 
water harvesting potential for command size; severity of soil erosion; a moisture regime 
where water harvesting and irrigation makes a difference, i.e. distribution of rainfall over 
the year, coincidence of excess rainfall and drought); and the level of environmental 
impact of the watershed and on downstream marshlands. The full set of 101watersheds 
covering 30,250 ha in 17 Districts in the Government's overall LWH Program have been 
identified by pre-feasibility studies and the Project team made a preliminary selection of 
6
sites from among these, using the site selection criteria noted above. The selection was 
confirmed during appraisal, particularly with respect to the subjective assessment of 
community buy-in and district ownership.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The main environmental safeguards issues for the Project relate to: (i) hydrological 
impact of water harvesting, water abstraction and changes to water outflows from the 
dams and irrigation systems, changes in water table and soil salinity, changes in water 
quality and eutrophication and siltation of water bodies, and associated impacts on 
downstream aquatic habitats and biodiversity; (ii) radical terracing and other earthworks 
in the command area and associated impacts on soil as well as potential increase in the 
use of agro-chemicals and spread of agricultural weeds; (iii) afforestation of steep slopes, 
establishment of no-use areas on the most fragile slopes and other land husbandry 
measures and associated impacts from potential technical or institutional failure of these 
measures; and, (iv) human health and safety impacts from waterborne diseases.  
 
Page  4
The key social safeguard issues arise from permanent and temporary land-taking that is 
required for establishment of water reservoirs, development of primary and secondary 
water distribution channels, and construction of terraces.  
 
Consideration was also made to the application of OP 4.10 for this project with regard to 
communities that have been historically marginalized due to cultural and political 
reasons, including the Batwa ethnic group, who in the past had distinct livelihoods. It is 
estimated by the Government of Rwanda that 25,000-30,000 of these historically 
marginalized people live in Rwanda at present. A socio-economic survey, undertaken in 
2004, notes that the historically marginalized people live in small groups dispersed 
throughout the country and earn their livelihoods as potters, laborers and porters. Further, 
the survey notes that these people do not participate in traditional community life distinct 
to the group, although they would be considered vulnerable. The survey also concludes 
that only about 14% of these people, who constitute about 920 households, live in rural 
areas, where the LWH project will necessarily operate (as an agricultural project).  
 
OP 4.10 screening for LWH: Notwithstanding the small number of rural, historically 
marginalized households in Rwanda, the small likelihood that these would be found in 
groups, a screening was undertaken during Project preparation in areas likely to be served 
by the Project for field verification of the conclusion that Indigenous Peoples would not 
be affected by the project. In determining whether OP 4.10 applies to the LWH Project, 
the following screening activities were undertaken:  
 
(i) Mayors, other local leaders and community members were consulted in seven 
communities of Kayonza, Bugesera, Karongi and Gatsibo districts. These districts are 
included in the proposed Rwanda LWH Project and are notable rural growth centers (that 
may also be considered for rural electricity connections under the Rwanda Electricity 
Access Scale Up project). Discussions with both men and women provided no evidence 
of distinct historically marginalized groups or individuals in the visited localities. The 
screening was undertaken as a pulse taking and a modest effort in light of OP 4.10, given 
the low chances of expected impact on the historically marginalized people.  
 
(ii) Further to this modest effort, the socio-economic studies undertaken for the sites 
being considered for the Project did not yield information on indigenous peoples (IPs) 
with distinct livelihoods that might be affected by the project. Instead, the studies showed 
households with varying educational levels (81% had basic education), owning 
residences (100%), and made out of earth walls and iron sheets roofing, while IPs in this 
country are known to have no education and temporary shelters made of sticks and grass.  
 
During the appraisal mission (September 1-15, 2009), a third round of screening by the 
Team's Social Development Specialist confirmed the absence of any indigenous peoples 
as defined by the World Bank Policy 4.10, by visiting households that had been identified 
as "historically marginalized." These visits confirmed at five specific LWH sites level, 
that there is a great extent of integration of all groups of people since 2003 into villages 
(imidugudus) and, therefore, there were no groups identifying themselves or recognized 
as a distinct cultural group, or have collective attachment to distinct habitats or ancestral 
territories. All people have taken on farming and some in addition have taken on pottery, 
and own the plots of land where their houses are situated. All children attend school and 
Page  5
they speak the same language - Kinyarwanda. Therefore, it has been concluded that there 
are no Indigenous Peoples in the project area, as defined in the Bank Policy O.P. 4.10. 
However, other marginalized groups, such as people affected by HIV/AIDs, widows, the 
elderly, etc., were found and these are provided for in the RPF and other Project 
activities.  
 
Based on the above analysis, it was concluded that OP 4.10 does not apply to the 
proposed LWH project.  
 
Further to this screening, the recently commissioned Strategic Social Assessment will 
undertake, among other tasks, to identify any historically marginalized and vulnerable 
groups by conducting a self-identification survey in potential Project-affected areas. (This 
activity was prepared in order to better plan for the participation of vulnerable groups in 
the proposed LWH project, including historically marginalized groups, returning and 
returned refugees, persons affected by HIV/Aids, orphans, widows/widowers and the 
elderly). This activity, with respect to OP 4.10, will extend the screening beyond what 
was done in the seven communities and followed up with the socio economic studies. 
Should the Strategic Social Assessment identify the presence of historically marginalized 
people, the Team will follow up with a screening by Safeguards Specialist to determine 
whether these are Indigenous Peoples, as defined by OP 4.10. In all cases, should 
vulnerable people that may be relevant to OP 4.10 be unexpectedly noted through the 
preparation of the strategic social assessment or other project activities, and require the 
application of OP 4.10, an Indigenous Peoples Plan will be prepared in accordance with 
the policy.  
 
Note that in general, the main Project impact on any low-income household, including 
those who might be from the historically marginalized groups, would be the provision of 
targeted assistance to those who would like to improve their livelihoods through land use 
management measures for increased productivity and commercialization of hillside 
agriculture. Negative impacts, if any, would be related to both permanent and temporary 
land acquisition associated with land husbandry measures for hillside agriculture in 
selected sites (e.g. establishment of reservoirs, development of primary and secondary 
water distribution channels, and construction and maintenance of terraces). These issues 
have been addressed in the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) that were disclosed in 
accordance with OP 4.12. The RPF provides for impact on all groups of vulnerable and 
marginalized men and women, including returning and returned refugees, people affected 
by HIV/Aids, orphans and the elderly.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Indirect project impacts include increased use of agro-chemicals (although the project 
supported crops will target the organic market niche, therefore, agro-chemical use 
increase is expected to be modest), and social changes associated with shift to irrigated 
agriculture and consolidation of farming and catchment management efforts in target 
areas.  
 
Page  6
Long term impacts include water abstraction and changes to the hydrological regime, 
and changes in land use and land cover in the catchment and the command area (e.g. 
afforestation in the catchment, and shift to high value crops in the command area).  
 
Cumulative impacts, particularly on hydrology, are possible through future development 
of other hillside irrigation schemes within the same watershed, and through development 
of irrigated agriculture in downstream lowland marshes. The cumulative impacts under 
the LWH project are expected to be negligible due to: (i) wide distribution of the selected 
pilot sites; (ii) small size of the irrigation schemes; (iii) low levels of water abstraction; 
and, (iv) environmental management measures for ensuring adequate outflows, limiting 
agro-chemical pollution, soil erosion and water losses.  
 
Cumulative impacts of hillside and lowland irrigation schemes on downstream wetlands 
and marshlands are of concern since marshlands in Rwanda have been extensively 
converted to agricultural uses. Based on official statistics, 94,000 ha of the total 168,000 
ha of marshlands have been converted (USAID 2008). Adverse cumulative impacts on 
downstream marshlands will be considered when screening and selecting proposed sites 
for development under the project. The potential types of cumulative impacts are largely 
manageable at the site level, making the sound adherence to the mitigation measures 
described below essential. To this end, the adoption of the ESMF as part of the 
Government's Common Framework of Engagement for all potential financiers of the 
LWH will be strongly instrumental in the mitigation of cumulative effects across the 
Government's larger program.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Infrastructure-only alternative: The original GoR design of the LWH program centered 
almost exclusively on the infrastructure (hardware) aspect of hillside intensification and 
only modest attention was given to farmer group formation and institutional capacity 
building. This alternative was modified as the preliminary technical mission in November 
2008 concluded that the transformational nature of the land husbandry and irrigation 
activities called for a holistic approach, involving extensive participatory processes 
addressing the potential social impacts of the project (see Component A as well).  
 
Micro-irrigation alternative: Although not part of the Government#s original design, the 
Project considered numerous micro-scale (pump) irrigation models as an alternative to 
the dam-reservoir-conduit model. This alternative was rejected during the technical 
mission and ensuing discussions with Government, as they would not help meet the 
objectives of the LWH. Namely, commercialized horticultural production requires year-
round production and hence storage of water. The current situation in much of Rwanda 
does not allow for year-round production as there is no water in the dry season. 
Furthermore, such a highly decentralized approach and large number of schemes would 
also limit the opportunities for environmental oversight. Finally, the micro schemes could 
not have the same flood-control benefits as the reservoir model.  
 
Page  7
Supply-only focus: The original LWH model proposed by Government did not consider 
marketing and post-harvest activities in its design. This alternative was modified in favor 
of the current design that addresses the critical constraints to marketing the envisioned 
output under LWH land husbandry and irrigation activities, since the gaps in the 
downstream value chain would render the LWH upstream investments unprofitable and 
unsustainable (with corresponding adverse environmental and social impacts).   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
OP 4.01, OP 4.04, OP 4.36 and OP 4.11  
 
The environmental safeguards policy and cultural resources issues will be managed 
through preparation and implementation of the following instruments: (i) overall 
Environmental Assessment which includes consideration of cumulative impacts and 
framework EMP; an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) which 
guides the screening of project investments for potential adverse environmental and 
social impacts and triggering of other safeguard policies, as well as guiding preparation 
of site specific environment assessments and management plans; specific site (catchment) 
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) will be cleared and disclosed once completed 
during implementation. The ESMF also provides guidance on the mitigation and handling 
of chance finds of physical cultural resources during earthworks for dam and irrigation 
infrastructure. In addition, as part of the Project support for the development of the 
Government#s Common Framework for Engagement (CFE) for LWH financiers, the 
ESMF will be incorporated into the CFE. That is, in addition to its use by the Project in 
the event of site selection changes during or after appraisal, it will guide other financiers 
in their social and environmental site management.  
 
OP 4.09  
 
A
pest management plan (PMP) has been prepared, cleared by ASPEN and disclosed in 
the Infoshop on 7 August 2009.  
 
OP 4.12  
 
The social safeguards issues, including involuntary resettlement, will be managed 
through preparation and implementation of the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), 
which has been prepared and disclosed on 7 August 2009. Site-specific Resettlement 
Action Plans will be cleared and disclosed once they are prepared during project 
implementation.  
 
OP 4.37  
 
With the confirmation of site selection and preparation of sites early in implementation, 
site-specific Dam Safety Plans will be prepared and disclosed. Like the ESMF, dam 
safety plan guidelines from the Bank will be used by the Government#s CFE for LWH 
financiers in the larger Government Program.  
 
OP 7.50  
 
A
Riparian Notification has been prepared, cleared and issued (10 August 2009).  
 
Borrower Capacity  
Page  8
Borrower capacity for both environmental and social safeguards implementation is 
moderately effective, with some weaknesses that the project will address. Rwanda has a 
dynamic and professionally staffed environmental regulatory agency (REMA) with 
politically astute leadership and instances of demonstrated effective enforcement of 
environmental regulations. REMA works closely with the District Environmental 
Officers who are responsible for site level environmental management of project 
activities, along with the MINAGRI environmental specialist.  
 
However, while the environmental regulatory framework is modern, it is also young and 
some elements of it are yet to be developed. REMA has been in existence only since 
2003, the Organic Law (No 4/2005) on environmental protection since 2005, and the 
general EIA guidelines since 2006. Sector specific environmental guidelines, e.g. for 
agriculture, are not yet in place. Demand for REMA services outstrips its staffing, and 
both REMA and district level environmental staff lack robust implementation experience 
and technical training specific to dam construction, irrigation development, watershed 
management, and other technical aspects of LWH project, although requisite expertise 
exists in the consulting sector and academia and can be tapped into for knowledge 
transfer. Logistical support for adequate implementation and monitoring of 
environmental safeguards measures also requires strengthening.  
 
In addition, REMA has been only recently (early 2009) reorganized in conjunction with 
the establishment of the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) which took over the EA 
function (and human and technical resources) from REMA. A detailed study of potential 
implications of this institutional arrangement, as well as other aspects of environmental 
institutions in Rwanda, was recently commissioned as part of the LWH project and is 
ongoing. However, preliminary indications do not suggest a significant impact on the EA 
function.  
 
The project will include training and other environmental management capacity 
development measures under Component A. In addition, MINAGRI is hiring an 
Environmental Officer to support implementation of environmental safeguards measures.  
 
Borrower capacity for social safeguards implementation is constrained, as limited 
technical capacity and understanding exist to implement the project consistently with the 
Bank resettlement policy. Close technical support is being/will be provided by the Bank 
social specialist during preparation and implementation to ensure compliance with not 
only domestic but also international good resettlement practice. In addition, MINAGRI is 
gaining first-hand experience with social safeguards implementation through an ongoing 
Bank operation (RSSP 2) and these activities were rated Satisfactory in a recent 
implementation support mission. MINAGRI will hire a rural sociologist, and other 
strengthening measures will be outlined in the project safeguards documents and 
integrated in the project budget, implementation and monitoring plan.  
 
To further facilitate implementation of the Project safeguards instruments, ESMF and 
RPF, four site-specific environment management plans (Karongi 12 and 13, Nyanza 23 
and Gatsibo 8) and three resettlement instruments (for Karongi 13, Nyanza 23 and 
Page  9
Gatsibo 8) for the IDA sites have been prepared and cleared for implementation so far 
(the documents are disclosed in-country and Bank#s InfoShop).  The resettlement 
instruments in particular, were rated as best practice by safeguards management.  
 
As for the Parent project, continued training for the LWH safeguards team in GoR is 
resourced, and social-related staff has been scaled up.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Consultations with communities at the LWH sites, local authorities and national 
stakeholders were launched in 2008, parallel with the Government's preliminary site 
identification and pre-feasibility studies, taken place during the development of the LWH 
concept and funding proposal. Consultations were carried out by a Consultant, whose 
social specialist and rural sociologist, worked alongside engineering and environmental 
staff. These consultations took the form of community meetings, individual interviews 
and focus groups. The feedback from the consultations was used to inform project design. 
Additional consultations took place as a part of preparing the LWH Environmental 
Assessment, ESMF and Strategic Social Assessment during the remainder of project 
preparation. The consultations revealed that while the community members are keen to 
see the project implementation to begin, their understanding of the project and resulting 
changes is limited, and continuous liaison with the affected communities will be 
necessary to disseminate information, collect feedback, and manage expectations. This 
observation led to an increase in resources and planned activities under Component A in 
terms of community mobilization and communication.  
 
All environmental safeguards documents have been cleared by the Rwanda 
Environmental Management Authority (REMA) and the Bank. They were disclosed at 
the World Bank's Infoshop on August 13, 2009; and in country on August 12, 2009. The 
proposed mitigation measures and their monitoring plans are an integral part of the 
project design and costs. Site-specific Environmental Assessments, Environmental 
Management Plans, Dam Safety Plans and Resettlement Action Plans will be disclosed 
once they are prepared during project implementation.
