II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The proposed repeater project would support only rehabilitation of water supply and 
sanitation network activities (for pumping station facilities and water reservoirs; 
renovation of the chlorination facilities and of rapid sand filters; replacement of 
distribution network; and rehabilitation, replacement or installation of production water 
meters) which are not expected to generate significant environmental and social impacts.  
 
Social Impacts: The completed pre-feasibility studies indicate that the project will 
largely be limited to rehabilitation of existing structures.  The planned new pumping 
station and reservoir of the Napornaya water treatment plant will be built on the premises 
of the authority, where there are no activities or residences.  However, as project design is 
further detailed, there is a possibility that some construction may exceed available land 
and may have to take place on sites not yet identified.  Further, some land within 
residence compounds may have to be temporarily occupied for works such as excavation 
of trenches.  In addition, DWPS2 may establish a sanitary protection area along the 
upstream reaches of the Varzob river and canal, to avoid contamination of the water 
source of the NAP and SAM water treatment plants.  In this case, the identified areas will 
need to be cleared of settlements (if any), and existing structures.  Further, certain 
polluting/quality threatening activities will be restricted (e.g. livestock access).   This 
activity will also include some mitigation measures such as installation of fences, septic 
tanks and drains.  
 
Aside from above, there are no major adverse social safeguard impacts expected 
through this project.  Other social issues such as identification of vulnerable groups, 
consultation with water users and their inclusion in the social analysis and customer 
satisfaction study which will feed into project design and also  become part of the M & E 
framework.  The project will also establish a usable complaint system which will serve to 
monitor project progress and impacts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Potential environemntal adverse impacts of the project would relate to: (i) inappropriate 
disposal of water treatment sludge; (ii) safety hazards from chlorination process; (iii) 
pollution by construction run-offs; (iv) disturbance during construction including dust, 
noise, vibration, access restriction, closure of roads, and increased traffic; (v) improper 
disposal of demolition debris; (vi) damage to existing utility services during pipe repairs 
and installation; (vii) safety hazards from construction activities; (viii) spillage of fuel 
and oil from construction; and (ix) damage to trees and vegetative cover. At the same 
time the project is expected to bring significant environmental and health benefits, such 
as improvements in public health through better quality and availability of treated water, 
and improvements in the sustainability of raw water sources through reductions in losses 
and wastage. Based on mentioned above the project is qualified as Category B for which 
a
partial EA and a simple EMP should be prepared and applied during the project 
implementation.  
 
The required mitigation measures for the project activities are standard and widely use 
in construction practices. They are well prescribed in the Environmental Management 
and Monitoring Plan, which was prepared for the initial project. As the new project will 
support same types of activities as under the initial project it is proposed the exiting 
EMMP to be applied also for the new project. The EMMP stipulates all contracts for 
construction works will include requirements for implementation of the specific measures 
as per EMMP provisions and good construction practices. Furthermore, daily control and 
monitoring of construction works will be part of responsibilities of the utility operator. 
The quality of drinking water supply will be monitored according to international and 
local standards using new laboratory equipment to be financed by the project.  
 
Social Impacts:  The completed pre-feasibility studies indicate that the project will 
largely be limited to rehabilitation of existing structures.  The planned new pumping 
station and reservoir of the Napornaya water treatment plant will be built on the premises 
of the authority, where there are no activities or residences.  However, as project design is 
further detailed, there is a possibility that some construction may exceed available land 
and may have to take place on sites not yet identified.  Further, some land within 
residence compounds may have to be temporarily occupied for works such as excavation 
of trenches.  In addition, DWPS2 may establish a sanitary protection area along the 
upstream reaches of the Varzob river and canal, to avoid contamination of the water 
source of the NAP and SAM water treatment plants.  In this case, the identified areas will 
need to be cleared of settlements (if any), and existing structures.  Further, certain 
polluting/quality threatening activities will be restricted (e.g. livestock access).   This 
activity will also include some mitigation measures such as installation of fences, septic 
tanks and drains.   None of these impacts are major or irreversible.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower, including the Municipality of Dushanbe, the Dushanbe Vodokanal and the 
Project Cordination Unit, have managed the ongoing Dushanbe Water Supply Project and 
are familiar with the World Bank's Safeguard Policies. Application of environmental 
policies has improved in the last 2 years, following specific supervision and advice 
provided by the Task Team. The WB team will continue closely monitor EMMP 
implementation, providing relevant assistance and capacity building. A Resettlement 
Policy Framework and/or Action Plan has not been necessary in the previous project as 
all activities were limited to publicly owned, well delimited land, where no settlement 
was identified.  
 
Since these detailed impacts will only be known once project implementation 
commences, and the possibility of land acquisition and restrictions in access cannot be 
ruled out at this stage, the borrower has agreed to develop a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF). The RPF will identify the possible impacts from project activities, 
describe the range of potential impacts (temporary and permanent) to land use/access and 
structures and specify the compensation rates and procedures for the same.  Where there 
is a gap between national and World Bank procedures, the latter will prevail for all 
activities financed under this project.  The RPF will serve as a screening device to 
ascertain if there will be any impacts resulting from project activities.  If any impacts are 
identified, the Borrower will develop relevant Resettlement Action Plans as described in 
the RPF which will detail the specific impact and compensation, and present it to the 
World Bank for approval.  No civil works will commence until such plans are approved 
by the World Bank.  The RPF will be implemented through the main Project 
Implementation Unit, with assistance from the Municipality.  Appropriate technical 
training will be provided.  
 
EMMP updated and disclosed in country and in Infoshop (January 14 and 25 2011.  
 
RPF prepared and disclosed in country and in Infoshop (January 25 2011)   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The main beneficiary groups are the customers i.e. the inhabitants of Tajikistan.  The 
project will involve and consult with these stakeholders through the detailed social 
analysis and customer satisfaction study which is in progress and will be an important 
input to the project design.  This study includes a range of quantitative and qualitative 
instruments such as questionnaires, focus group discussions and case histories which will 
serve as an important tool to get the beneficiary's perspective on needs and priority.  The 
study will disaggregated different user groups based on residence type, water source and 
socio-economic criteria, with a focus on identifying vulnerable groups.  This study will 
serve as the baseline for project M & E. It is planned that repeater/quick versions of the 
study will be done through project implementation to verify the effectiveness of project 
activities. An end of project evaluation will also be done keeping the same design in 
mind.
