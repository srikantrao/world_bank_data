2. Project Objectives 
The proposed project development objective is to enhance the credibility, transparency, 
and accountability in the management and use of public resources.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project aims to support the modernization of the Public Financial Management 
System in Senegal during the coming four years. It includes four components: (1) 
Strengthening Fiscal Policies and Planning; (2) Improving Budget Execution Processes; 
(3) Strengthening the capacity of external audit and legislative oversight; and (4) Project 
Management.   Because it is a continuation of the MDTF that has assisted the 
Government in reforming budgetary practices and the management of public finances, it 
would be able to build on the areas that have outstanding issues to be resolved. This 
targeted approach is expected to leverage the positive impact of the project, if 
government commitment is sustained as expected. Since many of the activities to be 
implemented under the project would cut across several entities, the process of change 
management, would be specifically supported under the project, particularly for the 
activities requiring strong buy-ins, e.g. assessment and selection process of large public 
investment projects, decentralization of commitment controls to line ministries, 
strengthening internal audit processes, legislative oversight, etc.

Component 1:  Strengthening Fiscal Policies and Planning (US$2 millions). This 
component aims at improving expenditures policy allocations, including reduction of 
potential deficit financing. It will support the on-going efforts by the Government of 
Senegal to align the legal framework with the new WAEMU directives.  It includes two 
sub-components: (i) Improvement the legal framework and extension of the Medium 
Term Expenditures Framework; and (ii) Development and implementation of a debt 
management strategy.  
 
Component 2:  Improving Budget Execution and reporting Processes (US$5 millions). 
This component will support the on-going efforts by the Government of Senegal to 
modernize the budget execution processes by rendering them more efficient and 
transparent.  
 
Component 3: Strengthening the capacity of external audit and legislative oversight 
(US$2.3 millions). This component aims at enhancing the external oversight in the 
management of public finances. It will be implemented under two inter-related sub-
components: Strengthening External Audit Processes, and Strengthening the Legislative 
Oversight.  
 
Component 4:  Project Management (US$0.70 million). This component will provide 
support for the coordination, administration, financial management, procurement, 
monitoring and evaluation and dissemination of the Project. It will also support change 
management activities, where necessary.
