2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is reformulated to improve access and quality of 
priority health, nutrition and HIV/AIDS services.  The change is deemed necessary to 
clarify the intent of the original project development objective.  The proposed additional 
financing will support the subcomponent IV under Component A, i.e., the 
implementation by the MOH of the National Nutrition Strategic Plan; and Component B, 
the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy by the SP/CNLS-IST.   
 
3. Project Description 
Project Support to the National Nutrition Strategic Plan ($15 million): The nutrition 
subcomponent, introduced to the project through Additional Financing when the project 
was half way into its implementation, is progressing well following rigorous preparation 
of the contracting out approach of community health and nutrition services.  With the 
proposed Additional Financing there will be scope to scale up the coverage, consolidate 
Page  2
the strategy and improve quality of services.  This component will support the following 
subcomponents: (i) the scaling up of essential direct health and nutrition actions at family 
and community level to all 13 regions; and (ii) policy and program coordination and 
monitoring and evaluation of direct nutrition action. Direct nutrition action at community 
level includes community-based child growth promotion with emphasis on behavior 
change communication, including care of pregnant women, and case management of 
severe acute malnutrition. Community-based management of severe acute malnutrition 
for non-complicated cases is used to complement in-patient care for cases with 
complications. Community-based activities will be implemented in all 13 regions with 
emphasis on the worst affected districts.  They will be implemented over three years 
(2012-2014), reaching 65% of the total population of rural children under five years old. 
This will be achieved by strengthening the capacity at district level, contracting out 
implementation to NGOs and CBOs, and strengthening their link with the decentralized 
system.  
 
Project Support to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy ($18 million): This component will 
complement the activities currently funded and proposed by the government for funding 
by the Global Fund # if approved (approximately US$24 million for 2011-2016) # and 
provide continuity to the activities funded under the initial project, particularly the 
strategic priorities and objectives focused on prevention and promotion activities. It aims 
to reduce new infections and control the risk of epidemic rebound among high-risk 
groups and its effects on vulnerable populations. It will support the following 
subcomponents: (i) the strengthening of community-based approaches for the prevention 
of risky behaviors by target populations and increasing the use of voluntary counseling 
and testing (VCT) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services (ii) 
enhancing the quality of early diagnosis and case management of HIV, sexually 
transmitted infections (STI) and opportunistic infections; (iii) laboratory improvements 
(to be funded by the Spanish Cooperation Africa Plan); (iv) improving the care of and 
support to PLWHA and in particular to orphans and vulnerable children (OVC);  and (v) 
improving the capacity to coordinate and monitor the HIV/AIDS strategic plan. The case 
management of HIV patients with ARV treatment are covered by Global Fund.  
Moreover, the team is working with the government to introduce a line item in the 
national budget for ARV treatment.  Project activities will include behavioural change 
communication (BCC) promoting healthier sexual behaviours through condom use and 
reduction of partners, decentralized VCT for HIV, training of health personnel for better 
PMTCT management and BCC interventions to increase use of prenatal services, early 
testing and treatment of STIs, improvement of blood safety, universal precaution 
measures and management of accidental exposure to HIV, and prevention of sexual 
violence against women. Implementation will continue to draw on the experience of 
working with NGO, line ministries and local authorities to develop IEC/BCC and care 
interventions targeted to miners, sex workers, uniformed personnel, in school and out of 
school youth, OVC´s, health workers, local story-teller (#griotes#), religious and 
traditional authorities and other groups.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Project will be implemented nationwide with an emphasis at community level 
activities.  Under Component B, the Spanish Program for Africa Grant (US$3,024,957) 
will finance the renovation of, and equipment and furniture for the: (i) HIV/AIDS and 
STIs national reference laboratory; (ii) laboratories of two regional hospitals, three 
district hospitals, and four NGO-run laboratories involved that support PLWHA (those 
that previously operated under the ARV treatment acceleration program (TAP) funded by 
World Bank from 2002 to 2007; and (iii) facilities of three Regional Antennas of the 
SP/CNLS-IST, which were damaged during the floods of September, 2009.  The project 
will not support any construction works.  The renovation works are limited to painting 
and fixing windows, doors, floors and frames/panels.
