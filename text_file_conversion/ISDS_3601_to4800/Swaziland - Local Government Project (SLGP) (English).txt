2. Project Objectives
The project development objective (PDO) is to develop institutionally strengthened
Tinkhundla and urban local governments.

3. Project Description
Component 1 - Tinkhundla Infrastructure and Capacity Building Support

 This component comprises two inter-dependent sub-components supporting eight
Tinkhundla located in peri-urban areas or rural growth nodes. The sub-components are:
(a) Tinkhundla Basic Infrastructure Financing, which consists of the provision of annual,
performance-based capital funding for small-scale public infrastructure, underpinned by
(b) Tinkhundla Capacity Building Support, which consists of on-the-job, just-in-time
capacity building support provided by a mobile mentoring team and designed to
strengthen Tinkhundla capacity and facilitate the achievement of performance
requirements.
 Component 2 - Urban Infrastructure Grants and capacity Building Support

  Component 2 comprises two inter-dependent sub-components: (a) Performance-Based
Infrastructure Grants; and (b) Urban Local Government Capacity Building Support. The
component is intended to strengthen the ability of urban local governments to provide
and sustain the delivery of local services. Access to the grants will be subject to each
local authority’s meeting minimum mandatory conditions and annual performance targets
in various areas of municipal management. The use of the grants will be limited to
investments in local roads and associated infrastructure, and all grant amounts would be
matched from other local government revenues for a minimum additional 20 percent of
the grant amount. Capacity building under the component will be provided by a mobile
team comprising expertise in key areas of municipal management, finance, planning and
community consultation, and procurement and asset development and management.
Technical assistance in the areas of environmental and social safeguards will be provided,
respectively, by the specialist in procurement and asset development and management,
and the specialist in planning and community consultation.

 Component 3 - Project Management and Technical Assistance

 Component 3 supports the implementation, monitoring, evaluation, and audit of the
Project, including annual Performance Assessments of the participating local
governments, provides formal training and short-term technical assistance to local
governments and the Government, and provides technical assistance to the Ministry of
Housing and Urban Development and the Ministry of Tinkhundla Administration and
Development to strengthen their capacity to support and monitor local government
performance. The component includes the costs of the Project Support Team, which will
oversee and manage the project on a day-to-day basis, and which will be paid for by the
Government of Swaziland.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will be implemented in urban areas, with a focus on local (municipal) road
rehabilitation, and in existing settlements in rural areas, where small-scale infrastructure
investments are likely to include culverts, small-scale water systems, but and taxi ranks,
and public market infrastructure.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Potential adverse environmental and social impacts may occur under Components 1 and
2. Component 1 will finance small infrastructure investments, including roads
improvements, minor bridges or culverts, bus ranks or local market shelters, and small-
scale water and/or sanitation facilities. Component 2 will provide grants to urban local
governments to repair and rehabilitate local (municipal) roads. Potential adverse
environmental and social impacts might include loss of vegetation, soil and water
pollution, soil erosion, and spread of malaria (from standing water) and adverse health
impacts on humans and animals due to poor waste management. None of these impacts
will be irreversible. Involuntary settlement may occur with respect to some sub-project
activities; these could include temporary use of land during construction, or small uses of
privately held or used land for the siting of community-selected infrastructure sub-
projects.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The only indirect and/or long term impact due to sub-project activities envisaged is
erosion/land degradation resulting from the construction of culverts in mountain areas.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
In the course of sub-project selection and detailed design, road section alignments will be
reviewed and marketplace locations will be selected to minimize adverse environmental
and social impacts. Similarly, culverts will be designed to reduce erosion on farmland or
other productive assets. Environmental and social protection clauses will be incorporated
into the works contracts, including related to HIV/AIDS prevention.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The borrower prepared (i) an Environmental and Social Management Framework
(ESMF) dated February 25, 2008; and (ii) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) dated
December 2007. However, the ESMF and RPF do not yet reflect changes in the project
design prepared in 2009 and 2010. The ESMF and RPF are being revised to reflect the
new project design. Note that existing institutional capacity to address safeguards issues
is relatively weak, mirroring general weakness in local governance. The project supports
capacity building in environmental and social safeguards through technical assistance to
local governments and oversight through a dedicated position in the Project Support
Team.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders consulted during the preparation of the ESMF included responsible
ministries, the Swaziland Environment Authority, local Chiefs, the National Emergency
Response for HIV/AIDS, and several town boards. Sub-project identification will take
place in the context of significant community consultation, and in the case of Component
1 sub-project investments, local community members will also be involved in detailed
sub-project design and implementation. Sub-project selection and consultation includes
the discussion of potential environmental and social impacts and the incorporation of
mitigation measures.
