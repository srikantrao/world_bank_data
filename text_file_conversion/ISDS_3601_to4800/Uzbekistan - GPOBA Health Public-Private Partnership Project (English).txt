B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the proposed GPOBA Project is to The development objective of 
the proposed GPOBA Project is to improve access to a number of medical diagnostic procedures 
(MRI, CT, Doppler and Endoscopy) for selected groups of socially disadvantaged patients.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project design envisages the following two components: 
 
Component 1: Vouchers to socially disadvantaged patients. The first and main component will 
finance the provision of vouchers to socially disadvantaged patients to utilize, free of charge, 
medical diagnostic procedures (MRI, CT, Doppler and Endoscopy) provided by the new PPP 
MDCs. It is expected that the vouchers financed by the GPOBA grant will represent around 15% 
of the annual revenues of an MDC during the implementation period of the project. 
 
Component 2: Capacity building: training, information campaign, independent technical and 
financial audits, and project management. To sustain the provision of vouchers to the target

population, the component would build the capacity to implement and operate the vouchers 
delivery system. The component would also finance the conduct of technical audits to ensure that 
the targeted beneficiary population is receiving the vouchers.  Furthermore, the component will 
finance fiduciary support and associated operating costs. 
 
The Project would be implemented over a five year period.
