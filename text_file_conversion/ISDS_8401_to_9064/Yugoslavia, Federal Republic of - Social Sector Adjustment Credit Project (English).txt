The overall objective of the SOSAC would be to support reforms in social protection and health wbich
contnbute to programs which are more fiscally sustainable while continuing to provide core bcnefits and
services to the population, in particular thc poorest. TIhc operation would also support reforms which
should introduce much-needed transparency and accountability in the management of public flnds in a
numbcr of social programs. Finally, it would support the efforts of the Serbian Governrnnt to develop
robust systems for monitoring and evaluating living standards and the impacts of public policy.
1A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed policy agenda under SOSAC is sumrnmarized in the attached draft policy matrix
(Annex 1), which has been shared with the Scrbian authorities. It is stressed that the agenda
varies sigaificantly in degree of specificity to date, with sorn£ areas such as pensions and child
protection reasonably wcll elaborated, and others such as budgetary managemcnt, health sector
rcforms, and monitoring and evaluation requiring more concrete defmition. Tn the meantime, the
project team continues to contribute to working groups in the areas of pensions, employment
programs, and social statistics. The key proposed areas for support are as follows:
(a)    Reforming financial managerment in the extra-budgetary funds
(b)    Pensions
(c)     Social and Child Protection and Family ILaw
(d)    NQGO legal framework
