I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The proposed project is a repeater of a successful on-going operation, the Mining Sector Capacity
Building Project (Credit 3206-MAU). The main development objectives of this project - to strengthen the
Government's capacity to act as a facilitator and regulator of mining activities and to significantly
increase private investment in Mauritania's mining sector - are maintained. In addition, the proposed
operation will build upon the project design and objectives to the developments in the mining sector
during the last two years, by bringing in two new components: (i) strengthening of the mining sector
public management capacity, and (ii) an increased focus on activities related to local economic
clevelopment, efficiency in the delivery of services and improvement of socioeconomic impacts in mining
areas.
The development objectives of the proposed project would be to:
(i) Build-up and consolidate the Government's long term institutional and technical capacity to manage
the country's mineral resources, including social and environmental managemcnt
(ii) Promote private investments in the minerals sector;
(iii) Improve mining sector contribution to national and regional socioeconomic development
I.A.3. Project Description:
The proposed project would include four components:
Component I - Local economic development in the mining areas.This component would support the
empowerment of local communities and municipalities for the development of alternative economic
activities and increased efficiency in the delivery of social services. The project will work on local

ISDS
economic development around the SNIM exploitation site and along the Zoueratc-Nouadhibou corridor
in NW Mauritania. The project will support activities aiming to (i) diversify the local economic base by
seeking alternative economic activities, (ii) fund a small grants program to provide necessary funds to
small businesses and entrepreneurs seeking to increase or diversify their productive capabilities; (iii)
strengthen the capacity of local authorities for the delivery of social services; (iv) develop
hydrogeological studies to improve the availability of water in the region; and (v) strengthen the regional
development management capacities, especially in the envrionmental and social areas.
Component 2 - Geo-information and developmentThis component would provide the geoscientific
information necessary to enhance the economic development of Mauritania. Geo-data are fundamental
for good governance and proper land use management, and would support many sectors, such as water
resources and environmental management, promotion of investments in the mining sector and others. The
project would continue the work started under the first project in upgrading the existing information and
increasing its availability. The component would include the following: (i) airborne geophysical surveys
of about 480,000 square kilometers over three selected areas with mineral potential; (ii) geological
mapping of about 185,000 square kilometers, of which about 35,000 square kilometers with the support
of parallel financing; (iii) metallogenic studies of selected ore districts and/or minerals (platinum,
palladium) based on outputs from the first Mining project; (iv) update of the country's hydrogeological
map, in collaboration with the National Center for Water Resources (CNRE), through (a) merging and
processing data from the SIGM and the CNRE databases (b) carrying out hydrological pilot studies over
selected areas with identified mining potential and poor water availability to improve water resources;
and (v) supervision assistance regarding complex technical activities, in particular geophysics.
Component 3 - Capacity building of public mining institutions. This component would strengthen the
mining sector management capacity by establishing a Mining Sector Promotion Unit (UPM) and
reinforcing DMG and the Mining Cadastre created under the first project. The sector monitoring and
control capacity of Mining and Geology Directorate (DMM) would be reinforced. The project would
thus consolidate the sustainability of public mining institutions established under the first Mining project
and strengthen inter-institutional relationships, especially with the Ministry of Rural Development and
Environment and the DMG's SAE. Improved environmental management would take place as a result of
sector activities under this component. This component would also carry out a comprehensive training
program. The training program would build capacity of the employees involved in sector activities
directly - such as employees of SNIM and staff of the Ministry of Mines and Industry, or indirectly - such
as local authority representatives to further sector capabilities through training and seminars.
Component 4 - Project management Project management will build upon the existing UCPM, Mining
Project Coordination Unit. Current operations will be reinforced by an accountant assistant and a project
evaluation specialist. UCPM will link with all concerned parties/entities and will carry out financial
management, procurement and disbursement activities. A regional unit would be established in Zoucrate
to coordinate local economic development activities envisioned for the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor,
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Nationwide, with a particular focus on the Zouerate-Nouadhibou corridor of NW Mauritania, regarding
CCD and LED activities.
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The project is a capacity building technical assistance which will not involve direct investments
in mining operations and, consequently, it will not generate direct environmental and social impacts.

However, if succesfull, the project will induce a development of mining activities in Mauritania. In that
sense the potential environmental and social impacts of such a development have been assessed and an
Environmental Management Plan designed to ensure that regulatory, institutional and monitoring measures
and mechanisms are in place to properly protect the environment and communities.
