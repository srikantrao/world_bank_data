I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
Between 1992 and 2000 Peru experienced a judicial reform process driven by political forces that was
strongly opposed by justice sector operators and international observers; that process encouraged a
bureaucratic and formalistic outlook, and exaggerated centralization and standardization of processes.1
Today Peru's justice sector institutions retain a negative reputation for providing services beyond the reach
of a majority of citizens while corruption issues continue to undermine the legitimacy of the overall system;
the institutions urgently need to develop a dynamic service orientation aimed at benefiting a variety of
potential users, and recapturing citizen respect.

The Government of Peru has requested the Bank's assistance to establish the basis of a new approach to
the provision of justice services that will improve sector performance in terms of quality and timeliness of
services delivered to the public as well as enhancing the access of the most disadvantaged societal groups.
The main thrust of that support will be to provide the technical assistance required to set in motion a
sustainable institutional reform process in four key agencies: the Judiciary, Consejo Nacional de la
Magistratura (CNM), Academia de la Magistratura (AM) and Ministerio de Justicia (MINJUS).

This project will constitute the first building block of a long-term institutional reform process to consolidate
more cost-effective, results-oriented justice sector agencies. It is expected that at the end of the project, the
Judiciary will have implemented a policy of progressive deconcentration of administrative decisions
consistent with the overall decentralization program supported by other Bank Loan. The incentive structure
will be changed: judicial employees will be selected, evaluated and promoted on the basis of merit.
Monitoring and evaluation of service delivery will be based on established performance indicators. While
the entire reform agenda in Peru will not be completed, major institutional reform gains will be achieved in
order to transform the justice sector into a modern, more responsive public service. Direct impact to
improve access to justice for disadvantaged groups will also be achieved.

any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The indigenous peoples aspects of the access to justice component of this project will be designed in
coordination with the team responsible for the supervision of the ongoing Indigenous and Afro-Peruvian
Peoples Development Project and will be fully consistent with the IPDP prepared for that project; this
project will only work on enhanced access in urban and peri- urban areas trough the provision of technical
assistance to the responsible Government agencies and NGOs. In rural areas, the project will work with
Justices of Peace.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
In order to promote ownership of the reform process, it was realized early in the identification of this
project that participation from all interested parties was essential. Extensive consultations with internal
stakeholders (judges, court administrators, and lawyers) on particular aspects of a justice sector
modernization strategy have taken place during project preparation. External stakeholders were also
involved: workshops carried out during the Second Poverty Forum, with over 540 representatives from
CSOs, focus groups included meetings with justices of the peace in small communities to include their
specific views on training needs as part of the Access to Justice component of the project. The highest
authorities of the Government and the Judiciary as well as lower level staff of sector institutions, bar
associations, representatives of the private sector and CSOs participated in a number of project preparation
events as well.

Key activities of project implementation will also include national and regional workshops; these events
will bring together sector authorities, legal professionals and CSOs for the purposes of discussing the
issues faced by the justice sector and arriving at a consensus over the priorities and elements of a realistic
medium-term strategy. Participation will reinforce the partnership among sector agencies for reform
purposes and generate a common thrust on the main elements of such strategy. Follow-up events in the four
selected judicial districts will be organized as a part of Project implementation to encourage discussions
among local authorities and interest groups about the constraints for effective justice service delivery and
their involvement initiatives to address them.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
