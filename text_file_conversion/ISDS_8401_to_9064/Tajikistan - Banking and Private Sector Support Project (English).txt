Project: Banking and Private Sector Support      Task Team Leader: Gerhard Botha
Authorized to Appraise Date: December 18, 2002   IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: September 4, 2003                 IDA Amount ($m): 10.00

Lending Instrument: Financial Intermediary Loan (FIL)  finance sector (50%)
Status: Lending                                  Theme: Small and medium enterprise support (P);
Other financial and private sector development (P)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the proposed project is to improve access to finance for
small and medium scale enterprises and, simultaneously, to improve
participating banks' capacity for lending to small and medium scale
enterprises.
I.A.3. Project Description
Component One: SME credit line. The project consists of a credit line for short to medium term
financing to eligible private small and medium scale enterprises for eligible subprojects for participating
banks. Lending to the final beneficiaries is at market rates. Any bank can apply for access to the credit
line funding any time and, based upon review of compliance with strict criteria by the IDA, will be able
to participate as a fully or limited participating bank in the program under agreed conditions. The
component will be implemented by an independent Project Implementation Unit, which will include a
Credit Line Section.
Component Two: Capacity building support to banks witlhfull and limited participation. In the process
of providing the credit line, the Credit Line Section of the Project Implementation Unit, including the
necessary international expertise, will assist the participating banks and enterprises to appraise and
manage the associated credit risk and, thus, will improve their capacity for lending to small and medium
scale enterprises. The assistance will be provided in the form of formal training and informal training
sessions, including one-to-one skills transfer sessions and site visits to participating banks and enterprises
during post-reviews.
I A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites

or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Most of the participating banks that are likely to participate in the onlending program during the life of the
project are located in Dushanbe. Their clients, the small and medium scale enterprise subborrowers, may be
located anywhere in the country, although they are expected to be located mainly in the cities.
B. Chteck Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
Comments. The subprojects to be funded under the credit line cannot be identified at this stage. The
classification.of the environmental impacts of the subprojects can be determined during project
implementation by the onlending bank and the credit line section of the PIU, making this project category
"1l1".

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
It is not possible to determine prior to project implementation the various
activities for which loan funds will be requested. The financing is provided
through participating banks for subprojects of small and medium scale
enterprises that are related to their working capital or investment needs.
Both banks, subborrowers and subprojects need to meet certain eligibility
criteria. In general, the private small and medium scale enterprises are engaged in
food and light industry, construction, retail trade, and catering. The amount of
subloans ranges from $5,000 to $150,000 (to be confirmed during
negotiations between the Government and the Bank).
Il.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not applicable.
Il.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

ISDS
Not applicable.
It D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The Operational Guidelines would include all necessary provisions for environment safeguards.
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Various safeguards are being built into the design of the project to ensure that funds will be
onlent according to the project's legal agreements and Operating Guidelines. E.g., subloan
approval process involves the participating bank, the Credit Line Section of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU), the head of this unit, the Bank and, in some cases, the Supervisory
Board of the the PIU. The Environmental Review Guidelines for Identification and Analysis of
Environmental Impacts of Subprojects Proposed to be Funded under the Project (the
Environmental Review Guidelines, part of the Operating Guidelines) describes the mechanisms
and responsibilities for environmental screening and review of proposals. As per the Bank's
requirements, it is proposed that (i) the participating banks/PIU screen the required information
submitted by subborrowers on proposed subprojects in early subproject preparation stage and
inform the subborrowers of the environmental assessment requirements, if any, and subsequent
follow-up requirements for sub-loan processing (based on the environmental requirements of
appropriate national and local authorities and the applicable environmental policies of the IDA);
(ii) the PIU carries out post-reviews in the participating banks and enterprises, including, if
applicable, monitoring implementation of mitigation measures based on environmental
assessments (including an environmental management plan) and monitoring environmental
conditions during project implementation; (iii) the IDA provides no-objection to subloan
applications, including environmental clearance, on a prior or post review basis; and (iv) the PIU
is required to discuss the subborrowers' compliance with agreed environmental actions, if
applicable, in regular progress reports to the IDA.
The PIU will have environmental staff that is able to familiarize the participating banks and their
enterprise subborrowers with the project's environmental review process and requirements, by
way of workshops or individual sessions.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The individual enterprise subborrowers cannot be identified at this stage, nor can the subprojects. During
project preparation, however, the Borrower's project preparation team and the Bank's missions have had
preliminary discussions with the potential participating banks on the conditions for participation and
onlending. Moreover, the Borrower's project preparation team will visit the banks, NGOs, the
Government and National Bank of Tajikistan to discuss the project safeguard requirements as described
in the Environmental Review Guidelines between the end of January and mid-February and in any case
prior to appraisal.
The subprojects will be identified during the implementation stage. At that time, the PIU, the
participating banks and subborrowers are required to follow the Environmental Review Guidelines,
including the consultation and disclosure requirements for Category B subprojects.
The Environmental Review Guidelines were sent to Infoshop on January 21, 2003. A copy of the
guidelines was put in a library in Dushanbe for the public on January 29, 2003. A copy was also

sent by email to international institutions in Dushanbe (including those who are working on
similar areas as the proposed project) and a number of local NGOs on January 24, 2003.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ]SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[X] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
