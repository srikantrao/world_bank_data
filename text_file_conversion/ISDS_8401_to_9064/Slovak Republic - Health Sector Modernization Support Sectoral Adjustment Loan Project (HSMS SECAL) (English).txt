I A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The overall goal of HSMS SECAL is to support comprehensive health sector reforms that
promote fiscal sustainability while continuing to provide quality health care services and financial
protection for the population. The overarching objectives are to: (i) improve fiscal discipline
through structural changes in the health sector that will alleviate the chronic problem of arrears in
the health sector, encourage greater technical and allocative efficiency and institute a system that
will promote fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of the health
sector; and (iii) mitigate any possible negative impacts on health care access, specially for
vulnerable populations.



I.A.3 Project Description (From PDS)
The HSMS SECAL is proposed as a sector adjustment loan (SECAL) to the health sector to
support sector-wide reforms aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public
expenditures on health care. It is proposed that the SECAL will be presented to the Bank's Board
in FY2003 for an estimated US$80.0 million, to be released in three tranches of US$44.0 million,
US$20.0 million, and US$16.0 million, respectively.
The health reforms proposed in the HSMS SECAL are similar to those that have been
implemented in many OECD countries and the transition economies. It focuses on supporting
decentralization of the health system and granting greater autonomy to purchasers and providers,
introducing incentives that encourage greater technical and allocative efficiency, and
concentrating the role of the state in financing a package of benefits for the entire population,
regulation and policy-making and planning. The main areas proposed as the focus of the HSMS
SECAL reform agenda are:
*   Creating hard budget constraints for health care providers to support incentives for
technical efficiency at the level of health facilities;
*   Giving health care facilities (particularly hospitals) organizational and management
autonomy to implement needed changes to improve efficiency;
*   Creating incentives for purchasers (health insurance funds) to become more efficient by
granting HIFs greater organizational and management autonomy (e.g. to set prices,
implement selective contracting with health providers and implement changes in the
provider payment systems);
*   Establishing an appropriate regulatory framework to ensure that social functions of the
Slovak health system  are maintained (financing for social care, regulation of health
insurance funds, quality of care accreditation and licensing, providing information to
consumers); and
*   Rationalizing the benefits under compulsory health insurance to create a better match
with available public resources for health care, and putting in place mechanisms to curb
unsustainable growth in the future.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Comments The proposed project focuses on health care financing reforms, and the hospital
reforms focus on rationalization of existing capacity, especially by re-orienting services from
inpatient to outpatient services. The project does not have a civil works component and does not
deal with medical wastes.
