Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Initial)

Section I - Basic Information
A. Basic Project Data
Country: AFGHANISTAN                                    Project ID: P078324
Project: Afghanistan Health Sector Emergency Reha       Task Team Leader: Benjamin Loevinsohn
Authorized to Appraise Date: January 20, 2003           IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: July 8, 2003                             IDA Amount ($m): 65.00
Managing Unit: SASHD                                    Sector: Health (100%)
Lending Instrument: Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL)       Theme: Health system performance (P); Fighting
Status: Lending                                         communicable diseases (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The TISA and its partners have agreed that the key objectives in the HNP sector are to reduce the rates of infant and
child mortality, maternal mortality, child malnutrition, and fertility. These impact indicators should be tracked over
the long-term, however they would generally not be useful in judging progress in the health sector over the next three
years because: (i) they are unlikely to change much during that period; (ii) most of them are difficult to measure and
for technical reasons could not easily yield data for the relevant time period, and (iii) could be affected by events
outside the control of the health care system. Instead of focusmg on these outcome measures, it makes sense for the
MOPH to concentrate on achieving measurable improvements in indicators directly related to the delivery of its
basic package of health services (BPHS), such as prenatal care, immunization coverage, access to birth spacing etc
I.A.3. Project Description:
To help accomplish the above objectives, the proposed project will: (i) help expand the delivery of the essential
services package aimed primarily at women and children through partnerships with NGOs and through strengthening
MOPH efforts to improve service delivery; (ii) rehabilitate and expand the rural health infrastructure to improve
access to services; (ifi) rigorously pilot test on a reasonably large scale the implementation of new approaches to
disease control in such areas as water treatment and storage and mental health; and (iv) help build the capacity of the
MOPH, particularly at provincial and regional levels, including the training of female health workers and carry out
monitoring and evaluation (More details are available in the MOP and Technical Annex)
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
About 10 provinces in all regions of the country benefiting all the major ethnic groups

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Pleasefill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
Il.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Modest amounts of sharps and other medical waste from operation of health centers.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
None
Il.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of altematives (if required)
Medical waste will be primarily managed through the segregation of simple waste from potentially pathological
materials. Use of safety boxes for syringes needles, and other sharps will be expanded. Potentially pathological waste
will be dealt with by deep burial in appropriate designed silos/pits.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An environmental management plan has been drafted which sets out activities aimed at dealing with medical waste
management The plan will be further discussed with stakeholders and published during the upcoming
pre-appraisal/appraisal mission.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Health workers and members of rural communities. Consultation will take place through focus group discussions
with both sets of stakeholders.
E. Safeguardts Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the

provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
