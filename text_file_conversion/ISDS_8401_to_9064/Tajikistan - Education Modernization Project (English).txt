I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The Project has as its objective the stabilization and upgrading of the basic education system through two
components: a) building capacity for change; and b) supporting local initiatives. Activities under a)
include: i) continued support for strategic changes in curriculum and textbook production; ii) supporting
improved management and finance ; Activities under b) include: i) supporting local initiatives through
school and raion grants for infrastructure and quality improvement; ii) support for textbook rental scheme
and book printing; and iii) provision of equipment to schools.
The project aims to maximize the influence of the Bank in both addressing policy development and
utilizing IDA credit funds for solid investments. It is the second stage in Bank involvement in basic
education in Tajikistan and builds on the experiences of the Education Reform Project LIL in expanding
work on textbook pisblishing and printing, and community based strategies to target the poor. The
project will work at the national levels (curriculum and textbook policy, management training) and at
district level ( school grants schemes, equipment and construction).
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project works at the national and local levels:
1. Building Capacity for Change: This component works at national and municipal level to: a) establish
a curriculum development unit and initiate changes in basic curriculum; b) improve the operation of the
textbook rental scheme, publishing and printing methods, and printing textbooks; c) build capacity for
improved financing and management at national and rayon level.
2. Supporting Local Initiatives: This component will work in selected districts to:

ISDS
a) Implement a demand driven school grants scheme. Under this scheme school communities
(through PTAs) will be asked to submit proposals to address prioritized needs. There will be two
categories of grant:
* Minor rehabilitation: These could include minor rehabilitation such as the replacement
of windows and doors, patching roofs and repairing flooring. Schools under this scheme
will receive a bulk purchase of basic equipment such as desks and chairs, cupboards and
blackboards
* Thematic grants: Schools will prioritize needs to encourage enrollment attendence by
girls and vulnerable students. Strategies will be identified by the school communities.
*   Funds for rehabilitation will also be used to support schools in the Japanese
Development Grant for Social Protection, when that grant activity is activated in
Darband and Rogun districts.
Components:
1. Building capacity for change
*   la. Development of management and financial reform capacity in the MoE at central
and municipal level.
*   lb. Curriculum Development
*   Ic. Printing textbooks and support to the publishing industry
2. Upgrading the system
*   2a. Equipping grant-aided schools
*   2b. School grant fund
*   2c. Raion Improvement Grants
3. Project Management Support
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be located in Faizobad, Khofarnighon, Darband, Rogun, Dushanbe Railway District,
Kulyab and Vose districts. These districts have different characteristics both geographically and
economically. The populations in the south are largely agricultural workers on collective farms, in the
north, the type of farming is different, and the areas are mountainous. The areas of Kulyab and Vose are
very close to the border with Afghanistan. They are subject to erosion, earthquakes and civil disturbances.
Cultural and social issues following the civil war are still in evidence and the areas are not fully politically
stable.
B. Chleck Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
Comments. The project is rated as a Category Fl. The project will involve minor works, financed through a
small grants scheme in schools selected by the communities. The minor works will involve small
rehabilitations such as the replacement of windows and doors, patching roofs and floors, and improving
water, heating and sanitation facilities. The schools will be selected and the exact scope of works identified
during project implementation. Therefore, the environmental classification of a Financial Intermediary is
justified. The environment section of the Operational Manuel (OM) will be disclosed in country and in
infoshop prior to project appraisal mission.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Not applicable.
II.D.1 b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not applicable.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Not applicable.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of altematives (if required)
Not applicable.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Only Component two of the project, "Supporting Local Initiatives", has the potential for negative
environmental impacts and these would be small as the school grants scheme only finances minor
rehabilitation of schools. There is no new construction in the project.
Before approving a subproject, the Fl will verify (through its own staff, outside experts, or existing
environmental institutions) that the subproject meets the environmental requirements of appropriate
national and local authorities and is consistent with OP 4.01 and other applicable environmental policies
of the Bank. The borrower will prepare an environmental chapter for inclusion in the project's
operations manual which will provide the framework for this environmental function of the Fl. The
guidelines will direct the environment screening, review and assessment process to be followed by the F]
and applied to sub-projects under the school grants scheme. The guidelines will include directions on
the use of environmental management plans, as needed; as well as a description of a monitoring program
to ensure that environmental management plans are implemented. The environment chapter will include
an assessment of the adequacy of Tajikistan's environmental requirements relevant to the project;
description of training needs and how the project will address such needs.
The environment chapter of the operations manual will be submitted to the Bank by the end of

ISDS
December 2002. The MoE and the PIUE staff will be responsible for stipulating and disseminating the
environmental Guidelines to all project related entities. The MoE and PIUE staff will also be responsible
for training project and Fl staff, as needed, to carry out the environmental procedures. They also be
responsible for monitoring and supervision of the work on environmental management. It is envisaged
that asbestos will be prohibited in all the construction materials used under the Bank financed activities.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders from the central MoE are included in the project development committee.
These represent sub-sectors of education that will be affected by the project. The MoE has also
been asked to add representatives of local education offices to this body to ensure their
understanding of project development. Municipal and regional government officials will be
involved in the management training for education system staff. Key players are also being sent
for training in Policy Development as part of project preparation and this will be continued under
the project itself. At the community level, schools and their communities will be involved in a
grants scheme to empower them to make decisions about school priorities. With regard to
curriculum, a participatory process will be set up to allow a broad spectrum of discussion about
needed changes, so these are not seen as threatening and are accepted by teachers and students
alike.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
[X] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
