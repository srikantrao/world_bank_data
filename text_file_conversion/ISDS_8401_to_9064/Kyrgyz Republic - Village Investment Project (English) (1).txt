A. Basic Project Data
Country: KYRGYZ REPUBLIC                        Project ID: P073973
Project: VILLAGE INVESTMENT PROJECT             Task Team Leader: Gotz A. Schreiber
Authorized to Appraise Date: April 14, 2003     fBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: October 9, 2003                  IDA Amount ($m): 10.00
Managing Unit: ECSSD                            Sector: Sub-national govemment administration
Lending Instrument: Specific Investment Loan (SIL)  (50%); Agro-industry (50%)
Status: Lending                                 Theme: Civic engagement; participation and
community driv (P); Rural services and infrastructure
(P); Rural non-farm income generation (P); Gender
(S); Rural markets (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project has two primary objectives: (a) help alleviate rural poverty through the promotion of rural
non-farm employment and income generating investments that will be demand-driven and implemented
by rural people themselves,and (b) support the country's policy of administrative decentralization and
devolution of responsibilities to local governments (aiyl okmotus) and to help develop their capacity to
manage financial resources and to plan, implement and manage local investments.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project will support the development of capacity at the level of village government (aiyl okmotu) to
plan, prioritize and implement local investments and to manage financial resources in an efficient and
transparent manner. Funds will be provided to eligible aiyl okmotus in the form of small block grants.
The aiyl okmotus will use these to support small-scale demand-driven community or group investments
that will directly or indirectly generate off-farm employment and income or that will alleviate serious
deficiencies in local infrastructure and thereby allow villagers to turn their attention to economic
ventures. Investment decisions at the community level will be made on the basis of participatory
planning, involving all local stakeholders.
Component A, Capacity Building for Local Governments, Communities and NGOs, will support local
capacity building and promote community empowerment. Training will be provided to strengthen the
capacity of communities, CBOs, NGOs and local governments to plan, coordinate, finance and
implement sustainable investments, and to do so in a participatory and transparent manner.
Component B, Village Investments, will support community driven investments in local micro-projects

ISDS
that will generate employment and raise incomes in the participating communities. Funding will be
provided for economic and social infrastructure projects that meet critical local needs as determined by
the communities themselves as well as for income generating group- or community-operated business
ventures that are considered beneficial for the community. The emphasis will be on non-farm activities,
but viable investments in agricultural diversification and specialization in higher-value products will also
be considered, as will critical investments in natural resource management (NRM). Eligible investments
will need to be community or group ventures.  Community governments will receive project funds on a
grant basis and will use these to support micro-projects within the community. Aiyl okmotus and
individual micro-projects receiving project funds will be required to account publicly and regularly for
all funds received and the progress of activities financed with these funds. Beneficiaries will contribute
part of the investment cost from their own resources, appoint a project implementation team, procure the
necessary goods and services, and implement, operate and maintain the micro-projects. About 1,000
such small sub-projects will be financed, based on community demand. The ceiling for sub-projects is
expected to be about US$20,000, with most of them much smaller.
Component C, Project Management, will provide support for overall project management, including but
not limited to a Project Management Agency that will manage and oversee the implementation of the
village investment program. The agency will not be large, as its functions will not include direct
implementation of micro-projects. The project will finance key agency staff, consultants, essential
equipment, operating costs, technical assistance, training, and office refurbishment. Funding will also be
provided for intensive publicity campaigns, beneficiary assessments, periodic surveys, participatory
M&E activities, project audits, widely representative Advisory Councils at the national and regional
levels, and to further legal, regulatory and administrative reform to promote and advance administrative
and financial decentralization and community-driven development.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Project activities will be located mainly within or close to existing settlements. Proximity to protected or
sensitive areas is not anticipated.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
Comments: Since the nature and location of actual sub-projects are not known, the project is environmental
category Fl.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
Il.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project will fund micro-projects of different types, which will only be identified during
implementation. As they will be small-scale activities, costing less than US$20,000, they are not
expected to have significant negative environmental impacts individually or collectively. Possible minor
impacts would most likely be related to construction residues and management of waste materials from
small-scale agro-processing facilities. The project is expected to result in positive environmental impacts
such as land stabilization and re-forestation.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
N/A
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No adverse impact is expected.
lI.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of altematives (if required)
N/A
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Each sub-project would be reviewed for safeguard purposes. An Operations Manual for the project will
include a chapter providing environmental guidelines to assist the Fls and the PIU in this function. The
chapter will include procedures to be followed in the environmental review consistent with OP 4.01 and
Kyrgyz requirements. The chapter will describe institutional arrangements required to ensure
compliance with safeguard procedures and issues. This chapter will serve as the Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). Prior to appraisal there will be public consultation on the EMP, public
disclosure of the EMP, and submission of the EMP to the Info Shop. The EMP will include a monitoring
program, compliance with which will be part of project implementation and supervision.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project will be highly participatory and demand driven. The main stakeholders are members of rural
communities, local administrations, aiyl okmotu and village (settlement) leaders, political leaders,
traditional leaders, NGOs, and the media. Although the involvement of each stakeholder will be
different, the principal participatory mechanisms will be extensive interviews, workshops at different
levels, and structured participatory planning and M&E processes. As appropriate, stakeholders will be
given training or experiential awareness-raising exercises to increase their own capacity to participate or
to enable them to include others in the process. The EMP will be disclosed prior to appraisal.
E. Safeguards Classiflcation. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks

in management of one or more safeguard areas
] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[X] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
