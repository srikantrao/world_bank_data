Project Description (From PDS)
The objective of the COMSTEC project is to reduce land degradation and conserve
globally significant biodiversity resources in the Sarstoon Temash National Park (STNP)
and its buffer zones. The proposed MSP would be complementary to the baseline
CARD project and would build on that project's organisational, institutional and
infrastructural framework for sustainable intensification of agricultural production and
other income generating activities.  The proposed MSP also involves some
substitution activities, as CARD resources in and around STNP would be reoriented to
support the objectives of COMSTEC. Proposed MSP activities are based on the
concept of co-management, as the most effective means for addressing open
access problems related to natural resource use. Co-management aims to
reconstitute the incentives at the local level in a way that those closest to the
resource are given a greater stake in its long-run viability and to directly involve the
population in the effective protection of resources.  In practice, this means
increasing the feasibility of exclusion (promoting a sense of responsibility for the
resource, improving. control) and creating awareness for joint benefits of the
resource  (biodiversity, soil and  water conservation).  Specific  biodiversity
conservation and natural resource management activities supported by COMSTEC
would be based upon Belize's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan from 1998,
developed under the GEF financed "Biodiversity Enabling Activity", and the
Regional Development Plan for Southern Belize (2000) prepared by the IDB financed
Environment and Social Technical Assistance Project (ESTAP).
(A)  Environmentally sound agricultural productivity improvements and small income
generating activities introduced
(B)  Community self-organisotion strengthened
(C)  Biodiversity assessed by communities, status and trends monitored.
(D)  Resource Management Plan for the STNP and its Buffer Zones developed.
(E)  National Park Regulations and the Management Plan implemented and enforced.
(F)  Project implemented efficiently
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environrmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The proposed MSP would complement the regional MBRS initiative by conserving the
terrestrial/wetland habitats in the Sarstoon Temash National Park in continental Belize. In
combination, the COMSTEC and regional MBRS projects would result in
conservation/sustainable use programs being implemented in a range of
interconnected ecosystems, stretching from the high-priority Sarstoon-Temash/Sarstun bi-
national marine complex through the coastal interface and into pristine terrestrial
ecosystems in the STNP

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary dataL
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Since the investments are very small, no major impacts are expected at this time.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
None.
3. In light of I and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Screening procedures should be in place.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The four Kekchi Mayan and one Garifuna communities around STNP hove initiated
and formulated the proposal for co-management of Park. An active group of
representatives, including village chairpersons and Alcaldes, the traditional leaders
in the Kekchi communities, have been involved since its initial stages and have been
successful in keeping the momentum of community interest up for more than two
years. Regular visits in the villages and meetings in Punta Gorda have been held in
spite of lack of modern means of communication. Community "sensitisation" has
been successful and would be strengthened by the project through better means of
communication and further capacity building under the Community Development
component of the baseline project. As the surrounding communities were not
consulted when the park was gazetted, even though the area lies in what they
consider to be their traditional lands, their commitment and motivation to
participate in the planning and management of its protection is strong.
Detailed work programming, implementation of activities, as well as monitoring and
evaluation would be done by the communities themselves, with support from
nationally contracted organisations experienced in the various required fields.
Regular informative    meetings    and   discussions  on   village  level and    annual
programming workshops will ensure broad involvement from community inhabitants
and brood based-decision-making. Villages have identified suitable candidates for
capacity building, leadership and technical training. This approach is the same as
that being applied under the baseline CARD project, guided by the social
assessment carried out during project formulation. The proposed MSP has been
prepared under intensive stakeholder consultation (community visits and workshops
with community representatives) with the involved five villages.
E. Safeguards Classyfication (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[I S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limitcd in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[xl S3. - No safeguard issues



[1 SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, comnmunity driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard frarnework or,prograrnmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
