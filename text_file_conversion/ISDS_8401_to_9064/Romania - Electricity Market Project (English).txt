I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective is to develop a well-functioning wholesale electricity market with the
aim of: (a) putting in place a transparent and predictable commercial and regulatory framework and a
power exchange that will facilitate electricity trading within a competitive national, regional and
eventually European market; and (b) improving the efficiency and reliability of the transmission system
in order to support trading and supply electricity at least cost to consumers. A well-functioning
wholesale electricity market is an integral component of Romania's strategy to attract and sustain private
sector participation in power sector renewal, especially for the refurbishment of power distribution and
generation assets, and to develop a more efficient and increasingly competitive power sector.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project will develop a well-functioning wholesale electricity market. It provides funding for
Transelectrica's highest priority investments in its transmission system. Two grid substations, Fundeni
and lernut, are proposed for Bank financing. The project also provides technical assistance to ANRE,
OPCOM and Transelectrica for: (a) the design and implementation of a regulatory framework for
electricity trading; (b) design, pilot testing and implementation of the OPCOM Power Exchange; and (c)
institutional support to Transelectrica. The proposed Bank assistance has been designed to provide
critical inputs (and avoid any overlaps), taking into account related ongoing EU, EBRD and EIB
projects.
The high priority of the Fundeni and lernut substation rehabilitations was established by
Transelectrica using a multi-criteria analysis which takes into account the importance for synchronous
interconnection with neighboring power grids (i.e., to meet the requirements of the UCTE, section B 2),
improving service quality for producers and suppliers in the electricity market, and upgrading reliability
and efficiency in the delivery of electricity to both captive and eligible consumers. These two
substations will be completely redesigned, rebuilt and equipped for remote control to facilitate the

operation of the electricity market. The Fundeni substation is one of the most important bulk supply
points for the Bucharest area and serves a very high load density area which requires high reliability and
technical performance of quality of supply. The 220/110/10 kV substation contributes to the supply of
an area where the peak demand is over 900 MW. The existing 110/10 kV substation was commissioned
in 1955 and the 220/110 kV bays were added in 1971. The existing equipment is obsolete with low
technical performance and requires urgent replacement of the 220 kV and 110 kV bays, including 3x200
MVA transformers (220/110 kV). The substation will be completely redesigned and rebuilt. The lernut
substation (400/220/1 10 kV) plays an important role in ensuring the electricity supply for the central and
northern region of Transylvania (about 20% of Romania's population). The demand in this region is
about 1,000 MW at peak load and will increase to 1,200-1,300 MW in the period 2005-07. Stability
analyses shows the necessity to maintain in operation the 400 kV lernut-Sibiu transmission line and a
generation load of 200-400 MW in the lernut Power Station. The existing 220/110 kV equipment
substation was originally commissioned in 1963 and the 400 kV bays were added in 1974. The
equipment is obsolete and reliability and technical performance is very poor, thus requiring urgent
replacement. The rehabilitation is intended to modernize the substation at all voltages levels, namely 400
kV, 220 kV and 1 10 kV bays; including I x400 MVA transformers (400 kV/220 kV); and I x200 MVA
transformer (220/1 1 OkV). Engineering and supervision services for bid evaluation and supervision of
the implementation of Fundeni and lernut will also be provided.
The technical assistance component consists of three main parts:
(a)    Design and Implenmentation of Regulatory Framework (Commercial Code, Market Rules and
Price-Capsfor network services)for the New Trading Platform. This component will assist ANRE to
revise the Commercial Code and develop and put in effect predictable and transparent subsidiary market
rules. This component will also assist ANRE to design and implement a transparent and predictable
price-cap methodology for setting and adjusting tariffs to be charged by Transelectrica. Finally, it will
assist ANRE to design and implement price-cap tariffs for distribution.
(b)    Design, Pilot Testing and Inmplementation of the New Trading Platform tlhrough the OPCOM
Power Exchange. Electricity Market Consultants will assist OPCOM, as well as ANRE and
Transelectrica as needed, to design, pilot test and implement the New Trading Platform. Work will
include: (i) the initial vesting contracts; (ii) design, pilot testing and implementation of the OPCOM
Power Exchange; and (iii) on-the-job capacity building and technical support to OPCOM and orientation
training for ANRE, Transelectrica and other market participants.
(c)    Institutional Support to Transelectrica includes its part for the new Electricity Trading Platform
and other institutional support. The Electricity Market Consultants will, in addition to OPCOM's Power
Exchange, also design, pilot test and implement a system balancing mechanism for Transelectrica. The
balance of this technical assistance component will provide consulting services and training to
Transelectrica in areas such as environment, financial management and interconnections/regional
cooperation.
Project Cost and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated at about US$113.60 million with
contingencies. The investment component for Transelectrica accounts for the bulk of the cost. The
total project cost and financing breakdown are given in the following table. The proposed Bank loan will
help finance the foreign exchange cost of Transelectrica's investment components. In addition, the Bank
will finance the foreign costs of the technical assistance components to be implemented by OPCOM and
Transelectrica. The technical assistance component to be implemented by ANRE will be financed by
EU/Phare. Transelectrica and OPCOM will be responsible for the local costs of their respective project

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The lernut substations is well isolated in a area that is primarily farmland. There is nothing of significanice
that is likely to be affected by the proposed projects. The Fundeni substation is on the outskirts of Bucharest
in an area that contains smaller industries and some private residences, all of which were built after the
substation was constructed.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The project does not involve significant environmental issues. Existing grid substations will be
rehabilitated with no land acquisition or resettlement. Transelectrica has prepared Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) for the project. The November-December preparation mission visited the
Fundeni substation site to assess environmental issues. Subsequently, the mission discussed with
Transelectrica environmental staff (headquarters and regional) detailed requirements of the EMPs. Another
Bank mission visited the lernut site in February. The EMPs are based in large measure on information
provided in the environment section of the feasibility studies for each substation. The Fundeni EMP was
reviewed and cleared by the Bank and placed in the InfoShop in mid-February. The lernut EMP was
cleared and placed in the InfoShop in early March.

Section 11 - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible imlpacts.
The project does not involve significant environmental issues. Existing grid substations will be
rehabilitated. The new substations will perform to more modern standards of environment, worker health
and safety. Impacts are minor and limited to the removal and disposal of old equipment and materials
and minor and temporary construction impacts associated with the movement of men, materials and
machines. Transelectrica has investigated its substations and concluded that no equipment currently in
use at the substations to be rehabilitated has utilized PCBs.

Transelectrica prepared and submitted Environmental management plans (EMPs) for the Fundeni project
on February 7, 2003, and for the lernut project on February 28, 2003. The EMPs are based in large
measure on information provided in the environment section of the feasibility studies for each substation
including documentation about public consultations have been submitted as required, prior to project
appraisal. The implementation of the EMPs is included among the main loan conditions and will be
supervised during project implementation.
IT.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Romanian environmental policies and procedures require public consultation as a condition of the project
approval. Additionally, the Bank requires public consultation as a condition of appraisal. These
consultations were held in January 2003 (Fundeni) and February 2003 (lernut), and related
documentation is included in the EMPs, as requested by the Bank.
E. Safeguards Classification Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[  SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
S ] 53. -No safeguard issues
SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
