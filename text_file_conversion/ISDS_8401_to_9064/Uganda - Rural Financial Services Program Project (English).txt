Project Objectives:
This institutional capacity-building program would support and supplement the efforts of Government,
donor agencies and rural finance apex bodies to create a healthy and extensive rural finance system that
would give the poor rural population greater access to financial services that would help stabilize
consumption and raise incone, thus alleviating poverty. Taking into account the activities that are already
underway in the country, the program would aim specifically to:
*   fill existing gaps in the support available to the microfinance subsector in order to enhance the
quality of the rural financial services and help make them financially viable;
*   encourage microfinancial institutions to extend their outreach to more of the rural population; and
*   help build a "business culture" among underserved rural populations.
Project Description:
To achieve these objectives the program would finance technical assistance and capacity building for
rural/micro finance institutions (RMFIs), their apex organizations and support institutions, and their
smallholder potential clientele. The program would strengthen RMFIs that meet stipulated eligibility
criteria and aim to serve the rural poor, especially women. No project funds will be provided for on-
lending, so there is no financial intermediation involved.
The program would have four main components (including the following closely linked activities or sub-
components), most of them provided through matching grants:
*   Expanding the outreach and services of the rural finance system (Promotion of product
innovations, Rural area penetration fund);
*   Building capacity of RMFIs and clients (Strengthening the training market, MFI capacity
building, Promotion of rural business culture);
*   Strengthening and upgrading the rural financial system (Apex structures, MFI upgrading); and
*   Program administration, monitoring and evaluation.
The program does not provide any funds for on-lending by RMFIs, but will help build their capacity to
serve low-income clients on a sustainable basis with more suitable products.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The program is for institutional development. It will be national in scope but will focus its support on the
institutions that can serve smallholders in rural areas. The demand-driven nature of the program is likely to
lead to the selection of locations in the more economically active regions of Uganda for the expansion of
services, but the Rural Area Penetration sub-component will target more remote areas that are currently
underserved by the RMFIs..

Comments:
The classification is based on the fact that the program supports capacity-building, primarily for RMFIs and
support institutions on a cost-sharing basis, and does not involve a credit line for subprojects.

Section II- Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.Plea se fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
The project is not itself a financial intermediary project, in that it does not involve any credit funds for on-
lending or other financing of productive activities.
It does support the Government's objective of increasing access to financing in rural areas by enabling
RMFIs and their support institutions to strengthen their systems and capacities. Issues related to the
financing of new rural investments could arise in future operations that involve funds for on-lending.
However, it may be noted that RMFIs typically do not finance start-up investment in new activities, for
which their short-term, high-interest loans of RMFIs are generally not suitable. The low-income clients of
RMFIs typically use loans for consumption smoothing and working capital (including inputs) in their
existing economic activities, which operate on a small scale with little direct impact on the environment.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
N/A.
3. In light of I and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A.
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Although safeguard issues do not arise directly for the capacity-building activities of this project, it should
be noted that the Government does have in place robust systems to avoid or mitigate possible
environmental consequences of the eventual objective of increased access to financing in rural areas. In
particular, the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), under the Ministry of Water,
Lands and Environment, has responsibility for environmental management and has mechanisms in place
for enforcing compliance through district environment committees and environment officers, who will also
work with the RMFIs receiving institutional support through this project. Furthermore, the "business
culture" training of the potential clients under this project will include training on sustainable
environmental management, in collaboration with other extension programs.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders of the project are the RMFIs, their support institutions (private and governmental),
other donor agencies active in the sector, and the potential clients of expanded RMFI services. The nature
of the capacity-building services provided under the program does not indicate a need for consultation
specifically on safeguard policies.
Nevertheless, under the business culture sub-component of the program, the potential RMFI clients will be
exposed to technical training on production activities that will include awareness of and skills for sound
management of the natural resources and the control of pollution. This training will be reinforced by the
advisory services that will be provided under the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS)
program and will be linked with the monitoring and compliance activities of NEMA at the district level. In
this sense, the business culture sub-component will be a means of informing the potential clients of
expanded RMFIs about the relevant issues that may arise. However, since the program will not directly nor
immediately provide increased financing to these clients, the need for advance disclosure does not arise.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is detennined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.



[ ] Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[XI S3. - No safeguard issues
[]SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similarprojects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
