B.  Project Objective 
 
The PDO is to ensure that water sector resources are effectively and efficiently used to contribute 
to poverty reduction. Specifically, the Project will: (i) consolidate and update the national water 
sector policy framework, and provide systems and facilities to ensure efficient utilization of the 
nation’s water resources for economic diversification and growth; (ii) provide increased access to 
improved water and sanitation services in urban areas in a more efficient and sustainable manner; 
and (iii) provide water resources management institutional support and selected local small 
works, to increase water security for poverty reduction at local level. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project has three components, with a total project cost of US$35 million. A SIL is proposed 
for the project to support the capital investment lending for civil works which is the largest 
component.  
 
Component 1
:  
Support for sector wide policy making and enhanced regulatory capacity in the 
Ministry of Energy and Water Development  (MEWD) and Ministry of Local Government and 
Housing (MLGH) – (US$ 3 million):
 This component will support the emerging water resources 
agenda as well as the WSS policy making function through: (i) strengthening policy making

capacity; (ii) supporting a Policy Reform Unit; (iii) TA support for legislative changes, and (iv) 
create and support capacity for monitoring and evaluation.  
 
Component 2
:
 Investments in water supply and sanitation in the Copperbelt and Lusaka 
Provinces – (US$ 26 million):
 This component will provide support for: (i) civil works for 
rehabilitation, networks extensions and small works; (ii) working capital for operational costs in 
the start-up phase of the lease contracts; and (iii) support to transactions costs for the selected 
PSP options..   
 
Component 3
:
 
Investments in water resources management – (US$ 6 million):
 This component 
will support pilot water resources activities including catchment based management, rain water 
harvesting and small works for water security in drought prone areas. Support will be provided 
for: (i) construction of 25 small pilot schemes for water security; (ii) catchment management 
plans  (iii) surface and groundwater monitoring facilities, and  (iv) supporting studies.  
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations 
under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
 
The project will support: (i)  mainly urban water supply and sanitation works in the Copperbelt 
Province and Lusaka Province, and (ii) Southern province pilot projects for water security 
schemes. The major capital works will be selected on the basis of cost-effective improvements 
and include rehabilitation and some augmentations to the systems. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
[Guideline: Refer to Section 5 of PCN]
 
 
It is expected that the majority of the works will be carried out and supervised through the 
private sector contracting arrangements as is currently the case for the on-going Mine Township 
Services Project. The contacting agency with the private operator will employ an environmental 
specialist to supervise and ensure compliance with environmental standards and safeguards.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN] 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
Provision has been made for funding of the ESIA during project preparation. The ESIA can only 
be successfully prepared once the capital work program has been agreed. The ESIA is expected 
to be completed during pre-appraisal which would be around March 2004.
 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
Consultation process will be an integral part of the EA preparation, implementation and 
supervision.  The ESIA document will be prepared by the Borrower, and approved by the Bank 
and disclosed in-country and at the Infoshop prior to Project Appraisal.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the
 
disputed areas

IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN REVIEW 
 
[Guideline: Summarize the key agreements reached on follow-up actions to be taken regarding 
safeguards during project preparation] 
 
Since the project has been categorized as B/S2, a “focused ESIA” is required and will be carried 
out at the earliest as OP 4.01 will likely be triggered. The ESIA TOR would also include an 
analysis of potential resettlements impacts as well as impacts on cultural property (OPN 11.03). 
Once additional information on project activities are available, the Task Team would provide the 
information to ASPEN before the QER to seek their advice and agree on approaches to handle 
the applicable safeguard issues. A ASPEN representative will be included in the Task Team to 
assure continuity. 
 
Agreed target date for Quality Enhancement Review: 
After pre-appraisal, scheduled for April 
2004.
