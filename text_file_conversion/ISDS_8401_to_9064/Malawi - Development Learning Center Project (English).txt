I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

To test the effectiveness and sustainability of a development learning centre in Malawi as part of a
global knowledge-sharing network to strengthen the capacity of public, private and civil society
decision makers and implementers to design, plan and manage social and economic development
policies and programs. In particular, the project will focus on improving the expenditure
accountant skills as outlined in the pillars 2 and 4 of the PRSP.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

This LIL has four components : (i) Main DLC construction and equipment in Lilongwe; (ii)
Support of the Main DLC operations; (iii) Equipment and Installation of the sub-DLC in Blantyre;
and (iv) Monitoring & Evaluation. The Credit will finance the DLC operations during the first
four years of operations on a decreasing basis. The first year, the Credit will cover 80% of the
Center's operating costs. The second year, it will cover 60%, the third year 40%, and the fourth
year 20%.

The management staff of the DLC will elaborate a business-plan which will describe the
management policy of the Center. The business-plan will help the DLC to reach financial
sustainability by the fifth year of implementation.

(i) Construction and Installation: This component will set up the institutional, physical and human
resource requirements for the DLC. It will be implemented by the Project Coordination.

(ii) DLC Operations Support: The component will in effect operationalize the DLC and assist in
establishing its viability and training program. It will be implemented by the DLC.

(iii) Sub-DLC Installation and Operations: This component will comprise the retrofitting of the
sub-DLC facilities in Blantyre and the support of its operations during the first three years of
implementation. It will be implemented by the DLC with the support of the Project Coordination
and will start after one year of successful operations by the main center in Lilongwe.

(iv) Monitoring & Evaluation: This component will be managed by the Project Coordination with
considerable input and collaboration from the DLC.

Components:

1. DLC Establishment, Construction and Installation
2. Support to DLC Operations
3. Sub-Center Installation and Support
4. Monitoring and Evaluation

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The Development Learning Center will be located in the vicinity of the Malawi Institute of
Management (MIM), a training institution, in Lilongwe. MIM was established in 1989 and owns 40
acres of land, much of it unutilized. Facilities developed by MIM include 13 training/seminar rooms
(2 blocks), 2 residential hostels (capacity of 64 self contained single rooms), administrative offices, a
dining complex, laundry facilities, a recreational sports field. MIM is connected to the public water
system but maintains its own water reservoir. It also manages its own sewage and waste disposal
system. The Institute receives approximately 800 participants per year with about 60 in residence at
any one time. There are no squatters in the property. MIM is located in the suburbs of Lilongwe, 15
Kms north-west of the city centre. There is no immendiate neighbors to the property and the campus
is located within an industrial area.

The DLC will be located outside the active campus ground currently developed with the facilities
described above. The construction (approximately 7 months work) and installation of the Center is
limited to a small one-story building, on about 10,000 square feet, with the following features: a
video conference room (30-person capacity), a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations
(hardware, software and Internet hook-up), a technical and administrative center; and electrical and
telephone installations.

The sub-DLC will be located within an existing infrastructure of a training institution in Blantyre.
The retrofitting (approximately 1 month work) and installation of the sub-Centre is limited to a few
offices and rooms, on about 5,000 square feet, with the following features: a video conference room
(20-person capacity), a computer room outfitted for 20 computer stations (hardware, software and
Internet hook-up), a technical and administrative center; and electrical and telephone installations.

The PCU will be responsible for preparation of the architectural designs, the bidding process, and
construction activities (based on the international DLC standards and IDA procedures). The PCU
will work closely with the Ministry of Housing and OPC to ensure the successful delivery of project
components 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The Bank, through ISG, will provide the expertise to procure,
install, and test the specialized equipment. No toxic materials will be used during construction or
operations. Water, sanitation, and waste management will be handled by MIM, in consultation with
the architect and site contractor.
