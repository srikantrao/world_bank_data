I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project's development objective is to reduce poverty by enhancing capability of
Cambodian public sector to deliver services more effectively. The Government of
Cambodia initiated significant reform programs following the formation of the Royal
Government in 1993. The Governnent's reform efforts so far have focused on the first
generation of reforms, e.g., macroeconomic and fiscal management improvement. To
reduce poverty significantly through broad-based economic growth, enhance public
sector service delivery is essential. Towad this end, in addition to continuing and
deepening reform efforts in macroeconomic and fiscal management, the Government
now needs to move decisively toward a second generation of reforms, in particular civil
service capacity building and strengthening governance. This project aims to bridge the
Government's reform efforts toward a second generation of reforms. While the project
is a small operation, it aims to play a catalytic role by focusing on capacity building on
the ground with an emphasis on training, knowledge transfer, and assumption of
responsibilities by Cambodians in the place of or complementary to the provision of
foreign advisors, including introducing Global Development Learning Network (GDLN)
facility.
