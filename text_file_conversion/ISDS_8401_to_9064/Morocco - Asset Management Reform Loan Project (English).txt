Project Objectives:
Public expenditure rationalization and improved social sector performance through the
establishment of an effective asset management system, focusing on education and health
expenditures.
Project Description:
Morocco, like many other countries, treats its public land and real estate holdings as public
goods, rather than productive assets capable of producing a mix of significant returns and
social benefits if properly managed. In Morocco, land and real estate typically represent 25 to
50 percent of public entities' assets, mostly under the custody of line ministries. The
replacement cost of the buildings of the ministries of health, education and higher education
alone amount to nearly 8 percent of GDP. The potential savings from improved management
of this land and real asset portfolio are significant: lessons from corporate real property
management, already applied by a number of governments around the world, have shown that
improved asset management systems generate significant economic and efficiency gains. The
AMRL will help Morocco achieve those gains by promoting a reform targeted towards: i) a
National Asset Management Policy; and ii) Buildings Management Systems for the public Health,
Education and Higher Education sectors. While the cost of maintenance and asset mnanagement can
be high in the short term, its return in the longer term is high. Therefore, the proposed adjustment
loan is to finance the short-term reform costs and to help fill the budgetary gap dunng the period of
adjustnent.
