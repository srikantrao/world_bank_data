BOARD DATE: December 16, 2003                 IDA AMOUNT (Sm): 4.0 million
MANAGING UNIT: AFTH2                          SECTOR: Social Protection
LENDING INSTRUMENTS: SIL                      STATUS: Lending
Project Objectives (From PDS)
The proposed supplemental credit would enable the Government to meet project development objectives
both in terms of direct impact on the poor through employment generation and sustainable improvements in
living conditions, and the longer-term institutional development objectives to increase the capacity of the
Government, municipalities and community groups to design and implement poverty reduction strategies
by building a bridge between the gains made under the National Poverty Alleviation Program (NPAP) and
the new PRSP currently being developed.
Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed supplemental credit, in the amount of US$4.0 million, would retain the basic objectives and
operating procedures of the Social Sector Development Project. It would aim to complete the portfolio of
unfunded sub-projects and consolidate the reconversion of the FAIMO employment generation schemes in
favor of higher impact, more efficient investments. It would also help ensure an effective transition of the
approaches and mechanisms developed under the PNAP into Cape Verde's PRSP and eventual PRSC. It
would consist of:
(a) Public Works and Employment Creation Sub-Projects (US$3.7 million)
The Project would finance 28 sub-projects previously suspended under Convention 1/01 that are already
identified, appraised and have had technical specifications developed (US$3.3 million). Two-thirds of the
amount would support rehabilitation of community roads and streets in poor areas. The remainder would
finance construction and rehabilitation of health posts, community centers, day care facilities and water
cisterns. The Project would continue, as part of the accompanying activities to the sub-projects, to train
small-scale entrepreneurs in the construction trades and to provide institutional strengthening to the
Municipal Partnership Commissions (US$0.2 million). The Project would also finance AGECABO
operating costs related to this last Convention 1/01 (US$0.2 million).
(b) Capacity Building and Monitoring & Evaluation (US$0.3 million)
The Project would finance part of the personnel and operating costs of the PCU/NPAP, as well as to cover
for the required technical and financial audits and a final evaluation of the program. A main focus of the
capacity building in poverty monitoring and evaluation will be to merge the mechanisms developed and
lessons learned under the NPAP (1998-2002) into the country's PRSP under development.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Rural and urban areas (country-wide).

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Experience with the parent project has been that there have not been any significant environmental or
social issues. On the environment side, sub-projects have been systematically assessed according to the
recommended environmental assessment guidelines developed by the Bank (Simplified Environmental
Assessment - Guide to Undertaking Environmental Impact Assessment of Agetip Works, Work Bank,
October 1996; and Environmental Gutidelines for Social Funds, the World Bank, October 1998) as
codified in the project's Procedural Manual. No substantive changes have been made to this Manual.
The screening process includes use of an environmental checklist. The subprojects to be financed
under the supplemental credit have gone through this environmental screening by an external firm and
pose no significant environmental risk. In terms of resettlement risk, with all 28 projects known, a
resettlement framework would not be required. The environmental screening criteria include whether
any resettlement will occur from the sub-project. None of the sub-projects to be financed pose a
resettlement risk.
The team has supplied documentation to AFTSI which substantiate the above including: a)
environmental management procedures in place and currently used for screening sub-projects as
codified in the Procedural Manual; b) results of the environmental screening of the 28 sub-projects to
be financed, including confirmation that no resettlement is involved; and c) legal description of the
country's land acquisition procedures and eminent domain regulations related to compensation.
The agreed upon documents have been disclosed in country and through Infoshop.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
Not applicable
3. In light of I and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
See para. I above
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Population of Cape Verde at large through Municipal Partnership Commissions.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ I SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[] S3. - No safeguard issues
[] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
