I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objectives of the project are to provide rural communities with improved access to
social services and economic opportunity, and to enhance the capacity of relevant government
institutions to better manage rural transport infrastructure.
l.A.3. Project Description:
The project funds the following eight components: (a) improvement (minor widening and strengthening)
of about 1,100 km of existing UZRs; (b) improvement of about 500 km of existing URs; (c) construction
of about 15,000 m of missing minor (less than 30 meters) bridges/culverts on URs; (d) periodic
maintenance/rehabilitation of about 1,500 km of UZRs; (e) improvement of about 150 existing rural
markets and construction/improvement of 45 river jetties; (f) implementation of Resettlement Framework
(RF), Environmental Management Framework (EMF), Resettlement Action Plans (RAP), Environmental
Management Plans (EMP) and Indigenous People's Development Plans (IPDP) associated with the civil
works components; (g) consultant services to assist in the design, supervision and monitoring of the civil
works components; and (h) technical assistance to build up LGED's and selected LGI's capacity in
transport infrastructure planning and financing, maintenance management, quality assurance, transport
safety, financial and project management, performance monitoring and evaluation.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Specific locations of the civil works will be determined annually. They will be carried out in the rural
areas of 21 districts under greater Rajshahi, Bogra, Pabna, Dhaka, Sylhet and Comilla. Overall coverage
of the project will amount to 44,900 sq kmn, with a poptulation of about 45 million. The first phase civil
works have been identified for 15 districts where land acquisition affects approximately 6,000
households to varying degrees. The first phase civil works are not located in, or in close proximity to any
protected area, or any designated natural habitats. There are a number of cultural and archaeologically
important sites that are located in the project districts, but not necessarily within sub-project sites. Only
one cultural property, a temple on the Taltola-Anandabazar Road, is located very close to both roadwork
and bridgework's, and will be protected during the construction phase.
B. Check Environmental Classification: A (Full Assessment)
Comments:
The project has only limited, local and manageable environmental impacts. However, because of the large
number of people affected by land acquisition, the project is classified and meets category "A" requirements.
This has meant that independent consultants were hired to conduct the EA and the borrower has addressed
their comments and revised the safeguard documents. The draft EA and resettlement policy framework were
disclosed before appraisal and made available on LGED's website, at District headquarters, and Bangla
summaries were placed at all District/UP offices where the first year's investments are scheduled.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
cescribe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project is unlikely to cause large-scale, or long-term significant impacts. The known impacts are
limited to manageable construction-related environmental impacts. Aside from mitigating project
impacts, the plans include measures to improve the currently deteriorated environment and hygiene
conditions at the civil works sites. This is particularly the case of the market areas and will include the
management of such issues such as wastewater and solid waste disposal and arsenic contamination of
the potable water supply.



ISDS
In the first phase civil works, about 6,000 households and 172 businesses will be affected, most losing
only small amounts of land. These impacts are adequately mitigated by the RF for the whole project and
the RAP for the first year has already been prepared and cleared. Other impacts may occur if indigenous
peoples, cultural property or natural habitat are affected, therefore the EMF and IPDP present a clear
approach for triggering of additional avoidance, mitigation and management measures at the civil works
level, and action plans to mitigate any potential impacts where unavoidable.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No cumulative impacts are expected. To monitor this and ensure that civil works selection and design
takes into account local environmental conditions, tracking will be conducted through annual
environmental audits. As LGED assesses the effectiveness of the safeguard mechanisms, they will refine
and update civil works screening and mitigation guidelines.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No long term impacts are expected. This is because most of the infrastructure being improved under the
project exists already.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The project preparation process included environmental analysis and preparation of environment
management plans. Based on the environment analysis and appraisal of the environmental impacts of
similar projects, an overall analysis of the civil works alternatives was undertaken. The civil works
components of the project will be in large part identified through a participatory process, which will
consider alternative sites. During the planning and design of the civil works component, environmental
considerations and participatory designs will consider all possible alternative project designs, and select
the most appropriate construction alternatives. Such analysis of alternatives is fully integrated into the
planning and design of the civil works included in the first year implementation program. The
environment codes of practice include guidelines for modifying the civil works designs linked to possible
environmental issues.
LGED developed a RF (and RAP for the phase one civil works) to deal with the impacts arising from
land acquisition and displacement of people from public lands, such as squatters. The road widening
works, will generally require strip acquisition of minor amounts of land along the roads being improved.
Alternative designs were considered to minimize acquisition and physical relocation of structures. An
IPDP was also prepared outlining the principles for planning and implementation when communities of
indigenous people are among those affected.
I[.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Environmental and social screening was carried out during project preparation to determine what
safeguard policies applied. Social and environmental assessments identified affected areas and details of
project impacts.
Where possible, the project will consider all possible alternatives to avoid and/or minimize land
acquisition and displacement. Where resettlement is required, the project will apply appropriate
resettlement and environmental mitigation measures, as described in the following table:
Policy                     Compliance Measures and Comments

Environmental           An EMF has been prepared for the project. As per the EMF all civil works
Assessment (OP 4.01)     will be screened for environmental impacts, and categorized into
environmllenital categories 1, 2 or 3. The category I civil works will be subject
to full EA and EMPs which will subsequently be prepared and implemented.
The category 2 civil works will be subject to Limited EA (LEA) and resultant
EMPs will be prepared. The category 3 civil works will be implemented by
incorporating the provisions of the ECPs in the civil works designs and
contract documents. The ECPs for each type of civil works have been
prepared, and should suffice the needs of the category 3 civil works. EMPs for
the Phase I civil works (all UZR improvement works), and a sample of each
type of other works have been prepared, which shall serve as guidance for the
2nd and 3rd year/phase civil works. LEA, if required will be conducted
following similar EA steps adopted in the preparation of these EMPs. For the
category 1 civil works, which are unlikely, unless the civil works are located in
designated "environmentally critical areas", detailed EA will be conducted.
Natural Habitats (OP    None of the Phase I civil works are located within or near any designated
4.04)                   natural habitats, and it is unlikely that any of the remaining civil works would
be located likewise. However, as a contingency provision, civil works that
affect a natural habitat will be subject to full EA. As part of the resultant
EMP, an adequate management plan to mitigate and compensate any impacts
on any natural habitats will be prepared.
Cultural Property (OPN  No designated cultural property will be impacted in the Phase I civil works,
11.03)                  and in the unlikely scenario of any such impacts, the impacts will be examined
as part of the full or limited EA, as applicable, and a detailed conservation plan
for cultural property will be prepared. A small number of minor community
and religious properties are close to the civil works, including one such
property in the Phase I UZR improvement works. All such properties will be
carefully protected.
Indigenous Peoples (OD  An IPDP for the Phase I civil works was prepared to clarify the required steps
4.20)                   to be taken where indigenous people are among those affected by the project.
It includes: (a) legal framework; (b) baseline data; (c) land tenure; (d) strategy
for local participation; (e) development or mitigation activities; (f) institutional
capacity; (g) implementation schedule; (h) monitoring and evaluation; and (i)
cost estimates and financing plan for the first year's works.
Involuntary Resettlement A RF and a RAP for the Phase I civil works were prepared to mitigate land
(OP/BP 4.12)            acquisition and resettlement impacts. The framework contains: (a) a legal
framework outlining the principles and guidelines which will be used to
acquire lands and mitigation of the adverse impacts; (b) a mitigation policy
matrix in terms of different loss categories; (c) an organization framework to
plan and implement the mitigation measures; (d) a grievance redress procedure
for the PAPs; (e) a framework to monitor progress in land acquisition and RAP
implementation; and (f) a planning process defining the tasks for phase-wise
land acquisition and action plan preparation and implementation. This will
provide the basis to prepare separate RAPs for each yearly/phase civil works
program, and was used to prepare the first phase RAP. RAPs for the
subsequent civil works phases contain the details of the impacts and impacted
persons, budget and the implementation time-frame.

IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultations were organized by LGED sociologists and District level community organizers in
107 focus group discussions, attended by over 3,000 local residents during project preparation.
These meetings have been documented in the final Stakeholder Analysis Report. The report also
plans participation approaches and identifies stakeholders for civil works identification, social
screening, design, social assessment, implementation, and monitoring. The participatory
approach used to select the project's physical components will also be extended to include
planning, implementation and monitoring of the resettlement activities. To preserve
transparency, the PAPs/communities will be made fully aware of the principles and guidelines
used for impact mitigation, and their rights and obligations in the compensation assessment and
payment processes. LGED project office will also assist the PAPs procure any legal documents
that are required to prove ownership and claim the compensation from the DCs.
Draft environmental and social assessment reports and plans have been disclosed publicly, in the
different project districts. The executive summaries of environmental and social assessment
reports and plans have been disclosed through the LGED website, and at Bank offices
(Washington Infoshop & Dhaka), LGED HQ and district offices, and public places in each
project District.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[X] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
S ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
