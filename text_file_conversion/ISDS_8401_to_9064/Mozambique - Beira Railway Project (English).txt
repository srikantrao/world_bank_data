                    selection of the successful bidder.

I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The main objective of the proposed Project is to: (i) make cost effective and efficient transport available for
the freight and passenger traffic in the central region of Mozambique and the neighboring countries of
Malawi and Zimbabwe; and (ii) improve the operational and financial sustainability of the Beira railways
system. An efficiently performing railway system will: (i) make Mozambican exports from the central
region globally more competitive; and (ii) accelerate economic growth in the Zambezi Valley. The Project
will support BOT-type concessioning of the rail system aimed at rehabilitation to standards adequate to
carry the freight traffic on-offer and strengthen functioning of the regulatory body.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Project Description
The rehabilitation work shall be carried out in accordance with the designs to be established by the
Conceding Authority as per the Concession Agreement. This will enable the system to carry all freight
traffic on-offer including coal currently produced but excluding large scale coal transport expected as a
result of coal concession. The concessionaire would be responsible for handling all traffic on-offer and for
establishing adequate capacity for such traffic. Once the coal concession is operational, the concessionaire
would be responsible for creating capacity for the increased traffic volumes. However, if the railway
concessionaire is unable to negotiate acceptable terms for upgradation of the Sena line to handle the
additional coal traffic, the conceding authority shall have the right to terminate the concession as per the
conditions laid out in the concession agreement

The proposed project would comprise three components: (a) railways concessioning (TA); (b)
infrastructure rehabilitation; and (c) strengthening of the regulatory framework.

In the short-to-medium term (prior to coal concessioning) the economic benefits are expected to be
substantial and justify rehabilitation of the line. In the long-term, the operation of the line would bolster
investor confidence and interest to participate in the coal concessioning. However, as the project is not
likely to be financially viable in the short run, the proposed rehabilitation of the Sena rail line would require
high share of public finance/concessionary loans. To make the concession biddable, the Government has
agreed to provide long maturity loans on concessionary terms. The Conceding Authority will award the
concession to the bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive to the bidding
documents and who has offered the lowest present value of support required. The Bank's financing will be

                                                                                                               ISDS


estimated based on Government's assessment of the support required after selection of the successful
bidder. The total project cost is estimated at US$100.00 million.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The Beira Railways System. The Beira rail system comprises two rail lines: (a) a 317-km Machipanda
line linking the port of Beira to the railway network in Zimbabwe; and (b) a 600-km Sena line linking the
port of Beira to the Moatize coal fields with a small spur linking the system to the rail network in Malawi.
The two lines take off from Beira and bifurcate at Dondo, a station about 28 kms. from Beira.

The Machipanda line goes in the Westerly direction up to the border station of Machipanda, where it links
to the Zimbabwe rail network at Mutare station. The Machipanda line is heavily graded which
consequently limits the train load.

The Sena line takes off from the Machipanda line at Dondo and goes in a North, North-Westerly direction,
crossing the Zambezi river between Sena and Dona Ana (298 Km from Dondo). The line again bifurcates
at Dona Ana, a 254 Km line runs on the North bank of the Zambezi river to the Moatize terminal station
and a short 44 km line runs North to Vila Nova Frontiera where it links up with the Malawi railway
system. There is, in addition, an 88-Km branch line running due East from Inhamitinga to Marromeu on the
South bank of the Zambezi. The line is graded in parts, particularly, for the first 36 kilometers while
starting from Moatize.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: The Sena line was operational until 1983. It is only being rehabilitated and no additional line is
being built. The rehabilitation work involves changing the rails and sleepers, replenishing ballast and
establishing signaling and communication equipment. No major earthwork is being undertaken and there is no
cutting of or filling of land. A full environment assessment was made for the on-going Railways and Ports
Restructuring Project (RPRP), which is valid for the proposed project as well. This EA report will be revised
in accordance with project objectives and disclosed prior to appraisal. The main issues are: (i) the line along
with five meters on each side has been de-mined. However, this is not satisfactory and it would be a condition
of effectiveness of the project that the area of 30 meters on either side is de-mined; and (ii) the line is fitted
with wooden sleepers, which would have affected the forests. A decision has been taken to use only concrete
sleepers except at a very few locations where nonstandard sleepers need to be used.

However, since the assessment was made a few years ago, the report will be updated through a
supplemental study. The objectives of the study would be to: (i) determine the environmental baseline
conditions at, and in the vicinity of the Beira rail operational site, including the Sena line; (ii) evaluate the
current institutional and legal framework and propose new regulations, whenever considered necessary; and
(iii) formulate an Environmental Audit Management Plan for the Beira railways system.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
As observed earlier, there were two main environmental issues (use of wooden slippers and clearing of area
within 5 meters of the railway line) and both have been resolved under the on-going RPRP. The clearing of
area within 30 meters of the railway line will be a condition of effectiveness.

During preparation, a study will be conducted to: (i) establish environmental base line conditions and
examine the present institutional and legal framework; (ii) assess the physical, biological and socio-cultural
environment; (iii) formulate an Environmental Audit and Management Plan which encompasses
environmental mitigation, monitoring and research, contingency plans, emergency response plans and
health and safety plans; (iv) evaluate the institutional issues relevant to establishing a well functioning rail
operation from an environmental point of view and recommend improvements and institutional changes as
needed. The study would also review the Mozambique Railways Act and address the environmental
management obligations of the concessionaire.

In addition, the study would undertake an inventory of people and property on railway land on the
Machipanda and Sena rail line systems and particularly of those people who might be living too close to the
railway tracks, thus compromising operational safety. Once the inventory is completed and any problems
identified, a separate Resettlement Action Plan will be developed for displaced people and/or for the
compensation of damaged property (if required), as appropriate and consistent with OP 4.12.

The specific actions, including environmental management obligations of the concessionaire would be
developed based on study findings and recommendations. The study will also identify accumulated liability,
the liquidation of which will be the responsibility of CFM

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
TBD

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
TBD

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
De-mining of the area within 30 meters of the railway line will be a condition of effectiveness.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Under the RPRP a comprehensive safety, health and environment (SHE) policy has been developed. The
social issues of staff retrenchment consequent to concessioning are being addressed satisfactorily under the
on-going RPRP.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Public consultation will be carried out with local population, local NGO's and local and central
government. Disclosure will be done in-country and in the InfoShop prior to appraisal.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
