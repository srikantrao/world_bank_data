I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Project activities are grouped under three components focusing on access/completion, quality and
management as in the table below. This structure corresponds to the MoE's Strategic Vision and is also
being utilized by other development partners. Although the structure may not be ideal, it will help the
MoE to facilitate coordination of support around the three main goals.
Increase Access and Completion of Primary Education in the poorest districts. This
component supports activities targeted to the 19 poorest districts in Phongsaly, Oudomxay,
Louangnamtha, Houaphan, Attapeu and Xekong to help raise primary enrolment and completion by
upgrading infrastructure, completing incomplete schools through extension and improvement of
multigrade teaching, upgrading contract teachers recruited locally where there are insufficient teachers,
and providing additional financial support to communities for the operation of the school and to lower
the cost of education, particularly for the poorest members.
1.1: Community Based Contractingfor classroom construction (CBC). The objective of this



2
ISDS
sub-component is to improve access and retention of children in the 19 targeted poorest districts by
improving the physical learning environment of the existing schools through increase of classrooms and
latrines. The achievement of this objective - combined with the increase of teaching force/multigrade
teaching aimed by sub-components 1.2 and 1.3 -- will allow incomplete primary schools to gradually
offer a complete 5-grades of primary education. Consistent with the decentralization policy, the project
will pilot a community management approach to school construction where eligible communities manage
the contracting and construction process and receive a grant of a fixed amount, designs, and technical
assistance to do so.
1.2: Community Grants for schooling (CG). The CBC program will be accompanied by a Community
Grant program providing grants of 3 million Kip annually to villages participating in the CBC program.
The CG program will scale up experience acquired under the Basic Education for Girls Project (BEGP)
which targets villages without schools in the same districts as those targeted in the proposed project. The
objective of the CG program is to encourage increased enrolment and completion of primary education
by providing resources for needed inputs and supporting the cost of education for the very poor.
1.3 In-Service Teacher Training - All teachers in participating villages will receive in-service training to
provide multigrade teaching, and all untrained contract teachers will be upgraded through the in-service
teacher upgrading program. The latter is a long established program started with support from UNICEF
which has been on-going for about nine years. Several multigrade teacher training programs exist,
having been developed under various projects. The project would scale up these programs.
2.    Improve the Quality of Primary Education. This component supports system-wide activities
designed and implemented at the central level.
2.1: Textbooks and teachers'guides. The objectives of this subcomponent are to: (i) ensure that school
teachers and students in primary grades 1-5 have teachers' guides and textbooks required by the
curriculum; and (ii) develop the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) to manage the complete
cycle of textbook provision, from evaluation of student achievement and curnculum development
through manuscript development, printing, distribution, and teacher orientation on the effective use of
textbooks.
2.2: National assessment of student learning outcomes. The Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes
for Primary Education (ASLO) component aims to strengthen the capacity of the National Research
Institute for Educational Sciences (NRIES) to evaluate the quality of primary education and the
conditions of schooling. This component will support the establishment of a pennanent and continuous
National Assessment System that will develop student assessment instruments to monitor achievement of
basic competencies.
3.     Strengthen capacities for policy analysis and management
3.1. Strengthen Policy and strategy development. This component aims to strengthen the capacity of the
MOE to make information-based decisions on policies and strategies. It supports (a) the establishment of
a Policy Analysis Unit, (b) development of a policy agenda and conduct of about five policy studies, (c)
establishment of a Statistics and Information Division, (d) improvements to the collection and
analysis of education statistics and the reporting of information in the Annual Bulletin and in
map form; and (e) improvement in the filing, storage and archiving of information that is
included in decrees relating to education, studies, reports, and project documents
3.2. Capacity Buildingfor Better Management. This program contributes to a broader multidonor effort
and focuses on building up in-country capacity for the delivery of training in education administration

ISDS
and management at the NUOL.
3.3: Project management. The objectives are good implementation, and strengthened capacities in
project management, coordination, procurement and financial management.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
About half of project investments are targeted towards villages in 19 districts in six Provinces as
noted above. The villages are small, rural, poor, mountainous, and the majority of the population is
ethnolinguistically non-Lao.
Natural Habitats -- The project will not be financing components that affect any known natural habitats as
defined under OD 4.40.
Pesticides -- The Project does not involve pesticides It will not procure any pesticides nor increase the use of
pesticides.
Cultural Propertv -- It is not expected that the project will adversely affect sites having archeological,
paleontological, historical, religious or unique natural values as defined under OPN 11.03. However, the
CBC Operational Manual (CBC OM) defines the actions to be followed in the event of chance finds.
Indigenous Peoples -- A Social Assessment and Ethnic Group Development Plan have been completed. The
project is not expected to negatively impact on ethnic minorities but rather to afford important benefits. The
EGDP details how the project addresses the constraints/issues faced by ethnic minorities, process-related
safeguards to ensure inclusion in decision making processes, an agenda for research and policy development
with respect to language of instruction and ethnic minority issues, and broadening stakeholder participation.
Involuntary Resettlement -- There is not expected to be any land acquisition. School construction is
intended to replace existing buildings on existing sites, although there may be some cases where the current
site is no longer appropriate. In the rare event that new sites would be involved, the CBC OM provides for a
land acquisition process to be followed with villagers compensated for any land acquired.
Environment -- The project includes classroom construction. Environmental issues that may anse from the
construction program include the use of building materials that contain asbestos and contaminated water
from latrines. There is little likelihood that significant environmental impacts will result from woven
asbestos tiles, and the proper siting of latrines will manage the water quality issue. The CBC OM provides
an environmental screening checklist and instructions to control these risks as well as those related to waste
disposal, dust and noise.
The table below summarizes related risk factors, the likelihood of occurrence, likely impact if
occurred and management response.
LRO = Likelihood of Risk Occurring (Low, Medium, High)

B. Check Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments: Category C was endorsed by the Safeguards Review Meeting of May 22, 2001 as long as
building sites are reviewed for asbestos in building materials, sanitation, water supply and dust and noise
issues. The Safeguards categorization S2 was considered appropriate for the size and type of project and is
consistent with similar projects. The CBC Operational Manual contains the processes and actions to be
taken for review of asbestos and other concerns.

N/A
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
II.D.3. Descnbe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The following plans and guidelines have been prepared: an Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP) for
the Indigenous Peoples Safeguards, an environmental checklist and land acquisition framework. The
environmental checklist, land acquisition framework and safeguards included in the EGDP that pertain to
the CBC program are all contained in the CBC OM. The EGDP is a separate, stand alone, document that



6
ISDS
includes the safeguards contained in the CBC OM as well as other activities.
Institutional Responsibilities. Overall responsibility for the implementation of these
guidelines lies with the EDP II Project Manager in Vientiane. The EDP II PM will ensure that the
guidelines are appropriately disseminated and that project staff have the required skills and
receive appropriate training. The PM is responsible for proper monitoring of social and
environment issues and will incorporate necessary changes to the guidelines and procedures, in
agreement with the World Bank, based on recommendations from monitoring exercises.
Monitoring and Evaluation. Approved projects with environmental and/or social impacts
will be supervised and monitored by District Engineers, and the Provincial Program Managers to
whom they report. Findings and any recommendations will be recorded in quarterly reports to be
fumished to the Project Manager, through the Provincial Education Service and shared with
World Bank supervision missions.
General monitoring and evaluation of the project will pay attention to the application of
the safeguard frameworks for the environment and land acquisition.
For the ethnic group development plan, as for all project activities, monitoring of
implementation will be the responsibility of the Project Manager in the Department of Planning
and Cooperation in the MoE, with each Implementing Unit responsible for implementation and
reporting on areas under their responsibility.
Complaints related to environmental, ethnic minority or resettlement issues will be
handled as follows:
*   As a first stage, affected or concerned persons will present, verbally or in wnting, their
complaints to the District Engineer or DEB as appropriate, who will have to provide a
documented response to the claimants within 30 days.
* If the claimants are not satisfied with the decision of district facilitators or authorities, the
case may be submitted to the PES or the EDP II Project Manager, as well as to relevant
government authorities, such as the Provincial Assembly or the Lao Front for National
Construction. Specified project office or authorities should record receipt of complaints and
reply to the claimants within 15 calendar days.
Claimants will be exempted from any administrative or legal charges associated with pursuing
complaints.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders in the project are the Government (central, provincial, district), education staff,
and communities/villages. Central Ministry of Education staff have direct responsibility for project
preparation. Decision makers have their input through the Steering Committee and technical staff
express their views through the Project Preparation Task Force. Provincial and district education staff,
provincial government representatives, village heads, school directors and teachers have participated in a
workshop to identify/confirm the constraints to achieving the universal completion of primary education,
and strategies to address them, and will be engaged in planning and managing the activities implemented
at the local levels, i.e. classroom construction, maintenance, in-service teacher training and school grant
program. Relevant agencies are consulted as needed. The Ethnic Group Development Plan was prepared
in consultation with potential project beneficiaries/communities through a Social Assessment, and



7
ISDS
agencies responsible for various facets of ethnic minority issues - the Lao Front for Reconstruction, the
ethnic minority unit of the National Assembly, and the Institute for Linguistic Research. Disclosure of
safeguard policies will take place through broad dissemination of the CBC OM. The EGDP and CBC
OM will be distributed to all participating Provinces and districts as part of the Bank's public disclosure
policy. They will also be utilized throughout project implementation, and further consultations will
continue under project implementation as participating villages are known.
E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
