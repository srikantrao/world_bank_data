I A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The 8 projects under development are expected to generate over 6 7 million TCO2e of emissions reductions
up to 2012.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The project is the umbrella project under which at least eight run-of-river power plants are developed
with a nominal capacity of 274 MW and an anticipated generation of 1789 GWh/year The most of the
region is scarce in vegetation Out of eight projects, seven projects are connected to the national grid and
one project will replace the existing off-grid diesel plant The first plant is expected to be in operation in
December 2004
I A 4 Project Location (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
The hydro-power projects will be located all over Peru Each project EA will provide specific information about the
location
BI. Check Environmental Classification A [ ], B [ x l, C I 1. Fl [ ], TBD [ I
Comments: Due to the civil works that will be undertaken for this project, it ments a Category B
environmental rating An initial screening of the projects confirmed that no irreversible or unprecedented
impacts are expected An environmental impact assessment will be done of each plant.

Section 11 - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant qucstions If information Is not available.
describe steps to be tak-en to obtain necessary data
1I D la Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
Major adverse environmental impacts from these run-of-river hydro projects are not anticipated An
environmental impact assessment (EIA) will be done for each site to determine what aspects of the
operation may require greater attention or monitoring and what additional actions may need to be taken to
ensure sustainability at the watershed scale.
IL.D lb Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component
None expected
ll.D Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
None expected
Il.D 2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
Il.D 3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The ElAs will touch on a range of issues, including water flows and balances, watershed-level
sustainability, archaeological chance find procedures, possible resettlement, natural habitats and attention
to the welfare of downstream water users as well as terrestrial and aquatic fauna dnd flora It will conclude
with a detailed Environmental Management Plan including schedule of activities (tailored to project
construction and operation schedules), institutional responsibilities, and budget All construction-related
impacts and mitigation measures (including archaeological chance find procedures) will be included in an
environmental manual for contractors which will be part of bidding and construction contracts
11 D 4 Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
People in the project areas will be apprised of and consulted on the findings of the EIAs Additionally, the
World Bank Infoshop and project sponsor will have copies of the EAs available upon request
E. Safeguards Classification (select one) Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply
[ ] SI - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[ x ] S2 - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[] S3 - No safeguard issues
[]SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
