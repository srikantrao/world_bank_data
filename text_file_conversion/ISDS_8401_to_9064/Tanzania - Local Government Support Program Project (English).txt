I A 2 Project Objectives (From PDS)
Local authonties in the target group with improved performance and greater accountability in the
areas of planning, financial management and project implementation
I A 3 Project Description (From PDS)
The project comprises three interrelated components
Component 1: Investment in local infrastructure and capacity building This component will provide
non-sectoral conditional grants for investment in  local infrastructure in accordance with local
needs,
Component 2: Community upgrading and institutional strengthening in Dare es Salaam This
component will comprise a community infrastructure and  service delivery upgrading component
targeted to low income unplanned and unserviced residential areas in Dares Salaam It will also support
improvements in local tax and non-tax revenue enhancement, focusing on strengthening data,
administration and collection systems,
Component 3 Capacity building at regional and national level, and supporting programme
management. This component will focus on capacity building in two areas: (a) strengthening of
capacity within PO-RALG and the Regional Secretariats to administer, monitor and support the local
govemment           system, and (b) capacity to implement the LGSP itself
I A 4 Project Location (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
Component I Only those local authorities within the target group that meet certain conditions will
receive funding for investment in sub-projects. The target local authorities of local authorities will
be determined during project preparation, but qualifying local authorities will only be determined by
an annual assessment process after project effectiveness. The particular sub-projects the qualitying

ISDS
local authorities will invest in will be identified through a demand-driven planning process at the
local level It is therefore not possible to indicate, at this stage or before project effectiveness,
which local authorities will receive funding or the nature and location of the sub-projects in which
they will invest
Component 2: This component will support upgrading investments in low-income, unplanned
communities in Dar es Salaam which will be identified at the early stages of the project preparation
process For Phase I of Component 2 the specific nature of the investments in the beneficiary
communities will be determined through a participatory planning process involving the Councils,
the affected communities and other stakeholders during the project preparation process These will
thus be known by project effectiveness For Phase 2, the specific investments will only be
determined after project effectiveness
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments A category B rating is proposed for this project, subject to ASPEN review This results from an
indicative Fl rating for Component I and a B rating for Component 2. Investments carried out under
Component 2 will have some environmental impact mitigated by adequate EMPs
Overall, the project is expected to have a beneficial rather than detrimental social and environmental
impact In fact, given the limited amounts available to local authorities under Component 1, sub-projects
financed under this component are not expected to have significant environmental impacts In the case of
Component 2, construction activities may require environmental mitigation measures (see section D for
further details)

Section 1 - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Pleasefill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
11 D.la Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
Infrastructure investments carried out under the project are likely to have some environmental
impacts



ISDS
Under Component I, local authorities will access modest amounts of capital funding for
expenditure on the development of local infrastructure and services in priority sectors such as
education, health, water, local roads, and on basic urban services, such as refuse removal.
Component 2 will focus mainly on the upgrading of infrastructure and services in low income
unplanned areas of the city Funds may be used to finance investments in the provision of services
including water supply, sanitation, drainage improvements, access roads, solid waste management
and other basic services
In general it is anticipated that the improvements to basic services to be supported by the project are
expected to have beneficial rather than detrimental impacts on the environment However, for both
Components the diverse nature of the investments means that the environmental impacts may vary
Given the limited amounts available to local authorities under Component 1, these sub-projects are
not expected to have significant environmental impacts In the case of Component 2, construction
activities may require environmental mitigation measures In addition, there will be transport of
substantial volumes of materials to and from the construction sites These adverse impacts will be
temporary in nature and largely ILmited to the length of the construction period Longer term
impacts will be dependent on the nature of the specific investments chosen and cannot be
determined at this time
Insofar as resettlement is concemed, it is important again to note that - for both Component I and
Component 2 - the sub-project selection process will be demand-driven and will include a
participatory process involving affected stakeholders, particularly local authonties and
communities. Infrastructure investments may result in some minimal relocation or resettlement.
This will be carried out through a process of community consultation and negotiation that will also
involve project affected families. Mitigation measures will be determined by means of a
resettlement framework and, if iiecessary, resettlement plans will be completed for the investments
after these have been identified.
II D l b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None
11 D Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
TBD
IID 2. In light of I, describe the proposed treatment of altematives (if required)
TBD
1I D 3 Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Both an Environmental Framework and a Resettlement Framework will be developed for Components I
(in its entirety) and Phase 2 of Component 2 during the process of project preparation
In addition, for Phase I of Component 2, where specific investments will be determined during the
process of project preparation, an Environmental Impact Assessment will be conducted, and Community
Environmental Management Plans will be prepared for each specific community. A Resetlement Plan
will also be developed for Phase I of Component 2

All these documents will be finalised and disclosed prior to project appraisal.
Under Component 3, training on environmental screening and mitigation planning and management will
be included in the capacity building programmes financed under the project.
Il.D 4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The primary stakeholders are the local authorities targeted by the project, residents within these
local authority areas, and those communities, in particular, that will directly benefit from investments in
infrastructure and services mad ethorught he project. Secondary stakeholders include line Ministries,
Regional Administration offices, private sector agencies and civil society Selection of the sub-projects
will be participatory and demand-driven
For Component 1, Local Authority Development Plans prepared through a participatory process will
define priorities for investment Compliance with environmental policies and implementation of the
Environmental and Resettlement Frameworks will be a requirement for accessing the grant funds This
will include local public disclosure of the environmental and resettlement frameworks and, on an annual
basis, any environmental and resettlement plans emanating from the implementation of these
frameworks. Affected communities will also be made aware of EMPs and RAPs through the annual
assessment process which local authorities will undergo in order to access CGP funding, the results of
which will be made publicly available at local and national levels
For Component 2, community participation will be part of the project design and communities will
be involved in decision-making through developing Community Upgrading Plans The modalities of the
participatory approach will be defined in a report to be prepared by a consultant during project
preparation NGOs, CBOs and civil society organisations will also participate in the consultations over
investment identification and in facilitiating the preparation and implementation of the sub-projects. The
development of the EIA and Resettlement Plans will form an integral part of the CUP process, and
affected communities and individuals will be directly involved in the formulation of these Given the
importance of the community participation and consultation process, its specific modalities will be the
subject of a study to be conducted by a specialist consultant during project preparation and are not yet
known However, these modalities will be developed on the basis not only that the full details of the EIA
and RAPs will need to be made widely and easily available - particularly to those directly affected by
them - but that affected groups/people should be involved in their development from an early stage
E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP) Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
SI - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts, or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2 - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[  S3 - No safeguard issues
SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues
