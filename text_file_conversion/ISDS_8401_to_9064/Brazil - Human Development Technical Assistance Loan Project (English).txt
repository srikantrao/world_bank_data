B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The development objective of the HD TAL is to assist the government in developing institutional 
capacity to monitor the progress and impact of its social policies, a critical step towards 
institutionalizing performance-based management.  This requires improving accountability and 
governance systems in the social sectors by creating a feedback mechanism under which 
monitoring, evaluation and research programs are used to formulate policies. This objective is a 
deliberate choice among several options, and is the result of identifying the most effective 
medium-term activity for achieving more equitable, efficient and quality social programs. Figure 
1 illustrates the integration between the HD PSRL conceptual framework and the proposed HD 
TAL strategy.

1.  The specific development objectives of the TAL are to: 
 
• 
Enhance monitoring processes and systems, including the systematic collecting 
of thorough data on social indicators, to permit: (i) stronger, more integrated 
and continuous assessment of progress on social programs and policies, and (ii) 
use of performance information in resource allocation decision-making. 
 
• 
Support the development of systematic research and evaluation of the impact of 
health, education and social protection policies and reforms as a means toward 
institutionalizing a results-oriented culture of accountability in public 
organizations responsible for social sector service delivery. 
 
• 
Support the institutional reform agenda as specified by the HD PSRL. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
2.  The proposed project would support both the achievement of the HD PSRL reform objectives 
and the long-term development of institutional capacity, through provision of technical 
assistance, studies, training and equipment, with project costs estimated at US$25 million.  The 
main activities to be financed under the project include three components to monitor and 
evaluate the reforms in education, health and social assistance, in preparation for the subsequent 
stages of the program.   
 
3.  Technical assistance will be provided to the Ministry of Education (US$5.0 million of loan), 
the Ministry of Health (US$5.0 million of loan) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and 
Statistics (US$5.0 million of loan) covering the following areas:  (i) training, (ii) improvements 
in information technology, (iii) specialized consultancies, (iv) legal drafting, (v) diagnostic 
studies, (vi) financing of surveys, and (vii) monitoring activities and impact studies.  These 
figures will be revised as the scope of activities and the related cost estimates are refined during 
the continuation of project preparation.  The following is a description of the main activities 
which are proposed under the above project components.

(a) For the 
Ministry of Education
 technical assistance will be given in the areas of student 
learning assessments and program evaluation (including SAEB, ENEM, 
ENC/PROVÃO); improved targeting mechanisms (for FUNDEF/FUNDEB, Merenda 
Escolar and FIES) and strengthening of a ministry-wide information system to track and 
monitor these and other programs. 
(b) For the 
Ministry of Health
, technical assistance will be directed at introducing 
more equitable resource allocation instruments, more effective provider payment 
mechanisms, results-based management and budgeting tools and policies to further the 
separation of financing and provision of publicly-financed health services.   
(c) For the 
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
, technical assistance will focus on 
enhancing national household surveys (PNAD, PME and POF) so as to provide strategic, 
comprehensive and integrated information for monitoring and evaluating the impact of 
social sector reforms.
