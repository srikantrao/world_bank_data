I.A.2. Project Objectives:
Brazil embarked upon a major power sector reform process in 1995, to
establish a modern, competitive, private sector operated system. Among
the major achievements, 23t of generation assets and 64t of distribution
were privatized, a National System Operator (ONS) assumed responsibility
for central cost-based dispatch for the interconnected system, a Wholesale
Energy Market (MAE) was created, and a new independent Federal Electricity
Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) was established. But after these initial
successes, reforms became increasingly paralyzed due to political
resistance to further unbundling of Government-owned regional utilities
and privatization of its generation spin-offs, as well as lack of overall
coordination. The system remained in the dangerous position of no longer
being centrally planned, but lacking correct incentives for the companies
(both public and private) to operate in an economically efficient and
equitable way. Among other things, adequate incentives were never
established for expansion of thermal generating capacity, to provide
insurance against the risk of water shortages in the overwhelming
hydroelectric generation system.
This lack of insurance became very costly when Brazil was hit in 2001 by
a severe drought, which sharply limited its ability to generate power.
Once the dimensions of the problem became clear to the Government of
Brazil (GOB), it acted rapidly and effectively to minimize the damage
through rationing, and to prepare measures both to reduce the risk of
future shortages and to complete the other reforms aimed at improving
efficiency and expanding coverage. GOB declared a crisis in June 2001,
and introduced rationing of electricity to 80t of the previous year's
May-July consumption levels. It has since drafted a comprehensive set of
proposed reforms, focused on 33 different priority initiatives, which have
been made public and are now being either implemented or discussed in
Brazil.
The Bank is proposing to support this continuing Brazilian power sector
reform effort through a medium-term program of assistance, starting with
this Power Sector Technical Assistance Loan (PSTAL). The PSTAL would be
followed soon by a complementary Power Sector Adjustment Loan (PSECAL),
which has been prepared in tandem with it, to be disbursed once GOB
completes the most urgent reform measures. The PSTAL is being processed
first because it would have to be signed by April 30, 2001, eight months



before the end of the current administration, so that expenditures could
be financed by the loan during year CY 02, while meeting requirements of
the Electoral Law (this deadline would not apply to the PSECAL, because
that does not require any GOB expenditures).
The central objective of the PSTAL is to help ensure the sustainable
implementation of the continuing power sector reform program. The two main
approaches to this are (a) studies to design appropriate measures as well
as develop organizational frameworks and strategic information, and (b)
development of institutional capacity to implement and monitor those
reforms.
The PSTAL would support reforms in five areas: (a) strengthening GOB's
institutional capabilities in policy-making; (b) improving long-term
expansion planning; (c) enhancing the sector's environmental framework and
management capabilities; (d) increasing access and affordability for the
poor; and (e) correcting problems with the dynamics of the wholesale and
retail markets, with a view to expanding competition.
Brazil is at an important crossroad. The energy crisis has produced the
political will to adopt forceful measures to fix the system, and it is
important to move rapidly before that political will dissipates. GOB
remains committed to its original vision of a competitive power sector,
where operating and investment decisions are made by the private sector,
and public oversight is exercised through policy-making and regulation.

The five project components are mutually supportive.    Component 1, for
strengthening MME and CNPE, and improving the regulatory linkages between
agencies and with the states, is central to building the capacity for
implementing the other components. Component 2, for long-term planning,
would reinvigorate an essential activity that was the main casualty of the
first round of reforms. In a hydro dominated system, especially where
much of the power comes from a few rivers, and where there are competing
uses for water, as well as environmental and relocation issues, river
basin inventories need to be comprehensive and kept up to date. Component
3, for environmental management, would benefit from the mainstreaming of
environmental concerns under components 1 and 2, and would be limited to
activities that are more purely environmental. Component 4, on access and
affordability for the poor, would center on development of comprehensive
and consistent strategies for rural electrification and for lifeline
tariffs. Component 5, on the dynamics of the electricity market, would
cover technical issues important for the efficiency of the energy market.
Details on these components are in Annex 2.
The project support would be in two forms. One would be consultant
assistance to help GOB personnel structure the implementation plan, review
organizational strategies and capabilities, and design TORs for both
personnel and for studies that will be needed to carry out the
implementation plan, including support for selecting qualified candidates
to directly staff the programmatic and policy areas. The second type
would be direct support in carrying out complementary studies that are
needed to clarify or evaluate certain issues before proceeding with
implementation. The Bank assistance is not designed to simply perform the
implementation of the revitalization program in lieu of the long-term
qualified personnel that must be acquired by the GOB. At most, short- and
medium-term teams of consultants will be financed in a transition period
for a narrow range of tasks, until GOB has staffed its institutions
appropriately for carrying out its own program. This should be clearly
seen as only a transitory measure, until MME develops the permanent cadre
able to take over fully the responsibilities that formerly rested with
Eletrobras and others.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key
environmental and social characteristics of the area and population likely
to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical
natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project is a technical assistance operation that focuses on regulatory
and institutional reforms, and on strengthening capacity for medium-long
term system planning in the Brazilian power sector. The loan will not be
used for investments or other budget expenditures in the power sector, and
thus will have no direct adverse environmental or social impacts. In
fact, it is expected to have positive environmental impacts, because it
offers the opportunity to address regulatory, institutional and
methodological issues in the areas of environmental and social planning
and licensing, which will affect future investments.
B. Check Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments: The project has no direct or indirect adverse environmental or
social impacts, since it focuses entirely on regulatory and institutional
reforms, and on strengthening planning capacity in the power sector.
Environmental and social planning tools and institutional responsibilities
will be revisited and updated as needed to fit the new, largely private
sector-based model which has been adopted by the Government of Brazil (as
described in greater detail in Section II below).

E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact
in any policy. Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards.
Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
I S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or
significant technical and institutional risks in management of one or more
safeguard areas
I S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are
limited in their impact and are technically and institutionally manageable
[XI S3. - No safeguard issues
I SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds,
community driven development or similar projects which require a safeguard
framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard issues.
