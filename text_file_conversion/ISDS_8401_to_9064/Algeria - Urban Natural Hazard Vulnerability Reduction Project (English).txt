I.A.2. Project Objectives
The main project objective is to contribute to vulnerability reduction and saving of lives and property in
future probable disasters through buildings and corollary infrastructure built to disaster-resistant standards
and rehousing of families located in hazardous. areas, as well as through emergency works on the
concerned watersheds in order to lessen the risk of deadly flash floods. Moreover, the project.will also
contribute to increase readiness to anticipate and intervene in case of a major disaster through the
preparation and maintenance of a monitoring and early warning system.
I. .3. Project Description
The main components of the project are:
(a) Strengthening of the national capacity for disaster nianagement (including both short term
preparedness and response, and the long-term hazard reduction measures); this component will
include a study on monitoring and early warning, as well as capacity strengthening measures
such as training, technical assistance end equipment. Two other outputs of this component will
be an integrated vulnerability reduction study will provide grounds for the design of works to be
performed on the slopes and oueds beds of the Bouzareah massif and a study that will address
in a comprehensive manner the issue of vulnerability in selected sites throughout the territory of
Algiers, and
(b) Reduction of urban.-vulnerability to natural hazards around the Bouzareah Massif in the Wilaya
of Algiers, including housing reconstruction in non-vulnerable areas. Other activities that will
be implemented under that component are:
-   Construction of several retention basins of a 10,000 m3 capacity each
-   Rehabilitation of a drainage collector (Jaubert quarry) over a distance of 1000 meter
-   Flow control works on nine oueds of the area
-   Slope fixation of banks of nine oueds of the area
-   Planting of forest trees and fruit trees in the sub-watersheds on respectively public and
private land
-   Building 5000 housing unit to relocate families presently living in hazardous and
vulnerable areas.
(c) Project management component
I. A. 4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or
sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be implemented in the region of Algiers. Physical works aimed at rehabilitating and
reducing the vulnerability to flash floods will be undertaken in the area of the Bouzareah massif. Five
thousand housing unit will be built in order to relocate families who are presently living in hazardous or
vulnerable areas. There are no.critical natural habitats, nor culturally or socially sensitive areas threatened
by the project.

Comments: The direct environmental impacts of the projects are limited and appropriately addressed in an
Environmental Management Framework in compliance with requirements of O.P. 4.01 as applied in the
case of emergency operations covered by O.P. 8.50 and which allow mitigating measures to be identified
and carried out during project implementation in order not to prevent the effective and timely achievements
of the objectives of this emergency project. The social issues entailed by the project have been covered by
a Resettlement Policy Framework.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If intbrmation is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
11.0D la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The main safeguard issue is the rehousing of 5000 families presently living in vulnerable areas with
respect to natural hazards. From the environmental point of view, the project aims to remove or mitigate the
impacts of a unregulated urban development that magnified the terrible consequence of the flash flood
experienced on the 10th of November 2001 through works to be carried out on the concerned watersheds
such as oued beds and embankments reinforcement, slope stabilization by tree plantations, retention basins
and drainage collectors. The environmental impacts of these works'is expected to be mininal and will be
addressed in detail during the course of the project as a result of the integrated vulnerability reduction
study.
The main social issue is to ensure that eligible residents receive appropriate social housing
compensation, and that the process of relocation maximizes choice and minimizes disruption. The majority
of inhabitants have already applied for social housing, which indicates their willingness to move off site.
The majority will move to available housing nearby, but some will move further.
lID. lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
There is no cumulative impact expected in this project.
II.D. Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipatedfuture activities in the project area
The long term impact of the project is considered to be essentially positive and would lead to a
significantly lower vulnerability of the population and physical assets in the area.
Il.D.2. In light of I, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
1. D. 3. Describe arrangementfor the borrower to address safeguard issues
The borrower has prepared a Resettlement Policy Framework that addresses to the satisfaction of the
Bank the requirements set forth by the Bank's Operational Policy relative to Involuntary Resettlement
(O.P. 4.12). A detailed Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared during the course of the project, its
preparation and implementation will be subjected to a dated covenant in the legal'agreement. This will
ensure, for instance, that no destruction of dwellings will take place until and unless the concerned families
have been resettled as per the RPF and the RAP. The environmental requirements as set forth by the Bank's
operational Policy O.P. 4.01 relative to environmental assessment is satisfied through the preparation of an
environmental management framework (EMF) that has been prepared prior to appraisal and which has been
found satisfactory to the Bank. Moreover, the integrated vulnerability reduction study to be prepared during
project implementation includes provisions for a detailed assessment of the risks entailed by the project and
the corresponding mitigating measures, The EMF details also the procedure to be followed in order to
ensure minimal impacts during the relocation process through a site assessment and mitigating measures
durihg the construction phase .The Inspectorate of Environment will be in charge of overseeing the
implementation of the EMF in its various components.
The loan agreement will refer explicitly to the arrangements agreed upon in the RPF and EMF.
11. D. 4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanismsfor consultation and disclosuire on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are the population of the project-area and in particular the population targeted by
the project. These stakeholders will be consulted according to the procedures agreed upon in the
Resettlement Policy Framework and in the Environmental Management Framework. Other key
stakeholders are the municipalities concerned by the project as well as the Wilaya of Algiers. Disclosure in-
country in a manner acceptable to the Bank and through the Bankc's Infoshop has been agreed upon. The
Government has committed itself to the disclosure of the said documents as mentioned in the aide-memoire
of the pre-appraisal/appraisal mission. The timeliness if the disclosure in-country is only constrained by the
specific situation the country is undergoing, i.e. parliamentary election and tense social climate. The Bank
is considering. that the in-country disclosure condition has been satisfied for the two above mentioned
documents and will make sure that further disclosure for the RPF/RAPs and the EMF/EMPs will be carried
out appropriately by having a dated covenant to that effect in the loan agreement.



E. Safeguiar(ds Classification (select one). Category is deterrnined by the hiehest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of ctiulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[Xl S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas.
It. is considered that this project carries significant institutional risks with regards to its resettlement
component and to the environmental monitoring and supervision that will be carried out by a weak
Inspectorate- of Environment. Thus the project will need close supervision from the Bank as the
Enspectorate of Environment in charge of screening the environmental impacts of the sub-components and
overseeing the implementation of the mitigation measures is a weak institution which will have to undergo
capacity strengthening as part of this project.
S2. -7 One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and instiltutionally manageable
[] S.. - No safeguard issues
I SF - Financial intermediary projects, social developmentfunds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguardframework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
