I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Development Leaming Centre will be located in the vicinity of the Kenya Institute of Administration
(kIA), a public service training institution, in Nairobi, Lower Kabete. KIA was established in 1961 and
owvns 80 acres of land, much of it unutilized. Over 3,000 trees were planted by the institute last year to
create a future recreational park on an idle 3 acre river belt. Facilities developed by KIA include 15
training/seminar rooms (4 blocks), 4 residential hostels (capacity of 200 self contained single rooms),
aclministrative offices, a dining complex, laundry facilities, staff houses, a recreational sports field, and
workshops for carpentry, painting, electrical and plumbing works. KIA is connected to the City Council
water system but maintains its own water reservoir. It also manages its own sewage and waste disposal
system. The Institute receives approximately 2,500 students per year with about 200 in residence at any one
time. Approximately 50 of the 200 members of staff live on campus. There are no squatters in the property.
KIA is located in the suburbs of Nairobi, 13 Kms west of the city centre. The University of Nairobi, Lower
Kabete Campus, neighbours the institute as well as a few public and private organizations, although the area
is largely up-market residential.
The DLC will be located in the active campus ground currently developed with the facilities described
above. The construction (approximately 7 months work) and installation of the Centre is limited to a small
onie-story building, on about 9,000 square feet, with the following features: a video conference room
(30-person capacity), a computer room outfitted for 30 computer stations (hardware, software and
Internet hook-up), a technical and administrative center; and electrical and telephone installalions.
DPM will be responsible for preparation of the architectural designs, the bidding process, and
construction activities (based on the international DLC standards and IDA procedures). DPM will
work closely with the Ministry of Roads and Public Works and the Information Technology
Department in Treasury to ensure the successful delivery of project components 1 and 2
respectively. The Bank, through ISG, will provide the expertise to procure, install, and test the
specialized equipment. No toxic materials will be used during construction or operations. Water,
samitation, and waste management will be jointly handled by DPM, KIA, and the Nairobi City
Council in consultation with the architect and site contractor.
