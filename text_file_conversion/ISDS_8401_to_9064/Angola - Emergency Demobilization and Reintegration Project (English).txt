I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The overall objective of the Program would be to help consolidate peace and foster reconciliation in
Angola and the Great Lakes region The three principal objectives of the Program would be to. l)
demobilize approximately 118,000 ex-combatants from the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and from
UNITA; ii) provide targeted support to facilitate their reintegration into civilian life; and iii) reallocate
Government expenditure from military to social and economic sectors
I.A.3. Project Description:
The Program would contain three main components: (i) demobilization, (ii) reinsertion; and (iii)
reintegration. The objective of the demobilization component would be to reduce the number of FAA
military personnel by approximately 33,000 over a 3-year period and to demobilize an additional estimated
85,000 returning members of the recently disbanded UNITA military forces
The demobilization process would comprise the following steps arrival, identification, pre-demobilization
orientation, severance payment, and transport to the province of choice Ex-combatants to be
demobilized would receive reinsertion assistance in the form of a cash contingency subsidy to sustain
themselves and their families for a limited period immediately following demobilization. This would be
complemented with a basic needs kit
The Program would include efforts to help ex-combatants establish sustainable livelihoods This would be
achieved through (i) targeted reintegration assistance, and (ii) close coordination with related ongoing or
planned reconstruction interventions. Reintegration assistance would be provided in such a way that the
ex-combatants' freedom of choice is maximized and that it is beneficial to the wider community vTargeted
reintegration assistance would comprise a) economic assistance through a wide variety of support,
including. (i) small scale agriculture micro-projects, (ii) skills development and training opportunities, and
(iii) support for short-term employment opportunities linked to on-going community works activities, and b)
social assistance for conflict resolution, counseling, etc

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Program will facilitate the reintegration of ex-combatants in selected areas. The selection of the areas
will be determined on an individual case and in line with the beneficiaries preferences and needs
throughout the entire country.
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The Program is being processed using OP 8 50 (Emergency Recovery Assistance) It is
classified as environmental category B as it includes a micro-project sub-component and it is not expected to
have a significant environmental impact. The phased and widely dispersed reintegration of 125,000 future
ex-combatants into civilian life is expected to be environmentally neutral No major physical works are
envisaged under the Program. Micro-project activities, estimated at $400 per ex- combatant and financed
under the reintegration component, would be screened for environmental impact and monitored in
accordance with Bank procedures.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information ts not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Economic reintegration activities are designed to develop the financial self-sufficiency of an
ex-combatant's household through productive and gainful (self) employment. The Program would provide
economic reintegration assistance through a wide variety of support, including (i) small scale agriculture
micro-projects, (0i) skills development and training opportunities; and (iii) support for short-term
employment opportunities linked to on-going community works activities
Based on experience, it is expected that the majority of ex-combatants would settle in rural areas Access
to land then becomes a critical element for successful economic integration. Government confirmed that
there would be no involuntary resettlement of ex-combatants and that ex-combatants would be allowed to
choose their reintegration destination freely
Ex-combatants' access to land would be facilitated with the same community-based procedures used for
others who need land. Specifically, any Angolan in search of land for housing or agricultural production
would contact the local traditional leadership, who would allot a piece of public land for use if available If

ISDS
no public land were available, the local administration would consult with respective communities to
facilitate the reintegration of ex-combatants
The Program is an Emergency Credit under OP8 50 While no major physical works are anticipated, the
Program recognizes that the potential environmental damage caused by poorly managed micro-projects
could exacerbate a community's problems For instance, small projects applying careless environmental
practices can make a substantial contribution to the slow degradation of environmental resources
Experience shows that unmanaged exploitation of natural resources for income generating activities or
uncontrolled grazing of livestock can destroy topsoil, seeds and vegetation
II.D lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Given the phased and widely dispersed reintegration of 125,000 future ex-combatants into civil life and that
micro project activities are estimated at $400 per ex-combattant, the cumulative impacts would not be
significant.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No long-term impact due to project atctivities is foreseen.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Since no serious negative environmental and social impacts are foreseen, alternative activities to mitigate
them have not been developed Instead the Program design has focused on ensuring that procedures for
the management of future environmental and social impacts are in place and that they are consistent with
national laws and Bank safeguard policies For all community works micro-projects to be supported under
the Program, environmental and social screening procedures will be established based on those already
developed under the Angola Social Action Fund (FAS). For small-scale agricultural activities, a screening
mechanism similar to that developed under the Sierra Leone Community Reintegration and
Reconstruction Project will be developed and applied.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The micro-project sub-component of the Program would build in environmental and social screening
procedures. The are tailored to the small scale micro projects and income-generating activities
Procedures to be followed in the review and approval process will be adapted to the Program and spelled
out in detail in the Implementation Manual The manual includes five categories of criteria used to screen
proposals, one of which concerns environmental and health impacts
Prime contractors who will oversee the review and approval of micro-projects would receive targeted
training to ensure that there is adequate capacity to ensure that negative environmental and social
impacts are identified, assessed and mitigated early on
Certain income-generating activities such as charcoal making will be rejected
Annual Monitoring and Evaluation of a sample of approved sub-projects would be carried out in
accordance with mechanisms descibed in the Implementation Manual These will include screening,
processing and monitoring of environmental and social sustainability, with particular attention to
environmental and social safeguards
Appropriate budgetary provisions for environmental and social management activities will be allocated
based on the Social Action Fund (FAS) experience The proposed arrangements for environmental and
social management of the Program is included as an attachment to the Technical Annex
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Consultation with government officials at provincial level, UN partners, NGOs, ex-combatants,
communities and civil society groups are being undertaken during preparation and will be continued during
implementation to ensure Program effectiveness.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[  SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
