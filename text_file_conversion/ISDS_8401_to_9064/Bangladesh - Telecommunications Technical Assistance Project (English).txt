I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project objective is to improve the performance of Bangladesh's telecommunications sector
through strengthening elements of the policy, institutional, and regulatory framework in order to promote
the competitive provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services. This will be achieved by:
(a) separating the policy and operational roles of the government in the sector by restructuring the
Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) to operate on a commercial basis; (b) strengthening
the policy function of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MOPT); and (c) strengthening the
regulatory capacity of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC). At the end
of the project period, it is envisaged that there will be a clear separation in the operational and policy
roles of the government and that BTRC's capacity to effectively regulate a competitive
to-lecommunications sector would be improved.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project includes two main components, the MOPT and BTRC components: IDA will
finance local and international consultant services, studies and training as well as procurement of
necessary equipment. The project is estimated at $1 1.11 million with proposed IDA financing of $9.12
million. The detailed project cost and IDA financing by components/activities are provided in the table
