I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The proposed project aims to reduce Colombia's vulnerability to natural disasters, measured in terms of
fiscal exposure of the state through components aiming at (i) the adoption of a policy of disaster risk
management, defining the role and responsibilities of the state in relation to natural hazard events; (ii) the
identification and implementation of measures to avoid the creation of new risks; and (iii) the
implementation of retrofitting (strengthening), mitigation and prevention works to reduce existing
vulnerability of vital physical and social infrastructure to natural hazard events; (iv) the implementation of
a strategy of risk retention and risk transfer to cover public sector losses due to natural hazards; (v) the
establishment of similar mechanisms to encourage risk retention and risk transfer in the private sector.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Component A - Policy development and Institutional Strenghtening

Sup-component A.1. ­ Policy Development (US$0.5 million). This component will support the
development of a clear policy framework redefining the role and responsibilities of the state on natural
disaster risk management (i.e. the broad level of risks it is willing/capable to assume). The subcomponent
will finance technical assistance to reformulation of policy development activities, legislation updating and
improvement, and dissemination.

Sub-component A.2. ­ Institutional Strengthening (US$1 million). This sub-component will strengthen the
capacity of the National Calamity Fund (FNC) or another agency identified during project preparation) to
evaluate proposed municipal and sectoral mitigation plans and to supervise their implementation. The
component will finance technical assistance required to transform the FNC into a channel for mitigation
and risk reduction (prevention/mitigation) funding and also as a possible channel for reconstruction
funding.

Component B ­ Risk Reduction

Sub-component B.1. ­ Territorial planning and information system (US$3.0 million). This sub-component
aims to improve the present practices of territorial planning by including better risk assessments and risk
analysis in all municipalities and by developing risk mitigation plans for priority municipalities. It will
finance:
(i)      the development and promulgation of methodologies for risk analysis and assessment for the
inclusion in municipal and regional development plans (PDMs and POTs);

                                                                                                             ISDS


(ii)    the development of municipal and sectoral risk mitigation plans in up to fifteen selected
municipalities and up to five vital social sectors for implementation under component C.2.;
(iii)   the carrying out of hazard microzonation studies and vulnerability and risk mapping in selected
municipalities;
(iv)    the development of a comprehensive information system on disaster risk and best practices to
include information collected in (i), (ii) and (iii) inter-alia. The system will be GIS based and will be
available on the Internet.

Sub-component B.2. ­ Mitigation and Disaster Risk Prevention (US$198.5 million).
This component will provide complementary financing to ministries and up to 15 municipalities is
several phases (see selection criteria bellow) to carry out approved risk mitigation plans. These
plans would include
-       retrofitting key public buildings such as schools and hospitals;
-       installation of infrastructure for alternative use of high risk areas (parks, sports track, etc.);
-       planting of native species to control landslides, erosion;
-       construction or repair of water drainage in areas subject to erosion and/or to flooding;
-       construction or repair of slope stabilization measures;
-       construction or repair of river bank protection;
-       construction of protective works for and retrofitting of key bridges and cross walks;
-       reinforcing of vital infrastructure (roads, water supply and energy systems);
-       resettlement of population living in high risk area.

Component C ­ Risk Transfer

Sub-component C.1. ­ Risk Transfer and Coverage of Public Sector Assets (US$15.0 million). This
sub-component will support the Government in defining a risk transfer strategy, which improves and
optimizes the insurance coverage of public assets. The strategy will be specifically geared to public assets
and rely upon the risk identification, risk diversification and economies of scale that exist at the level of the
state.

This component will finance two major activities: (i) technical assistance implement an insurance program
for public assets, including the creation of a reserve pool and reinsurance; and (ii) the creation of a facility
to ensure the financial solvency of the reserve pool during the first four years of operation (e.g. initial
capitalization, upper layer coverage, and/or reinsurance coverage).

Sub-component C.2. ­ Risk Transfer and Coverage of the Private Sector (US$15.0 million). This
sub-component will support the Government in devising a risk transfer strategy to expand and improve the
insurance coverage of private assets, in particular in the housing sector (and with a particular focus on
low-income housing). The strategy will create insurance mechanisms, which will make coverage available
to homeowners, through the municipal property tax.

This component will finance two major activities: (i) technical assistance to implement the insurance
program targeted at municipalities, including the creation of a reserve pool; and (ii) the creation of a facility
to ensure the financial solvency of the reserve pool during the first four years of operation (e.g. initial
capitalization, upper layer coverage, and/or reinsurance coverage).

Sub-component C.3. ­Coverage of Residual Risk (US$ 15.0 million). Despite clear risk reduction and risk
transfer strategies, some risk cannot be eliminated or transferred, resulting in a degree of risk remaining
with the state. This sub-component will finance technical assistance to design and implement a strategy to
cover those risks, including the preparation of parametric contracts and/or contingent credit facilities.

Component D ­ Project Management - (US$ 0.5 million). This component will partially finance
costs of Project Management for project implementation.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
     As the exact works to be implemented during the project will only be known in the course of
     implementation, preparation will include an Environmental Assessment Framework that
     identifies key elements that must be evaluated and considered during project selection and
     design to achieve environmentally sound practices and ensure compliance with the Bank's
     safeguard policies (particularly OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), and OP 11.03 (Cultural
     Property)). The EAF report will consist of the following sections:
(1) Project typology of the disaster vulnerability reduction measures to be financed by the project,
along with descriptions of the generic potential environmental impacts and benefits associated
with each type of measure.
(2) Screening procedures for: (a) determining if project sites are appropriate; (b) identifying
environmental issues that require special attention in project design (in accordance with the
Bank's environmental and social safeguard policies); and (c) determining whether additional
environmental assessment work is needed. The procedures will consider the project's type,
location, scale, as well as the nature and magnitude of its potential impacts, and will include
criteria for identifying areas of high cultural, historic, or architectural importance.
(3) Environmental management procedures describing the specific mitigation measures and
practices to be followed in order to comply with Colombian legislation and Bank safeguard
policies. The procedures will include "chance finding procedures" to be included in construction
contracts.
(4) Institutional arrangements identifying the local or regional environmental authorities that will
be involved in the environmental management aspects of the project, as well as their budget needs
and reporting requirements.

     OP. 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement: The resettlement of communities in areas at a clear
     high-risk to natural disasters is contemplated. The first phase of the project will be carried
     out in Bogotá and Manizales. Bogotá has a Resettlement Framework for populations living
     in high risk areas. This Framework was prepared under the Bogotá Urban Services Project,
     and was approved by the Bank on March 13, 2003, and therefore, this Framework will be
     applied for the resettlement during implementation of the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction
     Project. Resettlement is not foreseen in Manizales.

     Additionally, the project is supporting the preparation of a National Resettlement Policy,
     which will apply to the municipalities that are included in the following phases of the project.
     This Policy will be prepared during the preparation and the first phase of the project and will
     be reviewed and approved by the Bank for the second phase of the project.

Through experience acquired in the implementation of past and on-going operations, DNP is well
aware of the Bank's social and environmental policies and is strengthening its staff resources and
procedures to evaluate environmental risks linked to sub-projects. DNP has taken the lead in
coordinating the preparation of both the Environmental Assessment Framework and the
Resettlement Framework. During the preparation of the project the institutional arrangements will
be defined.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
     The Environmental and Resettlement Frameworks will include procedures for the
     consultation of affected and beneficiary population. The draft of the frameworks will be
     subject to consultation and review and will incorporate comments and proposals in the final
     version.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
