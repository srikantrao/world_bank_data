Project Objectives

The proposed Social Protection Technical Assistance Loans will support the Government's efforts to
implement Chile Solidarioand to lay the base for a national system of social protection.

The loan would support government actions in four key areas: (i) reforms to Chile's poverty reduction and
social protection policies targeted to the poorest households (Chile Solidario); (ii) integration of data bases
and service provision, as well as improvements to key information systems, including the country's
primary tool to target the poor, the Ficha CAS; (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation of social
programs and policies, including a greater role for civil society in conducting participatory evaluations; and
(iv) expanding the roles of municipal authorities and civil society in implementing social policy.



Project Description

The most recent CAS for Chile (January 23, 2002) sets out 3 broad goals: (i) sustaining economic growth
and social policy; (2) heightening inclusion, especially of rural populations and vulnerable groups; and
(3)modernizing the state as the underpinning for the two previous objectives.              The proposed technical loan
responds directly to these 3 objectives. It would support Chile's reform of social policy, directed to the
poorest households (disproportionately located in rural areas and encompassing vulnerable groups, such as
the indigenous), and incorporating initiatives to modernize the state in order to facilitate this reform,
specifically by expanding the role for civil society and better managing information.



Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics ofthe
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

E. Safeguards Classiflcation (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[ X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
  IS3. - No safeguard issues
[S] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
