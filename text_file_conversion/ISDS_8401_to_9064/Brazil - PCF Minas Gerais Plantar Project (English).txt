Project Objectives (From PDS)
The development objective of the PLANTAR project is to contribute to carbon dioxide
emissions reduction, through the replacement of fossil fuel (coal/coke), by renewable
energy (charcoal from sustainably managed biomass plantation)and to contribute to the
sustainable development of the pig iron sector.
Project Description (From PDS)
Plantar, S.A. - Planejamento, Tecnica e Adminstracao de Reflorestamentos (Sponsor) is
a family owned company based in Minas Gerais, Brazil, with over 4500 employees.
Carbon revenues from the sale of Certificates of Emission Reductions (CER) are
expected to promote and maintain project feasibility and guarantee that the project will be
self-sustainable after the end of the project cycle. The Plantar project will address
following Greenhouse Gas Reduction: (i) by replacing coke by sustainably produced
charcoal for the pig-iron production (C02, N20), (ii) by eliminating methane in the
carbonization process, and (iii) by reestablishment of native forests around and within the
plantation area (C02). The Project lifetime is 28 years and effective Emission
Reductions (ERs) will be monitored by external consultants.
Project Location: (Geographic location, infonnation about the key environmental and
social characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to
any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially
sensitive areas.)
Municipalities of Felixlandia and Curvelo in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil.
The environmental characteristic of this area is a typical rural production area in the
cerrado region of Brazil, dominating economic activity is cattle ranching and mining.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Plantations are located on former planted pasture land, no land use changes identified on
already identified land. Further land to be used for sustainable plantations will only be
implemented on former planted pasture land.
Parts of the forests are certified under the FSC criteria, rest of the forests will be certified
before every plantation. Annual Emission Reduction payments are conditioned to the
existence of FSC certification
Pest Management is following strict rules of FSC criteria and will continue to not use
POPs or pesticides that are in classes IA and I B.Plantar is currently conducting research
on improvements on optimal pesticide uses and results will be integrated into Plantar's
company policy.
Current charcoal use still partly coming from native resources, sources have been verified
and considered legal. Nevertheless, PCF is not involved in carbon credit purchase until
Plantar is self sufficient in charcoal supply from own monitored resources.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Describe any potential cumulative or long term impacts.
none
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Biodiversity: PCF developed a proactive program to increase and measure biodiversity
improvements by building up corridors.
Foresees environmental investments in pig-iron industry (filters, cogeneration)and the
implementation of ISO 14000 procedures.
Established timetable for FSC certification for all plantation areas (2002)
Investment in improvement of carbonization process in order to eliminate GHG and other
negative impacts on Climate Change and workers' health.
Environmental education of workers and neighbors.
Social assessment process concluded (no-objection given by all contacted institutions)
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
PCF financing is based on improvement of processes in order to reduce GHG
(quantitative) and biodiversity/social impacts (qualitative).
- Replacement of coke by sustainable produced charcoal
- improvement of biodiversity
- improvement of worker's health
- improvement of carbonization process and reduction of emissions
- improvement of industry standards (filters, cogeneration, ISO 14000)
- expansion of FSC certified area



5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Municipalities (Curvelo, Felixlandia, Itacambira)
NGOs (Friends of the Earth, Amdar, WWF)
local agriculture school
State Forest Institute
FSC project was explained and possible impacts declared, stakeholders were asked
for opinion, suggestions, recommendations, objections.
No objections have been given by all stakeholders.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and
institutional risks in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ x] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their
impact and are technically and institutionally manageable
[I S3. - No safeguard issues
[]SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven
development or similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic
approach to address safeguard issues.
