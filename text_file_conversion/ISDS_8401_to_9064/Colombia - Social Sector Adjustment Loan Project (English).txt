E%tensile consultations were held supporting the preparation of the Social Sector Adjustment Loan,
as described below, but none related to safeguard issues per se, since none are triggered. The
consultations undertaken and planned during preparation include:
*   Fieldwork for the "Social Dimensions of the Economic Crisis" study carried out as part of World
Bank Social Safety Net Assessment sector work on that included: focus group and structured
interviews with groups in rural and urban areas affected by the recent recession (internally
displaced populations, micro-entrepreneurs, construction workers, day laborers, and middle-
income debtors caught by rising mortgage rates) regarding their perceptions of vulnerability, use
of social risk management and recommendations for social sector reform.
*   Consultations with presidential candidates and their policy advisers. In preparing for the 2002
elections and presidential transition, consultations on the policy initiatives tn the proposed
SECAL were held in January 2002 with advisers to one of the main presidential candidates.
These consultations will be continued during the course of the presidential campaign with other
candidates and their staff.
*   A senes of workshops in three ciues (Bogota, Cali and Medellfn) in April 2002 to hold broad
consultations on social sector policy using the results of the 2002 Poverty Assessment and 2002
Social Safety Net Assessment analytical work. These workshops will include off-the-record
discussions of social sector policy and involve academucs, govcrnment policyinakers at the
national and local levels, civil society leaders and staff from bilateral and multilateral
development institutions.
In addition, the LAC Quality Assurance Team's recommendation to include a strategy to target
indigenous peoples and the Afro-Colombian population within the proposed social nsk management
system and stabilization fund, will be discussed with the Government.
