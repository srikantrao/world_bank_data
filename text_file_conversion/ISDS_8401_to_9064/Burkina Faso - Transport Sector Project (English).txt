I.A.2. Project Objectives:
To reach these global objectives, the development objectives of the TSP are:
(i)    Decrease of social, economic and financial transport costs to final users;
(ii)   Increase of MITH sectoral management capacity;
(iii)  Sustainable improved mobility for rural population;
(iv)   Improved road network conditions through a Steady (routine and periodic) maintenance of the
classified road network.
I.A.3. Project Description:
To reach its objectives, the TSP will include two components:
Component A. Institutional Support and Sectoral Reforms.
This component will strengthen planning, management and monitoring capacities of transport sector
related institutions.
The MITH will be supported in its reorganization; its financial management and procurement capacity
will be improved with new tools and procedures; monitoring tools and analytical capacities will be
developed.
Private haulers and their representative organizations will be promoted and supported through training

and technical assistance. They will receive a special assistance to profit from the newly developed
guaranty systems at the UEMOA level.
The coordination between the public services and the private sector will be reinforced to allow for better
sector management through a more participatory approach.
The sectoral regulatory framework will be streamlined and enforce while abusive road control and
corruption will be firmly reduced.
A new national road safety policy will be spell out and implemented.
A transport specific HIV/AIDS program will also be designed to be implemented within the MAP.
The National Rural Transport Strategy will be implemented and the MITH relevant units will be
organized accordingly.
Component B: Road Network Improvement
This component will preserve and improve the national road network. A special emphasis will be put on
periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of unpaved roads ranging from national roads to local
government capital access roadsfchef-lieux de dcpartements) It will act in concert with other donors
financing the PIP and will respect the agreed investment priorities. IDA will only support unfunded PIP
projects or will finance specific CSLP programs and policies. It is forecasted that around 5000 km of
earth and gravel roads should receive some works during the project of which 1700 will receive periodic
maintenance, 1550 km of main roads and 1750 km of local roads will be rehabilitated. All the works will
be designed in a minimal way in order to limit its costs.
Components:
A: Institutional Support and Sectoral Reforms
B: Road Network Improvement
Project Coordination Unit
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or-any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be national since it will complete the rehabilitation of the national road network on the
whole territory. It will also invest in the upgrading/rehabilitation of rural roads, expecially the departements'
capital cities. Burkina Faso has several national natural parks with wildife. Some of those are likely to
benefit from the TSP investments.
B. Check Environmental Classification: A (Full Assessment)
Comments:
The TSP will not create any new roaa, limiting itself to the periodic maintenance or rehabilitation of existing
transport infrastructure. This approach will be reinforced by the discrepancy between the size of the road

network requiring some works and available funds. This will result in minimum interventions on structures,
often limited to spot improvements rather than full-length treatments. This will be especially true for rural
roads where traffic is so low that investments will be restricted to minimum structures with no or limited
impact on the environment. In some cases, small spot-improving structures will have a beneficial impact
since for them to last over time they will be designed in such a way to control erosion thus benefiting to the
local environment.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No significant negative impact is expected from the project. However, because of the size and the scope of
the project and the investments it will finance, a sectoral EA will be prepared, cleared and disclosed
according to Bank's Safeguard Policies and national environmental regulations prior to project appraisal.
Road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance could have potential negative impacts to: soil, water, air
quality, flora and fauna as well as to the socioeconomic environment (economic activity, land acquisition,
cultural heritage, aethetic and landscapes, noise and human health and safety).This EA will assess both
environmental and social impacts in all their respective dimensions. Those will specifically include
resettlements issues that may occur because of road works. Only very localized (and temporary) move of
vendors and road stalls are deemed to have some low probability given that the project will not finance
the construction of any new road. Possible consequences of road improvement on wild flora and fauna
will aslo be studied given the possibility that some roads may lead to national parks.
This EA will suggest relevant mitigations measures as well as monitoring systems.
Il.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No cumulative negative impact is expected from the project. Yet the EA will also address those possible
impacts.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No long term negative impact is expected from the project. Yet the EA will also address those possible
impacts.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
To be assessed within each individual EA to be prepared for each road segment financed.
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
A sectoral EA will be prepared, cleared and disclosed according to Bank's Safeguard Policies and
national environmental regulations prior to project appraisal. This sectoral EA will assess both
environmental and social impacts in all their respective dimensions. Those will specifically include
resettlement issues that may occur because of road works. Only very localized (and temporary) move of
vendors and road stalls are deemed to have some low probability given that the project will not finance
the construction of any new road. Possible consequences of road improvement on wild flora and fauna
will aslo be studied given the possibility that some roads may lead to national parks. The sectoral EA
will suggest relevant mitigations measures as well as monitoring systems.
The sectoral EA will also determine how environmental and social issues will be managed. The sectoral
EA will make recommendations for an environmental unit to be created within the MITH to be in charge
of monitoring environmental and social issues in the transport sector. It may specifically be in charge of
monitoring the implementation of the EMP thus defined. This unit will be in charge of preparing and
implementing a Resettlement Policy Framework.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The EA final report will be disclosed through the GoBF's official gazette and will be made available for
consultation at the TSP coordination office. Furthermore, it will be made available to the public through
the GoBF official website (www.primature.gov.bf) as well as CD-ROMs. In order to maximize the public
awareness of this EA, the availability of its report will be advertize in the main national newspapers. The
conclusions of the EA will also be presented to identified stakeholders during a national seminar.
The design of the National Rural Transport Strategy will be highly participatory. During the project
preparation phase, several regional workshops and a national workshop will be carried out. These will be
designed to ensure the full participation of the primary beneficiaries in the final design of the program.
The workshops will include members of the farmer groups and other stakeholders from both the food
deficit and high potential areas, and will include vulnerable groups such as women.
Other key stakeholders include: (i) Ministries of Agriculture and Livestock, Hydraulics, Public Works,
Planning, Finance, Decentralization, Health and Social and Women's affairs; (ii) future decentralized
entities, such as Provinces, Communes, Comite' (Inter-) villageois de Gestion de Terroir, and prefectural
development committees; (iii) local administrative units, such as the prefectures; (iv) NGOs, and other
non-profit service providers; (iv) SMEs and local engineering consulting firms; (v) economic agents,
such as rural credit, agricultural input suppliers, spare parts dealers, authorized repair agents, and
transporters. All these groups will be consulted during the preparation phase and will be represented at
the regional and national workshops.
Regarding the transport sector management, the objective is to increase the participation of the private
sector in the planning process. The TSP will support the creation of coordination committees that will
include both private and public organization representatives.
Findings for the sectoral EA will be presented at validation workshop with relevant stakeholders.
