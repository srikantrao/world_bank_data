I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The Project Development Objective is to improve school readiness of preschool children (4-5 year olds), especially
those from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds through (a) increased access to early childhood education
programs, (b) improved quality of ECE programs, and (c) enhanced central and local capacity to implement Early
Childhood Education (ECE) programs.


I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The proposed project aims to achieve its development objectives noted above through the following three
components: (a) Access; (b) Quality; and (c) Capacity Building.

Access Component. This component would increase public ECE programs to about 1.Xmillion children in
disadvantaged areas through a targeted and phased construction program over 5 years. The ECE programs would
include classes for 4 and 5 year olds, mostly attached to the Education Enhancement Project schools, or other basic
education schools in disadvantaged areas where poverty rates are high, enrollment in ECE is low, and population
size is large. This would not only provide a strong incentive for the graduates of these programs entry into grade 1
but would also improve/ enhance the efficiency of the basic schools (through less repetition and dropouts). It is
proposed that expansion efforts be thoroughly planned in a phased approach, with sequencing of different phases
according to the availability of teachers, scheduling of training, and levels of community mobilization.

The component would also provide support to the GOE in enacting policies that would encourage private sector
expansion, including those by NGOs and non-profit groups. A survey of the issues faced by private and non-profit
ECE programs is planned as part of project preparation.

The project will address specific institutional implications of transforming MISA nurseries (with 4 and 5 year olds in
disadvantaged areas) into formal KGs that meet standards set by the MOE. The MOE will collaborate with MISA to
develop a plan that could include rehabilitation and refurbishments of their nurseries, provision of educational
materials, teacher training and supervision by the MOE.

In addition to the expansion of programs, the component would also address the demand side issues for families in
disadvantaged areas. Subsidies and scholarships for disadvantaged children would be provided using the community
targeting approach already successfully tried and tested under the EEP. In urban areas, slum children will be
targeted (Scholarships; TA and Training).

Quality Component. This component would provide phased teacher training programs and supervision to new and
current ECE teachers. A coherent, comprehensive teacher training strategy will ensure a higher quality of teacher
preparation and on-going support to ECE programs. In-service training for KG teachers lacking qualifications would

                                                            2
                                                                                                                   ISDS



be incorporated within the program for primary teachers, along with the Newly Appointed Teacher program. The
coherence and relevance of pre-service training will be improved. Special training courses and supportive
supervision for former administrators and teachers of upper grades who are reassigned to KG teaching positions will
be improved. Redeployment of teachers (instead of new hiring) is expected to help address the inefficiency issue
mentioned above.

The component would improve and standarize ECE curriculum and learning materials to make them more
child-centered, interactive, and able to include disabled children. The curriculum will also include health and
nutrition life skills. It would also include developmentally appropriate pre-technology curriculum that promotes a set
of skills to prepare children for technology use at the school level.

The component would include health and nutrition services for greater effectiveness of ECE services. MOE would
partner with MOH to develop a national strategy for health and nutrition services for preschool children. The
MOE/MOH partnership would define necessary services for particular regions, design delivery, and clarify
responsibility for carrying out necessary tasks.

Capacity Building Component. This component would provide knowledge and information on the benefits of and
approaches used in ECE programs for parents and families through campaigns and local training programs.
Awareness campaigns would be tailored to specific populations and would operate through mechanisms already
successfully established by the EEP. Mass media channels for communication on early childhood education and
related health and nutrition messages would also be explored.

The component would link efforts to expand KG directly with parent participation in literacy programs and to enable
parents to encourage reading to their children, and to specifically convey messages concerning different aspects of
ECE.

The component would also provide capacity building for the relevant staff of the Ministry of Education. Required
organizational reforms within the MOE will be supported to effectively administer ECE programs.

A strong monitoring and evaluation sub-component will be prepared. Specific capacity will be strengthened at the
Governorate and Central levels in data collection at various stages of the project cycle, data analysis, monitoring
project progress, and impact evaluation; as well as ongoing learning from existing programs.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
N/A

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
N/A

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
N/A

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Any environmental issues will be reflected in the Government's Construction Manual and bidding documents, for
which the World Bank can assist by providing examples of matrixes for small infrastructure construction. The
World Bank Task Team will develop a (simple) matrix that reflects possible environmental concerns (related to
safety, disposal of debris, drainage and increasing sanitation services and waste management, etc.) and will ensure
that all schools where classrooms will be built will have existing waste and sanitation systems. Social Assessments
will be carried out and will look at the issues of constraints faced by women for sending children to ECE programs,
the possiblility of using female teachers in rural areas and the types of incentives required for behavioral/attitudinal
changes, and community inputs in efficient approaches for implementation, monitoring and evaluation of project
impact.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project design will emphasize the need to involve local stakeholders (including teachers, parents, and children)
to identify needs and priorities and assist in project implementation and monitoring. A capacity building component
of the project will provide information about the project to parents and families through a series of awareness
campaigns on the importance of ECE, and project design will include community/parental involvement during
implementation.
