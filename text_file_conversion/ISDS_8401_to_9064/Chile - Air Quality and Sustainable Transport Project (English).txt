LENDING INSTRUMENTS. Grant                STATUS: Lending
PrOjecL Objectives (From PDS) :
1.1. To help reduce greenhouse gases from ground transport in Santiago through a promotion of
a long-term modal shift to more efficient and less polluting forms of transport. To that end, the
project will support the implementation of the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan for Santiago,
which is consistent with the overall objectives of the GEF operational program on sustainable
transport.
1.2. The transport sector contributes to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the form of
'C02, CH4, N20; also to the epnission of air pollutants like SOx, CO, PM and NOx, which
together with VOCs contribute to the formation of smog or tropospheric ozone (03). As carbon
,dioxide emissions arc directly associated with fossil-fuel use in transport, air pollution will also
be addressed with the implementation of this project.



Project Description (From PDS)
The project components are:
I   Promotion of bicycle use
The objective of this pilot program is to promote the use of bicycles as a mode of transport and aims at
diverting travelers from motorized modes, especially private cars. The project will include the construction
of 19 km of GEF-funded bikeways. A safety strategy to mniniize bicycle accidents and to maximnize
personal secunty, and a promotion strategy to promote de use of Bicycle use in Santiago
2      Modernizing the bus system
2.1. Technical assistance for evaluating the economic and environmental impact of clean technologies
for buses
This component will provide technical assistance to compare environmental performance and associated
costs of hybrid-electric buses with CNG and diesel ones. The tests will be developed usmg Heavy Duty
Dynamometer located in Santiago. Also the buses operating conditions and performance will be monitored
throughout a full year.
2.2. Implementation Frameworkfor Bus Reform
The project will provide technical assistance to develop a 30 km of segregate bus corridors, it wil review
the management and business organization measures that are required to effectively operate the new
corridor infrastructure, business organization, the concessions for specific bus line operations and the
structurung of integrated fares.
2.3 Renewal of the bus fleet in the regions
This component will finance a strategic study to define ways of synchronizing and coordinating the'
removal of these "not-so-old" buses from the streets of Santiago, with the renewal of concessions in
regional cities
3      Applying land-use incentives to reduce motorized travel
3.1 Developing the Central Ring of Santiago (Anillo Central)
This component will finance additional studies to calculate the impacts of urban development policies
aiming at spurring the development of housing projects located on the Anillo Central. Also the
development of financial incentives required to make this re-population happen and will eventually finance
the development plan of one or two of the most promising locations from a GHG  Imission reductioij
perspective. Also it will finance studies to identify new sites to extend the urban renewal program, and
look for the feasibility of developing one of the already identified sub-centers close to ihe historic center
An infotmation campaign will also be part of the studies.
3.2 School Location
The GEF grant would contribute to studies and fund high-level expertise to help in defining a sound landl
use and school relocation strategy, including an assessment of their economic effects and financial
implications
3.3 hIousing Policy
The GEF support would focus its intervention through an analysis of the consistency and compatibility of
the various sector policies that affect land-use and transport, namely the policies designed by the Ministnes
of Housing, Economy and Transport regarding land-use, social housing, transport infrastructure investment
plans, air pollution, etc.
3.4    City Center Revitalization



Project Location:
This project is located in Santiago and its Metropolitan Region, Chule and will have impact in the entire
region. However, most of the components will be implemented in the central area of the city. The 19 Km of
Bikeways wlll be build in the Comunas of Santiago, Providencia y Nunoa. The areas where the bikeways
will be build are areas where there have been previous development. These areas will become segregate
from streets and walkways. Also there will no be any human resettling activities, nor construction on green
areas.
B. Check Environmental Classification A [ ], B [ ], C [X], FI [ ], TBD []
Comments:
The project will involve relatively minor works to insert 19 Km of bikeways into existing streets, and thus
no settlements will be affected Nonetheless, the construction will follow the environmnental guidelines
fromn CONAMA RM, to ensure that materials, noise, and traffic flow get well managed. The bikeway
designs will be subject to an independent safety audit, and the constructuon contract will involve an
environmental assessment and management plan. As to the rest of the project, there will !be environmental
benefits. To mitigate these impacts, the project will follow environmental guidelines for construction
prepared by local environmental authority. The field test will take place on operating routes. The rest will
be studies with indirect benefits in the future.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available, describc
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
On the establishment of 19 Km of Bikeways, there will be construction works associated to this
component. On this regards an environmental management plan and its implementation guidelines will be I
designed to meet the requirements of the project.
2. Identify and describe an! poteniiil large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Descnbe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
Long term impacts of the project will be positive, due to the reduction of global and local emissions, as
C02, Particles, Nox, SOx and other contaminants currently present in Santiago's Metropolitan Area. The
rcdueition will be directly linked to the reduction of the length of trips per person per day and the change of
mode of transportation.
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
On the analysis of the construction of Bikeways there are not alternative to the current design.
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
There ate provision from the executing agency to manage and supervise the environmental management
Plion ilie construction of Bikeways. Also CONAMA RM will be involved in supervise the development
of this component                                                           I
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanmsms for consultation and discldsure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are The executive Commission for Transportation in Santiago, SECTRA, CONAMA,
NGO's ( Ciudad Viva, Ciclistas Furlosos, others). From the preparation phase, stake4ulders have been
consulted, and SECTRA's website has been used as a channel for consultation. Also, as part of the
preparitlon activities, there has been a workshop for discussing the project components and consultants
approuch with the different stakeholders.
