Project Objectives (From PDS)
The main objective of the project is to help consolidate Colombia's national capacity for the
implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
Specifically, the project will develop national capacities in blosafety required to: (i) strengthen the
legislative framework and operational mechanisms for biosafety management in Colombia; (ii) buld
capacity and establish an operational system for nsk assessment and monitoring; (iii) establish the biosafety
database system and Biosafety Clearnghouse Mechanism; (iv) support centers of excellence and a network
for research, risk assessment, and monitoring; and (v) establish the Project Coordmating Unit (PCU).



Project Descnption (From PDS)
In order to achieve the above objectives the project will implement the following components:
1. Strengthening the legislative framework and operational mechanisms for Biosafety
management in Colombia
With Colombia's ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety through Law 740 in May 2002, it
became imperative for the country to adopt a national legislative framework which regulates and
harmonuzes activities related to LMOs across different sectors and organizations. Co-financing resources
would be used to carry out an in-depth evaluation of Colombia's current legal framework in the context of
the Cartagena Protocol and make recommendations for a National Biosafety legislative and policy
framework for the protection of human, animal and plant health, the environment and the socio-econolmc
well-being of the population.
2. Capacity building and establishing an operational system for risk assessment and
monitoring
Training is crucial part of the project. Along with the development of the regulatory system, experts will be
trained to enforce the law and the provisions of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The following
traimng activities are planned
a. Two trairung courses for 60 trainers from the Ministnes of Agnculture and Rural Development,
Health, Environment, International Trade, policy makers, NGOs, media, consumer and producer
groups. This course will specifically focus on contained, deliberate release and commercial use of
LMOs.
b. A workshop for 60 representatives of government, media, NGOs, consumer groups and scientific
commumty on socio-economic and legal aspects related to LMOs. Special attention will be given to
socio-economic impacts, trans-boundary movement of LMOs, and the Cartagena Protocol.
c. Five courses of three-to-twelve-day each for a total of 115 representatives of government dealing
with risk assessment, risk management, and research, and selected scientists from the centers of
excellence network (Component 4). These courses will be of higher knowledge level and technical
specialisanon on interdisciplnary biosafety issues, including general technical background for
LMO nsk assessment and management, LMOs under agriculture settings, and LMOs interactions
with the environment and health. The two model crops (proposed for research in Component 4) will
be used as case studies for discussion of ex-ante biosafety strategies.
d. Besides these training courses and workshops, 10 short term (3-month each) and 6 long term (6-
month each) visiting scientists exchanges will be conducted to allow more specialised training of
selected technical personnel engaged on risk assessment, risk management, and research. At least
four short term and two long term (about 38%) of these visiting scientist exchanges will be used to
strength collaboration between parties involved in the research proposals on potato and rice
described in Component 4.
Under project activities, a project mailing list will be developed in order to enhance the rapid exchange of
information between participating parties in order to provide regular updates on significant developments in
Biosafety and to facihtate the timely provision of specific information upon request. The data will be
presented in a user-friendly way.
The infonnation network and special workshops are aimed to improve the public perception and
participation in the process of implementing the National Biosafety Framework (NBF) and the use of
LMOs. Media and NGOs working on these issues, will be granted access to the information network. This
will ensure the dehvery of current and relevant information on Biosafety and related legislation issues.
3. Establishing the biosafety database system and Biosafety Clearing-House Mechanism in
Colombia
An mformation database and network will be set up and contain registers, dossiers, trial data and other
related information required by the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The database will be accessible by all

Section I[ - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill maaU relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtam necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
The potential contribution of biotechnology to sustainable agriculture is expected to be high, but the
introduction of transgenic varieties in tropical ecosystems deserves careful oversight and monitonng This
issue is of particular importance in the Andean region due to its high level of genetic diversity for a large
number of species that are mentoned above and the concern over the likelihood of genes spreading from
transgenic crops to wild relatives and the potential impacts on crop genetic diversity. Risk assessment
related to the natural environrnent is a necessary element of any biosafety program and is a key element of
the proposed GEF/GOC project.
The project will provide resources for updating and upgrading laboratory equipment. The actual laboratory
tests are not expected to produce any hazardous materials However, the project operations manual will set
m place procedures for deahng with any waste products produced during testing and risk assessment.
In the case that there are small construction activities, QAT's Environmental Guidelines for Small
Construction will be used.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible Impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts. NA
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required) NA
4. Describe arranigement for the boffower to address safeguard issues. NA
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentiafly affected people.
Broad-based public consultations on biosafety issues are currently underway in the context of the
integration of the National Development Plan. Participants include representatives from all sectors in
Colombia. Over the last few years ICA has organized 25 workshops directed to stakeholders, policy
makers, scientific community, and civil society. The GEF project will broaden stakeholder participation
and pubhc information by includmg key representatives of each of these sectors in the capacity building
component through courses and pubhcations, and through the dissemination of information via the BCH
mechanism. Through the BCH mechanism, participation will be supported which wllU target farmers and
other rural organizations and consumer associations. Additionally the BCH will offer the opportunity to
create forums on relevant/important biosafety subjects for the purpose of obtaining input from the public at
large and feedback on the projects outcomes, particularly at the institutional level. OpportunitLies will be
provided to NGOs, academics and the research commumty to publish opinions and to dissemnate them to
the public. Finally, the BCH will disseminate information to different citizen groups interested m Biosafety.
E. Sqfeguards Classification (select one). Category is determned by the highest impact in any policy Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an iLdividual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[ I S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. - No safeguard issues
I I SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
