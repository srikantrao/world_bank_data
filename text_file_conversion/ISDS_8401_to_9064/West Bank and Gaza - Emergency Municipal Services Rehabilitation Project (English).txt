1.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The objectives of the proposed Emergency Municipal Services Rehabilitation Project is to restore
the quality and coverage of essential municipal services in order to enhance the health status and
welfare of the population. This will be achieved by: (i) providing budgetary support for non-
wage municipal operating costs associated with essential service delivery; (ii) creating temporary
labor-intensive employment opportunities; and (iii) strengthening local government cost
management and improving emergency response capacity through a Municipal Fund to be
established under the proposed Project.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed Grant of US$20.0 million to the Palestinian Authority would support local
government efforts to sustain essential municipal services and provide temporary labor-intensive
employment opportunities in response to the severe contraction of the Palestinian economy
resulting from protracted closures of the Palestinian territories . The Grant would help reduce
urban vulnerability to deteriorating municipal service coverage and quality; enhance central-local
government emergency response capacity through the establishment of a Municipal Fund; and
strengthen local government capacity to more effectively manage resources and deliver services.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
There are about 440 Local Government (LGUs) (municipalities, village councils and hamlets) in
the West Bank and Gaza with population of 3.2 million, the stakeholders agreed that the proposed
project would address LGUs with populations of 1,000 and over which constitute just over 260
communities. It was further agreed that this criteria would be realistic, fair and transparent since it
covers about 96% of the total population and since allocations would be based on a per capita
distribution principle. This facility will finance emergency programs submitted by LGUs and
prepared in close consultation with their communities.

﻿Comments.
The proposed Project would contribute to environmental improvements by increasing municipal
service quality and coverage. A limited number of micro civil works sub-projects are expected to
be financed under the Project, depending on demand, similar to those implemented under
previous projects in the WBG such as the Emergency Service Support Project. Given that most
of the likely investment activities would support rehabilitation and improvements to existing
infrastructure and service delivery with a sub-project value that may not exceed US$150,000 and
would not require land acquisition or resettlement the Project has been placed in environmental
screening "Category B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 (January 1998)
and requires preparation and implementation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
Although the Project was prepared in accordance with OP 8.50, the Bank team, as best practice
recommends, assisted the client in preparing an EMP prior to negotiations. The EMP would give
general guidance on environmental issues, as well as provide a screening criteria for the proposed
project to minimize or avoid any negative environmental impact. The EMP would also elaborate
potential environmental impacts and recommend mitigation measures. The need for mitigation
measures is likely to be limited. If any, the costs of these measures would be financed out of the
allocation provided to LGUs through their emergency program assistance.
