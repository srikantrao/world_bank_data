A.2. Project Objectives 
The higher level objective of the proposed FTAL is to reduce the probability of future financial sector 
crises and to mitigate the negative impact of the current crisis on poverty levels and income distribution. 
The FTAL will accomplish this goal through technical assistance to develop institutional capacity and 
improve the financial infrastructure and legal framework. The FTAL is consistent with the objectives of the 
proposed Country Assistance Strategy Progress Report 2003 of modernizing the State and improving 
governance, restore confidence and facilitate the resumption of economic growth and poverty reduction. 
The first project development objective (PDO) will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the 
monetary authorities to improve the design and implementation of monetary and fiscal policies. The FTAL 
will achieve this objective by helping the Central Bank to define a strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank 
in view of the large quasi-fiscal deficit it is incurring as a result of the banking crisis management; by 
developing the monetary and financial regulations to be issued by the Monetary Board required by the 
recently approved LMF and; by helping the Ministry of Finance to implement an efficient debt 
management strategy. 
 
The second PDO will consist of strengthening the institutional capacity of the financial regulatory agencies 
to reduce risks and increase efficiency of financial activities. The FTAL will achieve this objective by 
strengthening the institutional capacity of the Banking, Securities, Insurance and Pension 
Superintendencies, with particular emphasis in the institutional development of the Superintendency of 
Banks and; by modernizing the financial infrastructure, particularly the country’s payments and securities 
settlement systems.

institutional development of the Superintendency of Banks; modernizing the financial infrastructure, 
particularly the country’s payments and securities settlement systems; developing the monetary and 
financial regulations to be issued by the Monetary Board under the recently approved LMF; and

development plan for fixed income securities. The components are as follows: 
1. 
Strategy to re-capitalize the Central Bank and statistics improvement.

Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Banking Superintendency (SB).
