Section I - Basic Information
A. Basic Project Data
Country: KENYA                                   Project ID: P082378
Project: Free Primary Education Support Project  Task Team Leader: Michael Mills
Authorized to Appraise Date: April 24, 2003     IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: June 19, 2003                    IDA Amount ($m):
IDA GRANT FOR POOREST COUNTRY- 54 5
Managing Unit: AFTHI                             Sector: Primary education (100%)
Lending Instrument: Specific Investment Loan (SIL)  Theme: Education for all (P)
Status: Lending
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective is to ensure that the quality of primary education is not
undermined by a lack of textbooks, and to plan for a more comprehensive program of support to the
education sector in the future. The project would support the Government's new policy of free primary
education; and it would also assist the country to move towards the Millennium Development Goal of
having all children throughout Kenya able to complete a full course of primary schooling by Year 2015.
A new, Government was democratically elected in Kenya on 27th December, 2002. This presents
an exciting new opportunity for the Bank group to resume and strengthen its program of support to the
country, as the new Government is quickly moving forward to address governance problems and
corruption, and to strengthen poverty reduction efforts. One of the Government's highest priorities is
education, and some bold policy changes are now being introduced. In particular, the Government needs
urgent support to enable it to deliver on its commitment to free primary education. The proposed project
is intended to provide an initial phase of support to the Government to assist it as quickly as possible to
deal with the immediate challenge created by the new policy environment and particularly the abolition
of primary school fees. It would also assist the Government to plan for a further round of external
assistance in the education sector.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The proposed project of $54.5 million (equivalent to about 15 percent of the total public budget
for primary education in the country) would have two components.
Component 1 - Textbooks ($50 million)

The bulk of project funds would be used for the scaling-up of the recently evaluated
Government/DFID textbook program, using school grants (at say K.Sh.500 or $8/child), the existing
procurement system which is considered to be competitive, and the existing financial management
system (with independent auditors). Under this approach, financing is made available on the basis of per
capita textbook grants to schools. The school principals and SCs are allowed to select the textbooks
needed from the approved list of textbooks, subject to the funds in the school account. The project
would therefore support the provision of textbooks to all primary schools by financing an expanded
unified national system of instructional materials. The project would cover textbooks for both the old
curriculum subjects, as well as the new ones as they are introduced (see below). The project would also
build upon the past support of IDA and DFID to the Kenyan Institute of Education (KIE) for the
development of an objective and transparent system of textbook evaluation, vetting, and approval.

Component 2 - Strengthening Planning and Management Capacity (US$$5 million).
In addition, there will be a second, smaller component (about $4.5 million) to support activities
for the carrying out of the project efficiently (training, monitoring, beneficiary assessments and external
audit etc), for policy work, and for the preparation of a new project (scheduled for FY04). Weak
management and planning capacity at the central, local, and school levels is one of the main causes of
poor implementation of education reforms and delivery of education services. The proposed technical
assistance and training would support the development of the proposed further phase of the education
reform program for extemal funding, as well as provide assistance with the costing and expenditure
planning work. This component will also include support for project management and evaluation.
Components:
1. Textbooks. Sector: Primary Education
2. Strengthening Planing and Management Capacity. Subcomponents. Sector: System Reform
and Capacity Building, and Institutional Development.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
This is a national project that will focus on support to primary schools throughout the country.
B. Check Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments. The project has been categorized as a "C" because it supports only the provision of textbooks
and the strengthening of planning and management capacity in the sector. This project will not support the
construction or rehabilitation of any buildings or other infrastructure and will be limited to the provision of
instructional materials, technical assistance, studies and training (capacity building).

The project will support improvement of overall educational management by expanding the roles
of school level stakeholders in the procurement of instructional materials through School Committees
working with head teachers. By expanding the roles of local stakeholders in educational management,
the project will strengthen accountability at the school level.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
