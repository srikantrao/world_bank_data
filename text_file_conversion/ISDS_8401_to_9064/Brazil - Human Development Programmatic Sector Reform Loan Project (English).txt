INSTRUMENTS.          Reform Loan
Project Objectives
The proposed First Programmatic Human Development Sector Reform Loan (First RD PSRL) supports an
ongoing program of human development reforms that tackle core sectoral issues of targeting, resource
allocation, and efficiency of spending. The human development program contributes to reducing poverty
and to protecting the poor against adverse effects of economuc crises, and is also considered a key factor to
achieve sustainable and equitable growth. In addition to deepening key sectoral reforms, this Loan will (a)
signal to the markets the commitment of the new administration to sound economic and sectoral policies;
and (b) finance part of the nominal fiscal deficit and the external financmig requirements of the public
sector.
Project Description
The proposed HD PSRL builds upon sound social policy reforms carried out by the Government during the
last decade and especially in recent years. There have been substantial improvements in education, health
and social assistance outcomes since the Bank's Special Sector Adjustment Loan (S-SECAL) of 1999 that
selected 22 core HD programs for protection and evaluation. The proposed HD PSRL supports a subset of
these programs and additional ones that have proven to be effective, and that are based on sound policy
principles. The policies embodied in these programs would be maintained through the transition without
creating artificial rigidities for the new administration. The protected programs would help maintain and
scale up the Improvements in service delivery and in welfare outcomes. The impact of positive human
development outcomes on growth and poverty reduction are well documented.
The first loan of the HD PSRL supports. (i) the recent substantial progress on social policies and
outcomes; (ii) the protection of budgets and monitoring of implementation of effective social policies
during times of transition and instability; and, (iii) the commitment by the new administration to the
continuation, improvement, and expansion of these effective social policies to obtain better sector
outcomes.
