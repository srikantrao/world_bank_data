A. Basic Project Data
Country: DOMINICAN REPUBLIC                     Project ID: P054937
Project: Early Childhood Education Project       Task Team Leader: Alberto Rodriguez
Authorized to Appraise Date: June 1, 2002       IBRD Amount ($m): 42.00
Bank Approval: October 10, 2002                 IDA Amount ($m):
Managing Unit: LCSHE                             Sector: EC - Early Childhood Development
Lending Instrument: Specific Investment Loan (SIL)  Theme: EDUCATION
Status: Lending
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objectives of this project are: (a) to increase access to early childhood services for all
children ages zero to five, as measured by preprimary enrollment rates and the expansion of nonformal
services provided by communities and agencies; and, (b) to strengthen the quality of early childhood
education that is available to children ages zero to five.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The purpose of the Early Childhood Education Project is to assist the Govemment of the Dominican
Republic in its efforts to increase the availability of high quality educational services for young children
ages zero through five by means of targeted early childhood interventions. With a particular focus on the
poor, the project will expand access to and improve the quality of integrated services that address young
children's basic needs, including preprimary education, psycho-social stimulation, health care, and
nutrition. Specifically, the Early Childhood Education Project will assist the State Secretariat of
Education (SEE) to expand and improve formal, center-based preprimary services for five-year-olds and
will work with sub-national governments, local communities, and NGOs to increase access to
high-quality, nonformal early childhood services for children between the ages of zero and five.
The objectives will be achieved through expanding services, improving quality of education and building
institutional capacity in the education sector. Within the expansion of services and quality
improvements, seventeen Regional Model Centers will be constructed, 600 new classrooms built at
existing schools, and 600 existing classrooms will be renovated. Furthermore, a grant program is being
created to finance community-driven projects.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

This project will be implemented country-wide, with particular attention given to rural areas. One small
Regional Model Center will be constructed in each of the Dominican Republic's seventeen regions. While
the exact locations of the buildings have not yet been determined, selection of site and construction designs
will be guided by Bank-approved manuals to be developed as part of the project's Operation Manual. Given
the small size of the Regional Model Centers, the construction efforts will be relatively simple, and adverse
environmental effects are unlikely. Each center will have four classrooms, visual observation facilities, two
bathrooms, an office for the administration with an adult bathroom, and a storage room for foodstuffs,
teaching materials, and equipment. The construction of new classrooms and the renovation of dilapidated
classrooms will all take place in existing schools, making potential adverse environmental impact unlikely.
Direct and indirect beneficiaries of the project include children ages zero to five, their families, and their
supporting communities. All communities will have access to and benefit from the new Regional Model
Centers, as one will be constructed in each of the country's regions.
B. Chleck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: Apart from some potentially small school construction efforts, the project does not pose any
environmental risks.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Alternatives in siting and design are addressed in the environmental screening and management,
described in the section below.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
In order to deal with any possible negative environmental impacts, the Government has proposed a
simple yet comprehensive environmental analysis method. The methodology follows international best
practice for small infrastructure projects, of applying checklists and matrices to ensure proper siting and
design, followed by proper construction practices, operation and supervision. The process is described
below:
Siting and Design
For the new schools especially, and to a lesser extent for the expansion of existing schools, proper siting
and design are critical to both avoid unnecessary impacts on the environment and unnecessary escalation
in project costs due to mid-stream design changes. A screening checklist has been prepared (see Annex
1) which enumerates critical questions about possible sites and designs, such as:
-   is it in or near a natural park
-  are there critical natural habitats
-   is the area prone to flooding
-  will the project affect any streams, rivers, springs
-  are there people living nearby who might be affected
-   is the area prone to natural disasters
-   is there site access
-   is there electricity at the site
-  will the project cause impacts on surface water quality
-  etc.
This checklist will be filled out for each candidate site to feed into the site selection decision-making
process.
Identification of Mitigation Measures
Once a site has been chosen, the screening checklist is used to identify possible environmental impacts in
each phase of the project (design, construction and operation). Another matrix is produced (see Annex 2)
where each impact is described, mitigation measures are identified, and responsibilities, costs and
monitoring indicators are assigned for each. Mitigation measures could include recommendations for: i)
siting within the chosen plot (iLe. away from any streams, wetlands, roads); ii) design such as increasing
sanitary facilities; iii) specific construction practices not already included in the construction manual; iv)
operational issues such as proper solid waste management from the school. These mitigation measures
are then included in the relevant bidding documents, where applicable, or in operational manuals for the
schools; for instance, measures in the design to avoid contamination of nearby water bodies through
proper sanitation, inclusion in the contractor's bidding documents of measures to prevent stream
contamination during construction, and operational guidelines for the school for proper solid waste
management.
Design Specifications
The schools and classrooms which will be constructed have design specifications that include restrictions
of material use (no lead paint, no asbestos, etc.) and promotion of environmentally friendly technologies
(such as wastewater recycling, use of natural ventilation to lower energy needs). Specific
recommendations for designs, both to mitigate any negative impacts and to take advantage of any
opportunities to enhance positive impacts, will be identified during the environmental analysis.

Construction Manual
A draft construction manual has been produced describing good construction practices, including
provisions for: erosion control, pollution control, solid waste management, protection of cultural
property, restoration of roads, restriction of borrow pits and dumps, maintaining access and services,
public information, etc. The manual includes occupational health guidelines, first aid instructions and
restrictions on use of child labor. Adherence to the manual will be referenced in all bidding documents
for works, whether for new construction, expansion or rehabilitation.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project design was discussed at local, regional and national levels throughout project preparation.
Workshops were held in many areas where construction is considered to provide the communities with
an opportunity to discuss the project as a whole and construction impacts specifically. Furthermore,
public fora will be organized during the environmental analysis for the individual schools. The Grant
Program for Inter-institutional Support for Child Development will ensure that information about the
project will flow to participating NGOs and community groups.
E. Safeguards Classiflcation. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
