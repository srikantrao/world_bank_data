A. Basic Project Data
Country: MEXICO                                 Project ID: P068290
Project: Urban Micro and Small Business Project  Task Team Leader: James C. Hanna
Authorized to Appraise Date: February 11, 2002  IBRD Amount ($m): 58.40
Bank Approval: June 3, 2003                     IDA Amount ($m):
Managing Unit: LCSFR                            Sector: Micro- and SME finance (75%); General
Lending Instrument: Sector Investment & Maintenance  information and communications sector (25%)

I.A.2. Project Objectives:
1.     Bank activities to generate urban economic growth have been focused largely in areas
such as urban government management and municipal finance, infrastructure and housing
upgrading, and environmental cleanup. More recently, Bank urban strategies are also placing
stress on direct support for productive firms to promote buoyant, broad-based growth of
investment, incomes and employment. See, for example, Cities in Transition: A strategic View of Urban and
Local Government Issues, The World Bank Infrastructure Group, Urban Development, 2000, and Urban Poverty
Chapter of the PSRP Sourcebook (final draft).
In Mexico, the Bank has articulatedmee-pronged national urban development strategy
which includes a direct focus on assisting the urban poor---amounting to 35 million people or
two-thirds of the country's total poor---to improve their income earning capacity. See Mexico Urban
Development: A contribution to a National Urban Strategy,Finance, Private Sector and Infrastructure Management
Unit, LCR, The World Bank, November 9, 2001.
2.     As part of this strategy, the Project objective would be to help increase the
competitiveness and growth of micro and small businesses (MSBs) in poor urban areas of
Mexico through the adoption of e-business. The definition of MSBs for Project purposes is that
used by the Government's statistical institute, INEGI, which is based on the number of firm
employees: microbusinesses are those where entrepreneurs are self-employed or have up to 15
employees; small businesses are those with 16-100 employees. "E-business", when well
integrated with a firm's business processes and organization, involves considerable innovation in
business processes and tends to have a strong positive impact on productivity, competitiveness

ISDS
and growth. "E-business" refers to the progressive process of (1) investment in information and
communications technologies (ICT), such as personal computers (PCs), other hardware
equipment, software, Internet connectivity, and local and wide area networking; (2) their
application to individual business processes like market research, production, finance, and
management; and (3) the purchase and/or sale of goods and services between a business and
other businesses, households, individuals and/or governments over computerized networks.
3.    The Project objective would be achieved through the following two components:
(a)   Expanding e-business development services markets for MSBs via (i) demand-side
matching grants for BDS provicding information, training, market access and technology
appropriate to MSB needs to adopt e-business solutions, (ii) a supply-side BDS innovation pilot
in information and communications technology (ICT)-based business development services
providing distance learning, new market access, management tools, and online trading to reduce
transaction costs; and (iii) a BDS innovation pilot for the promotion of new employment of
urban at-risk youth through ICT-based training and job placement;
(b)   Improve MSB access to ICT infrastructure and new economy e-gov business services -
technical assistance, hardware and software investments to extend internet services to MSBs and
to reduce regulations and simplify institutional practices associated with business regulations
(eg., registration, operating licenses and inspections, labor and tax registration and renewals) via
installation of best practices electronic government services and a promotion program to
facilitate access to and usage of them by micro and small businesses.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Components
1.    The proposed Project would support the increased competitiveness and growth of micro
and small businesses (MSBs) in poor urban areas of Mexico. It would contain two components
aimed to substantially increase access to sustainable business development services and to
improve the business climate for microbusiness investment and operation.

Comments.
1.     The Project would consist primarily of firm-level technical assistance, institution-building
among business services providers, and regulatory changes at the municipal level in regard to
formalization of business. Based upon past experience elsewhere, the ELIP is likely to include
support to MSBs in the acquisition of clean technologies and to obtaining internationally recognized
certification systems for quality and environmental protection, such as ISO 9,000 and ISO 14,000.
2.     Participatory Approach. E-Mexico, NAFIN and the Ministry of Finance have been an
important vehicle to bring together public and private interests in the design and implementation
of the Project. In the analytical work done on the Project, inputs have been provided directly by
local community organizations anxious to foster MSB development, by authorities at the
municipal level responsible for business regulation and local development, such as the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development and Secretary of Economic Development, and by private
sector organizations--- commercial banks, NGOs and technology firms. Work on specific issues
has also been substantially informed and directed by national surveys of MSBs by INEGI and
Bank sector work on the business climate and urban development.

Social Outreach Strategy.
1.    The principal focus of the Project is MSBs within urban areas in the six initial target
areas. The total indigenous populations of Mexico throughout these areas runs from slight to
modest, amounting to 2.6% in Mexico's Federal District (Mexico City), 0.6% in Jalisco, 6.7% in
Mexico, 4.5% in Michoacan, 18.8% in Puebla and 14.3% in Veracruz. Source INEGI Estadisticas
sociodemogaraphicas, 1995. However, within these states, including Puebla and Veracruz, the
concentration of indigenous inhabitants is largely 1. outside of the principal urban areas in which
the Project would be expected to draw clientele. Source: SEDESOL Socioecon6micos. 2000
Nonetheless, given that most of the Project would be demand-based and MSBs operated by
indigenous people could be beneficiaries under the Project; the Project design would include an
outreach strategy, consistent with the Bank's Operational Directive on Indigenous Peoples
(OD4.20), to facilitate and encourage their access to services.
2.     Under the Project, E-Mexico will contact and work closely with key indigenous
organizations, particularly in the Federal District, Puebla and Veracruz, to promote understanding
about and interest in the Project. Participating E-BDS organizations will also be encouraged to
recruit and assign staff who speak local dialects and languages in order to facilitate service
provision, as well as produce locally adapted promotion and training materials for this purpose.
For the business development services component of the Project, the ICT-based BDS pilot would
seek to recruit and train business center staff in locations close to MSBs operated by indigenous
people experienced in working in indigenous communities and to adapt the services it provides,
orally and in written materials, to use appropriate indigenous languages.
3.     Performance indicators and monitoring of this aspect of the Project would be an integral
part of the overall system as described in Section C4 and Annex 1 of this report. In addition,
however, supervision work by the PMU and the Bank would scrutinize regularly the outreach
efforts described above, particularly in states with higher concentrations of indigenous
populations, through periodic visits and interviews with clients and local indigenous leaders.
