I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The main objective of the proposed PFPSAL 3 is to support implementation during 2003 of the
Government's financial and public sector reform priorities in response to the 2001 economic crisis, while
continuing to ensure that social programs are adequately funded and increasingly better targeted.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed Third Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL 3) is the third
Loan in support of the Government's multi-year financial and public sector reform program. It follows on
the first Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan of US$ 1.1 billion approved in July
2001 (US$700 million on standard IBRD terms and US$400 million on SSAL terms) and the second
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan of US$1.35 billion approved in April 2002
(US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800 million on SSAL terms). Key reform priorities in
the financial sector include: (i) overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking activity, (ii) institutional
development of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), (iii) problem bank/bank failure
resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring and privatization. Key reform priorities in the public sector
include: (a) a further deepening of structural fiscal policies in support of sustainable fiscal adjustment, (b)
implementation of the Government's public expenditure management reform program including concrete
improvements in budget planning and execution, completion of the new legal and institutional framework
for financial management and accountability, and consolidation of the new system of public liability
management, and (c) implementation of the Government's strategy to strengthen public sector governance
including implementation of the national anti-corruption strategy and preparation of civil service reform.
Priorities for social spending include: (i) adequate expenditure allocations for health, education and social
protection in the 2003 budget in line with benchmarks agreed under the PFPSAL program and (ii) better
targeting of social protection to vulnerable groups including framework legislation to institutionalize the
direct income support (DIS) program for farmers.

Comments: Increases in fuel taxes enacted in 2002 under the program should act to promote energy
conservation and the shift away from indirect agricultural subsidies to direct income support may reduce
the use of environmentally harnmfulfertilizers. Improvenments in Public Expenditure Management should
permit line ministries, including The Ministmy of Environment, to be miore focused in their use of resources.
