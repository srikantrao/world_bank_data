Comments: Construction of higher education establishments in various sites may have impacts during
construction (increased traffic, risk of road accidents, disturbance of neighbors, modification of surrounding
vegetation, disturbance of cultural and archeological sites, air and water pollution) and impacts during use of
facilities (increased traffic, disturbance of neighbors, pollution from garbage disposal, including chemicals).

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Depending on the site selected for construction the higher education establishment (e.g. large urban, small
urban, or peri-urban), the possible impacts listed above in Section lB are likely to vary. Under the
ongoing project (P005741), which uses a similar environmental protection mechanism to what will be
proposed here, has not resulted in any major environmental problems.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
This is a case of multiple project components but no cumulative impact is expected.
II.D. l c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No long-term impacts due to anticipated future use of higher education establishements likely.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
NA
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Govemment procedure for environmental impact assessment is likely to be the same or similar to those used
in the on-going project P005741. An environmental management plan (EMP) will be developed,
satisfactory to the Bank. In line with the procedure set out in the EMP, environmental impact of
construction of higher education establishments will be determined on case by case basis, with mitigating
measures to be put in place as appropriate. The Agence nationale pour la protection environmentale, as
well as the Bank, will have a validation role in these procedures.

safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or

safeguard issues.
