Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet
Section I - Basic Information
Date ISDS Prepared/Updated: October 8, 2002
A. Basic Project Data (from PDS)
I.A.1. Project Statistics
COUNTRY: Guyana                              PROJECT ID: P073851
PROJECT: Poverty Reduction Support Credit I  TTL: John H. Stein/Norman Hicks
APPRAISAL DATE: October 9-10, 2002           IBRD AMOUNT ($m):
BOARD DATE: December 10, 2002                IDA AMOUNT ($m): 12
MANAGING UNIT: FPSL LCR                      SECTOR: Poverty reduction
LENDING INSTRUMENTS: SECAC                   STATUS: Appraisal ongoing
I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
Stimulating economic growth by means of an appropriate medium-term economic framework, budgetary
reforms, modernization and restructuring of the sugar sector, legal, regulatory and institutional reform of
the water sector;
Improving governance and increasing public sector efficiency and accountability through: public sector
procurement reform; improved public sector financial management, local government reforms; and
effective monitoring and evaluation of PRSP implementation
Improving delivery and quality of basic services and safety nets through: increasing access by the poor to
quality education, improving the efficiency of social assistance programs, addressing the spread of
HIV/AIDS
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
This single tranche, fast disbursing IDA credit supports the Governments poverty reduction strategy as
presented in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper presented to the Board in September 2002. The project
is classified as a sector adjustment operation. Its main environmental impacts refer to policy reforms and
specific Government programs to be undertaken as part of the Government's poverty reduction program.
There no specific measures being supported under PRSC I that require action or mitigation measures on
environmental impacts. However, the expected future PRSC II is likely to support a new mining law and
accompanying regulations; accordingly, a Sector Environmental Assessment of mining in Guyana is
planned prior to IDA appraisal of the PRSC II. Passage of a new, more environmentally friendly forestry
law might also be a condition for the PRSC I; during PRSC I, IDA intends to provide advice to the
Government on how the new forestry law and accompanying regulations mnight be made broadly
consistent with relevant World Bank Safeguard Policies.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or
sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.) The PRSC I is
nationwide in scope. However, the restructuring program for sugar includes the construction of a new,
modern sugar factory at the coastal town of Skeldon along with the expansion of sugar cane cultivation by
10,000 hectares. Approximately half of this cane expansion area would be on lands owned by the Guyana
Sugar Corporation and half on private farmers' land. The proposed sugar cane expansion area would not
qualify as a critical natural habitat under OP 4.04 since large expanses of similar, less disturbed wetland
habitats occur in the general vicinity. Nevertheless a full EIA will be carried out as a condition of appraisal
for the future PRSC II.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not
available, describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
None are expected under the program. OveraLl the program is expected to have positive environmental
impacts through improved and strengthened government institutions and greater transparency and
accountability of the public sector. Special focus is being given on poverty reduction schemes and
provision of basic services to poor areas.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard.policy
or due to multiple project component.
None are expected.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No negative impacts are expected under this operation.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues. None needed for PRSC I.
However, preparation of PRSC n will involve an EIA and Environmental Management Plan for the new
Skeldon sugar factory as well as a Sector Environmental Assessment of mining in Guyana. The new
forestry law will provide for improved environmental and forestry controls.
ll.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Government has prepared a satisfactory plan for continued public consultation and participation in the
monitoring and evaluation of the PRSP, which will include issues of environmental concern.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S,. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ XI S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
I S3. - No safeguard issues
[I] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the
parties' claims on the disputed areas
