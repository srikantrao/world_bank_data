Regulation and competition policy (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objectives are to: (a) accelerate, in a commercially viable manner, the use of electricity
for economic growth and social services and thus improve the quality of life in un-served and
under-served areas (peri-urban and rural); and (b) strengthen Mozambican capacity to increase access to
modern energy. It seeks to achieve these objectives via supporting the implementation of the
Govemment of Mozambique (GoM) National Energy Strategy of October 2000 that, inter alia, aims at
reforming the country's energy sector and implementing an enabling environment for private sector
participation in the sector.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Phase 1
Project activities will be clustered around the following four main components: Power Sector Reform,
Grid Electrification, Renewable Energy Promotion and, Institutional Development and Capacity
Building.
Components:
1. Power Sector Reform
2. Grid Electrification
2.1 Main grid sub-component (29.17)
Peri-urban (29.17)

2.3 Environmental Management (0.76)
3. Renewable Energy Promotion
3.1 Solar PV investments (6.09)
3.3 TA/capacity building (3.30)
3.4 PDF grant (0.30)
4. Institutional strengthening & capacity building
4.1 Regulatory studies & CNELEC advice (1.07)
4.3 Training (0.63)
4.4 Office equipment (1.04)
4.5 Project coordination (1.50)
4.6 Preparation of Phase 2 (0.80)
4.7 PPF (0.6)
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project components will be located in various parts of the country, most of which (except for the EdM
component) will be rural, mostly rural District Capitals. The EdM distribution investments would be in
several peri-urban areas to which EdM has already extended its transmission line and would like to connect
more customers.
The isolated grids and renewables components will be implemented in the provinces of Inhambane,
Zambesia and Cabo Delgado, where there is no power supply or the present supply cannot satisfy demand
The institutional/household solar PV system component will develop a systematic program for meeting
efficiently all the modern energy needs of rural institutional customers, such as health clinics and schools,
and initiate the process by providing light, cooling for vaccines and electricity for other appliances via solar
PV systems.
In the first phase of the APL, the micro-hydro component will involve, mainly, design of a micro-hydro
program, which will be implemented in the second phase It is expected that implementation (by the private
sector) will involve, mainly, the rehabilitation of existing plant.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The project has been categorized as a B due to the potential environmental and social impacts of
the (a) main grid investments; (b) independent grid investments, including North Inhambane; (c) investments
in institutional/household solar PV systems; and (d) micro-hydro systems.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
Il.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The Environmental and Social Impact (ESIA) Report identified potential impacts related to construction and
operation & maintenance of future sub-projects. As regards the environment, the report identified
potential impacts on soils, air, vegetation, and natural habitats and proposed mitigation measures. The
report concluded that it will be unlikely that natural habitats will be affected negatively given that the
future sub-projects will be implemented in small rural towns and peri-urban areas where there are few, if
any, critical habitats remaining; mitigation measures have been proposed nevertheless in the event that
natural habitats are encountered during project implementation. As regards the social aspects of the
proposed project, the report identified potential impacts related to land acquisition, health and safety, as
well as air and noise pollution; mitigation measures have been proposed and a resettlement policy
framework has been prepared as part of the ESIA report.
II.D.Ib. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Soil erosion, loss of vegetation, soil, air and noise pollution, as well as health and safety risks.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
None
II.D 2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
None
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Borrower has prepared an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESIA) Report and a Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) The ESIA Report provides tools for the environmental and social impact
assessment of future sub-projects, while the RPF outines the principles to be applied in the event of land
acquisition under the proposed project
1I D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Since the sites for future sub-projects have yet to be finalized and no design details are available,
a generic approach to the preparation of the ESIA report had to be adopted. Discussions were held
with the Directorate of Energy (DNE) and Electricidade de Mozambique (EdM) regarding the
selection of representative sub-project sites. The ESIA report outlines a public participation plan
that will be applied during the preparation of future sub-projects.

For the electrification investment components, there have been extensive discussions with service
providers (EdM, potential private investors/financiers/retail dealers) and potential customers,
which will be continued during the course of project preparation. Visiting missions have traveled
to all three of the functioning independent mini-grids under UHEP to assess their operations, and
the views and needs of consumers. Safeguard documents will be distributed to the affected
peoples and other stakeholders. ESIA and RPF will establish the grievance and appeal
mechanisms and channels in addition to those under the Mozambican Law. During the course of
project preparation, discussions will be held with health and education officials to coordinate the
provision of energy services to rural public facilities, and to define the proposed project's role in
the fight against HIV/AIDS.
Other key stakeholders: Extensive discussions have been held with bilateral donors who have
shown support for the proposed project concept and are happy with the Bank taking the lead in
advancing both sector reforms and new approaches to electrification tailored to Mozambican
contexts. The project team has had one or more meetings with other GoM ministries/agencies
with some responsibilities in rural development - Ministries/Directorates of Agriculture and
Rural Development, State Administration, Health, Education, Water, and Environment - or in
investment promotion - Ministries of Industry, and of Planning and Finance, and CPI (Center for
Promotion of Investments). In addition, several NGOs attended a meeting on renewable energy
options and another workshop on solar PV meetings have also been held with provincial
administrators, local entrepreneurs and local residents, all of whom have requested urgent
support in providing access to modem energy (electricity, in particular).
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
