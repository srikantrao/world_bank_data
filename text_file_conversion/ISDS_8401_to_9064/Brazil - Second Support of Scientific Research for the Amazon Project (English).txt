I.A.2. Project Objectives:
la. Project background
Although tropical rain forests contain most of the earth's biodiversity, and perform a range of important
environmental services, such as carbon sequestration to offset the effects of global climate change, they remain
one of the least understood ecosystems in the world. This is especially relevant in the case of the Brazilian
Amazon, which contains the largest extent of tropical rain forest in the world.
Brazil has a long tradition of supporting research into science and technology, but, until relatively recently, its
investments for environmental research in the Amazon have represented only a small fraction of total S&T
funding. Furthermore, cutbacks in national S&T funding during the 1980s and early 1990s further restricted the
availability of resources to support research on environmental issues in the Amazon. This situation improved
somewhat in recent years with the advent of a number of national and international initiatives designed to address
some of the limitations affecting research in the Amazon. One such initiative was supported through the Pilot
Program to Conserve the Brazilian Rain Forest, ajoint undertaking of the Brazilian government, Brazil's civil
society and the international community that seeks to find ways to conserve the tropical rain forests of the
Amazon and Brazil's Atlantic coast.
Under the Pilot Program's Science and Technology Subprogram, two interrelated projects were initiated in 1995
to promote the generation and dissemination of scientific knowledge relevant to conservation and sustainable
management of the Amazon by supporting competitive grants for directed research, and strengthening two

established regional research institutions. By the time the projects closed in June 1999 and December 1999,
respectively, the Emergency Assistance and Science Centers and Directed Research Phase I Projects had
provided total funding in the amount of about US$27 million (US$17.43 million equivalent in grants from RFT,
USAID, EU and DflD, and US$9.23 million equivalent from GoB) to support 23 directed research projects, as
well as significant infrastructural improvements and institutional strengthening of the two regional research
centers, the Emilio Goeldi Museum of Para (MPEG) and the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA).
An additional ECU 5 million was provided by the EU bilaterally in 1998 through the Pilot Program to fund a
second round of directed research projects. USAID has also indicated that it intends to provide some US$6
million to support a follow-on operation to continue strategic support for strengthening scientific research on
targeted environmental topics, the proposed second phase science project, which is the subject of this PCD.
In addition, the Brazilian government is currently leading a large international multidisciplinary research
initiative which seeks to understand how the Amazon functions as a regional entity, and how changes in land use
and climate affect the biological, chemical, and physical functions of the Amazon, including the sustainability of
development in the region and the influence of the Amazon on the global climate. The "Large-Scale
Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA)" is being funded by the US National Aeronautics and
Space Agency (NASA), the EU and the Government of Brazil.
The proposed second phase project under the Pilot Program Science and Technology subprogram is being
designed to build on the lessons learned from the Phase I projects, as well as other related projects in the region.
The Phase II project is also being designed with an eye to recent developments in Brazil's S&T strategy, which is
providing for more long-term, sustained national support for S&T activities, with special provisions to guarantee
support for infrastructure and research in the Amazon. Thus, the primary emphasis of the proposed project will
on sharpening the focus of regional research in the Amazon and disseminating results for the benefit of a broad
range of end users.
lb. Project development objective
The development objective of the proposed project is to promote and disseminate targeted and coordinated
scientific and technological research on key questions contributing to the conservation and sustainable
development of the Amazon region.
To accomplish this objective, the project would support (i) targeted research subprojects on selected priority
questions; (ii) the selection and use of innovative dissemination methods to augment the applicability and transfer
of scientific and technical knowledge to conservation and sustainable development end users in the Amazon; and
(iii) the development and use of an effective and efficient model of project and subproject coordination and
management, including an improved system of monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes and impacts.

B. Clheck Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments.
The project retains a "C" for environmental assessment purposes. It is not expected to produce any negative
environmental effects.
In terms of general environmental impacts, the proposed project is expected to increase capacity in the
environmental sciences in the Amazon and in Brazil, and improve the technological knowledge needed to
utilize sustainably the resources from the rain forest.
Key stakeholders include the national and regional science and technology community, the PPG7, national
and internationals NGOs, grass-roots based organizations, and local end users.

Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
As noted above, a participatory process will be carried out during project preparation to consult with a range of
project stakeholders, including research scientists and technicians both within and outside of the Amazon region,
universities and other research entities, government and donor managers of Pilot Program initiatives, national and
international environmental NGOs, and local communities and grass-roots based organizations. The purpose of
these consultations will be to contribute to the selection of two or three priority research areas for project
coverage, and help define precise research questions within each area. In this way, it is expected that key
concerns of local populations, as well as priority research issues of the Pilot Program, will be adequately
addressed by the project.
Stakeholder participation during implementation will range from involvement of scientists as researchers and
technicians in the working groups and networks chosen to carry out the targeted research, to participation of
representative stakeholders, including NGO and local community representatives, on advisory panels overseeing
project implementation, dissemination of results, and monitoring and evaluation activities.
E. Safeguards Clfrssification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. -No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
