B.  Project Objective
 
 
The higher level objective of the proposed FTAL is to prevent future financial sector crises and encourage 
save and sound intermediation to mitigate the negative impact on poverty levels and income distribution. 
The FTAL will accomplish this goal through technical assistance to develop institutional capacity and 
improve the financial infrastructure and legal framework. 
 
The first project development objective (PDO) will consist of defining a strategy to re-capitalize the 
central bank in view of the large quasi-fiscal deficit it is incurring as a result of the banking crisis 
management
. The FTAL will achieve this objective by helping the central bank to improving its financial 
and monetary statistics, analyzing its balance sheet dynamics (including potential linkages with other 
macroeconomic aggregates and development implications) aiming at designing a strategy to facilitate the 
central bank re-capitalization. Otherwise, a deteriorated balance sheet of the central bank poses a high risk 
of constraining monetary policy and favoring inflationary financing of the quasi-fiscal deficit. 
 
 
The second PDO will consist of developing institutional capacity of the Banking, Securities, 
Insurance and Pension Superintendencies, with particular emphasis in the institutional development 
of the Superintendency of Banks
. The FTAL will achieve this objective by strengthening the institutional 
capacity in areas such as supervisory functions and analysis (including IT supervision), strategic planning, 
institutional reorganization, skills improvement and training, and purchase of some limited IT equipment 
 
The third PDO will consist of modernizing the financial infrastructure, particularly the country’s 
payments and securities settlement systems
. The FTAL will achieve this objective through the design 
and  implementation  of a modern payments and securities clearance and settlement system to minimize 
Page  2
 
 
risk, increase efficiency, support an active interbank money market, and provide appropriate liquidity and 
cash management tools. 
 
The fourth PDO will consist of developing the monetary and financial regulations to be issued by the 
Monetary Board required by the recently approved LMF
. The FTAL will achieve this objective by 
developing key by-laws and monetary and prudential regulations of the LMF. 
 
The fifth PDO will consist of implementing an efficient debt management strategy
. The project would 
achieve this objective by helping to establish a new institutional framework for debt management and 
budget execution within the Ministry of Finance, and assist in the development of primary and secondary 
markets for fixed income securities. 
 
C.  Project Description
 
 
The proposed FTAL will consist of technical assistance of US$14.5 million to finance consultant work, IT 
based system development and equipment, and training to achieve the PDOs described above. The 
components, with initial estimated amounts, are as follows: 
 
\01\02
Strategy to re-capitalize the central bank and statistics improvement
. The central bank has 
generated an important quasi-fiscal deficit as a result of the banking crisis management. An 
analysis of the central bank’s balance sheet dynamics will be produced as the basis for the re-
capitalization strategy, the main outcome of this component. It will also include an improvement 
of the central bank statistics to bring them closer to international standards regarding the 
classification of financial instruments, sectorization of the economy, monetary aggregates 
compilation and statistical treatment of banks in liquidation. 
\01\02
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Banking Superintendency
 with special emphasis 
in the areas of training, strategic planning, human resources management, inspections (including 
IT supervision) and the framework to strengthen the accountability of external auditors. 
\01\02
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Securities Superintendency
 including the design 
and sequencing of a well-thought strategy and implementation plan for the development of 
securities markets. 
\01\02
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the Insurance Superintendency 
(SS), including 
improving staff skills, updating of accounting practices to take into account the development of 
new products and financial techniques, and the improvement of the SS supervision and 
enforcement functions. 
\01\02
Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the
 
Pensions Superintendency
 (SIPEN), especially in 
the area of quantifying transition costs for the implementation of the new system, staff training 
and assessment  of new financial instruments to diversify AFP’s portfolios. 
\01\02
Design of a comprehensive payments and securities clearance and settlement system reform 
strategy
 including the required legal and regulatory framework, oversight function and 
implementation of a well functioning real time gross settlement system and a revamped automated 
check clearing system. 
\01\02
Regulatory development of the LMF
 (coordinated with the IADB Technical Assistance Program). 
\01\02
Design and implementation of an efficient framework for debt management and related fixed 
income markets’ development plan 
including staff training in government debt management, 
assistance in implementing the needed institutional changes at the Ministry of Finance, 
introduction of auctions for sale of government and central bank paper per the FSAP 
recommendations and related IT needs. 
\01\02
Unallocated amount to support contingencies that could happen from an intensification of the 
banking crisis
.

under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity
 
 
[Guideline: Refer to Section 5 of PCN]
 
 
The assessment from the World Bank specialists confirm that the BCRD has a good organization and capable staff, 
also the other members of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) are well qualified and have very good experience 
in their field of expertise. However it will be necessary to organize seminars and training for the PCU members on 
World Bank requirements and procedures. In sum the risk of implementation of this project is considered average.
