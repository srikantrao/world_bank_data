Project Objectives (From PDS) . Project rationale and objectives:
The goal of the project is to ensure the cooservation of the natural resources and biodiversity of the Bio-Itsi
Reserve. In so doing, the project will contribute significantly to the conservation of the natural resources
and biodiversity of Tikal National Park. El Zotz Biotope, and other important areas in the cenatal region of
the Maya Biosphere Reserve.

i Projec: Descn:puon (From PDS)
This project teeks to strengthen the protection of the Bsu-Ilzi Reserve and to improve the agroforestry
prat.'es o, cotunsunities surrounding the Rcscrve. The Bio-Itza Association will play the key role in
protecing the Reserve and improving agroecosyslem maragement. To ensure that the association fulfills
this roic, Cl/ProPeten will assist the Bio-[tzi Association over the next five years is the following ways:
I   Strengthcn the financial, administrative. and communications systems of the Bio-izi Association.
2. Reinforce and implement a strategy and management plan for the protection of the Bio-ItLzi
lteserve.
'   Create a ind t.plernient a plan fo: thei rntcning ard evaluation of socio-econornic and biodiversitv
data.
4   Design and establish an information, tramnng, and research center on traditional production
systems.
Each of these results essentially constitutes a component of the proposed project. The activities and
financial inputs required to achieve these four fundamental results are described in detail below.
. Strengthen the financial, administrative, and comumunications systems of the Bio-It2a Association.
Total cost: S429,000; GEF contnbution: S291,000.
The Bio-ltza Association ts a key conservation actor in the north-central Peten. It and its members
are accorded significant respect by indigenous and Ladino people alike. The Association is in a
good position to posiively influence the land and resource management practices not only of the
Itza in San Jose but also of hundreds of other families elsewhere in north-central Pet6n. To have
the greatest influence, however, the Bio-Irzi must consolidate the gains it has made over the last
decade and improve its institutional capacity in a number of areas.
The first step in this process is to carry out a diagnostic on the stamts of the admtinistrative systems
and organization of the Bio-Iezi Association. This will include revising operational policies
(Internal Regulation, Manual of Policles and Procedures, etc) and developing internal systems of
communication that facilitate information Ilow among the management of the organization, its
components, and members. The next step is to revise, update and unplement a Five-Year Strategic
Plan for the association and establish annual operational plans the association as a whole and for
each of its components, including business plans for the enterprise components. Another key step
is to review and strengthen the accounting and financial management system. A fourth parallel
step is to identify the education and information reeds of the associaion's management, its
components, and mrnebers, then design and impiement a comprehensive training program,
including a scholarship fund. In the first phase of the project, a Project Coordinaiiou Unit (PC')
with the required technkical personnel and counterparts from the Bio-Itzi Assoctation will be
established. The role of the UCP is to oversee project implementation and management and train
counterparts as a furure senior rrmanagement xeam for both the Association.
The institutional strengthening of the Bio-Iei Association would result in direct environmental
benefits, rnost notably greater opportunities for indigenous cormmunity to conserve globalyv
important biodiversity. The strengthening would also contribut to the success of the other
components of the project, thereby ensuring that they produce their global environrmental benefits
in the most efficient manner.
2. Reinforce and implement a strategy and managemwnt plan for the protection of the Bio-Itzi
Reserve. Total cost; S293,000; GEF contribution: S 159.000.
The first prionty is to review and update the 2000-20004 Management Plan for the Bio-ltzi
Reserve. With this plan in place, the strengthening of control and enforcement systems, including
patrol schedules, fire control, and demarcation of borders, can proceed. Another priority is to
revise, update, and implement the public use plan as well as systems for managing naturai
resources. This will entail establishment of a geographic information system and development of
specific plans for management of wildlife, nontimber forest products, timber, and tourism. In
order to develop agreements with surrounding communities regarding conservation of the reserve,
a community relatioas program will be implemented. Key communities include Corozal, Nuevo
San Jose, Cruce Dos Aguadas, Joborrnpche, and San Pedro; key agencies include CONAP
(TikaI/Zotz) and CECON (Zotz). A prcgram of investments in infrastructure, such as a vehicle, a
tounsm camp, and tourist equipment, will also be carried out in accordance with the reserve
management plan.

steps to be take. to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associatcd with Lhe proposcd project
Since the investnents are vcrv small, no major impacts arc expected at this time.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potencial cumulative or long term impacts. None
3. In light of 1 and 2, descnbe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Screening procedures should be in placc. A checklist as an AnLex in the document is recommended.
5. Identify the key stakeiaolders and describe the nicchanisms for consultation and disclosure or safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholder involvement in project planning
Project preparation has included 2 process of Social Assessment and preparation.of a participanon action plan,
with emphasis on indigerous development given that rmore than 90 percent of the target project benc-t::arics
belong to Mayas-tza indigen,ous people. In Novernber and Decermber 2000, ProPetsn staf and consultants
hired wnlth PDF funds, vorked with the Bio-ltza Association to fac.lirate a participatory planning process to
prepare the GEF proposaL Two initial workshops were held on :2 November and 18 Novemaber 2CC40 to defne
the strategic objectives of the project. A majority of the members of associarion worked together in each
workshop to identify threats and opportunities regarding the Bio-ltzi Reserve. They also discussed the
association itself and the problems it faces. Based cn their anaiysis, they formulated possible solutiors to the
identified problems and a seies of objectives for the GEF proposal. FilnaLy the mennbers identified -.r?ect
stakeholders and reviewed in depLh the role of PT ?r-r&L.
After the second workshop. members broke into iour working groups and held two or three meetings
independently to flush out activiues that would support the defined strategic objectives. In addition, the
plenary nared six members to a Comisizn de Consldta, which w Nzs given the responsibility of meerg with
local, regional and natornal stskeholders from go'.eminent, NGOs. indigenous and campesino corrrurriues to
present the project in general terms and receive feedback. The smakeholders consulted are discussed irn more
detail m Annex 4.  A thdu plenary vorkshop was hleld on 16 December, during which each wo6ang group
and the Comnision presected their results. During the week of 8 Januay, luan Martinez and Karen B-re.loitz
of the World Bank visited i-e Petin to discuss the project with ProPetcn staff and the Bio-[izi
Proposal preparations contanued through the month of January _001 with the Comision de Consmdra. the
association's board, and representatives from each of the working groups. The final project design was
presented to a plenary session of the association on 20 January in San lose.
