I A 2. Project Objectives (From PDS).
The main objective of the Project is to meet the electricity needs of the country in an
economically and environuTentally sustainable manner to contribute to economic growth, and
well-being of the population of Jordan. As one of the largest foreign direct investments in
Jordan, it should help pave the way for attracting additional private capital investment flows for
infrastructure development in Jordan. The Project is part of the medium to long-term least-cost
power generation expansion plan in Jordan. It would help avoid power shortages and secure
significant economic benefits for the country. By enabling the Government to shift costs to the
private sector, and reducing the need for public investment, this Project would help make
available scarce public resources to increase Government support for the social sectors of the
economy.
The Project is consistent with the Bank Group's strategy in the sector, the mainstay of which is to
promote efficient development of the sector through institution of fundamental reforms, and
active private sector involvement In line with its economic reconstruction and development
program begun in 1995, in which the private sector was expected to play a significant role, the
Government committed to and actively embarked on reforming the energy sector, especially
electric power. Significant and commendable achievements have so far been made in all aspects.
These cover the creation of a competitive electricity market structure; active program to divest
power generation and distribution assets by end-2003 to the private sector; new power
generation development by the private sector, and establishment of an independent regulatory
agency, all founded on a sound enabling legal framework that clearly articulates the
Government's long-term sector policy objectives, as well as the roles of the Govermment, and
other stakeholders in the sector.
1.A 3 Project Description (From PDS)
The Project consists of a 450-MW gas-fired combined-cycle power station to be developed,
owned, and operated by the private-sector.

characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
The power station will be constructed on a site located at Sanra, which is approximately 35
kilometers northeast of Amman Jordan There is a nearby settlement, but the general area is open
and barren, without active economic use or evident potential, and not close to any critical habitats
socially sensitive areas or protected areas. The cultural heritage site on a hilltop about 2 km from
the project site, which is already degraded and vandalized, will not be affected.

Comnments The project has been placed in category A due to the potential environmental impact
associated with the construction and operation of the power station

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions 1 information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
II D. I a Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
The legal base for environmental assessment in Jordan is provided by Law #12 on environmental
protection and its revision of 2002. The revised law refers to mandatory ETA for environmentally
significant projects; however, there is no decree or ordinance yet setting forth guidelines for
environmental assessments
The expected environmental issues that the project (power plant) will entail are mostly related to
air pollution due to atmospheric emissions as well as nuisances associated with the construction
of the project. Workers and population safety issues should also be of concern. For the purpose
of this project, the standards to be followed will be those prescribed in the Bank's Pollution
Prevention and Abatement Handbook or those applicable under Jordanian regulations, in case

ISDS
such standards are stricter.
The land for the project site is owned and will continue to be owned by The Government The
Government acquired the site in 1999 after paying compensation to land owners as required by
Jordanian law. A rapid Social Assessment (SA) was conducted in June 1999 to investigate the
acquisition by eminent domain of 17 ha of privately-owned land in Zarqa govemorate in order to
accommodate the construction of the proposed power plant. The SA took place after the land
acquisition had been officially approved but before the compensation levels were announced or
negotiated with the owners. It found that the land being acquired was uninhabited and "dead";
that the acquisition was being done in according to laid-down procedures, that it occurred no
physical displacement of persons nor displacement of economic activities; nor would any cultural
or social issues arise other than the matter of level of monetary compensation finally negotiated
with the land-owners. It was recommended that this process should not be interrupted
It D. lb Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component
TBD during the EIA
II.D. Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
TBD
II D 2 In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
IL.D 3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
For the related downstream and upstream infrastructures, i.e., the transmission lines to Amman
and the Gas pipeline coming from Aqaba, it is understood that a full EIA will be conducted by
respectively the Gas pipeline Company and by the National Company NEPCO. But for the
reason stated above, the Bank will require that the sponsor selected for the SAMRA Power Plant
project conducts an EIA on the basis of terms of reference that will include an assessment not
only of the power plant itself but also a streamlined assessment of the spurline section of the gas
pipeline and of the transmission line to the north Amman substation This will ensure that
obvious and significant safeguards issues are identified early and mitigated in a manner
acceptable to the Bank These potential issues would be mostly related to rights of way, land
acquisition andl/or resettlement as well as impacts on cultural heritage.
With regards to land acquisition already undertaken, prior to completion of appraisal it will be
verified that (i) Bank standards of compensation were met (replacement value of the land was
awarded); (ii) the compensation was paid and (iii) there was due process and opportunity for
grievance, appeal or complaint.  Based on current infonmation, no other resettlement or
additional land acquisition will be required; however, this will be reviewed during project
preparation.
In addition, the Guarantee documentation will ensure that the applicable Bank safeguard policies
will be observed.

IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A consultation process with key stakeholders, including landowners, will be conducted to
support the preparation of the EIA. This will include meetings with Jordanian NGOs, including
the Jordan Environment Society, The Royal Society for Conservation of nature and Friends of
Archeology. On-site meetings would be conducted with local residents and potentially affected
parties.
E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.
S I. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts, or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
S3. - No safeguard issues
]SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
