I.A.2. Project Objectives:
PSCAP seeks to build capacity for improved public service delivery at the federal, regional, and local
levels by implementing civil service reforms, deepening district-level decentralization, improving urban
management, and reinvigorating justice sector institutions. Capacity building support under PSCAP will
entail the development of working systems, improvements in organizational effectiveness, and provision
of bulk in-service training in a demand-driven manner to support the above-mentioned NCBP
sub-programs and thereby improve service delivery performance across sectors. PSCAP also aims to
enhance the supply response of training institutions and increase access to those information and
communication technologies that will facilitate the efficient provision of capacity building for public
service delivery
I.A.3. Project Description:
It is envisaged that PSCAP will help build capacity for public service delivery by implementing civil
service reforms, deepening district-level decentralization, improving urban management, and
reinvigorating justice sector institutions. In facilitating the rapid, yet focused provision of capacity
building support, the Program will include measures to stimulate the supply-side response of training
institutions and increase access to appropriate information and communication technologies.
Design Principles. Critical to the design of PSCAP is the Government's intention to wholesale capacity
building support in focused, yetdeniand-driven manner across the NCBP. Accordingly, assistance
would be channeled through a limited number of components (or financing windows), each of which
would support a menu of activities govemed by corresponding operational manuals (see figure 4).

ISDS
According to the operational manuals governing the various components of PSCAP, assistance would be
made available to beneficiary institutions (applicants) that meet clearly defined eligibility criteria. Such
rules of access would enable beneficiary institutions to demonstrate their ownership of relevant capacity
building agendas, and their readiness to absorb assistance in a sustainable and monitorable manner.
Applications for assistance would be assessed by appropriate Technical Appraisal Committees (TAC)
and PSCAP funds would be committed and disbursed in efficiently and transparently.
An additional aspect of design is to provide performance-based replenishments to PSCAP components
(and relevant capacity sub-components) that are implemented rapidly in line with the Government's
timetable Accordingly, components (or financing windows) that are disbursed and implemented fastest
will be replenished with unallocated (and if necessary, reallocated) resources.
Components (Financing Windows).As discussed in section B3, the capacity building sub-programs
covered under PSCAP essentially seek to strengthen the enabling environment within which public
institutions operate, and also empower MABs and local governments to undertake the performance
improvement measures necessary to enhance frontline service delivery. In addition, appropriate use of
ICTs is viewed as necessary to improve institutional performance at various levels of government.
PSCAP will therefore include following four components or financing windows (see figure 4):
(1)  Public Sector Enabling Environment (PSEE);
(2)  Empowennent, Restructuring, and Performance Improvement (ERPI);
(3)  ICT for Public Service Delivery; and
(4)  Performance-based Replenishment (PR)
These are described in detail below and depicted in figure 4.

(Urban and DLDP)
Component 1. Public Sector Enabling Environment (PSEE)
The PSEE Component aims to strengthen the enabling environment within which public institutions (for
example, MABs, woredas, municipalities, revenue authorities, and justice institutions) function. It is
envisaged that this component would support a broad menu of activities or prototypes (described in
detailed in section A 2.1 ) covering the following areas:
*   Expenditure, revenue, and personnel management systemsPrototypes for expenditure and
personnel management have been developed under the Resource Management and Control
Sub-Program of the CSRP. Those for enhancing revenue performance will be supported under
the Tax Reform Sub-Program of NCBP;
*   Accountability, transparency, and anti-corruption: Prototypes for strengthening both fiduciary
and operational accountability are being developed under the Urban Management and
District-level Decentralization Sub-programs with support from the Bank and other donors;
*   Enabling legislation and intergovernmentalfiscal systems.Prototypes for establishing a robust
intergovernmental system-including the expenditure and revenue assignments-are being
developed under the CBDSD Project and will be included the menu of activities financed under
this component;
*   Legal and policy framework for Justice, Tax, and ICT sect&hring PSCAP preparation,
prototypes for strengthening the incentive and accountability framework in each of these sectors
will be identified and incorporated.

ISDS
The federal and all regional governments will be eligible to apply for capacity building support in one or
more of the areas under the PSEE Component, although the first phase of the program will involve the
initial implementation in three regions, selected on a demand-driven basis. The PSEE menu and
operational manual will be developed over the course of PSCAP preparation.
Component 2. Empowerment, Restructuring, and Performance Improvement (ERPI)
The ERPI Component aims to empower MABs, local governments, and justice sector institutions to
review their legislative mandates, functions, institutional capacity, structures and systems, as well as
demand-responsiveness; develop performance improvement plans to be implemented with PSCAP funds;
and then implement the measures (for example, restructuring, development of institutional charters,
performance benchmarking) necessary to realize frontline performance gains. Overall, this Component
will offer a demand-driven modality to channel support to the restructuring and performance
improvement of a broad array of institutions participating in NCBP (for example, functional
decentralization under the DLDP, restructuring under Urban Management, and the PSIP under the CSRP.
Operational manuals, which were developed for PSIP and local government restructuring under the
CBDSD Project, will be appropriately refined and harmonized for the purposes of the ERPI Component
Depending on its type (MAB, local government, justice sector institution), a beneficiary institution would
need to meet clearly defined eligibility criteria (including the submission of performance improvement
plans) before receiving support. Upon receiving PSCAP funds, the implementation of performance
improvement plans would be rigorously monitored. All MABs, local governments, and relevant justice
sector institutions (for example, courts) will be eligible for support under the ERPI component, although
the first phase of the program will likely involve the participation of 10% of MABs, 15% of woredas,
10% of municipalities, and 10% of justice sector institutions, selected on a demand-driven basis.
During PSCAP preparation, the Bank and the Government will review options for allowing private and
public training institutions to apply for ERPI resources.  Under ERPI, training institutions could
undertake restructuring (including review of legal status and governance arrangements), specialized
training for staff, and various performance improvement measures. A key output for training institutions
would be their ability to meet pre-qualification requirements to bid for bulk training contracts under
PSCAP. Allowing training institutions to participate in ERPI will depend on the national training
strategy currently being developed under the CBDSD Project.
Component 3. Information, Communication, Technology for Public Service Delivery (ICT)
This ICT Component aims to achieve rapid, yet sustainable ICT penetration in federal, regional, local,
and civil society institutions for the purposes of improving public service delivery at all levels. While
support for the policy and legal framework for effective ICT penetration is to be financed under the
PSEE Component, there is considerable demand for specific investment and capacity building in the nuts
and bolts of ICT development in public institutions. Such investments in principle cover a wide array of
activities from the implementation of Government-wide information systems to improve core public
management functions to the use of distance learning technologies to facilitate public sector training.
Taken together, it is envisaged that the ICT Component could support a menu of activities that includes
facilities improvement, connectivity, applications development, and specialized training. Access rules
would place a premium on institutional arrangements that promote financial sustainability, indigenous
capacity building, strong linkages to the market, and an applications-driven approach to investments in
ICT. Further work on identifying eligible institutions as well as access rules will be carried out during
PSCAP preparation.
Component 4. Performance-based Replenishment (PR)

ISDS
The PR Component is designed to provide greater flexibility and reward implementation
progress across the PSEE, ERPI, and ICT Components PSCAP. Specifically, resources under
this Component will be used to replenish Components 1-3 based on their disbursement and
implementation performance. It is expected that the Monitoring and Evaluation Department of
MCB will undertake rigorous and quarterly performance reviews of each Component. These
performance reviews will be submitted to the PSCAP Steering Committee and provide a basis
for awarding performance-based replenishments (PR) or allocating resources away from poor
performance Components on an annual basis.

B. Check Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments: The project preparation process has revealed that there is no need for an
investment/rehab component in PSCAP since the Government has decide to "course" fiscal support
for investment at the local level through the intergovernmental fiscal system within regions.
PSCAP is a federal level specific purpose grant for capacity building (NOT fiscal support for
investment in rehab)

The project preparation process has revealed that there is no need for an investment/rehab component in
PSCAP since the Government has decide to "course" fiscal support for investment at the local level
through the intergovernmental fiscal system within regions PSCAP is a federal level specific purpose
grant for capacity building (NOT fiscal support for investment in rehab)
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
PSCAP is designed around demand-driven approach to capacity building support. Key beneficiaries and
stakeholders in this Program-namely, federal, regional, and local government institutions; the courts;
public and private training institutions; local communities and civil society institutions-are centrally
involved in identifying and applying for capacity building and fiscal support.
E. Safeguards Classiflcation. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
