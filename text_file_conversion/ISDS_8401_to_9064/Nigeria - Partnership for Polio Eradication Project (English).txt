I.A.2. I'roject Objectives:
The overall goal of this project is to assist Nigeria in its efforts to eradicate child morbidity and mortality
due to Poliomyelitis. More specifically, the objective is to provide the additional polio vaccine required
to carry out the intensification of Nigeria's ongoing polio eradication program during 2003-2005.
This project is part of a multi-country polio eradication program and will contribute to a key global
public good.
The polio eradication effort globally is in its final stages. Globally $ 2.2 billion has been spent to date,
with a further US$ 725 required for the period 2003-2005. US$ 425 in pledges and projection are in place
against this requirement, leaving a gap of $275 million to finish the job. Most of the money is needed to
finance national and cross-border activities in the final few countries that were still polio-endemic at the
end of 2001. Nigeria is one of these countries. It is estimated that Nigeria faces an oral polio
vaccinefunding gap of approximately $ 27 million for planned supplementary polio activities during
2003 and 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project would support the acceleration/intensification of the National Polio Eradication Program by
providing timely and adequate supplies of the polio vaccine for immunizing children under five years of
age. It would have a single component: procurement of polio vaccines through UNICEF for the
supplementary polio activities carried out during 2003 and 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005 (with
financing required to be in place 4 months before scheduled activities). UNICEF will supply the polio
vaccine to the country in a direct agreement with the Bank. The Agency is already the established
supplier for polio vaccine in Nigeria.
Other components of Nigeria's National Polio Eradication Program would be financed by the GON with

contributions from other donors.
Components:
Oral Polio Vaccine Procurement
Supplemental Operations
Surveillance: Epidemiological
Surveillance: Laboratory
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project has a national coverage and is supposed to cover all children in the target age-groups. The
project's impact will make the children immune to the wild polio virus, while non-vaccinated children will
be partially protected through herd immunity.
The vaccination program and procurement of vaccines is coordinated at the federal level. From there
vaccines are distributed to all 36 states. The project will not create any new structures, but be implemented
through the existing federal and state structures with the assistance of lUNICEF and WHO.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments.
The project which entails the procurement of oral polio vaccines will need to dispose of the small plastic
vials which contain the vaccine for up-to-ten children. This will be doine in accordance with WHO
guidelines for polio vaccination campaigns. These vials are not contaminated since they have not been in
physical contact with any patient. No sharps such as needles or vial cutters are involved in the oral
vaccination methods. Therefore, the program has no infected medical waste.
Since the project will finance a specific activity of limited character under the present program of the
Ministry of Health, which receives sector-wide support under the Health Systems Development 11, it is
deemecl not necessary that a new enviromental assessment be carried out. A Multi Sectoral AIDS project
(The HIV/AIDS Program Development Project) also has been prepared recently.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
None.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
The project will contribute to the eradication of poliomyelitis, which is a global good.
Il.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N.A.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The distribution of the vaccines will be accompanied by training on the safe disposal of the used vials.
Leaflets on safe procedures will also be provided.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The Polio Eradication Program has established a framework for broad, on-going participation largely
through the Interagency Coordination Committee (ICC). This mechanism includes representatives from:
(i) key government ministries/departments; (ii) multilateral agencies (UNICEF and WHO); (iii)
bilateral agencies (CIDA, NORAD, Governments of Japan, he Netherlands and Ireland, the EU, DFID,
USAID, CDC); (iv) NGOs; and, (v) community mobilization and media experts. The ICC meets
regularly to review needs and strategies of the national polio eradication program, and assess
performance of supplementary immunization activities.
The Program has achieved a coverage of around 90% for the last few years by placing high priority on
mobilizing participation of the beneficiaries as well as the key stakeholders.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[  S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. - No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
