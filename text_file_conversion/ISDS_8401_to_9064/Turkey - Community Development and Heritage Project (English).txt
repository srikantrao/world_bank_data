I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective is to improve local socioeconomic development through a
replicable pilot upgrading of the urban cultural heritage site of Mardin utilizing a community
partnership approach to the management of cultural assets.
The project will harness community participation in urban upgrading and cultural site
management. It will pilot this approach in the historic urban site of Mardin, and will strengthen
the country's institutional capacity to manage cultural assets with an eye to local development.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project would consist of the following components:
A. Mardin Urban Upgrading Component. This component was developed in partnership with UNDP
and comprises a set of interventions in the old town that will involve civil society to improve the town's
public spaces, historic structures and limited infrastructure improvements, with the objective of
improving livability, local economic and environmental conditions and preserving the town's
architectural legacy. UNDP has been involved in the engagement of the Mardin community under its
Local Agenda 21 in Mardin since October 2000, and has laid the foundation for the preparation and
implementation of this component on a participatory basis. The community was instrumental in
identifying the elements of this component and is ready to participate in the implementation. UNDP has
also prepared architectural surveys for parts of the historic city and built functional ties and institutional
relations with local community groups and the municipality through the UNDP's Local Agenda 21

program. This component includes the following:
(1)Small Grants Scheme.- This component provides funds for three types of renovations for
protective and architectural purposes. (i) exterior of historic homes for interested residents; (ii)
exterior improvements to shops in the commercial district for interested traders or shopkeepers; and
(iii) exterior improvements to important religious buildings supported by religious foundations, who
will continue to use their premises. Grants could also be provided to new small entrepreneurs in
culture-based industries such as arts, crafts and masonry stone carving required for preservation, to
improve or expand their businesses in traditional arts and crafts, and to meet expected new demand.
In kind contribution will be required from beneficiaries. Selection criteria would give priority to
applicants with entrepreneurial activities with potential to improve economic conditions in the town,
as well address the needs for renovation of the poorer households. A manual outlining the selection
criteria and process is prepared for the guidance of the Mardin Project Implementation Unit. The
Mardin Citizen Council will have the responsibility for the application of the guidelines for a proper
and transparent selection process.
(2)A Public Buildings Renovation Program This sub-component provides funding for restoration
work on the streetscape areas and the renovation of important public buildings and squares Three
buildings were identified and their future use decided. (i) the Kassimiyeh School will be converted
and equipped to be used by the local community as a culture center; (ii) the Zinceriyeh School will
be renovated, and parts of it will be equipped to be used as a public library; and (iii) the Caravan
Sarai area and structure will be renovated to convert its use from a parking area into an arts and
crafts center with shops to be used by local trades people.
(3)Streetscape and Urban Services Improvements:This sub-component provides for a street
improvement program to restore public areas, such as squares, fountains, and the main route
connecting the Citadel at the top of the hill to the Market at the end of the town, and passing through
the main town attractions. The works will include improvements to the water, waste water and
drainage system to take advantage of the overall street repair. The underground work will include
repair of water and waste water leakages. Leakage detection and prevention have a positive effect
on improving the lives of the population whose homes may suffer unsanitary conditions, while at the
same time addressing the damage caused by leakages and humidity to cultural buildings. This
sub-component also includes landscaping, better solid waste collection and management in the city.
Related to water supply improvement and taking advantage of the work, in an effort to improve the
lives of the Mardin residents, the Ministry of Culture, in its holistic approach to Mardin
development has agreed to finance the construction of a water storage tank at the northeast site of
the city which is expected to improve water distribution, cut down on water stoppages, and
contribute to better water supply and water saving efforts of the town.
(4)A Program of Community Support This sub-component would provide financial support in the
form of grants to community initiated programs including training, public information in support of
the project activities, support for ongoing youth and women programs, as well as support to carry on
the activities of the local council for the 5-year period of the project. This sub-component also
includes technical assistance in municipal management to the Municipality of Mardin and the
Citizen's Council, particularly in the area of cultural heritage including a Mardin Development
strategy, support for a leak detection program to assist the city in its future initiatives to improve
basic services This sub-component includes the monitoring and evaluation of physical progress,
and socio-economic and environmental impact of the project.
(5)Mardin Project Implementation Unit This sub-component finances the operation of the Mardin

ISDS
PIU to undertake the project in accordance with Bank guidelines.
B. Institution Strengthening (IS) Component. The objective of this component is to strengthen
MOC's capacity to manage heritage sites nationally through broad based participation with
nongovernment organizations and universities in and outside Turkey to further capture the
economic/community development benefits associated with the country's cultural heritage assets.
This component includes:
(I)Policy Oriented Activities This sub-component would allow the Ministry of Culture to have
reviewed its legal framework that appears to have overlaps in jurisdiction with other government
agencies. A dialogue with these agencies to better streamline responsibilities would enable the
Ministry to undertake its responsibilities over the vast cultural wealth of Turkey in cooperation with
other interested parties in order to leverage the Ministry's resources. This effort would be supported
by a community outreach effort on the part of the Ministry of culture, through a series of workshops
to learn about international best practices, as well as outreach to local communities and
culture-based agencies in Turkey. This sub-component also includes an advisor for site management
who will dedicate 50% of the time for the Pamukkale/Hierapolis site, and 50% to advise the MOC
on institutional strengthening. These efforts will be strengthened by the development of Turkey's
Cultural Policy.
(2) Custodial / Curatorial Management: This sub-component is designed to strengthen the Ministry
of Culture's role in its main activities conservation and inventory to better manage cultural assets
The objective is to leverage the Ministry's resources and knowledge with those existing outside
The sub-component supports two activities: (i) strengthening the nationwide conservation system to
revive and utilize traditional conservation techniques that are at risk of being lost due to advent of
modern building techniques. There is need to upgrade knowledge and technology of existing
conservation centers, with emphasis on promoting the Istanbul Conservation center as a center of
excellence of conservation in Turkey and possibly in the larger region. Five other regional
conservation centers will also be strengthened through provision of equipment and training and
increased networking with the center; (ii) inventory of cultural sites; which would coordinate the
establishment of a nationwide inventory system to identify, map and classify archeological/cultural
assets according to modem curatorial criteria and local economic development potential. This
activity is now undertaken by several agencies inside and outside the government. These activities
form the basic elements for the better management of the vast wealth of Turkey's cultural heritage
Identifying cultural assets and their surrounding communities through a comprehensive inventory,
and engaging the communities in the conservation of their assets forms the foundation for protectiig
these assets and managing them in the long term.
(3)Project Implementation This component would support the project management units, and
would include consultancy services for technical expertise, project monitoring, mid-term and final
studies for monitoring and evaluation, travel, training and equipment.
L.A.4 Project Location- (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Mardin, is a medium-size town in the southeastern part of Turkey overlooking the Mesopotamian
plain and close to the Syrian border. Mardin falls within the Euphrates watershed area. The
investment part of the project will target the urban historic part of the town which incorporates

ISDS
several ethnic groups and their architecture, largely dating back to the 1600 - 1800's. The majority of
the investment is small scale upgrading, and would in fact have a positive impact on the environment.
Interventions would include fixing drainage and water supply systems that may be leaking in parts, as
well as trash collection from the streets.  Specific environmental mitigation plans are included in
these components.
Residents of Mardin. There are approximately 55,000 people living in and around old Mardin. The
average household size is between six and seven members, and the education level is slightly below
the national average (only twenty per cent of all heads of household included high school or
vocational school graduates). The population is religiously and ethnically diverse and speak different
languages such as Arabic, Aramic and Kurdish, as well as Turkish of course. In old Mardin the
primary source of household income is from civil service wages. In new Mardin and the surrounding
squatter settlements the primary source of income is self-employment. Unemployment in old Mardin
is high (41 percent of households had at least one unemployed household member).
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The project is rated B because it involves rehabilitation work. Investments are for rehabilitation
purposes and no major construction is included Investments do not divert natural resources from their
current uses. The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact provided appropriate
environmental mitigation plans are undertaken - which would be ensured under the project. A National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was prepared by the State Planning Organization in May 1998 with
Bank assistance. The NEAP proposes a number of actions for developing an effective environmental
management system; emphasizes the need for enhancing environmental information and awareness; and
builds the first steps to adopt EU environmental standards and regulations at a feasible pace for integration
with the EU in the long term.
Mardin derives its water sources from underground aquifers, and discharges wastewater into the valley
below Project activities do not affect any surface water, nor will any considerable additional amount of
water be required from or discharged into the underground aquifers. Therefore impact on international
waters is not foreseen.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.



5
ISDS
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
Environmental:
The construction activities and Mardin will have some transient negative impacts. Even though the
proposed works are small, extra caution will be applied when carrying out these works since the
project is located in a sensitive area.
An environmental management plan was prepared by the Government and reviewed by the Bank It
includes (i) a description of the environmental issues, mitigation and monitoring plan,
responsibilities for implementation, institutional strengthening and training activities, and costs of
the proposed measures; (ii) public consultation to discuss the environmental aspects and identify and
discuss any issues which may represent potential regional reputational risk.  The EMP was
disclosed in the country and in the Bank's Info shop.
The EMP highlights the environmental and cultural sensitivities of the area. Noise, dust, removal of
debris, safety of workers and visitors, design of sanitation system, the cleaning of latrines and solid
waste are all considered within the context of threats to the urban natural surroundings  Project
monitoring in the area will also ensure adherence to the EMP. The same attention to environmental
and cultural aspects will be required for the whole project regardless of financing sources. Where
necessary, environmental assessments will be taken prior to any new construction.
The Mardin component has a small grants scheme to provide funds for minor renovation and repairs
to improve the facades of homes, religious buildings and shops. Public buildings and spaces will
also be renovated. Proper procedures will be established for the implementing agency to ensure that
the grants are not given for any hazardous activity, and that the recipients will use the funds in an
environmentally appropriate manner. The EMP has identified a list of materials that are not to be
used (e.g. fake material, asbestos, toxic material, harsh abrasives, lead based fluids), and
recommended others to be avoided, where possible (e.g. mosquito repellants). Care will be taken in
the selection of construction materials, use of paints and varnishes, disposal of construction debris
etc. A list of activities/materials not eligible for the grant is developed within the EMP to help the
implementing agency in screening the proposals. Bank-supported interventions would involve
rehabilitation investments in public buildings and squares as well as investments in street
improvements, water and waste water rehabilitation, a small water storage tank (1500 cubic meters),
garbage collection and drainage repair in the old town. These undertakings will be based on small
contracts with particular attention to environmental standards including safety, noise abatement and
disposal of debris, as well as maintaining the cultural integrity of the town.
All terms of references and technical specifications will require attention to environmental and
cultural aspects of the activities.
Cultural:
The project is designed to protect and enhance the use of cultural assets in Mardin with a view to
sustainability and enhancing their benefits to the local community. No controversial issues are
expected since the project aims to protect cultural assets, and to manage them in an environmentally
and socially sustainable way The Ministry of Culture is the custodian for cultural assets in Turkey,
and has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring adherence to Turkish laws. Technical assistance and



6
ISDS
training is provided. Prior to the start of construction activities, contractors will be required to take
the EMP into consideration to verify the impact of any construction activities on the cultural assets
in the site, to avoid damage to such assets, and to determine action necessary to protect significant
cultural assets that may be discovered during the construction, in accordance with the Bank's policy
on culture, and Turkish law covering the protection of archeological sites. Implementation units
will have access to international and local expertise in the cultural and environmental areas. Terms
of Reference for consultants, teams of designers and contractors, and technical specifications for
contracts will all pay particular attention to the need for care, adherence to highest standard of
protection, and adherence to Turkish laws in this area. Consultant design and supervision teams and
contractors will be required to have the necessary skills to address issues of cultural and
environmental concerns.
Other Safeguard Issues Considered:
Resettlement:  Given the existence of squatter settlements in Mardin, the Bank team
investigated, and discussed with the Government the possibility of a resettlement action
taking place in Mardin. The squatters live in houses outside the periphery of Mardin old
town, where the physical investments will take place as well as outside the declared historic
district. The project itself does not require any movement of these settlements. The
Government also provided assurances that it had no plans for relocation of these squatter
settlements which are generally not uncommon in Turkey as a whole. Given that the project
does not require any movement of the population from the settlements close to Old Mardin,
the Bank's policy on resettlement is not required for Mardin.
International Waterways: The Bank team investigated the impact of project interventions in
Mardin on the international waterways in discussions with environmental consultants and
municipal officials responsible for water and wastewater services. Mardin falls within the
watershed of the Euphrates River. Mardin derives all its waters from underground aquifers
and discharges the waste water into a valley down the hill. No water is extracted from or
discharged into surface water. In addition, the project interventions are small and aim to fix
leakages in the pipe system within the city. Such intervention does not require additional
water extraction or cause additional discharge. The proposed construction of a new tank on
the northeast side of the city aims to better the distribution of water, given that the whole city
gets its water from one distribution point. This is inefficient and causes frequent stoppages
in order to serve the different parts of the city at different times. The population stores water
when it is available, but tends to replace the stored water with fresh water when service is
restored. Therefore, better distribution and leakage control interventions are thus expected
to prevent waste. Given that there is no need for additional extraction of water or discharge
of wastewater into surface or underground water, the project does not have an impact on
international waterways, and the Bank's operational policy on international waterways does
not apply.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
It is expected that the cumulative impacts will be positive for the safeguard policies

ISDS
concerned. On the environmental frontapplication of Bank standards of implementation,
monitoring and evaluation for Mardin will ensure that high standards of environmentally
sound procedures are adopted. Consultative approaches with the local community and local
NGOs and the inclusion of public information will increase awareness of the local
population to the importance of the site. On the cultural front, the situation is similar in that
the Government is looking to reverse previous damage in Mardin, which was caused by
years of neglect and difficult economic circumstances. The Government is building on the
community's attachment to a unique historic town, and aims to provide further incentives for
upgrading the historic center. The Government is looking to apply standards to provide the
discipline, knowledge and application of modern urban management methodologies and
community development concepts which would enhance the benefits and significance of the
site, while maintaining the high standards required in this field. In addition, technical
assistance and studies would provide the necessary collaborative approaches with
institutions that are leaders in the field.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
The cleaning up of the Mardin historic urban area will build the foundations and provide
incentive for better operations and maintenance of the area to provide positive long term
impacts that is likely to spill over to surrounding settlements.
I1.D 2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not Applicable.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Environment Management Plan has been accepted by the Government, and will become,
through reference, part of the legal agreement between the World Bank and the Government of
Turkey, thus ensuring their implementation as part of the project. The EMP has been made
public through the Bank's InfoSho and through the Ministry's website in Turkey. All contracts
for works, goods and consulting services will require appropriate attention to environmental and
cultural safeguards. The project units will have access to appropriate skills to monitor project
activities.
On the Environmental front, the Republic of Turkey has high standards for environmental
protection that incorporate a consultative process. An Environmental Management Plan covering
the project has been prepared by the Government following consultations with the affected
communities and in discussion with government agencies. The EMP was reviewed by the Bank
The Government has made the EMP public.
On the Cultural front, the objective of the project is to protect cultural assets through local
participation in the process in order to harness the economic potential of such assets. Protection
of cultural assets is in line with the Bank's safeguard policies.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The stakeholders for the overall project include agencies of the national government (including



8
ISDS
Ministry of Culture, Tourism, Environment), local government, local project beneficiaries as well as
visitors to the sites. A social assessment has been undertaken, and consultation was undertaken
within these assessments. Monitoring indicators and evaluation mechanisms for the resettled
households are developed. The EMP was discussed with stakeholders.
In Mardin, the consultative approach has been ongoing for over two years since project
identification with assistance from UNDP under its Local Agenda 21 program in Turkey. Given the
specific circumstances of Mardin, its distance from the central government, the mix of ethnic and
religious backgrounds of its population, and the work already done by the UNDP, the Ministry of
Culture requested that the UNDP continue its role in Mardin to ensure the continuation of the
consultative and participatory process.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.

I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The project development objective is to improve local socioeconomic development through a
replicable pilot upgrading of the urban cultural heritage site of Mardin utilizing a community
partnership approach to the management of cultural assets.
The project will harness community participation in urban upgrading and cultural site
management. It will pilot this approach in the historic urban site of Mardin, and will strengthen
the country's institutional capacity to manage cultural assets with an eye to local development.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project would consist of the following components:
A. Mardin Urban Upgrading Component. This component was developed in partnership with UNDP
and comprises a set of interventions in the old town that will involve civil society to improve the town's
public spaces, historic structures and limited infrastructure improvements, with the objective of
improving livability, local economic and environmental conditions and preserving the town's
architectural legacy. UNDP has been involved in the engagement of the Mardin community under its
Local Agenda 21 in Mardin since October 2000, and has laid the foundation for the preparation and
implementation of this component on a participatory basis. The community was instrumental in
identifying the elements of this component and is ready to participate in the implementation. UNDP has
also prepared architectural surveys for parts of the historic city and built functional ties and institutional
relations with local community groups and the municipality through the UNDP's Local Agenda 21

program. This component includes the following:
(1)Small Grants Scheme: This component provides funds for three types of renovations for
protective and architectural purposes. (i) exterior of historic homes for interested residents; (ii)
exterior improvements to shops in the commercial district for interested traders or shopkeepers; and
(iii) exterior improvements to important religious buildings supported by religious foundations, who
will continue to use their premises. Grants could also be provided to new small entrepreneurs in
culture-based industries such as arts, crafts and masonry stone carving required for preservation, to
improve or expand their businesses in traditional arts and crafts, and to meet expected new demand.
In kind contribution will be required from beneficiaries.  Selection criteria would give priority to
applicants with entrepreneurial activities with potential to improve economic conditions in the town,
as well address the needs for renovation of the poorer households. A manual outlining the selection
criteria and process is prepared for the guidance of the Mardin Project Implementation Unit The
Mardin Citizen Council will have the responsibility for the application of the guidelines for a proper
and transparent selection process.
(2)A Public Buildings Renovation Program This sub-component provides funding for restoration
work on the streetscape areas and the renovation of important public buildings and squares. Three
buildings were identified and their future use decided. (i) the Kassimiyeh School will be converted
and equipped to be used by the local community as a culture center; (ii) the Zinceriyeh School will
be renovated, and parts of it will be equipped to be used as a public library; and (iii) the Caravan
Sarai area and structure will be renovated to convert its use from a parking area into an arts and
crafts center with shops to be used by local trades people.
(3)Streetscape and Urban Services Inmprovements.This sub-component provides for a street
improvement program to restore public areas, such as squares, fountains, and the main route
connecting the Citadel at the top of the hill to the Market at the end of the town, and passing through
the main town attractions. The works will include improvements to the water, waste water and
drainage system to take advantage of the overall street repair. The underground work will include
repair of water and waste water leakages. Leakage detection and prevention have a positive effect
on improving the lives of the population whose homes may suffer unsanitary conditions, while at the
same time addressing the damage caused by leakages and humidity to cultural buildings. This
sub-component also includes landscaping, better solid waste collection and management in the city.
Related to water supply improvement and taking advantage of the work, in an effort to improve the
lives of the Mardin residents, the Ministry of Culture, in its holistic approach to Mardin
development has agreed to finance the construction of a water storage tank at the northeast site of
the city which is expected to improve water distribution, cut down on water stoppages, and
contribute to better water supply and water saving efforts of the town.
(4)A Program of Conmmunity Support This sub-component would provide financial support in the
form of grants to community initiated programs including training, public information in support of
the project activities, support for ongoing youth and women programs, as well as support to carry on
the activities of the local council for the 5-year period of the project This sub-component also
includes technical assistance in municipal management to the Municipality of Mardin and the
Citizen's Council, particularly in the area of cultural heritage including a Mardin Development
strategy, support for a leak detection program to assist the city in its future initiatives to improve
basic services. This sub-component includes the monitoring and evaluation of physical progress,
and socio-economic and environmental impact of the project.
(5)Mardin Project Implementation Unit: This sub-component finances the operation of the Mardin

PIU to undertake the project in accordance with Bank guidelines
B. Institution Strengthening (IS) Component. The objective of this component is to strengthen
MOC's capacity to manage heritage sites nationally through broad based participation with
nongovernment organizations and universities in and outside Turkey to further capture the
economic/community development benefits associated with the country's cultural heritage assets.
This component includes:
(l)Policy Oriented Activities. This sub-component would allow the Ministry of Culture to have
reviewed its legal framework that appears to have overlaps in jurisdiction with other government
agencies. A dialogue with these agencies to better streamline responsibilities would enable the
Ministry to undertake its responsibilities over the vast cultural wealth of Turkey in cooperation with
other interested parties in order to leverage the Ministry's resources. This effort would be supported
by a community outreach effort on the part of the Ministry of culture, through a series of workshops
to learn about international best practices, as well as outreach to local communities and
culture-based agencies in Turkey. This sub-component also includes an advisor for site management
who will dedicate 50% of the time for the Pamukkale/Hierapolis site, and 50% to advise the MOC
on institutional strengthening. These efforts will be strengthened by the development of Turkey's
Cultural Policy.
(2)Custodial / Curatorial Management: This sub-component is designed to strengthen the Ministry
of Culture's role in its main activities conservation and inventory to better manage cultural assets
The objective is to leverage the Ministry's resources and knowledge with those existing outside
The sub-component supports two activities: (i) strengthening the nationwide conservation system to
revive and utilize traditional conservation techniques that are at risk of being lost due to advent of
modern building techniques. There is need to upgrade knowledge and technology of existing
conservation centers, with emphasis on promoting the Istanbul Conservation center as a center of
excellence of conservation in Turkey and possibly in the larger region. Five other regional
conservation centers will also be strengthened through provision of equipment and training and
increased networking with the center; (ii) inventory of cultural sites; which would coordinate the
establishment of a nationwide inventory system to identify, map and classify archeological/cultural
assets according to modern curatorial criteria and local economic development potential. This
activity is now undertaken by several agencies inside and outside the government. These activities
form the basic elements for the better management of the vast wealth of Turkey's cultural heritage.
Identifying cultural assets and their surrounding communities through a comprehensive inventory,
and engaging the communities in the conservation of their assets forms the foundation for protecting
these assets and managing them in the long term.
(3)Project Implementation This component would support the project management units, and
would include consultancy services for technical expertise, project monitoring, mid-term and final
studies for monitoring and evaluation, travel, training and equipment.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Mardin, is a medium-size town in the southeastern part of Turkey overlooking the Mesopotamian
plain and close to the Syrian border. Mardin falls within the Euphrates watershed area. The
investment part of the project will target the urban historic part of the town which incorporates



4
ISDS
several ethnic groups and their architecture, largely dating back to the 1600 - 1800's. The majority of
the investment is small scale upgrading, and would in fact have a positive impact on the environment.
Interventions would include fixing drainage and water supply systems that may be leaking in parts, as
well as trash collection from the streets.  Specific environmental mitigation plans are included in
these components.
Residents of Mardin. There are approximately 55,000 people living in and around old Mardin. The
average household size is between six and seven members, and the education level is slightly below
the national average (only twenty per cent of all heads of household included high school or
vocational school graduates). The population is religiously and ethnically diverse and speak different
languages such as Arabic, Aramic and Kurdish, as well as Turkish of course. In old Mardin the
primary source of household income is from civil service wages. In new Mardin and the surrounding
squatter settlements the primary source of income is self-employment. Unemployment in old Mardin
is high (41 percent of households had at least one unemployed household member).
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The project is rated B because it involves rehabilitation work. Investments are for rehabilitation
purposes and no major construction is included. Investments do not divert natural resources from their
current uses. The project is expected to have a positive environmental impact provided appropriate
environmental mitigation plans are undertaken - which would be ensured under the project. A National
Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) was prepared by the State Planning Organization in May 1998 with
Bank assistance. The NEAP proposes a number of actions for developing an effective environmental
management system. emphasizes the need for enhancing environmental information and awareness, and
builds the first steps to adopt EU environmental standards and regulations at a feasible pace for integration
with the EU in the long term.
Mardin derives its water sources from underground aquifers, and discharges wastewater into the valley
below. Project activities do not affect any surface water, nor will any considerable additional amount of
water be required from or discharged into the underground aquifers. Therefore impact on international
waters is not foreseen.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data



5
ISDS
Il.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental:
The construction activities and Mardin will have some transient negative impacts. Even though the
proposed works are small, extra caution will be applied when carrying out these works since the
project is located in a sensitive area.
An environmental management plan was prepared by the Gov,ernment and reviewed by the Bank. It
includes (i) a description of the environmental issues, mitigation and monitoring plan,
responsibilities for implementation, institutional strengthening and training activities, and costs of
the proposed measures; (ii) public consultation to discuss the environmental aspects and identify and
discuss any issues which may represent potential regional reputational risk.  The EMP was
disclosed in the country and in the Bank's Info shop.
The EMP highlights the environmental and cultural sensitivities of the area. Noise, dust, removal of
debris, safety of workers and visitors, design of sanitation system, the cleaning of latrines and solid
waste are all considered within the context of threats to the urban natural surroundings.  Project
monitoring in the area will also ensure adherence to the EMP. The same attention to environmental
and cultural aspects will be required for the whole project regardless of financing sources. Where
necessary, environmental assessments will be taken prior to any new construction.
The Mardin component has a small grants scheme to provide funds for minor renovation and repairs
to improve the facades of homes, religious buildings and shops. Public buildings and spaces will
also be renovated. Proper procedures will be established for the implementing agency to ensure that
the grants are not given for any hazardous activity, and that the recipients will use the funds in an
environmentally appropriate manner. The EMP has identified a list of materials that are not to be
used (e.g. fake material, asbestos, toxic material, harsh abrasives, lead based fluids), and
recommended others to be avoided, where possible (e.g. mosquito repellants). Care will be taken in
the selection of construction materials, use of paints and varnishes, disposal of construction debris
etc. A list of activities/materials not eligible for the grant is developed within the EMP to help the
implementing agency in screening the proposals. Bank-supported interventions would involve
rehabilitation investments in public buildings and squares as well as investments in street
improvements, water and waste water rehabilitation, a small water storage tank (1500 cubic meters),
garbage collection and drainage repair in the old town. These undertakings will be based on small
contracts with particular attention to environmental standards including safety, noise abatement and
disposal of debris, as well as maintaininig the cultural integrity of the town.
All terms of references and technical specifications will require attention to environmental and
cultural aspects of the activities.
Cultural
The project is designed to protect and enhance the use of cultural assets in Mardin with a view to
sustainability and enhancing their benefits to the local community. No controversial issues are
expected since the project aims to protect cultural assets, and to manage them in an environmentally
and socially sustainable way. The Ministry of Culture is the custodian for cultural assets in Turkey,
and has the ultimate responsibility for ensuring adherence to Turkish laws. Technical assistance and



6
ISDS
training is provided. Prior to the start of construction activities, contractors will be required to take
the EMP into consideration to verify the impact of any construction activities on the cultural assets
in the site, to avoid damage to such assets, and to determine action necessary to protect significant
cultural assets that may be discovered during the construction, in accordance with the Bank's policy
on culture, and Turkish law covering the protection of archeological sites. Implementation units
will have access to international and local expertise in the cultural and environmental areas. Terms
of Reference for consultants, teams of designers and contractors, and technical specifications for
contracts will all pay particular attention to the need for care, adherence to highest standard of
protection, and adherence to Turkish laws in this area. Consultant design and supervision teams and
contractors will be required to have the necessary skills to address issues of cultural and
environmental concerns.
Other Safeguard Issues Considered:
Resettlement: Given the existence of squatter settlements in Mardin, the Bank team
investigated, and discussed with the Government the possibility of a resettlement action
taking place in Mardin. The squatters live in houses outside the periphery of Mardin old
town, where the physical investments will take place as well as outside the declared historic
district.  The project itself does not require any movement of these settlements.  The
Government also provided assurances that it had no plans for relocation of these squatter
settlements which are generally not uncommon in Turkey as a whole. Given that the project
does not require any movement of the population from the settlements close to Old Mardin,
the Bank's policy on resettlement is not required for Mardin.
International Waterways: The Bank team investigated the impact of project interventions in
Mardin on the international waterways in discussions with environmental consultants and
municipal officials responsible for water and wastewater services. Mardin falls within the
watershed of the Euphrates River. Mardin derives all its waters from underground aquifers
and discharges the waste water into a valley down the hill. No water is extracted from or
discharged into surface water. In addition, the project interventions are small and aim to fix
leakages in the pipe system within the city. Such intervention does not require additional
water extraction or cause additional discharge. The proposed construction of a new tank on
the northeast side of the city aims to better the distribution of water, given that the whole city
gets its water from one distribution point. This is inefficient and causes frequent stoppages
in order to serve the different parts of the city at different times. The population stores water
when it is available, but tends to replace the stored water with fresh water when service is
restored. Therefore, better distribution and leakage control interventions are thus expected
to prevent waste. Given that there is no need for additional extraction of water or discharge
of wastewater into surface or underground water, the project does not have an impact on
international waterways, and the Bank's operational policy on international waterways does
not apply.
Il.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
It is expected that the cumulative impacts will be positive for the safeguard policies



7
ISDS
concerned. On the environmental frontapplication of Bank standards of implementation,
monitoring and evaluation for Mardin will ensure that high standards of environmentally
sound procedures are adopted. Consultative approaches with the local community and local
NGOs and the inclusion of public information will increase awareness of the local
population to the importance of the site. On the cultural front, the situation is similar in that
the Government is looking to reverse previous damage in Mardin, which was caused by
years of neglect and difficult economic circumstances. The Government is building on the
community's attachment to a unique historic town, and aims to provide further incentives for
upgrading the historic center. The Government is looking to apply standards to provide the
discipline, knowledge and application of modern urban management methodologies and
community development concepts which would enhance the benefits and significance of the
site, while maintaining the high standards required in this field. In addition, technical
assistance and studies would provide the necessary collaborative approaches with
institutions that are leaders in the field.
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
The cleaning up of the Mardin historic urban area will build the foundations and provide
incentive for better operations and maintenance of the area to provide positive long term
impacts that is likely to spill over to surrounding settlements.
Il.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not Applicable.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Environment Management Plan has been accepted by the Government, and will become,
through reference, part of the legal agreement between the World Bank and the Government of
Turkey, thus ensuring their implementation as part of the project. The EMP has been made
public through the Bank's InfoSho and through the Ministry's website in Turkey. All contracts
for works, goods and consulting services will require appropriate attention to environmental and
cultural safeguards. The project units will have access to appropriate skills to monitor project
activities.
On the Environmental front, the Republic of Turkey has high standards for environmental
protection that incorporate a consultative process. An Environmental Management Plan covering
the project has been prepared by the Government following consultations with the affected
communities and in discussion with government agencies. The EMP was reviewed by the Bank.
The Government has made the EMP public.
On the Cultural front, the objective of the project is to protect cultural assets through local
participation in the process in order to harness the economic potential of such assets. Protection
of cultural assets is in line with the Bank's safeguard policies.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The stakeholders for the overall project include agencies of the national government (including



8
ISDS
Ministry of Culture, Tourism, Environment), local government, local project beneficiaries as well as
visitors to the sites. A social assessment has been undertaken, and consultation was undertaken
within these assessments.  Monitoring indicators and evaluation mechanisms for the resettled
households are developed. The EMP was discussed with stakeholders.
In Mardin, the consultative approach has been ongoing for over two years since project
identification with assistance from UNDP under its Local Agenda 21 program in Turkey. Given the
specific circumstances of Mardin, its distance from the central government, the mix of ethnic and
religious backgrounds of its population, and the work already done by the UNDP, the Ministry of
Culture requested that the UNDP continue its role in Mardin to ensure the continuation of the
consultative and participatory process.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts, or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
