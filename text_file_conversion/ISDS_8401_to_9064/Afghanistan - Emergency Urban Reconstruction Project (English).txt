B.  Project Objective
 
 
The objective of the project is to pilot different ways of improving infrastructure service delivery and shelter in 
Kabul, Kandahar and Kunduz in order to enhance the quality of life, health status, and welfare of the all segments of 
the population, especially the disadvantaged, and to support economic growth of the country.  This will be achieved 
by supporting the integration of selected neighborhoods into the urban fabric of participating towns by carrying out 
reconstruction and rehabilitation of basic urban services and enhancing the managerial capacity of the Ministry of 
Urban Development and Housing and the participating towns.  The project would also lay the groundwork for a 
follow-up project aimed at city-wide infrastructure reconstruction and service delivery.,.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION
 
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN] 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
The project will use the Environment and Social Safeguards Framework, already agreed 
to by the Government of Afghanistan, to assess and mitigate safeguards issues  In addition, 
recognizing the emergency nature of the Project, and the related need for providing immediate 
improvement in local urban services, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing 
potential environmental and social risks and implementing the framework, an Environment and 
Social Framework Management Plan (E&SSFMP) will be developed.   The project will also be 
based on the following principles:  
a) 
the proposed project will not support Category A investments, nor investments which require land 
acquisition affecting more than 200 people. 
b) 
activities requiring a more detailed level of assessment will be supported under a subsequent 
operation 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be 
addressed? 
 
Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs of this project.  Prior to 
approval by the World Bank Board, the E&SSF and the E&SSFMP will be disclosed in Afghanistan in Dari and 
Pashto and in the World Bank Infoshop. 
 
IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN 
REVIEW 
The Environment and Social Safeguards Management Plan will be formulated based on the 
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework, already agreed by the Government of 
Afghanistan.  The Plan will include, but not be restricted to, an outline of responsibilities for the 
implementation of the framework. 
 
Agreed target date for Quality Enhancement Review: 
TBD
