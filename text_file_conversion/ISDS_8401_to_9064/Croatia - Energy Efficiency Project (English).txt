I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

The objective of the proposed project is to increase the demand for and supply of energy efficiency
projects and services. This will be achieved by: (i) creating a core developer of energy efficiency
projects within Hrvatska Elektroprivreda d.d. (HEP--the national power utility). This new energy
service company (HESCO) will develop, finance and implement energy efficiency projects on a
commercial, for-profit basis, using local businesses as key delivery agents; and (ii) providing a
framework for other emerging service providers to tap into new energy efficiency business
opportunities.

All project risks--financial, credit, technical--will be shared among project participants, including
HESCO, other energy service companies, energy efficiency equipment providers, commercial banks
and other investors, and end users. HESCO will create demand for energy efficiency services and
equipment and demonstrate the viability of performance-based contracting and investments paid for
out of energy savings.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):

The project has four main components.

Energy efficiency capital investments (US$32.45 million, including a US$5.0 million IBRD loan):
Energy efficiency capital investments will be principally goods, materials and installation works
implemented in the premises of HESCO's and other ESCOs' clients under Energy Saving Contracts.
HEP will on-lend the US$4.95 million World Bank loan to HESCO for procurement of energy
efficiency capital equipment and installation services. Local banks are expected to co-finance
investments with loans of US$13.8 million to HESCO and US$5.5 million to other service providers.
HEP will contribute US$1.0 million in equity financing (in `kind' and in cash) and US$5.7 million of
retained HESCO earnings. Other ESCO owners are expected to contribute US$1.5 million in equity
and retained earnings for projects they implement for their customers. All project financing costs will
be repaid by clients' energy savings.

Client project development costs and early HEP ESCO capital investments (US$3.8 million,
including GEF contingent grant of US$3.6 million). The contingent grant will be used to identify
potential customers and to cover initial project financing. This grant will underwrite the costs to

                                                        2
                                                                                                        ISDS



develop projects, and act as bridge financing to help demonstrate to commercial lenders the reality of
the cash flows created by well-conceived and well-managed energy efficiency investments. These
activities are expected to require US$0.6 million for audit and post-audit project preparation and
US$3.0 million in capital investment at financial closure. These costs will be capitalized in the
project financing if and when financial closure occurs. Only if projects do not move to
implementation will the contingent grant become unrecoverable and considered an incremental cost
to the project activity. The contingent grant will enable HEP ESCO to quickly demonstrate the
viability of energy efficiency projects based on performance contracting.

Enhancing the creditworthiness of HESCO, other project developers and end-users (GEF credit
enhancement facility of US$2 million). US$2.0 million in GEF funds will constitute a Partial Credit
Guarantee Facility to address perceived credit risks associated with the project. First, US$0.8 million
of the facility will help HESCO establish a syndicated commercial loan of about US$10 million to
co-finance initial projects, and mitigate the end user credit risks that HESCO will be exposed to in
conducting its business and financing projects directly. Second, US$1.2 million of the facility will
allow HBOR to underwrite partial credit guarantees for commercial bank loans to end users and
emerging energy service providers. The US$1.2 million in guarantee reserve is expected to leverage
US$3.0-5.5 million in commercial lending for energy efficiency projects not implemented by
HESCO.

Training, information dissemination, outreach, and monitoring and verification (US$1.5 million,
including GEF technical assistance of US$1.4 million). GEF technical assistance will be available to:
HESCO staff and project partners, other energy efficiency businesses, HBOR, and appropriate
nonprofit or consumer groups. An important component is the capacity building and support of sales
that HESCO will receive from a Strategic Partner (International ESCO Management Consultant).

B. Check Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)

Comments: The project is rated "FI" because the speficic energy efficiency invetsments funded by the
IBRD loand and GEF grant will be identified only during project implementation. The project will
yield greater efficiencies in energy use and the investments will reduce fuel consumption and/or
encourage less polluting fuel use that in turn will improve air quality. No investments involving
process changes will be financed under this project. The project would finance subprojects in three
main areas: street lighting, district heating, and building retrofits. Details of the types of subprojects

have been presented by the Borrower in an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) which is part of
the project Environmental Management Framework (EMF) providing the guidelines for
environmental screening and assessment of sub-projects. All subprojects are of a minor nature and
have minor impacts. Most likely Categories are B and C. No A Category subprojects are
aniticipated. HEPs' Development Department would screen projects and then be responsible for
assuring each subproject complies with appropriate Croatian environmental law. Screening,
institutional arrangements and applicable laws/regulations for subproject environmental review are
detailed in the EMF.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Dust and noise impacts from construction and the potential for asbestos materials in replacement of old insulatio
wastes will be in accordance with Croatian regulations. Furthermore, any new insulation materials are asbestos-fr
under Croatia's international commitments, such as the Montreal Protocol. Additional issues are all of a minor na
presented in the Environmental Management Framework (EMF).

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
None

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

                                                     4
                                                                                                        ISDS



The Borrower has prepared an EMF acceptable to the World Bank which details the environmental proceedures t
for screening sub-projects. The EMF identifies specific mitigation and monitoring requirements and institutional
each type subproject. For example, if asbestos is identified in either a building retrofit or district heating subproje
and disposal would be performed by licensed organizations in compliance with Croatian regulations and/or EU r
requirement would be specified in the contractor bid document. Furthermore, any new insulation materials are as
acceptable under Croatia's international commitments, such as the Montreal Protocol.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A strong public participation program to inform the public and to engage key stakeholders
was initiated during project preparation. Nine televised roundtable meetings were conducted
for various stakeholder groups (incl. city authorities, NGOs and consumer groups), together
with publications of articles about the proposed project in the main national newspaper. The
key result of this program to date has been improved understanding of the project and
projec-related environmental issues. The results of these consultative sessions are recorded in
the minutes and form an integral part of the EMF. HEP has incorporated relevant
recommendations in the project design and implementation.

Efforts are under way to continue informing the public and engage key stakeholders. During project
implementation, an NGO will be engaged to develop and implement an outreach program to share
information with the UNDP-GEF energy efficiency project (see above) and to bring together focus
groups of users and project developers.

The project's key stakeholder groups are direct beneficiaries (municipal building managers, district
heating system managers, housing cooperatives, businesses, public service facilities such as schools,
hospitals, and governments), other affected groups (small business associations, energy efficiency
service providers, municipal heating system managers, building designers, manufacturers of
energy-efficient equipment and materials, project service providers, financial organizations), and
other stakeholders (local advocacy groups, students, officials and key staff of city and regional
governments, engineers).

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
          in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[X] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
          similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
          safeguard issues.
