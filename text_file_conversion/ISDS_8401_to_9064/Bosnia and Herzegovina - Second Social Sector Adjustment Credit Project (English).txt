I.A.2. Project Objectives
The overall objective of SOSACII would be to support reforms in cash transfer programs and institutions in
order to protect the poorest and most disabled in a fiscally sustainable manner. This is consistent with
broader efforts to reduce and reorient public spending to priority needs. Specifically, the priority program
goals are to:
* ensure that protection for disabled veterans and survivor families is better focused on the most
disabled, and made more fiscally sustainable;
* improve the impact and efficiency of the social safety net, in particular social assistance and benefits
and programs implemented by the Employment Institutes;
* refine the policy framework for the protection of persons with disabilities, including those on pensions,
social assistance, veterans benefits and civil victims of war; and
* ensure that reforms are done on the basis of better information, both within the system and to the
public.
I.A.3. Project Description
It is proposed that SOSACII be presented to the Bank's Board in FY2002, for an estimated amount of
US$40 million., released in two tranches. The program would be in the areas outlined above, and also be
supported through the Social Sector Technical Assistance Credit (SOTAC).
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.) Adjustment operation with no specific geographical focus.
