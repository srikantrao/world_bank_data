I.A 2. Project Objectives
The overall goal of this project is to assist Pakistan in its efforts to eradicate Poliomyelitis More
specifically, the objective is to provide the additional oral polio vaccine (OPV) required for the
intensification of Pakistan's ongoing polio eradication program during 2003-2005.
This project is part of a multi-country program and will contribute to a global public good: the
eradication of Poliomyelitis by 2005 as aimed for by the World Health Organization (WHO)
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project will support the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative by providing timely and adequate
supplies of polio vaccine for immunizing all children below five years. It will have a single
component: procurement of polio vaccines through UNICEF for the supplementary polio activities
carried out during 2003 and 2004 and in the first quarter of 2005. UNICEF will supply polio
vaccine to the country under a sole source services procurement agreement between the Government
of Pakistan (GOP) and UNICEF. UNICEF is a well-recognized for its expertise in vaccine
procurement and already supplies OPV to Pakistan.
The amount of vaccine needed depends on the needs identified, and regularly adjusted, by the
Technical Advisory Group (TAG) based on the surveillance results. Should surveillance show
unexpectedly good results and not all project funds are eventually needed for the procurement of
OPV for SlAs during 2003-CY 2005, WB funds could be reprogrammed for the procurement of
OPV needed for SIAs in 2006. Should project funds remain unspent and the TAG determines that
SlAs are no longer needed, only then could the remaining funds be used to procure OPV for the
routine immunization program. This is justified because a strong routine immunization program is
essential in the period between the interruption of transmission and polio-free certification. The
procurement methods would remain the same.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project has a national coverage and is expected to cover all children below the age of five. The
project's impact will make the children immune to the wild polio virus, while non-vaccinated
children will be partially protected through herd immunity. The vaccination program and
procurement of vaccines is coordinated at the federal level. From the central EPI cold rooms,
vaccines are distributed to the four provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and North West Frontier
Province, and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The project will not create any new
structures, but be implemented through the existing federal and provincial structures with the
assistance of UNICEF and WHO.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments. The project involves the procurement of oral polio vaccine and will need to dispose of the small
plastic vials which contain the vaccine for up-to-ten children. These vials are not contaminated since these
have not been in physical contact with any patient. The disposal of these vials will be done in accordance
with the WHO guidelines for polio vaccination campaigns. No sharps such as needles or vial cutters are
involved in the oral vaccination methods. Therefore, the program has no infected medical waste.
Since the project will finance a specific activity of limited character under the present program of the
Ministry of Health, which receives sector-wide support under the Second Social Action Program
Project, it is deemed not necessary that a new environmental assessment be carried out. An HIV/AIDS
Prevention Project also has been prepared recently.

Il.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

due to multiple project component.
None
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
The project will contribute to the eradication of poliomyelitis, which is a global good.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
NA
II D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
NA
IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are children below five years of age and their parents, Ministry of Health officials and
other government officials, and NGO and donor representatives. The Polio Eradication Initiative has
established a framework for broad, on-going participation largely through the Inter-Agency
Coordination Committee (ICC). This mechanism includes representatives from: (i) key government
ministries/departments; (ii) multilateral agencies (UNICEF and WHO); (iii) bilateral agencies (DFID,
Governments of Japan, the Netherlands, the EU, USAID, Center for Disease Control Atlanta, etc); (iv)
NGOs; and, (v) community mobilization and media experts. The ICC meets regularly to review needs
and strategies of the polio eradication program, and assess performance of supplementary immunization
activities.
The Program has achieved a coverage of over 80% for the last few years by placing high priority on
mobilizing participation of the beneficiaries as well as the key stakeholders.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
