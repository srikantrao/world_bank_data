L.A 2 Project Objectives:
The objective of the project is to help create the conditions to stimulate a sustained increase in private
investment in Senegal through improved investment climate, greater private participation in economic
activities, and policy sector reform. The project is thus expected to make important incremental
contributions towards Senegal attaining the 8 percent GDP growth called for in the Governmenit's
poverty alleviation program.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The overall objective of the Government's reform program, underpinned by the PRSP, the private sector
development strategy, and other strategic analysis, is to create the conditions to sustain high per-capita
GDP growth of at least 8 percent per-annum  The Government aims to reach this objective through a
series of important policy and sector reforms aimed at eliminating inefficiencies and distortions that lead
to misallocation of resources, constrainilg Senegal's international competitiveness, and through capacity
building  The project will support these initiatives through a series of interrelated actions aimed at
stimulating private investments, and consists of the four mutually reinforcing components described
below. The support under the Credit will be through the financing of consulting services and studies,
goods, computers and equipment, a handful of vehicles, training and minor repairs (civil works).
Project Component I - Improving the Investment Climate

ISDS
The objective of this component is to improve the investment environment, by facilitating the policy,
legal and regulatory interface, and the dialogue process between the public and private sectors. This
objective will be achieved through judicial reform, a better business environment and trade facilitation,
enhanced capacity to regulate infrastructure and resolve post-privatization issues, and by reactivating the
public/private consultative process. The implementation of the proposed activities will facilitate and
expedite private transactions and reduce their costs. The following activities will be supported under this
component: (a) egal and judicial reform; (b) business environment enhancement, covering
administrative barriers and tax reform; (c) trade facilitation, encompassing customs and the
airport; (d) infrastructure regulation; and (e) private-public consultative process.
Project Component 2 - Facilitating Private Participation and Enhancing Competitiveness
In recent years, investment in Senegal has been concentrated in a handful of subsectors. Foreign
Investments have been mainly in infrastructure and, to a lesser extent, mining and export activities,
notably fishing. Construction has been a leader in the formal sector together with tourism and fisheries,
while the informal sector has been providing subsidence living opportunity for a large part of the
workforce. In-spite-of the favorable impact of these investments on Senegal's competitiveness, exports
and growth, employment in the formal private sector has largely stagnated and the outlook for fisheries is
limited. The objective of the private participation component is to: (i) stimulate a higher level of foreign
investment in infrastructure, export-oriented firms and other sectors and broaden private participation in
economic activities; and (ii) increase the productivity of the local private sector. This objective will be
achieved through the implementation of the following subcomponents: (a) investment facilitation
support, encompassing support to API[Xvstment Promotion Agency) funding of strategic
infrastructure studies, and institutional capacity building within key embassies; (b) a matching-grant
facility to improve private sector competiveness; (c) capacity building within support institutions and
private associations; and (d) support to divestiture and oversight of public entities.
Project Component 3 - Stimulating Sector Investment and Implementing Policy Reform
The objective of this component is to promote subsector reforms that would: (i) directly stimulate growth
and development in areas where Senegal benefits from untapped potential; (ii) improve the situation in
other activities that affect ability of the private sector to operate effectively and competitively; and (iii)
free-up public and private resources, whicih would be available to fund pro-poor private initiatives and,
indirectly, finance private investment. The implementation of the subcomponents described below would
be further reinforced by the initiatives described in the previous two components. The implementation of
certain reforms (namely pension, edible oil and postal) would need to be complemented by a significant
amount of financial restructuring that would be financed in part through the proposed private sector
adjustment credit.  The following sectors and areas will be covered: (a) pensions reform; (b)
telecommunication reform and development of the information technology sectorp*4l1
reforms, covering both post and financial services; (d) support to the development of tourism; (e)
promotion of the music industry; and (f) edible oil sector reform.
Project Component 4 - Supporting Implementation and Capacity Building
The project will, in substance, be implemented by beneficiaries. In addition a professional project
management unit (PMU) has been established. This PMU is currently housed within APIX but under the
project will be accountable to the project steering committee. The PMU would oversee the financial
management, procurement, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, audit, public information and related

functions as well as manage a handful of actions the coordination which will be outsourced to a team
leader (e.g. tourism). While most partner organizations have the capabilities to manage the complex
activities supported by the project, strong complementary implementation capacity is needed to ensure
that project objectives are met. The Credit will thus finance a team of high caliber local professionals
located at the PMIJ consisting of a project manager, financial and procurement specialists, program
officer, and the related support staff. The management of the matching-grant will be outsourced to a
team of local and international consultants. This unit will also be responsible for ensuring adequate
monitoring and evaluation, and undertaking the impact assessment of various components, preparing
quarterly progress reports, and facilitating the mid-term review and orderly closing of the project. In
addition to the above, the Credit will also refinance US$1.99 million of PPF resources used to prepare
the project. The component will also finance the following additional activities: (a) public information
and  communication  campaign; (b) strengthening  UPE   (Economic  Manag+m*nt Unit);
implementation and dissemination of the new procurement code.
I A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
This is a reform support project Most of the project activities will take place in Dakar, Capatial of Senegal.

Comments. The objective of the project is to help create the conditions to stimulate a sustained
increase in private investment in Senegal through improved investment climate, greater private
participation in economic activities, and sectot reform. In order to do this, the components consist
of capacity building, addressing policy constraints, and implementing sector reforms. There are no
environmental or safeguard issues.
