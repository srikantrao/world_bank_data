I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

1.       Project development objective:           The development objectives of the proposed Burundi
Agricultural Sector Support and Rehabilitation Project (PRASAB) are to help farmers in the project
areas, through their producer organizations (POs), realize benefits from productive investments and
improved agricultural services, and facilitate continued application of new information and technologies
for ongoing production, while maintaining the POs sustainable. The project would thus contribute to the
Government's and World Bank's strategy goal of reducing rural poverty by improving food security of
smallholder farmers and increasing rural incomes.


The proposed project would support these objectives by financing productivity-raising interventions
among male and female farmers and farmer groups, and by enhancing institutional and technical
capacities of producer organizations and groups related to rural development, and of government
institutions necessary for reviving the rural sector.

The activities of PRASAB would complement those financed by other donors and the Government, and
support the existing strategies and policies established to revive the rural sector.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The proposed project would have four main components, divided into subcomponents that make for
easier implementation and monitoring of the project. The components are:

1.       Promotion of producer organizations' investments and capacity

2.       Development of agricultural services

3.       Project administration and monitoring

1.1      Component 1. Promotion of producer organizations' investments and capacity

                                                        2
                                                                                                         ISDS




(a) Productive investments.        Under this subcomponent the project would finance demand-driven,
productive investments (subprojects) proposed by producer organizations (POs) and the technical
assistance required for effective implementation of these subprojects. Support would be provided as
grants, with up-front beneficiary contribution of at least 15 percent of subproject cost (5 percent in cash).
Productive investments would include productive infrastructure facilities, including support for: (i)
improvement/construction and management of the agricultural production related infrastructures (for
example, small-scale water management schemes, such as small irrigation schemes, hydro-agricultural
retention pools, small ponds, hillside water retention structures, pastoral wells, and small dams or any
other water resource management facilities allowing the channeling of surface and underground water for
agricultural purpose); (ii) improvement of small-scale agro-processing infrastructures and investments for
existing, as well as for new agricultural and livestock products (that could not be financed on credit from
rural financing agencies), especially for nontraditional export crops such as fruits, flowers, vegetables,
essential oils, sugar, rice, and palm oil; and (iii) selected off-farm income generating activities supporting
agriculture, such as workshops for repairing/manufacturing agricultural tools and small equipment.


Furthermore, the project would assist producer organizations in the development and implementation of
integrated ecosystem management plans involving innovative approaches for better soil and water
management, including the application of conservation tillage systems, crop rotation, strip cropping
system, cover crops, terraces and grassed waterways. All subprojects involving infrastructural facilities
would be required to have safeguards for environmental safety.

(b) Enhancing the capacity of producer organizations.              Support to be given would include: (i)
strengthening of organizational, technical and management capacities of producers organizations and
promoting their effective participation in the project's steering committees and decision making process
in order to help their members get better access to input, farming technology, rural finance, and
marketing services, and (ii) developing inter-professional organizations for better management of key
agricultural subsectors. The project would also finance acquisition of small office equipment, in-country
training and workshops, study tours and fellowships, as well as technical assistance.



1. 2     Component 2: Development of agricultural services

(a)      Demand-driven research and extension subprojects. Under this subcomponent the project would
finance, on a grant basis, development and implementation of efficient and demand-driven agricultural
research and extension subprojects for new technologies aimed at: (i) increasing productivity of the
existing farming systems and development of conservation farming techniques (no tillage) to preserve
soil fertility and manage water resources; (ii) facilitating better access to high quality of genetic and
planting material, and (iii) improving the quality of service delivery, including demand-driven extension
and training services. Grants for applied or adaptive research would be provided for themes identified as
priorities by farmers through participatory diagnostic work to be financed with IDA funding. Access to
these grants would be available to private and public research institutions on a competitive basis.

(b)      Institutional development of the Ministry of Agriculture. This subcomponent would facilitate the
reorientation of state activities in the agricultural sector away from direct production, commercialization,
and marketing of agricultural produce and toward the development of regulatory policy frameworks,
quality control, monitoring, and evaluation services. The project would also support building of
institutional capacity in the Ministry of Agriculture, both at the central and decentralized levels, on the
basis of the findings of an analysis by the Diagnostic Trade Integration Studies (DTIS), expected to be

                                                        3
                                                                                                        ISDS



ready in June 2003, which analyze the capacity of both institutional and human resources. Furthermore,
finance would be made available for developing effective management systems for monitoring
investments in the agricultural and rural sector and for improving the effectiveness of thematic research
activities.

(c)       Strengthening service providers. Under this subcomponent, funds would be provided to
reinforce institutional capacities of civil society organizations and private operators and help them
become capable to operate as service providers for POs and effectively promote diversification of income
generating activities. These organizations and operators include NGOs, consulting firms, and
micro-finance institutions. The project would provide grants for improving organizational, technical,
financial management, and business skills among potential service provides to improve the access to and
the quality of services to smallholders. (The project would not provide funds for relending.) The project
would finance acquisition of small office equipment, in-country training and workshops, and study tours.


1.3      Component 3: Project administration and monitoring

The administration and monitoring component would help finance the administration and management of
the project and the monitoring and evaluation of the project activities. The main costs would include
financing the establishment and functioning of a Project Coordinating and Monitoring Unit (PCMU) and
the activities related to a base-line study, continuous monitoring, and periodic evaluation studies,
including the preparation of a project completion report.

Components:



1. Promotion of POs'investment and capacity
2. Development of agricultural services
3. Project Administration and Monitoring



I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
