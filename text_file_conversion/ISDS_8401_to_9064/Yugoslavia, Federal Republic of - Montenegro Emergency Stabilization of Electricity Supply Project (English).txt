I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the proposed project is to test whether, and to what degree, electric power distribution
consumers will improve payment discipline and participate in a loss reduction program in response to an
introduction of remote metering, automated billing and demand side, management (DSM) in pilot areas.
Additional objective is to improve the financial management in the Electric Power Company of
Montenegro (EPCG) through introduction of a modern management information system (MIS) in EPCG.
I.A.3. Project Description:
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed project will have two components:
a.     Power Distribution Pilots
Under this component, funding will be provided for supply and installation of remote metering and
automated billing system in selected distribution areas in Podgorica, Niksic, Herceg Novi and Bijelo
Polje. The automation of metering and billing system will be combined with introduction of new tariff
system, modernization of the financial management system of EPCG and gradual introduction of DSM
techniques in pilot distribution branches. This would enhance the service to distribution consumers and
enable stabilization of electricity supply through the reduction of distribution losses (particularly illegal
consumption of electricity) and improvement of financial condition of EPCG. This component will also
include a provision of technical assistance to EPCG in design, procurment and implementation of
distribution pilots.
b.     Financial Management System

ISDS
This component includes design, supply and installation of a computer-based financial management
system as a part of the corporate Management Information System (MIS) of EPCG. This component will
also provide funding for technical assistance to EPCG in revieweing the company's business process,
preparing bidding documents for procurement of MIS and its implementation in EPCG.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project is located in four urban areas (Podgorica, Niksic, Herceg Novi and Bijelo Polje) and all
activities under the project will be confined to the existing distribution facilities owned and operated by
EPCG. The project seeks to promote a socially responsible behavior and to introduce billing systems
which should make it easier for poor consumers to pay, benefiting both poor and the power utility. Also,
it would reduce implicit subsidies to nonpaying consumers which often belong to a better-off part of the
population. The social risks of undertaking the project are low, as the political situation is improving and
the need to stabilize supply of electricity is widely recognized and accepted as a social priority by all
stakeholders to be involved in pilot projects. Project benefits are not limited to pilot areas and any
obstruction that may come from influential groups (trying to continue illegal use of electricity) would be
isolated and unacceptable to the public. The Bank's reputation is likely to benefit from the project as a
result of improved supply of electricity and better service to distribution consumers which are expected
outcomes of pilot projects. The potential positive social outcomes are high and far outweigh the low
social risks of undertaking the operation.
Environmental impacts are expected to be positive as a result of the likely reduction of distribution
losses. The project will not affect any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or any other
culturally or socially sensitive areas. A small scale upgrade of the distribution network in pilot areas,
which is associated with the introduction of new metering system, does not require disposal of
distribution transformers. Existing distribution transformers in pilot areas are less than 20 years old (their
normal life time is 40 years) and will be moved to other locations in the network, which is a standard
practice in distribution companies. A due attention will be paid to the technical specifications of new
distribution transformers to ensure their full compliance with the latest international technical and
environmental standards.
