I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The development objective is to restore 14,500 hectares of degraded agricultural lands to productive uses
for rural communities and to build capacity for community-based management of 5,400 hectares of these
lands. The project would restore the productivity of degraded pasturelands by means of afforestation with
tree and shrub species adapted to these adverse site conditions, providing urgently needed fuel wood and
timber to rural communities.

In addition to restoring productivity and conserving soils, the project's afforestation activities would
support global objectives of carbon sequestration and reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations. The
project fits in the general framework of global climate change mitigation, a growing area of activity for the
World Bank Group.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project has a single component, Restoration of Degraded Agricultural Lands, with two activities:

Afforestation of Degraded Agricultural Lands. The project would afforest 14,500 hectares of degraded
agricultural lands on 1,891 plots distributed throughout the country The plots are located in 151 primarii
(mayoralties, municipalities, local communities) in all 11 judets (provinces). The lands to be afforested are
largely "refused lands" ­ lands that have not been privatized and primariya are unable to restore to
productive uses due to a lack of financing and technical know-how.

About 9,106 ha (63%) are property of Moldsilva or in the transfer process to become Moldsilva property
and 5,389 ha (37%) are owned by the local communities, which have contracted Moldsilva for a period of
5-10 years for executing the afforestation work on their behalf. The decisions of local councils have been
taken and the contracts for the planting and maintenance activities have been concluded with the forest
agency. After the contract period forest management activities will be continued by the primariya.

Moldsilva would apply environmentally sound forest management practices, well-developed in Moldova, to
ensure the maintenance of healthy plantations and develop a sustainable flow of wood and non-wood
products for subsistence and commercial purposes. Maintenance cuttings are carried out from canopy
closure to mature stages, and improve phyto-sanitary conditions through the control of forest pests and
fires.

Support to Community Forest and Pasture Management. The project would build capacity and
improve the enabling environment for community forest and pasture management by providing: (i)
Technical assistance for the development of community forest management on communal lands; and (ii)
Direct financial support to communities for improved management and productivity of community forests
and pastures. Eligible investments will include forest pruning and thinning, and other costs associated with
forest maintenance, costs of re-seeding and restoring degraded pastures (various measures for site
preparation and pasture improvement), livestock watering sites, and fencing as needed to protect new forest
stands and pastures under restoration. The specific investments for each community will be demand-driven:
the project will educate eligible communities about the program and provide assistance in proposal
preparation and implementation; and (iii) Improve the level of understanding of the project activities and
help to replicate the results in other areas in the country.

The community and state forest management activities would ensure a sustainable flow of wood (fuel wood
and lumber) and non-wood products (hay, mushrooms, medicinal plants, and wildlife) for subsistence and
commercial purposes, contributing broadly to poverty reduction and economic development in rural
communities.

the Project
(%)


     Environmental characteristics: About 60% of the project lands are state-owned degraded agricultural
     land, where agricultural activities have been stopped or some low-quality grazing takes place in a free
     access situation. The remainder (40%) are local community lands. The sites are located in the
     agricultural landscape and have been under heavy use for decades. The sites are located throughout
     the country, and in some cases are near protected areas. The project design ensures that project sites
     located near protected areas will be afforested to improve site biodiversity values and contribute to
     landscape level linkages.

     Social characteristics: The communities around the project sites typically have a few thousand people
     in each village. These populations will benefit from the afforested lands through increased availability
     of forest goods (e.g., fuelwood, medicinal plants, and hunting opportunities) and from the stabilization
     of landslides and the beneficial impact of this on adjoining agricultural lands.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The project is classified as Category B. An Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management
Plan were prepared as part of project preparation and discussed with key stakeholders in Moldova.

The project's environmental impacts are positive and substantial, through the following:

l Reduction of soil erosion (from water and wind) and stabilizing lands at risk of gully formation and
    landslides, with associated improvement of aquatic ecosystems currently affected by soil erosion and
    nutrient flows;

l Restoration of soil productivity and horizon development favorable soil hydrology; and


l Restoration of vegetative cover, wildlife habitat, and biodiversity values. The project uses non-native
    species, mainly Robinia pseudoacacia, Quercus rubra and Gleditsia, on about half of the project sites.
    It would have been preferable to restore vegetative cover relying exclusively on native species.
    However, many of the project sites are so degraded that afforestation using native species would not be
    successful - hardy non-native species such as Robinia are adapted to grow on such degraded sites. On
    the partially degraded sites, and wherever soil/site conditions allow, native species will be planted. On
    the rest of the lands, which do not allow for the successful planting of native species due to their
    extreme soil conditions, afforestation works would be carried out based on the following tested method
    for ecological restoration: (a) establishment of forest cover using non-native species that are known to
    survive on degraded soils; and (b) secondary planting using native species. Plantations of non-native
    species are managed on short rotations and assume restoration of native forests after the first
    (maximum second or third) production cycle. After the soil conditions have improved (after one or two
    rotations of robinia), native species could be planted on improved soils. The success of afforestation
    of eroded lands also relies on indigenous brush species, which improve the structure of
    plantations and biodiversity values.

With regard to social issues, the project would trigger the Bank's safeguard on involuntary
resettlement due to changes in access to communal grazing lands as a result of their afforestation.
A large number of rural households own livestock (mainly sheep and goats) and depend on
livestock production. It is anticipated that afforestation activities on grazing areas in communal
lands will partially restrict access to grazing grounds and affect the livelihoods of livestock

 owners. These lands are small in area (on average, 7 hectares) and constitute a small portion of
 the total village pasture area. The majority of pastures suffer from a high degree of degradation
 and very low productivity. The project sites that are classified as grazing lands have a low biomass
 production estimated at 1 ton of dry matter per year and yielding an estimated US$ 8 to US$16
 per ha. Despite the low productivity, farmers consider these lands to be important as grazing
 reserves. The project has designed a special compensation program, described in Section II.D.3
 below, to address this issue.

 II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
 due to multiple project component.
 There are no potential cumulative impacts.

 II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
 The forests would be managed either by Moldsilva or local communities (depending on ownership), by
 maintaining forest cover and providing limited wood (eg fuelwood) and non-wood (eg hunting) benefits to
 local communities.

 II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
       No alternatives are warranted as a result of proposed future uses.

 II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Environmental Assessment: An a EA Report and a Project Environmental Management Plan were prepared
and discussed in-country with key stakeholders prior to the appraisal mission. Implementation of the EMP is
a requirement of the legal agreement (Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement).

Natural Habitats: The project sites were selected based on their degraded condition and the threat of
continued erosion. The sites contain sparse grasslands, but the habitat value of these has been degraded by
overgrazing and soil erosion. Moldovan biodiversity specialists have mapped the location of biologically
important grassland ecosystems throughout the country, and confirmed that there is no overlap between the
project sites and these natural habitats.

Forestry: The project is consistent with the Bank's new operational policy on forests. The project aims to
reduce deforestation rates in Moldova, enhance the economic contribution of forested areas, promote
community participation and contribute to global public goods. The project is also consistent with (OP 4.36)
because: (i) the sites to be afforested are not natural habitats, and therefore there is no conversion of natural
habitats; (ii) afforestation using non-native species will be designed to prevent and mitigate the potential of
their spreading to natural habitats and adversely affecting native biodiversity.

Involuntary resettlement: The Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12) is triggered by
afforestation activities on grazing areas in communal lands. Although these lands are limited in size (on
average, 7 hectares) and constitute a small portion of the total village pasture area, there is a possibility that
the livelihoods of some livestock owners will be adversely affected. The project would address this issue by
implementing a compensation program for affected individuals and communities that would include: (a)
provision of alternative grazing grounds; (b) provision of livestock fodder during duration of the project; (c)
priority status for receiving benefits from the forests (temporary employment, fuelwood, grazing, etc.); (d)
local communities will be allowed to grow vegetables between the seedling rows, at least until the trees grow
and shade these areas (probably 5-7 years); and (e) direct financial support to affected individuals and
communities for improved forest and pasture management (from the PHRD grant). A Process Framework
has been developed that outlines the participatory process by which affected persons will be assisted in their

 II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
 policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project was designed with the full participation and collaboration of key stakeholders, especially the
communities around the afforestation sites. The EA and EMP were widely circulated to interested parties in
Moldova for their comments and inputs before and after their finalization. In particular:

l The Project Concept Note (PCN), which includes a detailed project description and a preliminary
      assessment of environmental issues, was widely discussed with representatives of state institutions
      (e.g., the State Chancellery Division of Agriculture and Ecology, the Ministry of Environment, State
      Agency for Geodesy, Cartography, and Land Resources, and district administrations responsible for
      environmental protection and agriculture), environmental NGOs, and local communities and their
      represenatives (mayors and councils)
l Information on the project and its environmental issues was presented in national newspapers and
      television (both available in every participating primariya) in 2002 and 2003
l When the project and its environmental assessment were under preparation, the preliminary findings of
      the EA and its Environmental Management Plan were included in series of 30 workshops on the project
      with community members and primariya and raion representatives, which were organized and delivered
      jointly by Moldsilva and the Biodivesity Office of the Ministry of Environment.
l Moldsilva (through its Forestry Institute) organized a special project presentation for the mass media
      on June 17, 2003, emphasizing its environmental impacts, benefits, and mitigation measures.
l The draft EA and EMP (Romanian version) were presented to and discussed with the: (a) the Ministry
      of Environment; (b) the Academy of Sciences; and (c) Environmental NGOs in July 2003.
l The EA report was translated (in Romanian) and posted on the websites of the Forestry Institute and
      the Regional Environmental Center in July 2003.

 The Environmental Assessment Report was publicly available through the World Bank's Info Shop on July
 16, 2003.
