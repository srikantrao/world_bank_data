Project Objectives (From PDS):
a) Demonstrate at a commercial level, the potential for eolic generation in the Guajira
peninsula of Colombia, therefore facilitating future investments to capture the relatively
large eolic potential in the region (estimated at over 5 GW).
b) Avoid the release of 1.53 Million tons of CO2 equivalent in the period 2005-2023 by
displacing a mix of coal and gas based power generation in the merit order dispatch. The
project will avoid at the same time emissions of local pollutants, such as NOx and Sox
and PM.
c) Increase the share of renewable source based power generation technology adding to the
national private expertise in the installation and operation of on-grid wind based power
generation technology and strengthening institutional capacities with regards to national
participation in international carbon markets.
d) Contribute to technology diversification enhancing the robustness of the power system
e) Increase reliability of the power supply: as the wind regime is counter to the rainfall
periods in'the area, the use of wind complements the availability of hydropower
f)  Promote the participation of the Wayuu Indian community in the project in a way that
effectively integrates social and environmental benefits to enhance project sustainability.
Project Description (From PDS)
The project consists of the development of an eolic generation facility with a nominal power capacity
rated at 19.5 MW,- supplied by a total of 15 eolic generators with a rated capacity of 1.3 MW each.
The wind generators will be delivering their output to the Colombian interconnected electricity system
under a preferential dispatching scheme according to what it is established by CREG Resolution
No.086 (dispatching options for power generation plants with installed capacities between 10 and 20
MW). The grid connection to the site will have a length of 8 km, over dessert, largely uninhabited
land.



Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics
of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical
natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be located in Wayuu Indian Territory in the Northeastern region of the Atlantic
Colombian coast, in the area between Cabo de la Vela and Puerto Bolivar, within the region of Uribia
in the Department of Guajira. In terms of geodesic coordinates the site is located 120 15' 4" North
latitude, 72° 4' 1" to the East, 5 Km west from Puerto Bolivar.
The average wind velocity at the site is 7.29 m/sec (at 10 m height) to 9.15 m/sec (at 50 m height) and
its topographic characteristics provide the necessary conditiorns to maximize the power generation
potential of the wind farm.
The proposed site was selected considering relevant technical, socio-economic and environmental
criteria as well as issues regarding infrastructure use and development.
The site is not located in the proximity of any protected areas or critical natural habitats. The project is
however located in the Wayuu Indian territory and as such various actions to avoid adverse social
impacts and enhance social benefits will be undertaken by the developer.
B. Check Environmental Classification A [],B [X}, C [I], FI [], TBD []
Comments:
The B category recognizes the need to address the social issues associated with the participation of the
Wayuu community in the project. The project will demonstrate that actions to address global.climate
change can be linked to local sustainable development. The environmental impact of the generators and the
transmission line is limited and will be addressed through an environmental management plan.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
For the particular case of the Jepirachi Carbon Off-Set project, the following can be mentioned:
a) Power Transmission Lines: The EA will indicate alternative alignments depending on siting so as
to minimize impacts
b) Road Construction or Improvement: The EA will specify, for each siting option considered, how
many kIn of access road would need to be built or improved as part of the wind farm development.
The EA will indicate alternative access road alignments so as to minimize impacts
c) Potential impact on avifauna: The EA will address the siting and design of the wind turbines and
transmission lines in order to minimize impact on local or migratory bird population. Guidelines
to minimize this impact have been developed and will be integrated into the design process.
d) Indigenous PeonIes: The project will be sited in indigenous lands and for this reason social
assessments and associated indigenous people development plans are being undertaken.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
None
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not required
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An enviromnmental license is being obtained from the local environmental authority (CORPOGUAJIRA)
which is expected to address any environmental issues. An environmental management plan is being
prepared by the beneficiary. An IPDP is being prepared by the beneficiary.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are: the wayuu Indian community, CORPOGUAJIRA, the beneficiary, the Ministries
of Environment and Interior.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or-on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenevcr an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[X1 S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
f ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
