I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
Mexico seeks to improve its social, economic and political development through enhanced
competitiveness, human capital development, and building more efficient, accountable, and transparent
public institutions. Policy makers increasingly believe that improvements in the performance of judicial
institutions, particularly at the state level, could play a key role in the achievement of these objectives.
With federal participation, the promotion of institutional building assistance to modernize state
judiciaries, and the development of policies for harnessing the collective knowledge of all judicial
institutions are expected to build momentum to direct further reform and modernization efforts. Support
for inter-and intra-state knowledge sharing (including interfaces with federal sector institutions), when
promoted through the National Commission of the Presidents of the State Supreme or Superior Tribunals,
is expected to build judicial leadership, increase ownership and reduce resistance to change.

The development objective of the proposed Project (the first in a set of assistance programs) is to
improve the institutional performance of state courts through the strengthening of judicial modernization
"building blocks" in selected states (about 5 to 10), with measures that can be advanced without awaiting
legislative reforms; and to facilitate dialogue on and support for long term national and state policy on
judicial modernization. Specifically, the Project would help: (1) strengthen the functioning of the state
judiciaries and ancillary institutions; (2) develop human capital; (3) improve efficiency of court
adjudication; (4) improve judicial transparency and citizen outreach; and (5) strengthen access to justice
and more open judicial system. In addition, the project would provide a project coordination unit (PCU)
for coordination and knowledge sharing.

Project preparation has so far been participatory, and the plan is to continue consultations during
preparation and implementation. The concept of judicial modernization building blocks, and the
accompanying strategy, emerged from this participatory process and past research. Participatory
assessments have been undertaken in several states (e.g. Colima, Estado de Mexico, Oaxaca, Quintana
Roo, Sonora). Examples of state judicial modernization plans from Colima, Estado de Mexico, Oaxaca,
and Sonora are attached. Overall project priorities and ideas are based on consultations with the 32 State
Court Presidents at their national association meetings in August (Ixtapan de la Sal) and October (
Aguascalientes), 2002. Knowledge sharing would develop a new set of clients, and facilitate future
systemic reforms.
