I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The key development objective of the Program is to improve the investment climate and encourage
growth and the creation of employment opportunities in port cities. Phase I of the Program would seek
to: (i) strengthen local government strategic and physical planning, and coordination capabilities to better
utilize existing assets and resources; (ii) improve the efficiency of, and streamline administrative
procedures at, key local government agencies that interface with the private sector; and (iii) revitalize
port city business districts/clusters that are key to growth and employment generation.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Phase I has three components, which are briefly described below.
1. Revitalizing Port City Economy and Business Clusters. This component will support local
economic development by creating and reinforcing business linkages within the city, upgrading industrial
and commercial areas serving micro- and small-scale enterprises, and rehabilitating commercial districts
with the aim of revitalizing existing businesses and triggering new private sector investment.
Preliminary, small-scale identified investments include rehabilitation of a small industrial area for
microenterprises, physical improvements to the local fish market to enhance sales and marketing (while
improving conditions for fish sellers), and access in and out of Ma'alla Port.

2. Strategic and Physical Planning. This component would finance the formulation of CDS strategies
for Aden, Hodeidah and Mukalla, including competitiveness assessments, cluster strategies, participatory
workshops and other work that would help to form and reinforce a shared vision of each city. Financing
would also support an update of Aden's master plan, including several inter-related physical planning
studies necessary to underpin Aden's CDS. Investment priorities identified through these planning efforts
would subsequently be incorporated into Aden's Capital Investment Plan. Efforts would be made to link
formulation of this plan with budgetary planning processes at the local level to include budgeting for
recurrent cost obligations implied in the identified capital investments. Technical assistance, design and
feasibility studies would also be financed under this component to assess business cluster needs,
determine the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of proposed investments in Aden, and study
prospects for larger, down-stream investments in Phase II in Aden, Hodeidah and Mukalla, and undertake
detailed design work, as well as supervision of works, for Phase I and Phase 11 investments.
3. Local Capacity Building and Administrative Modernization.Underpinning Aden's strategic and
physical planning efforts and revitalization program, this component would include a series of capacity
building measures focused on improving the efficiency and transparency of public services provided to
the private sector. This would include introducing new organizational and management systems at the
General Investment Authority, Customs Authority, Public Land Authority, and Public Works - four key
points of interface with the private sector. Rules and procedures need to be simplified, streamlined and
made more transparent. Delays in service delivery can be cut down and inefficiencies reduced through
the introduction of new automated systems. Businesses would benefit from reduced transaction costs in
establishing and running their operations, while such systems would increase transparency and reduce
discretion in the issuance of permits and regulatory approvals. Selected technical assistance and training
assignments to foster public-private partnerships and support reforms to improve performance at the Free
Zone would also be financed under this component.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Phase I of the Program targets Aden, which is located on the gulf of Aden and is the second largest city in
Yemen. Phase I is not expected to have any adverse environmental or social impacts. The infrastructure
investment component will not result in any large scale resettlement, nor will it affect indigenous people, or
cultural property. The City Development Strategy will ensure that all stakeholders' views are incorporated
in the final strategy.
B. Check Environmental Classif ication: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: Phase I has been categorized as B because Phase 1 will not include any sub-projects with
significant environmental impacts. Instead, those investments would be limited in scope and focused on
existing small-scale infrastructure in commercial areas, such as improving access and roads, or developing
public services in support of small and micro-enterprises. Depending on the outcome of a prioritized capital
investment plans for the three cities covered by the project that are to be developed in Phase 1, Phases 11 and
III may include sub-projects with more significant environmental impacts; therefore, the environment
category will be re-assessed during the appraisal of both subsequent phases.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
To mitigate against potential negative impacts of the Phase I investments and ensure environmental issues
are mainstreamed into the overall planning process, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been
prepared. The EMP will be produced in compliance with World Bank guidelines, as set forth in OP 4.01
and will be updated during the preparation of each subsequent phase of the project.
It is anticipated that OP 4.30 (Involuntary Resettlement) will be triggered in Phases II and III of the Program
and the ISDS; therefore, the ISDS will be updated during the appraisal of each subsequent phase. A list of
potential small-scale investments for Phase I are specified in the Project Appraisal Document but these
investments will not involve any land acquisition or involuntary relocation of residents or economic
activities. As a preparatory measure for the more complex investments anticipated in Phases II and III, a
Resettlement Policy Framework will be developed during Phase I.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No potential cumulative impacts are anticipated in Phase I.
II.D. l c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Long-term impacts are more positive than negative. APL approach will allow the Project to deal with
physical investments and the policy and regulatory reforms in an integrated manner. This will enhance
improvement in the living conditions through increased economic opportunities and improved urban
environment in participating cities.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N.A.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Please refert to section lI.D.1.a. regarding the EMP.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Through implementation of the CDS, the Project seeks to establish a participatory mechanism for
planning, decision-making, implementing and monitoring infrastructure investments. This mechanism
seeks to enhance stakeholder capacity through a participatory approach to urban management. The
participatory element of the project is not merely an adjunct to the project design, but rather, a
fundamental basis on which the Program will be implemented and on which its success will depend
heavily. The means that the encouragement and promototion of stakeholder participation will be
determined and proposed through Social Assessments.
During Phase I, key stakeholders in Aden will participate in the project through a City Development
Strategy process, and a detailed framework and scope for this exercise has been defined. However, it is

ISDS
envisaged that stakeholders will be organized into focus groups according to areas of concern. Thematic
discussions will be organized for each focus group, and the outcomes of discussions will be synthesized
in stakeholder consultations. Lessons will be drawn from Aden's experience in Phase I to launch CDS in
secondary port cities under Phase 11. At the same time, dissemination of information on the results of the
Social Assessments and the progress of the CDS process are taking place through stakeholder
consultations in an effort to raise awareness among citizens about the strategy, and in an attempt to
nurture a sense of ownership.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
] S3. - No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
