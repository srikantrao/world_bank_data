pL A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The project aims to enhance local capacity and provide improved opportunities for sustainable and
equitable economic growth In the rural areas of the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW), while conservmga
Important watershed services
This objective would be achieved by i) promotn g utable man l and use systems based on the rational use
and management of the watershed resources and p) implementing conservation and mitiUation measures to
prevent the deteioration of the hydrological resources of the Canal watershed More specifically, It would-
(a) Identify and support initiatives for improved land and water conservation and management for adoption
by natural resources managers, and create alternative sources of income for the poorest small-holder
farmers, including new off-farm opportunities, (b) stren,gthen institutional capacities and coordination
mechanisms to ensure a coherent. multi-sectoral approach to integrated land and water use in the PCW,
wVhile enhancing community participation in decision-making, (c) select and implement a program in
priority areas designed to valuing public goods (e g , environmental services) relating to water quality and
water quantity in the watershed and biodiversity conservation, and (d) Improve the knowledge base for
planning the riext phase implementation of Panama's Law 21 (approved in 1997), which calls for a renewed
effort to manage the PCW in a efficient and equitable manner, and sets forth the objectives, policies and
institutional responsibilities for implementinc the Regional and General Land Use Plans for the Inter-
Oceanic region and the Canal watershed



I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed project would be implemented over four years and would have a base cost of US$ 13 7
million. The project direct beneficiaries will be the farmers' families living in the priority watersheds,
which cover approximately 40% of the rural agricultural lands The project would have four components
(1) Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Integrated Watershed Management (US$I 8 million,
13% of total project cost) This component is oriented toward developing the institutional capacity at the
local, regional, and national levels to support rural development and to protect critical watershed services
(e g. water quality, hydrologic stability) The component consists of three subcomponents (i) Policy aid
Plannlitng would develop consensus and define the policy, legal, implementation framework, and to
strengthen mechanisms for negotiation and conflict resolution among resource users and around the
implementation of the regulatory framework for,pollution prevention and abatement among agroindustry,
(ui) Capactty Building would provide key stakeholder groups (community, producers, service providers.
private, public agency) with training and assistance to incorporate watershed management objectives in
local, national development planning and implementation, and (ii) Support to Rural Orgauiization would
strengthen existing rural organizations to address both productive and environmental issues within the
PCW
(2) Promotion of Sustainable Practices and Conservation Activities. (US$5 8 million, 42% of total
project cost) This component will finance the development and piloting of an incentive system to
introduce sustainable improvements in rural land and watershed management by rural land owners and/or
managers The component comprises activities for (i) Sub-waterslhed Planiinuig to develop participatory
Integrated Sub-watershed Management Plans (IMPs) in the seven priority sub-watersheds, which will
facilitate the targeting of rural development and natural resources management investments at the local and
PCW levels, (n) Incentivesfor Imzproved Management auid Conservation Practices to provide appropriate
technical assistance and supporting incentives to rural producer and stakeholder groups leading to adoption
of improved production and environmental management practices within the seven project sub-watersheds
It would finance extension services, goods and small works, and for small producers. some limited capital
investment for implementing sub-projects identified in the IMPs, (in) Adult Education to provide literacy
and vocational education to the underemployed, unemployed, and landless rural poor (especially women
and youth) to enhance their opportunities to seek non-farm employment, and environmental education to
promote natural resources conservation, (iv) Eivivromnsental Services: would develop the framework for
policies and markets for environmental services, through the elaboration of a Strategy for Environmental
Services in the PCW, and (v) Dtagnostics and Feasibility Studies. to carry out studies to identify promising
alternative production and marketing systems that support sustainable use in critical areas
(3) Component 3. Environmental Management and Monitoring (US$4 3 million, 31% of total project
cost)- This component would execute cross-sectoral programs to improve protection of critical watershed
areas and mitigate impacts of the rural sector It would consists of three subcomponents (i) Protected
Areas: through baseline studies and subsequent development of management plans, it would support the
incorporation of four natural areas (currently under the jurisdiction of the Interoceanic Region Authority
(ARI) that are destined to pass to the National Environmental Agency (ANAM) for administration, into the
National Protected Areas System (SINAP), in addition, two other existing parks with management plans
would also be supported to implement the plans, (ii) Rural Roads' a maintenance program would be piloted
to stabilize roads and reduce sedimentation impacts within selected subwatersheds and sensitive areas on
the southern shores of Lake Gatun, and (mi) Applied Researclh anid Envirotunental Mo,iitoriitg support to
applied scientific investigation would be undertaken to examine the specific effects of the different land
management strategies supported by the project in ameliorating changes water quality, erosion, sediment
transport and recharge/run-off.
(4) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.8 million; 13% of total project cost)
This component comprises activities for (i) Project mnanagemnent would finance the establishment and
implementation of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) within MIDA's newly created "Office For the
Coordination of the PCW" as well as resources for a smaller unit within ANAM, which would participate
in the PCU; and (n) Monitoring and Evaluation This sub-component, under the responsibility of the PCU,
would support technical assistance and operating costs for project monitoring, evaluation and dissemination
of project results and impacts



I.A.4. Project Location (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas
The project is located in the Panama Canal Watershed (PCW), which covers approximately 5% of
Panama's national territory (or about 330,000 hectares) and is politically divided into two provinces (Colon
and Panama) and six districts The PCW includes about 10,800 producers (8,200 farmers and 2,600 artisan
fishermen), of which 72% are small-scale producers
The PCW represents an important portion of the country's tropical moist forest The Panama Canal also
represents a significant asset to the international community four percent of the world's maritime trade
passes through the Canal In addition, the Canal has an important social role in directly employing 9,500
people and protecting livelihoods as the Canal watershed supplies water to half of the country's population
The functioning of the Canal and the services it provides depend on sound natural resource and ecosystem
management of the PCW, hence the maintenance of the hydrologic and ecological functions of the
watershed is considered a strategic priority for the country in social, environmental and economic terms
Moreover, the PCW generates environmental benefits as it supports important biodiversity features and
provides habitat to numerous endangered and threatened animals and plants, botanical and zoological
studies carried out in the PCW during the late 1990s have described 1,125 plant species (200 rare and 5
new for Panama), 165 bird species (some endangered), 24 amphibians and It mammals
The project would be implemented in seven priority sub-watersheds (located in the western portion of the
PCW where main land use is agriculture and livestock) and in six PAs (located in the eastern portion,
except for one - Altos de Canipana National Park - which overlaps with one of the aforementioned sub-
watersheds) The six PAs supported under the project would include- a) four natural areas currently under
the urisdiction of the ARI that would be incorporated into the SINAP Advent and Zorra Islands, a I 10
km forest buffer around Lake Alhajuela, and Cerro Balboa Forest, and b) two existing PAs Altos de
Campana National Park and Lake Gatun Recreation Area
Selectiotn criteria for the sub-watersheds include, environmentally sensitive or critical areas, particularly
those which are highly vulnerable to erosion with a high potential for sediment production and larger
contribution of water into the PCW's lakes, rural poverty, rural population density, and sites where the
local institutional and organizational environment is conducive to introduction of the proposed activities
PA selection criteria include: contribution to the maintenance of the hydrologic and ecological functions of
the watershed, natural areas under thejurisdiction of the ARI that are destined to pass to the ANAM for
administration and incorporation into the SINAP; existence of management plans (in existing PAs) and
local institutional and organizational arrangements favorable to the introduction of the proposed activities,
PA implementation capacity, including presence of, or commitment to designate staff from ANAM or other
institution responsible for PA management, and areas where existing land tenure situation and access rights
do not imply in either resettlement of people or restrictions on the use of resources that cannot be fully
addressed by the project activities foreseen under the above-mentioned components. such as provision of
vocational education, technical assistance, training and financial incentives to the transition to sustainable
livelihoods appropriate for the PA's objectives
Key stakeholders are small farmers, artisan fisheries, underemployed, unemployed and landless rural poor
(especially women and youth) Prcliminary estimates are that 40% of the PCW 10,800 producers and an
additional estimated 1,000 adults (unemployed and landless rural poor) would be targeted (or be
beneficially affected) by the project - more precise estimates will be obtained upon completion of the social
assessment to be undertaken as part of the PHRD phase scheduled to start in late-February/early-March

Comments
Based on the assessment of potential impacts presented below (see Section 11 D I a), the project is proposed
for a Category B designation. It is being designed to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Bank
umbrella policy on Environmental Assessment (OP 4 01) Despite the largely positive or neutral project
impacts anticipated, submission of an EA and respective EMP was considered prudent to ensure conformity
with the aforementioned Bank policy. The borrower will submit a first draft EA by April 2003 The
approval of this draft EA will be a condition for negotiation

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If Information is not available. describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
I Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Environmental Assessment Project activities having potential environmental impacts would mostly be
those financed under Components 2 and 3 Impacts of the majority of these would be positive or neutral -
e.g from the introduction of on-farm soil conservation and soil stabilization measures, control of grazing
pressure, and re-vegetation and reforestation of riparian forests utilizing native species However, impacts
of any misdirected support for improved livestock systems, agro-processing or aquaculture could be
negative Environmental screening and evaluation procedures as well as proposing mitigation measures will
be built in the management of the financial mechanism to be adopted under Component 2 (see Section 4
below). Component 3, rural roads, would only finance road maintenance and stabilization As such
positive outcomes are expected However, poor design or lack of supervision can always lead to
unintended and negative consequences Review and supervision visits by a qualified environmental
specialist will be included in the Component 3 design
Natural Habitats. The proposed project would support natural habitat conservation and improved land use
by integrating into existing national and regional rural development programs the conservation of natural
habitats and the rehabilitation of degraded natural habitats, within the context of integrated watershed
management. Project activities would not significantly modify or degrade natural habitats In terms of
policy dialogue, the project would assist GOP with strengthening the central and local institutions in the
rural and environmental sectors, providing them with enhanced capacity to guide and monitor the
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources
Forestry The proposed project would support the adoption of conservation measures,e g reforestation,
natural forest regeneration, establishment of private protected areas, and sustainable production systems,
including agro/silvopastoral systems to lower the impacts of livestock production on the PCW
functionality. The project M&E system would track compliance for monitoring project implementation
This would also apply to investments in forestry-related activities that may require attention to forestry
management standards
Social Assessment A social assessment (SA) will be carried out as part of project preparation with the
following objectives. (a) evaluate existing patterns of watershed, natural resource and land ownership,
management, access and use among different groups and institutions in the proposed project area, (b)
identify stakeholders, using a gender perspective, who should be involved in preparation, implementation,
and evaluation and to obtain their inputs on project scope and design, (c)assess potentially negative impacts
of proposed activities on vulnerable groups in the population, low-income producers and women, and
design measures to prevent or mitigate these impacts. and ( d) identify opportunities to build the capacity of
local governments, indigenous organizations, producers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
As a first step to conducting the SA, a socio-economic survey was carried out under project preparation by
MIDA, with FAO assistance This survey has provided information on key social development issues, and
covered the whole watershed area Although per capita income in the urban areas of the watershed is
relatively high, the rural areas are characterized by critical poverty and inequality issues Poverty is
especially severe among smallholders and small producers and their families Almost two-thirds (about 63
percent) of rural holdings within the watershed are less than 10 hectares, these support about 7,800 small
producer's families whose income levels are below that necessary to meet basic needs. Almost 1.000 farms
have less than I hectare A large proportion of these 7,800 households are below the extreme poverty line
Most do not have access to health and sanitation services About half these households do not consider
farming as their primary vocation, they cultivate land because they are otherwise unemployed In two of
the watershed's six Districts, the poverty rates are very high (73 percent and 62 percent in Capira and
Portobelo, respectively)



S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts, or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2 - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
I I S3 - No safeguard issues
[ I S:- Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
