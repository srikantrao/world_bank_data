Project Objectives (From PDS)
The Netherlands Clean Development Facility (NCDF) administered by the World Bank supports projects,
are expected to generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions while complying with requirements of
the clean development mechanism (CDM, Art 12) of the Kyoto Protocol (KP)
The development objective of the project is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to contribute to the
improvement of two waste management sites in Nova Iguacu in the State of Rio de Janeiro. It will reduce
GHG emissions by generating power using biogas from a sanitary landfill (Adrianopolis) and a dump site
(Marambata). This will include investments in gas collection systems, power generation and further
upgrading of the waste management and environmental control system.
Project Description (From PDS)
The project sponsor, NovaGerar, is a 50 50joint venture between EcoSecurities, an environmental finance
company and S A. Pauhista a Brazilian civil engineering and construction firm S A Paulista was granted a
20 year concessional licence by the Empresa Municipal de Lunpeza Urbana (EMLURB - Municipal Waste
Collection Company, a mixed economy company linked to the Municipality of Nova Iguacu) to manage the
Marambata and Adrianopolis landfills in the state of Rio de Janeiro Whereas, SA Paulista is responsible
for landfill operations, the joint venture NovaGerar will explore all business related to the use of the GHG
and is the legal contractual partner of the World Bank
The NovaGerar Project includes two operations, which largely represent the Brazilian waste management
reality (1) the clean up of an existing dump site, Marambaia, and (2) the construction of a sanitary landfill,
Adrianopolis Both are based in the municipality of Nova Iguacu in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Landfill gas
will be collected at both sites to be used for power generation. As part of this concessional agreement, SA
Paulista is responsible for the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the Marambala site
In order to achieve the objectives, NovaGerar will invest in a gas collection system and a modular
electricity generation plant (with maximum capacity of 12 MW), to produce electricity to supply to the grid
and reduce emissions of ca 12 million tons of CO2 over the next 21 years. The Netherlands Clean
Development Facility intends to purchase all Emissions Reductions from the project generated by the year
2012 It is estimated that by the year 2012 approximately 120,700 tonnes of methane will be reduced
(equivalent to 2,535,000 tonnes of C02)



Project Location, (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social .haractenstics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or cntical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
The project is located in the municipality of Nova Igua,u, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil The
municipality is located in the Baixada Fluminense, one of the most highly populated areas in Brazil, with a
population of approximately 3 million people Continued population growth as a result of migration, has
contributed to social tension in the area, and significant environmental degradation from sustained,
inappropnate municipal solid waste disposal practices in the area. Of particular relevance is the significant
environmental degradation of the Guanabara Bay (Baia de Guatabara) over several years Solid waste
disposal in the area has been largely by uncontrolled, open dumping at the Marambaia dumpsite which
received approximately 600tonnes waste/day over the past 15 years, until its closure in January 2003,
resulting in severe pollution of the nearby river Iguacu. Leachate from the site pollutes the local soil and the
adjacent river (Rio Iguacu) which empties into the Guanabara bay Some 89 scavengers (catadores) are
currently working at the Marambata dump site but do not live on the site
To address the problem of inadequate solid waste disposal, the municipality in cooperation with the
Ministry of the Environment, FEEMA and IBAMA (state and federal environmental agencies respectively)
promoted the decommissioning of the Marambaia dumpsite and the construction of an engineered sanitary
landfill at Adrianopolis. The site of the proposed Adrianopolis landfill is located in the Vila da Cava
district, about 10km from the city's urban center A total area of 20ha of land has been assigned for the
construction of the landfill and the energy component. The areas to be filled are spread out over four matn
areas in the site and can receive up to 4000-5000 tonnes of waste/day at full capacity The vegetation in the
site and its immediate vicinity is secondary forest with low biodiversity value The underlying soil on the
site is clayey soil of low permeability The site is located within a 10km radius of the Federal Biological
Reserve of Tmngua. Both the Marambaia and Adrianopolis sites have roads leading to them, as such there is
no need for construction of access roads that may interrupt the activities of residents of the nearby
community.
B. Check Environmental Classification A [ ], B [XI, C t ], Fl [I. TBD []
Comments The project has been classified as a category 'B' because potential adverse impacts though
varied, can be mitigated The engineering design of the proposed Adrian6polis landfill and the Marambala
dumpsite closure, incorporate the mitigation of the polluting effects of landfill leachate Mitigation of
potential adverse post-closure effects are also addressed in the environmental monitoring plan. In addition,
appropriate measures have been included for the mitigation of any potentially harmful by-products of the
energy generation component. A Social Plan has been developed by the municipality to address the
compensation of scavengers whose activities at the Marambaia dumpsite must cease upon closure of the
site.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available, descnbe
steps to bc taken to obtain necessary data
1 Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
The project is expected to (i) reduce methane, a greenhouse gas, by generation of electricity from landfill
gas, and to (ii) improve the management of municipal waste in the municipality and is expected to have
significant positive benefits notably the protection of the environment and human beings through the
mitigation of potential risks associated with improper waste disposal.
The primary focus of the project is the efficient collection of biogas and power generation using methane.
This section discusses the key safeguard issues related to energy generation at the closed dumpsite and the
new landfill site, as well as impacts associated with the implementation of the supporting components of
landfill construction and dumpsite closure.
Potential adverse impacts from the energy generation component are noise from the operation of
generators, generation of waste residues (lubricant oils, spent coolant liquid, condensates), accidents (fires,
gas leakages), electric discharges along transmission lines Although a decision is yet to be made as to the
mode of transmission of energy that will be generated from Adrianopolis and Marambaia, no resettlement
is envisaged as a result of installation of transmission lines In the case of Adrianopolis landfill, the site
shares a border with the 500KV power substation, and as such any environmental impacts associated with
the installation of the lines are expected to be minor. In the case of the Marambaia site, there is some 600-
800 meters between the power substation and the point of connection at Marambaia. In order to ensure that
adequate measures are taken to safeguard people and the environment, the client will submit any plans,
work programs and environmental assessments to the Bank for approval prior to implementation
The main impacts associated with the construction of the Adrianopolis landfill have been identified in a
report of study of altemnatives Estudo Ambiental de Alternativas Locacionais carried out under the project
by the municipal entity responsible for waste management, EMLURB. Project impacts are associated with
construction activities at the sites of the Adrianopolis landfill and the Marambaia dump. Main impacts
during the construction phase include (1) loss of vegetation and fauna from clearing of secondary forests for
site preparation; (ii) reduced replenishment of the underlying aquifer; and (in) other potential impacts such
as construction nuisance including disposal of construction waste, noise, increased traffic, dust, impacts on
other road users Potential impacts during operations include increased traffic, odor, noise, litter, visual
impacts, health and safety of workers on the site (dealing with healthcare and municipal waste, operation of
sensitive and/or heavy equipment), disposal of solid and liquid waste streams generated on site All these
impacts are being addressed through environmental guidelines and targeted mitigation activities.
With respect to the Marambaia dumpsite closure, the environmental impacts are expected to be largely
positive given the deplorable conditions - presence of disease causing vectors, visual impact, soil and water
contamination by leachate, associated with the practice of uncontrolled open dumping and exposure to risks
thereof by scavengers The main social impact of closure will result from prohibition of scavengers at the
dumpsite and the cessation of scavenging activities. A Social Plan has been developed by the municipality
to address the compensation of scavengers displaced from their activities at Marambala dumpsite
As with all landfill construction and dump closure projects, potential impacts after site closure include (j)
fires, (ni) methane migration from the site which if not adequately mitigated could have severe
consequences. Both possibilities are being avoided to the extent possible through proper planning,
monitoring, and mitigation measures
2. Identify and descnbe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts
No impacts of this nature are anticipated and those described above are all being addressed and mitigated



3. In light of I and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
As mentioned above, a detailed study of alternative locations, Estudo Ambiental de Alternatzvas
Locacionats was carried out by the municipality prior to selection of the Adrianopolis landfill site. This
study was submitted to the Federal Environmental Agency, IBAMA in order to obtain an environmental
licence because the site is located in the vicinity (under lOkm) of the Federal Biological Reserve of Tingua
The selection of the site was made according to the following criteria: (i) availability of sufficient space to
locate the project; (n) existence of adequate roads; (ii) proximity to points of waste generation, (iv)
distance from areas of dense population; (v) compatibility with municipal urban legislation and
environmental legislation, (vi) appropriate physical and geographic characteristics for the undertaking
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Measures that will be taken to address safeguard issues are presented in more detail in the Environmental
Assessment reports produced for the Adrian6polis landfill, the Energy component and in the case of
Marambaia dumpsite, also a Social Assessment. The EA reports discuss mitigation measures that will be
used to address potential impacts Some of the key measures are described briefly below.
Engineering Design
To mitigate the negative environmental impacts of inadequate solid waste disposal, the engineering designs
for the dumpsite closure and construction of the Adrianopolis landfill have been carried out according to
internationally accepted standards to ensure adequate provision for waste disposal and protection of the
environment
Vegetation Enrichment Plan
To address the loss of vegetation as a result of vegetation cleanng for construction purposes, the project
sponsor has prepared a vegetation enrichment plan which will involve the reforestation with native species,
of areas cleared during construction activities, restoration of 30ha of degraded land in the Federal
Biological Reserve of Tingua; and planting of a green belt to reduce any visual impacts of the landfill A
similar vegetation enrichment plan will be embarked upon at the Marambaia site At Adrianopolis landfill,
the reforestation will also serve to improve water retention around the water spring area No use of
pesticides is envisaged for reforestation activities.
Social Plan
A social plan was prepared by the municipality to address the displacement of scavengers at the Marambaia
dumpsite in November 2002 Some of the elements of this plan include:
*   Registration of families for inclusion in Federal government records. This registration was
completed in February 2003.
*   Individual service to obtain access to community resources such as documentation, photos, legal
services and so on.
*   Assisting catadores in entering thejob market, by building capacity through literacy courses and
*   Creation of 30 job vacancies in companies linked to the municipal administration
*   Establishment of waste recovery units that will be operated by a cooperative of catadores that will
be created The units will be located in two or three areas of the municipality and will receive
waste destined for Adrianopolis landfill.
*   Provision of food baskets by the municipality, to all the catadores until they are established in the
job market.



5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people
Key stakeholders in the consultation process include.
* Municipalities and local institutions (Nova lguacu and Rio de Janeiro)
* Local NGOs and community groups
* Climate change communities (NGOs, Government institutions)
* Caradores at the Marambaia dumpsite
Public consultation with stakeholders was conducted in three distinct stages (X) Prior to the issuance of
environmental licences, stakeholder consultation was conducted by the municipality and the landfill
operator, which culminated in an official public hearing in June 2001 The concerns of the stakeholders are
recorded in the official minutes of the hearing (Ata da Audencta Publica) kept by FEEMA, (ii) An opinion
survey on the remediation of the dumpsite and implementation of the Adrianopolis landfill with energy
generation (The Clean Development Mechanism project, financed by the Bank includes only the collection
of landfill gas to power generation); and (mii) Interviews and specific questionnaires for the catadores
It is important to note that in response to stakeholder concerns the project sponsors among other actions,
agreed to remediate and close the highly polluting Marambaia dumpsite.
The Social Plan embodies an intersectoral approach for the proposed social interventions and identifies
responsibilities of different stakeholders under the plan.
