I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The focus of the project is to build upon and anchor more deeply the institutional reforms started
under the first Export Development Project (EDP) with the intention of creating a conducive
export environment and encouraging exports.           The project's development objectives are to
improve access to export markets, modernize trade-related services; enhance the efficiency and
performance of customs operations, and make internal trade and distribution more efficient. By
building on the achievements of the first EDP, the implementation of the Second Export project (EDP2)
is expected to strengthen linkages between domestic and offshore sectors, enhance competitiveness of
Tunisian exporters, and strengthen public-private interface to administer and promote internal and
external trade.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Component 1: Access to Markets

Second Export Market Access Fund. This component would include a matching grant fund (the second
Export    Market     Access   Fund   -    EMAF2)     inspired   by    the   success  of    EMAF     and
consolidating/complementing EMAF assistance.         While EMAF assisted individual enterprises to
overcome barriers to sell in foreign markets, EMAF2 will target products and markets according to a
3-year plan and provide matching grants to association of producers, individual exporters especially
women-owned enterprises, to establish a presence in key export markets, trading companies to channel
exports originated from Tunisian SMEs into export markets, and export consultants on a demand-driven
basis.  EMAF2 will also provide matching grant to strengthen professional associations, as these
associations, like export promotion agencies, could help diffuse market information across firms and
within industries.

E-commerce portals for commerce and tourism. This sub-component would finance the development of
e-commerce to link SMEs and emerging exporters in the garments, shoes and services sectors (especially
ICT and tourism) to their counterparts and potential business partners in Europe and North America on a
pilot basis. The Internet can play a dominant role in establishing commercial links with foreign
enterprises and in promoting Tunisian products and services. A new role would also be assigned to the

                                                          2
                                                                                                            ISDS



Chambers of Commerce and professional organizations to facilitate the market access for SMEs by
managing and maintaining sectoral portals. In order to enable these organizations to accomplish their
new task, it will be necessary to strengthen their organizational structure.               This will be done by
coordinating this component with activities envisaged under the second phase of the SME Exchange
Program. This may also require a change in their legal status to allow professional associations to hire
relevant skills and expertise to provide services to their members. This component would also build on
the existing initiatives, including TradePoint, and Virtual Souk.

Component 2: Trade-related services

E-government pilots. The Project would finance the application of pilot e-government mechanisms to
selected trade-related government services, in view of improving their efficiency, transparency and reach.
A successful example of the e-government techniques to trade-related services has been Tunisie Trade
Net that was created under the first Export Development Project (EDP). There are other trade-related
services that could be good candidates for automation. A partial list of these services is shown in the
table below. During project preparation, an enterprise survey would be conducted to solicit private
sector views as to trade services presenting the heaviest burden on their day-to-day business activities.
This information would then be mapped against the results of a survey of administration that would
determine key trade-related services susceptible to e-government. The component would help introduce
e-government to one or more of these services on a pilot basis.

Component 3: Trade facilitation and logistics

International experience has shown that lowering the traditional barriers to trade (tariff and non-tariff

                                                       3
                                                                                                          ISDS



barriers) is necessary but not a sufficient condition to increase integration with world markets and
achieve competitiveness of exports. In fact, the more those traditional barriers are brought down, the
more conspicuous become the importance of the procedural, logistic, and regulatory environment that
impact on the costs and potential of trade. Experience of countries that have doubled per capita income
in less than 10 years (Chile, China, Ireland, Malaysia) suggests that open and competitive markets, a
strong investment climate and the mobility of people, ideas, firms, products and services across borders
and within countries are key instruments for generating jobs and improving living standards (World Bank
PSD Strategy 2002). In this context, this component will focus on upgrading logistics links to global
markets as an important condition for promoting exports and attracting export-oriented FDI.

Internal trade. The aim of this component would be to ensure that the inefficiencies in domestic
distribution do not hamper export development, and to reduce transactions and regulatory compliance
costs. A number of measures could be envisaged under this component (Annex 1.C). They focus on
improving the internal distribution and supply chain facilities.         The transport chain is nowadays
considered as fully integrated within the production system, and as far as international trade is concerned,
within the trading pattern itself. Facilitation of transport is therefore an issue, not only concerning the
ports, but also inland logistics. Logistics options such as finance facilities aimed at attracting distribution
and logistics services will be examined.

External trade. The component has two main objectives: (a) to enhance the trade facilitation system
(Tunisie TradeNet) that was established under EDP by expanding the set of services and information
available through Tunisie TradeNet by including access to real-time container status information; and (b)
to improve customs efficiency, by modernizing existing customs communications network which is
unreliable and thus inadequate in making optimal use of the customs computer system that was
modernized and developed under EDP.

One important component of transport related information that is not available yet within Tunisie
TradeNet is container status information. Replacement of the outdated computerized system at the main
container terminal, at Radès, will provide access to real-time container database information, enable
further replacement of manual transactions by electronic transactions and thereby allow transport
professionals to provide more efficient service and timely flow of goods (import / export) for traders.
International best practice, for example, in Singapore and at le Port du Havre provide this level of
integration between computer systems of trade community and transport community.

The Customs computer system, SINDA, will provide, when completed, powerful processing capabilities
as well as a rich database of information and customs intelligence. SINDA, located in Tunis, is accessed
remotely by Customs units that are located across the Tunisian territory. The poor quality of the present
Customs communications networks is a major handicap for customs operations in general and negatively
affects ability to administer and facilitate movement of goods. Alternatives to addressing this issue are
relatively limited and will rather rest in terms of choice of technology solution.
