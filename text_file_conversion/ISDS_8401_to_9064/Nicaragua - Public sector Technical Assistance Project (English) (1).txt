improving the government's public administration, financial management, economic planning,
policy formulation, and execution and civil service capacity. This effort would strengthen the
framework for governance and public institutions, and thus improve business confidence, private
sector led growth, and poverty alleviation. Building on the progress already achieved through the
ongoing public sector modernization program supported by the Institutional Development Credit
project (IDC-2690) and the Economic Management Technical Assistance Credit (NI-3314), the
project would complete the implementation and expansion of the Nicaragua's successful
integrated financial management reform effort including implementation of the cash
management, macroeconomic, public investment, fiscal policy formulation and implementation
and public procurement, advance in the implementation of the civil service reform, support the
creation of the Public Administration Office and improve the government's capacity to
communicate and disseminate the results achieved under the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), the Programmatic Structural Adjustmen Credits (PSAC) and the National Integrity Plan
(NIP) encouraging citizen and public sector stakeholder knowledge and support for the reforms.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Project Component 1 - US$ 8.5MM
Consolidation of the Integrated Financial Management Reform (SIGFA)
This component, through technical assistance, information technology and training would continue the

ISDS
program of institutional strengthening, supporting in particular: (i) the consolidation of e-SIGFA system
in the areas of budget, accounting (E-SICOIN) and treasury, allowing for generation of budget
execution, cash-flows and financial statements reports in accordance to general agreed
accounting principles, and also reliable information for decision-making; (ii) review financial
management and control regulations of non-financial public sector and factual operations at the
ministerial and decentralized level; (iii) decentralize the implementation of E-SIGFA at the
municipal level; (iv) strengthening of public credit and internal and external control mechanisms;
(v) implement the project management system e-SIGFAPRO at the central government ; (vi)
improve SIGFA legal and regulatory framework and process reengineering and increase public
awareness of the reform process; (vii) Government's telecommunication infrastructure; (viii)
strengthen procurement system operations ; and (ix) reorganization of MHCP modernization.
Project Component 2 - USS2.0MM
Implementation of the Civil Service Reform
This component, through technical assistance, information technology and training would
continue supporting the creation of a civil service regime based on merit. The main activities to
be financed are: (i) the implementation of a merit-based civil service regime to allow the
administration to manage public services within a competitive system perceived by citizens as
trustworthy in applying norms and regulations through objectives, transparent and based on
well-founded decisions; (ii) implementation of a classification position system to be in place in
all public institutions by end 2003; iii) human resource management operating in all institutions
by 2007; and (vii) civil service information system deployed and operative in all institutions by
end 2007.
Project Component 3 - US$5.OOM
Public Administration Implementation
This components through technical assistance, information technology, civil works and training
would the implementation of the Public Administration Office: (i) design and definition of the
office, its functions, organization and processes including salary payments of key staff on
declining bases for 3 years); (ii) support formulate homogenous policy and normative throughout
the public administration; (iii) redefinition and restructure of the executive power macro-reform,
including the ministries and agencies; and, (iv) creation of two Centres for Citizen's Services
(Centros de Atenci6n a la Poblaci6n, CAC). To improve access and conditions in which public
services are delivered, provinding the adequate physical spaces where this services will be
delivered and locate them in key geographical areas. Public services would be put together in
areas with high demand, operational costs will go down as will do the costs for the citizen.
Proiect Component 4- US$2.5 M
Comunication
The component would improve technical assistance, equipment and training to build up the
administration's capacity to coordinate its own information flows about program with
multi-sectoral dimensions, such as its new poverty reduction initiative (supported separately
through poverty reduction credits). There would be two subcomponents as follows:

ISDS
a) Promoting open access to information
This sub-component would promote greater public awareness of their rights to be informed and
to have access to factual and timely public information by: (i) supporting necessary legal and
legislative work needed to complete the establishment ofa legal framework for allowing greater
access to information including issues related to confidentiality and privacy of data, security
interests, and obligations to provide information on a timely manner, among others; and, (ii)
improve the technical and managerial capacity of officials in the executive branch to handle
requests for information under a revised legal framework.
b) Establishing a functional communications network within the public administration
The objective of this sub-component is to establish a professionalized communications network
between and within ministries and agencies directly involved in GON's major social and
economic development initiatives. The objective would be achieved through a "learn-by-doing"
process, beginning with improvements in capacity and linkages between a core group of
government ministries in one or two of GON's "sectoral cabinets" (social and economic) and
then extended the experience to the rest of the executive branch. It would assure that there was
adequate internal communications between key sectoral ministries and agencies involved in
implementing its programs to reduce the risks of presenting contradictory and misleading
.information to the public and to share reactions and feedback from divers sectoral stakeholders as
part of the dialogue process. It would also assure that communications with civil society
organizations and the public at large was coherent, accurate, substantive and "two-way". GON
would thus be adapting internationally tested practices covering two-way communications
between the public sector and civil society.
