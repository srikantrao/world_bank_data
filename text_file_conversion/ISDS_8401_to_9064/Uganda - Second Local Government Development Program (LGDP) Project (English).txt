I.A.2. Project Objectives:
Improve Local Government institutional performance for sustainable, decentralized service delivery.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Through a combined Grant (US$75.0 million) and Credit (US$50.0 million), IDA will finance a
portion of the combined Government and external assistance budgets for policy development
and operational activities, both ongoing service delivery and new initiatives. The IDA Grant will
finance all the activities under Component 2 (Local Development Grants). The IDA Credit will
finance those activities under Components 1, 3, 4 and 5.
Component 1: Support for the Decentralization Process -This component consists of activities to support
the improvement of the LGs to plan and implement projects which will be funded by the Local
Government Development Grant (Component 2), activities to suppotlt the development of a national LG
capacity building strategy and strengthening of the Human Resource' Development (HRD) functions in
LGs, and support of annual workshops through which progress towards decentralization in Uganda will
be assessed, and establishment of an analytical and design basis for the development of a decentralization
budget support instrument. It would also provide support to the national assessment system,
operationalization of the planning guidelines and information systems, and audits of the accounts of all
LLGs for the first two years of the program.
Component 2: Local Development Grants - This component will continue and extend the financing of

local infrastructure investment through supporting a system of central-local intergovernmental transfers.
Component 3: Local Government Capacity Building - This component will provide capacity building
grants to LGs.
Component 4: Local Government Revenue Enhancement - This component will finance technical
assistance at both the policy and operational levels.
Component 5: Support to Project Implementation - This component will consist of activities to support
project management, monitoring, evaluation and audits of the accounts of the program.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The local authorities that meet the minimum conditions will receive the development grants.
Those local authorities that don't meet the minimum conditions will only receive the capacity
building grants. The project will involve all 74 higher level local govenmments and around 1000
lower level local governments.
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: This project has a category B rating. The investments under this project will focus on the
improvement of the delivery of basic services and will result in improved living conditions. The investments
under the project would be sectorally varied given that they will be determined by local level priorities
which will differ from one local government to another. The types of investment are common community
development projects whose potential environmental and social effects are well understood, unlikely to be
significant, and readily manageable. Modular sector specific environmental checklists have been prepared
for projects and these checklists will be used to determine that the investments conform to environmentally
appropriate guidelines and that they incorporate the mitigation measures defined therein. Local
Governments will be required to apply the environmental checklists for appraising their investments and
comply with the mitigation measures contained therein. In addition, routine checks will be made to ensure
that individual investments also conform to nationally applicable environmental standards. All of these
measures are contained in the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) prepared for the
project. The environmental checklist prepared under LGDP I will be revised and upgraded so that it
conforms with the provisions of the ESMF and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). Under the
project, an environmental and resettlement training module will be developed as part of the standardized
training module for LGs. The project does not intend to displace any settler within the project location.
Project design, determination of investment sites and implementation arrangements are all to be formulated
through a participatory process. Availability of land without any form of encumbrances is one of the
prerequisites for project site selection and implementation. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has
been prepared and Resettlement Plans subsequently developed and presented for approval when land taking
is necessary. The RPF establishes the resettlement and compensation principles, organizational
arrangements and design criteria to be applied to meet the needs of the people who may be affected by the
project activities requiring land acquisition and /or denial, restriction or loss of access to economic
resources.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Infrastructure investments under Component 2 may have some environmental impact. The investments
under this component fall under various sectors such as water supply, drainage, sanitation, solid waste
management, access roads, construction of schools and health facilities. In addition, the investments are
sectorally varied given that the they are determined by local-level priorities which will differ from one
local government to another. Due to the diverse nature of the investments, the potential environmental
and social impacts and the scope of environmental and social analysis for each investment would also
vary. However, the anticipated types of investment are common community development projects whose
potential environmental and social effects are well understood, unlikely to be significant, and readily
manageable. The project does nol intend to displace any settler within the project location. However,
given the uncertainties of land acquisition, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared in
accordance with OP 4.12, and Resettlement Plans will be subsequently developed and presented for
approval, when land taking is necessary. In addition, the RPF establishes the resettlement and
compensation principles, organizational arrangements and design criteria to be applied to meet the needs
of the people who may be affected by the project activities requiring land acquisition and /or denial,
restriction or loss of access to economic resources. It specifies a format for reporting and verifying that
land given to government as a "voluntary donation" by communities is in fact not at the expense of any
villagers.
II.D.1 b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Unlikely - will be determined before any sub-projects are approved for funding.
II.D. 1 c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Unlikely - will be determined before any sub-projects are approved for funding.
II.D.2. In light of I, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Consideration of alternatives will be part of the design of the proposed subprojects.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been prepared which establishes a
mechanism to determine and assess future potential environmental and social impacts of Local

ISDS
Government subproject investments under the proposed LGDP II. The ESMF establishes the screening
process or mechanism for the subprojects to enable the LGs to identify potential environmental and
social impacts of subprojects and to address them by incorporating the relevant mitigation measures into
the designs of the subprojects. The ESMF prescribes a set of mitigation measures, monitoring and
institutional measures to be taken during implementation and operation of the subprojects to eliminate
adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them or reduce them to acceptable levels. A
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared and Resettlement Plans will be subsequently
developed and presented for approval when land taking is necessary.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The GoU decentralization policy provides for participatory approach to governance. During the technical
analysis for the design of the project, participatory approach was used whereby all the key stakeholders
(Line Ministries, donors, Civic Society Organizations, LGs, etc) were consulted and a number of feed
back workshops organized to enable them to have inputs and validate the conclusions and
recommendations of the technical studies. As a result, a number of bilateral donors have expressed
interest to co-fund LGDP 11. The participatory approach adopted during the program design shall
continue during the implementation phase. The same policy requires LGs, through a participatory
manner, to prepare three year rolling development plans incorporating plans of lower LGs. This legal
provision has been strengthened under the project by making it a minimum access criterion for LGs. For
sub-projects, local governments will be required to apply the environmental checklists for appraising
their investments and comply with the mitigation measures contained therein and will carry out
consultation with the beneficiaries prior to incorporating them into development plans. Documents on
the environmental and social management of future subprojects will be reviewed and subsequently
disclosed to the public. The RPF and ESMF reports were disclosed to the public by the Bank and the
Government of Uganda on March 26, 2003.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
