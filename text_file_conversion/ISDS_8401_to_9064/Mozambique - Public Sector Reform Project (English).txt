I.A.2. Project Objectives
To support the Government to restructure the public service for decentralized service delivery,
professionalize the public service, and improve governance.
I.A.3. Project Description:
1.1    Restructuring
Objective: To begin a process of restructuring central government so that service delivery will be
improve through decentralization and rationalization ofprocedures.
Phase I will focus on supporting key ministries committed to reform to prepare plans to decentralize,
deconcentrate, and privatize the delivery of services and at the same time move towards focusing the
ministries on policy formulation, monitoring and evaluation. Some ministries may be ready to implement
the reforms before the end of the first phase. The Government public sector reform and team and country
team members have confirmed the readiness of a number of ministries for restructuring; the Prime
Minister has asked that all ministries prepare restructuring plans. The implementation of the reforms,
and the associated capacity building, will be supported by thdFundo de Melhoramento do Desempenho
(Performance Improvement Facility, PIF), which will be designed and begin to be implemented in Phase
I (see Annex 13 for a description of how the fund will be operated). The Facility will include an
incentive structure that will reward ministries and agencies that are committed to reform and meet their
reform targets. The preparation of the plans, and the actual restructuring, will be carried out by the
ministries themselves. The project's role will be to define the process, establish a change management
team to support the ministries, train ministry staff in change management and strategic planning, and

monitor progress (see Annex 15 for a description of the ministerial restructuring process).
The project will help the Council of Ministers to exercise its collective responsibility for poverty
reduction and the implementation of PARPA by improving the policy formulation, decision-making,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation process. The project will strengthen the capacity of the Office
of the Prime Minister - i.e. the managers of the policy process - through adequate staffing, training and
equipment and will build capacity to link policy and resources more closely, especially through the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Plan (PARPA), and
monitor implementation. These activities will also help to realign the center of government on policy
and monitoring as service delivery is progressively decentralized.
The project will also provide capacity building support for reorganizing district administration and
improving working conditions at the district level through the provision of training and equipment.
Also, since it is important to be able to demonstrate progress while long-term structural changes are
planned and implemented, the project will provide funding support to the GoM Quick Wins Program
through the PIF. The quick wins will involve reengineering existing process to improve the delivery of
services.
Linkages will be established between restructuring and reengineering capacity building support under
this project and the sectoral reform targets set for the first PRSCs. The PIF will in effect provide funding
to build the capacity of the sector ministries to prepare for the reforms the implementation of which
would be funded by the PRSC.
1.2    Professionalization
Objective: Motivate public servants to become more responsive to the needs of citizens and
businesses and increase professionalism.
There are immediate and long-term issues to be addressed. The leaders, managers, and key technical and
professional staff essential to prepare and implement the reforms needed under this project and the
sectoral reform programs have to have the incentives needed to become fully committed to reform and to
their roles in the reform programs.  There is an immediate need to enhance their conditions of
employment to achieve this. There is also a medium term need to reform the salaries in the public
service to meet the needs of a restructured and reoriented public sector: restructured for decentralized
service delivery, and reoriented to service the public and facilitate business development.
These basic medium term reforms of pay and conditions can only be executed alongside the
restructuring, since the restructuring will help to define which are the key positions that are below
market. In addition, some restructuring may be required to create the resources needed to pay the higher
salaries. The process of preparing the restructuring plans will trade off higher salaries against other uses
of funding to meet the redefined objectives of the ministries concerned. Since the restructuring plans
will be prepared during phase I and for the most part implemented in phase 2, it will only be possible to
implement the more basic, longer term pay reforms in phase 2.
Thus the project will fund capacity building for the preparation of a sustainable medium termn pay
strategy, the design of a scheme to enhance the salaries of key staff in the short term, and the associated
implementation plans,  as well as substantial training in the skills required for the current and
progressively reformed public service. It is assumed that the funding for the salary enhancement will be
funded by the budget. To underpin the strategy, studies will be undertaken into both supply and demand

aspects of the labor market of which the public sector is part. The enhancement would begin during
Phase 1 and the implementation of the strategy would take place over a number of years, as resources
became available, partly as a result of the restructuring.
The mainstreaming of gender and HIV-AIDS programs as part of public sector reform will be carried out
with the support of other donors who are members of the Public Sector Reform Donor Working Group
and who participated in the appraisal.
Capacity building support will be given for the following:
*   Support design and implementation of sustainable medium term pay strategy to establish the
priorities for raising the salaries of civil servants within the context of the revenue expectations of
government and the policy priorities established in MTEF (study is nearing completion);
* Prepare plans to introduce results oriented performance management for senior managers and in key
central coordination agencies;
* Reform Human Resources Management processes to improve responsiveness and efficiency, and to
encourage the increasing professionalization of the public service, including establishing equal
opportunities for women.
1.3. Governance
Objective: Improve allocation, efficient use and accountability ofpublic resources.
The important reforms of expenditure management and accountability (referred to as the SISTAFE
reform in Mozambique) which are part of the Government's Public Sector Reform Strategy and
Implementation Plan, will be supported by the GI0 group of donors, led by the IMF. The project will
support the governance agenda by helping to establish an accounting profession for the first time in
Mozambique, raising the policy profile of procurement reform, decentralizing procurement capacity, and
strengthening the oversight capacity of the National Assembly through technical assistance and training
for its Secretariat.
1.4 Program Coordination
Objective: Enhance UTRESP and CIRESP capacity to coordinate and monitor the reforms and
communicate with key stakeholders.
* Build capacity of UTRESP to coordinate, administer, and monitor the Government's Public Sector
Reform Program, including those parts supported by other donors, through training, advisory services
and equipment.
* Build change management capacity at UTRESP and in ministries.
* Establish Council of Advisors drawn from outside the public service.
Components:
* Restructuring
* Professionalization
* Governance
* Program Coordination

characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
