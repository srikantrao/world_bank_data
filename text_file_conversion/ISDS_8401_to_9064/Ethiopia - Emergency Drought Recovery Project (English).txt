Theme: Natural disaster management (P); Nutrition
and food security (P); Rural services and
infrastructure (S); Vulnerability assessment and
monitoring (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
To assist the Govemment to respond to the development crisis exacerbated by the recent drought, and
enable Government to: (i) stabilize the macro-economy and minimize the negative effect on long term
development programs caused by the need to divert scarce budgetary resources to a crisis response; (ii)
help affected families to survive the crisis, retain productive assets, and develop sustainable livelihoods,
and (iii) put in place drought proofing infrastructure and support mechanisms (using a revamped
workfare program and other safety net programs) to reduce the vulnerability of households to future
weather shocks.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The proposed operation (based on a grant of US$ 60 million) includes three components:
Quick disbursing assistance (US$ up to 40 million). The positive list of imports will include: (i)
machinery and equipment, (ii) agricultural inputs including fertilizer; (iii) petroleum products (up to 20
percent of the value of the grant); (iv) construction materials; (v) transport vehicles, motor bicycles and
bicycles, (v) livestock and animal health products and veterinary supplies and equipment. In aggregate,
the imports financed under the fast disbursing component would be used to support the Government's
Emergency Drought Recovery Program, which includes programs to support water supply rehabilitation

and harvesting, small scale irrigation development, health services, agricultural inputs, and rural
infrastructure development.
Community interventions (up to US$ 18.5 million). These activities would seek to improve coping
capabilities and protect productive assets of the affected population and enable them to recover their
productive capacity following the emergency period. This would be achieved by providing employment
in the construction of community assets under a revamped public works (EGS) that includes a budget for
non-wage components, or through income supplements or payments conditioned on behaviour related to
school attendance, or improved nutrition or improved health care, or behaviour to protect against
transmission of HIV/AIDS . The mission would seek to negotiate funding for these activities to be
provided to woreda government as a supplemental grant justified as a response to the drought. Funding
would be in addition to the normal block grant, in the affected woredas. Woreda Governments would be
encouraged to contract in technical assistance from NGOs, the UN or other agents to overcome capacity
constraints in designing and running these programs. Special arrangements may be sought with the
ESRDF or other agencies with a national presence to provide technical assistance and guidance to the
Woreda Governments.
Project coordination, program monitoring, and studies (US$ 1.5 million). The project would support a
management team in the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural Development, that would
also monitor achievements under the program and promote learning. Studies would be carried out on
safety nets, the nature of destitution and vulnerability, as well as to assess innovative aspects of the
program, and to assist in the design of medium term responses to the chronic aspects of the crisis.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be active in the drought affected areas of Ethiopia. Under the current drought, 365 woredas
(Districts) have been declared affected, with a population in need of assistance totalling 1 1.3 million
persons. The areas where the need is greatest arre: (i) in the Center - North corridor, along the escarpment
which separates the highlands from the lowlands, in Eastern Tigray and Amhara regions; (ii) in the Center -
East corridor, along both sides of the escarpment going NE to Jijiga, in Eastern Oromiya and Somali
regions, (iii) in the Rift Valley lowlands, running from Nazreth NE to the Danakil depression and the border
with Eritrea, in Afar region, and (iv) selected areas in the South, in Southern Oromiya and SNNPR region.
The areas affected by the current drought include 156 woredas which have been declared chronically food
insecure -- where inhabitants have been battered by an almost constant moisture insufficiency, and are
extremely vulnerable to a large calamity of this kind.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The project proposes to finance the construction of rural communal infrastructure, in small rural
communties, as a part of ongoing food for work and employment generation schemes. These schemes
provide essential income supplements, and food, to the vulnerable population. The infrastructure to be
developed may include small, community level infrastructure such as rural road rehabilitation and related
works, school and clinic rehabilitation, small communal water harvesting infrastructure, bunds, terraces,
gully plugs, and erosion control infrastructure. The nature of these small works has triggered safeguard
policies, and it is requested that the operation be classified Category B. The project has been classified as a
B due to the potential environmental and social impacts of the small, community-level infrastructure and the
need for effective livestock management.

ISDS
The contribution of the Bank project will be to provide cash, to complement the food resources made
available for employment generation schemes in affected areas. This cash will be used to bring in
specialized materials (roof and windows and benches for schools for example, cement and steel for road
infrastructure, wire nets for gabions, and so forth) as well as to cover the cost of improved design and
supervision activities. This will contribute to a broader menu of more responsive, better designed
community projects, improving the developomental, and environmental, effectiveness of ongoing efforts.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Potential safeguard issues relate to the provision of small community level infrastructure, livestock
management, cultural property, and natural habitats. Critical wildlife habitats and existing parks are in
the highest part of the highland areas, in regions of adequate rainfall, outside of the affected areas.
There are culturally important stone churches and monuments in the affected area, but they are not
threatened by the crisis.
Construction of communal infrastructure (ponds, small irrigation, tracks) may involve the acquisition of
land and the withdrawal of access to land hitherto used by individuals. These activities may therefore
impact the livelihood of individuals or cause involuntary resettlement (although highly unlikely in an
Ethiopian rural community context). The Government will undertake to prepare a Resettlement Policy
Framework in parallel with the Environmental Assessment and Management Plan, to be presented to the
Bank by December 31, 2003.
II.D.I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Cumulative impacts may include soil erosion, soil and water pollution, and loss of vegetation. The
environmental assessment will make a determination of the actual impacts and will proposed appropriate
mitigation measures.



4
ISDS
II.D.Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Potential long-term impacts are not anticipated as the potential impacts of sub-projects can be easily
mitigated.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Alternatives will be addressed in the context of the identification of small-scale interventions to be
supported by the project.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The response on environmental issues is broad. An Environmental Protection Agency sets national
policy. The natural resources department in the Ministry of Agriculture provide direction and guidance
on how to manage land, water, forests, grazing land, wildlife and other resources. But the action takes
place at the Woreda (District). The Ethiopian Government is in the process of massive decentralization,
and staff are being shifted out to the Woreda. At that level, natural resources staff work with the
communities to design and implement projects designed to respond to the challenge of degradation.
Community food for work projects, supported by food aid in food insecure areas such as those affected
by the current drought, are designed to respond to this imperative, typically include bunding, terracing,
gully repair and plugging and other restorative measures.
An environmental assessment (EA) will be carried out six months after project effectiveness (i.e. by end
December 2003). The EA will assess potential environmental and social impacts related to livestock
management, including water points; the provision of small, community-level infrastructure; the level of
environmental assessment and management capacity at the woreda level and potential training needs; and
it will assess the potential for coordination with ongoing projects such as the ESRDF, the Emergency
Rehabilitation Project and the planned Pastoral Community Development Project. An Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared as part of this EA.
The Govemment will develop a Resettlement Policy Framework to address any potentially detrimental
social effects arising from the construction of small village infrastructure under the project and possible
need to resettle families. This framework will be presented to the Bank for discussion by December 31,
2003, along with the EA and EMP.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders in this project are the smallholder farmers and their families, affected by the current
drought, who stand to lose livelihood and quality of life due to the degradation which could result from
asset depletion and coping mechanisms under the current crisis. The project will be carried out by rural
communities, organized in "kebeles" or peasant associations, with the support, and in consultation with
Woreda Government. The Woreda natural resources staff will promote husbandry practices designed to
restore productivity and minimized environmental damage. Subprojects, to be funded under the project,
will be selected by the community. However, design will be carried out in consultation with Woreda
Government, and approval will be given by the Woreda Council (a grouping of high level Woreda
officials). It is at these two stages that provide the opportunity for the enforcement of safeguard policies
by the Government.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.

The proposed operation (based on a grant of US$ 60 million) includes three components:
Quick disbursing assistance (USS up to 40 million). The positive list of imports will include: (i)
machinery and equipment, (ii) agricultural inputs including fertilizer; (iii) petroleum products (up to 20
percent of the value of the grant); (iv) construction materials; (v) transport vehicles, motor bicycles and

and harvesting, small scale irrigation development, health services, agricultural inputs, and rural
infrastructure development.
Community interventions (up to US$ 18.5 million). These activities would seek to improve coping
capabilities and protect productive assets of the affected population and enable them to recover their
productive capacity following the emergency period. This would be achieved by providing employment
in the construction of community assets under a revamped public works (EGS) that includes a budget for
non-wage components, or through income supplements or payments conditioned on behaviour related to
school attendance, or improved nutrition or improved health care, or behaviour to protect against
transmission of HIV/AIDS . The mission would seek to negotiate funding for these activities to be
provided to woreda government as a supplemental grant justified as a response to the drought. Funding
would be in addition to the normal block grant, in the affected woredas. Woreda Governments would be
encouraged to contract in technical assistance from NGOs, the UN or other agents to overcome capacity
constraints in designing and running these programs. Special arrangements may be sought with the
ESRDF or other agencies with a national presence to provide technical assistance and guidance to the
Woreda Governments.
Project coordination, program monitoring, and studies (US$ 1.5 million). The project would support a
management team in the Food Security Department of the Ministry of Rural Development, that would
also monitor achievements under the program and promote learning. Studies would be carried out on
safety nets, the nature of destitution and vulnerability, as well as to assess innovative aspects of the
program, and to assist in the design of medium term responses to the chronic aspects of the crisis.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be active in the drought affected areas of Ethiopia. Under the current drought, 365 woredas
(Districts) have been declared affected, with a population in need of assistance totalling 11.3 million
persons. The areas where the need is greatest arre: (i) in the Center - North corridor, along the escarpment
which separates the highlands from the lowlands, in Eastern Tigray and Amhara regions; (ii) in the Center -
East corridor, along both sides of the escarpment going NE to Jijiga, in Eastern Oromiya and Somali
regions, (iii) in the Rift Valley lowlands, running from Nazreth NE to the Danakil depression and the border
with Eritrea, in Afar region, and (iv) selected areas in the South, in Southern Oromiya and SNNPR region.
The areas affected by the current drought include 156 woredas which have been declared chronically food
insecure -- where inhabitants have been battered by an almost constant moisture insufficiency, and are
extremely vulnerable to a large calamity of this kind.
B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The project proposes to finance the construction of rural communal infrastructure, in small rural
communties, as a part of ongoing food for work and employment generation schemes. These schemes
provide essential income supplements, and food, to the vulnerable population. The infrastructure to be
developed may include small, community level infrastructure such as rural road rehabilitation and related
works, school and clinic rehabilitation, small communal water harvesting infrastructure, bunds, terraces,
gully plugs, and erosion control infrastructure. The nature of these small works has triggered safeguard
policies, and it is requested that the operation be classified Category B. The project has been classified as a
B due to the potential environmental and social impacts of the small, community-level infrastructure and the
need for effective livestock management.

The contribution of the Bank project will be to provide cash, to complement the food resources made
available for employment generation schemes in affected areas. This cash will be used to bring in
specialized materials (roof and windows and benches for schools for example, cement and steel for road
infrastructure, wire nets for gabions, and so forth) as well as to cover the cost of improved design and
supervision activities. This will contribute to a broader menu of more responsive, better designed
community projects, improving the developomental, and environmental, effectiveness of ongoing efforts.

Section nI - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.1 a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Potential safeguard issues relate to the provision of small community level infrastructure, livestock
management, cultural property, and natural habitats. Critical wildlife habitats and existing parks are in
the highest part of the highland areas, in regions of adequate rainfall, outside of the affected areas.
There are culturally important stone churches and monuments in the affected area, but they are not
threatened by the crisis.
Construction of communal infrastructure (ponds, small irrigation, tracks) may involve the acquisition of
land and the withdrawal of access to land hitherto used by individuals. These activities may therefore
impact the livelihood of individuals or cause involuntary resettlement (although highly unlikely in an
Ethiopian rural community context). The Government will undertake to prepare a Resettlement Policy
Framework in parallel with the Environmental Assessment and Management Plan, to be presented to the
Bank by December 31, 2003.
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Cumulative impacts may include soil erosion, soil and water pollution, and loss of vegetation. The
environmental assessment will make a determination of the actual impacts and will proposed appropriate
mitigation measures.

ISDS
ll.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Potential long-term impacts are not anticipated as the potential impacts of sub-projects can be easily
mitigated.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Alternatives will be addressed in the context of the identification of small-scale interventions to be
supported by the project.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The response on environmental issues is broad. An Environmental Protection Agency sets national
policy. The natural resources department in the Ministry of Agriculture provide direction and guidance
on how to manage land, water, forests, grazing land, wildlife and other resources. But the action takes
place at the Woreda (District). The Ethiopian Government is in the process of massive decentralization,
and staff are being shifted out to the Woreda. At that level, natural resources staff work with the
communities to design and implement projects designed to respond to the challenge of degradation.
Community food for work projects, supported by food aid in food insecure areas such as those affected
by the current drought, are designed to respond to this imperative, typically include bunding, terracing,
gully repair and plugging and other restorative measures.
An environmental assessment (EA) will be carried out six months after project effectiveness (i.e. by end
December 2003). The EA will assess potential environmental and social impacts related to livestock
management, including water points; the provision of small, community-level infrastructure; the level of
environmental assessment and management capacity at the woreda level and potential training needs; and
it will assess the potential for coordination with ongoing projects such as the ESRDF, the Emergency
Rehabilitation Project and the planned Pastoral Community Development Project. An Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) will be prepared as part of this EA.
The Government will develop a Resettlement Policy Framework to address any potentially detrimental
social effects arising from the construction of small village infrastructure under the project and possible
need to resettle families. This framework will be presented to the Bank for discussion by December 31,
2003, along with the EA and EMP.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders in this project are the smallholder farmers and their families, affected by the current
drought, who stand to lose livelihood and quality of life due to the degradation which could result from
asset depletion and coping mechanisms under the current crisis. The project will be carried out by rural
communities, organized in "kebeles" or peasant associations, with the support, and in consultation with
Woreda Government. The Woreda natural resources staff will promote husbandry practices designed to
restore productivity and minimized environmental damage. Subprojects, to be funded under the project,
will be selected by the community. However, design will be carried out in consultation with Woreda
Government, and approval will be given by the Woreda Council (a grouping of high level Woreda
officials). It is at these two stages that provide the opportunity for the enforcement of safeguard policies
by the Government.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks

technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
