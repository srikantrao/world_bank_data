I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The supplemental credit would sustain activities successfully initiated under HPP 11 in the following
areas: (i) improvement in delivery of basic services targeting most dominant diseases: diarrhea, nutrition
disorders, malaria, traumas, reproductive health problems and tuberculosis; (ii) support capacity building
activities in restructuring and streamlining of health service delivery infrastructure in Burundi's health
system; and (iii) provide support for the Project Implementation Unit.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Component No. 1: Control of priority health programs (US$ 4,22 million equivalent)
This component would finance activities by MOH to improve the quality of preventive and curative
services directed at diarrhea, acute respiratory disorders, nutrition disorders, traumas, reproductive
health, malaria, and tuberculosis. Specifically, it would finance: (i) IEC activities to increase and
sustain national awareness about these priority problems; (ii) procurement and distribution of essential
drugs and other supplies to health facilities; (iii) carry-out routine epidemiological surveillance; (iv)
train health staff to manage priority health problems more effectively; (v) provide equipment and
pedagogical training at the Faculty of Medicine and the National Institute of Public Health (Institut
National de Sante Publique); and (vi) strengthen the technical skills of national and provincial units
supervising national health programs.
Component No. 2: Institutional strengthening (US$ 5.01 million equivalent)

ISDS
This component will finance: (i) implementation of on going sector reforms involving the updating of
legal and regulatory framework to improve the quality of health care; (ii) analysis of the human resources
needs and appropriate training and deployment strategies within sector in the context of the
Government's current financial constrains and Burundi diseases burden; (iii) expansion of basic health
services for greater coverage and increased utilization; and (iv) strengthening management autonomy in
public hospitals including consultants fees, training and workshops, rehabilitation and re-equipping of a
referral provincial hospital in Ngozi within its present premises.
Component No. 3: Project Coordination (US$ 0.77 million equivalent)
The component would fund the existing project implementation unit which has demonstrated its capacity
to coordinate and facilitate implementation. Under this component, Project funds used to purchase office
equipment, finance operational costs, and technical assistance (short- and long term), and support
monitoring and evaluation activities.
Component No. 1: Control of priority health programs (US$ 4,22 million equivalent)
Component No. 2: Institutional strengthening (US$ 5.01 million equivalent)
Component No. 3: Project Coordination (US$ 0.77 million equivalent)
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The supplemental credit would be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting in October 1, 2002.
As in the original project, the Ministry  of Health would have overall responsibility for project
implementation. The HPPII Project Implementation Unit, within MOH will be responsible for the
day-to-day management and coordination of project activities and for overseeing procurement,
disbursement and financial management. The Project Steering Committee, set up under HPPII will
continue to carry out periodic reviews of progress under the supplemental credit. The supplemental credit
is coherent with programs incorporated in the National Health Action Plan. There are no critical natural
habitats, or other culturally or socially sensitive areas which will be adversely affected by the Project. A
follow-up sector-wide Health operation is planned for FY04 to strengthen systems being developed under
the current project.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. A Medical Waste Management Plan has been prepared under the HIV/AIDS and Orphans
Project. It incorporates legal and regulatory reforms, provides improved management and training for
persons responsible for medical waste management in all health facilities and municipal agencies. It also
includes a public education program to raise the ievel of awareness needed to improve the collection,
storage, transportation and safe disposal of medical waste. This Plan would contribute to drastic reductions
in the risks to personnel, patients and the public which could result from poor management of medical waste
(handling of human blood, use of sharp instruments, disposal of syringes and needles, destruction of expired
drugs and laboratory supplies etc.)

describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The original Credit was rated C and it was rightly indicated at the time that improved maintenance and
cleanliness in health facilities would have a positive environmental impact. The recent study, a basis for
the proposed Medical Waste Management Plan under the MAOP, confirmed improvements achieved.
The "B" rating for the MAOP applies also to this Supplemental Credit. No activities would take place
within protected historical, religious or traditional shrines. No natural habitats will be adversely affected
by this project.
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not Applicable

arrangements and procedures during Project launch.
E. Safeguards Classiflcation. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[  SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
