B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the horizontal OECS APL is to build human capital which, in turn, will 
contribute to the diversification of their economy and more sustainable growth. This will be 
achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of 
teaching and learning with more direct interventions and resource provisions at the school level, 
a focus on student-centered learning and mechanisms to provide student support, and (iii) 
strengthening sector management and school governance.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The preliminary project description was prepared by the Government, is founded in the ESDP, 
and considers other donors’ inputs. The content and weight of each component has not been 
agreed to yet. The GOSVG has solicited Bank funds primarily to support universal secondary 
enrollment.

Component 1. Increase equitable access
 through construction, expansion and rehabilitation of 
secondary schools, or through conversion of primary schools to secondary schools. A recent 
school mapping exercise (DFID), based on population trends and efficiency needs, shows a long-
term need for 1,800 new secondary places to achieve universal coverage by 2010. A building 
analysis will complement the school mapping data to assist in making final decisions regarding 
conversion, construction and sites. 
 
Component 2. Improve quality
.  
2.1 
Upgrading of teacher skills
 to support graduate and post-graduate teacher training in content 
and methodology in Computer Science, Natural Science, Mathematics, Foreign Languages, 
English and Social Sciences.   
2.2 
Curriculum development for Forms I to III 
to complement ongoing work by the OECS 
Education Reform Unit (OERU) for the sub-region. 
2.3 
Improved student support services,
 including: (a) activities to complement the EU/EDF 
proposal, especially regarding targeted support for male students and (b) school improvement 
projects and co-curricular activities to generate wider participation of students in the school 
community.  
 
Component 3. Strengthen management and governance
, which is key to the achievement of 
project and sector objectives. The GOSVG requests technical assistance to: (i) develop an 
appropriate legal and regulatory framework for MOEYS operations to establish a base for 
adequate governance and management of the system; (ii) improve and expand the EMIS and 
upgrade the staff database and integrate this information in the EMIS; and (iii) train school 
principals, parents and teachers to design and carry out school development plans.  School 
principals will receive additional management and leadership training. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The school mapping exercise has assisted in determining needs and potential locations.  The 
building analysis will complement the school mapping data to assist in making final decisions 
regarding conversion, construction and sites. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Central Planning Division will coordinate with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry 
of Health and the Environment to approve the sites and carry out the environmental impact 
assessments, as necessary.  They have experience in these matters.  The Bank has provided the 
Government with the 
Guidelines for Addressing Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in 
World Bank Education Project in Latin America and the Caribbean
, to be used for the 
environmental impact studies and included in all bidding documents for civil works.
