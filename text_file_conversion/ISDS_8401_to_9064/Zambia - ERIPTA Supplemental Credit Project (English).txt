describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental pre-audits of the privatization candidates will be conducted under the project,
which will be reviewed and approved by IDA safeguard specialists prior to disclosure in country
and at the Infoshop. Prior to each divestiture, a comprehensive environmental audit with a costed
remediation action plan will be prepared by the borrower and reviewed and approved by the
Bank prior to disclosure in country and at the Infoshop.

privatization advisory services in the petroleum, power and telecommunication sectors, as well

of the proceeds of the proposed supplemental credit have been allocated to this purposefor the
preparation of environmental pre-audits and audits prior to divestiture. If the enterprises are to
be divested at different periods, separate environmental audits will be carried out by ZPA and
additional funding will be required to carry out these studies. Contingencies have been provided
within the Credit to cover possible additional costs..
