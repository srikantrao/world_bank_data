strengthening market institutions, focusing on entry and exit policies, regulatory costs, delivery of public
services, competition, and judicial reform; (c) deepening the financial sector, addressing the constraints to
increased lending by the banking system and the development of financial markets; (d) improving

I.A.4. Project Location:
Bl. Check Environmental Classification A [ 1, B [ ., C [xl, Fl [ 1, TBD [ I
Comments: There are a few environmental issues that should be flagged at this stage and addressed in the
preparation.
I. In the privatization law due account should be taken of issues relating to environmental liability in
future cases. This is being addressed under the EPSAL, but progress in this area is important and
should be monitored.
2. In the restructuring of the energy sector attention needs to be paid to any affordability impacts of
higher energy prices and their possible implications for increased use of wood fuel.
3. Similarly in the modernizing of the water sector, we have had problems in other countries with
affordability, resulting in sharp declines in consumption of water in poor houscholds with possibic
negative health impacts.
4. On the managing of environmental risks the project should ask and record progress in the
introduction of an integrated pollution prevention and control permit system, as well as on
implementation of the environmental laws and regulations.
