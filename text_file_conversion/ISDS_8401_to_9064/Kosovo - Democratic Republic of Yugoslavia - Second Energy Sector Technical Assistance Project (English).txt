system, and (b) optimizing utilization of existing generation capacity through economic dispatch; and in
institutional development of the power utility
I.A.3. Project Description:
Four components have been tentatively identified on the basis of the Energy Sector Study report (
September, 2002) and preliminary discussions with the Recipient. These components will be further
elaborated and firmed up during pre-appraisal scheduled in January 2003. The client will contribute in
kind by providing counterpart support. Cost estimates are also preliminary and will become better
determined when the scope of work is fully defined. The project components are:
Detailed feasibility report for 400 kV connection between Kosovo B and Kashar ( Albania).
Assistance in developing terms of exchange of power.
Detailed documentation to solicit contractors to establish dispatch center.
Institutional development support.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
No environmental issues are anticipated. The consultants' terms of reference for the feasibility study of the
transmission line will include evaluation of possible environmental impact of each of the alternatives to
be studied, and recommendations on environmental safeguards that should be included while
implementing the selected alternative.
The detailed feasibility study for transmission line will include an assessment of possible social impact in
case any land needs to be acquired for the related sub-station, tower setting, and the right of way. These
issues will be included in the evaluation of options. The land acquisition procedures will be reviewed
An assessment of social impacts would be required only when detailed route planning and technical
design is prepared for implementation.
II.D. I b Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

in the project preparation, work directly with the consultants throughout the project implementation
period and provide most of the data needed for the project.
While making an assessment of social impact as part of feasibility study, the consultants would be
required to consult with the local population and with the NGOs.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of thal policy apply.
] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
