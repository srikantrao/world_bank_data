B.  Project Objective
 
The objective of the project would be to create a sustaining financing mechanism in Iller Bank to 
support municipal investments and service.  
 Iller Bank is registered as a development bank but it 
does not function as a bank due to systemic problems such as lack of independence in operations 
and incentives for municipalities and utilities to act in a fiscally responsible manner.  Further, the 
lack of long-term capital in the country hinders the operations of the bank.     
 
The above investment operation would be complemented by the Bank’s proposed Public Sector 
Adjustment Loans (between FY’04 and FY ’06).  These Public Sector Adjustment Loans 
(PSALs) will have three broad areas of focus – public sector reform; local government reform; 
and social security reform.  The reforms in the local government area would create an enabling 
environment for the implementation of the above project.

C.  Project Description
 
Currently, Iller Bank lends and also transfers central government tax resources to the 
municipalities.  The bank has the authority to intercept transfers against municipalities that do 
not service their debt.  However, in practice due to political influences full intercepts are not 
implemented.  This leads to non-performing loans for Iller Bank which ultimately hurts the 
investment climate in the municipal sector.   
 
The project will support the restructuring of Iller Bank and have three components.  It would be 
implemented in two phases using the Bank’s Adaptable Program Loan (APL) instrument.  The 
total project cost is estimated to be US$ 270 million with a World Bank loan of US$ 200 million.  
Each phase of the World Bank’s APL is estimated at US$ 100 million. 
 
A. Policy Component
:
The reforms would focus on restructuring Iller Bank to make it 
function like a bank and ultimately become a financial intermediary for municipalities.  
To this end, this component of the project would focus on: developing and implementing 
a
plan to improve the quality of assets; developing a policy to lend to municipalities after 
proper economic, financial, technical, and environmental appraisal; implementing a 
policy to secure loans made by Iller Bank by automatic reduction in central government 
transfers; developing a plan to reduce the current pipeline of projects some of which are 
not economic; and developing a plan to raise capital in the future for municipal lending.   
 
B. Institutional Component
:
This component will focus on the institutional change that 
would be necessary to support the above policy component.  As the bank restructures 
itself, it would have to realign itself as more of a financial institution rather than a 
technical one.  It would have to hire more experts with economic and financial 
background and at the same time review the role of its current technical staff.  Some of 
the technical staff would be retained to provide engineering, investment planning, and 
land use planning advice for the municipalities that are shareholders of the bank.   
 
C.  Investment and Services Component
:
This component would support lending for priority 
investments in the municipalities after the above policy and institutional changes take 
place.  The investments would have to be viable and would cover areas such as water, 
wastewater, and solid waste management that are core areas of competence for Iller 
Bank.  Through this component, the introduction of the private sector for the provision of 
municipal services would also be supported.    
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project location is not yet known.  The project would focus on priority and viable 
investments, in all areas of the country, that would be identified during project preparation.    
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity
 
Page  3
Iller Bank has been in operation for decades and is able to carry out its function on a technical 
basis (project preparation and procurement).  The project would support the financial functions 
of Iller Bank.  Thus, the Borrower will have the technical and financial capacity to carry out the 
project in a satisfactory manner.

As this is a Financial Intermediary project, a safeguard framework will be developed to address 
safeguard issues that may arise during project preparation and implementation.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
A
framework agreement on environmental issues will be developed during project preparation.  
This would address the environmental safeguard issues that may come up during project 
implementation.  Agreement would be reached with the Borrower that in case other safeguard 
issues arise during project implementation, the Borrower will address them in accordance with 
Bank policies.  
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be 
addressed? 
 
The Bank’s procedures on disclosure of information for Financial Intermediary operations will 
be followed during project preparation and implementation.  Under the project, the 
municipalities that will utilize the loan will consult with the affected population and disclose 
information, in accordance with Bank policies.  Iller Bank as a Financial Intermediary will 
ensure that the municipalities carry out the public consultation and information disclosure, in a 
satisfactory manner. 
 
IV.  AGREEMENTS REACHED ON SAFEGUARDS AT PCN 
REVIEW 
 
At the PCN review meeting it was noted that the project is expected to follow the Bank’s 
safeguard procedures for a Financial Intermediary project and this would involve reaching an 
agreement with Iller Bank on how they would address the safeguard issues under the project.
