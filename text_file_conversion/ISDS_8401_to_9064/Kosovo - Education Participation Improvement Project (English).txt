I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The objective of the project is to improve children's access and educational attaimnent at primary
and secondary education levels.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The proposed project is expected to have up to four components, a school development grant component
will provide funding to schools to achieve improvement of access and education attainment, a
management information systems (EMIS) component will help strengthen and ensure the sustainability
of the current EMIS, an education participation support grant component may help pilot cash payments
for poor families (this component is contingent on Bank and UNMIK approval), and a project
management component will support implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the project.
1. School Development Grants (SDG): The SDG process will help allocate up to 10,000USD grants to
targeted primary schools and 20,000USD grants to targeted secondary schools (maximum grant amounts
to be determined during preparation) on the basis of a school development planning and proposal writing
process. Through this process, the schools will be expected to prepare plans and projects aimed at
improving access, attendance, and completion, as well as improving the quality of teaching and learnlig.
The component will help build the capacity of school boards and school management to (i) define plans
to improve performance; (ii) develop grant proposals; (iii) target increasing access to schooling; and (iii)
improve attendance as well as attainment. Outreach assistance will be provided to targeted schools to
help prepare the plans and grant proposals. The proposals will be evaluated and approved by a central
evaluation board. (Criteria and procedure for targeting will be established during project preparation.)
2. Improving the Education Management Information System: T he project will improve the
sustainability of the current EMIS, as well as help improve the system in terms of measuring access to
schools. More specifically, the EMIS will help monitor enrollment, attendance, repetition, dropout and

completion, as well as account for children who are eligible to attend school but not in the school system.
3. Piloting education participation support grants (cash payments) to families witlh children attending
schools: Contingent on Bank and UNMIK approval, the project may pilot cash payments to compensate
for the out-of-pocket payments of schooling to the poorest families who have school eligible children as
an incentive for the children to enroll and attend school.
4. Project management: An international project manager and a small logistical staff are responsible in
the Ministry of Education and Science for implementing the education components of the Education and
Health Project. Their contracts are expected to be extended under the upcoming project. In addition to
supporting project implementation in cooperation with UNMIK authorities responsible for financial
management and procurement), the project management unit will be responsible for monitoring and
evaluation of results under the school development component.
Components:
1. School Planning and School Development Grants
2. Education Management Information System
3. Education Participation Support Grants (cash payments to families)
4. Project Management
