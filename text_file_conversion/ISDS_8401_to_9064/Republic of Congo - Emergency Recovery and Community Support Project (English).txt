I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):


The objective of the Emergency Recovery and Community Support Project is to support recovery
of communities living in smaller municipalities and rural areas (i.e. all areas out of the two cities
of Brazzaville and Pointe Noire). To that effect, and in line with the objectives outlined in the
Transition Support Strategy, the Project aims to: (i) provide financial support for the
implementation of priority, small-scale rehabilitation and economic revitalization activities in all
"départements"; (ii) support activities initiated by local NGOs and community-based
organizations in all "départements"; (iii) assist in strengthening administrative capacities, at both
the central and the local levels of Government to facilitate implementation of the economic
reform and decentralization programs; and (iv) provide balance of payments support to free up
Government resources and allow for fiscal transfers to local collectivities, so as to provide these
entities with some of the resources necessary for the delivery of basic social services.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):


The proposed program comprises four components: (i) financing of priority local investments
(component A); (ii) support to community organizations (component B); (iii) capacity
enhancement at the central and local government level (component C); and (iv) support to
economic management (component D). Components A and B are directly aimed at
implementing rehabilitation and economic revitalization activities in the ten départements and
the four smaller municipalities, through processes which are expected to help strengthen social
capital and create short- and medium-term employment opportunities. Components C and D are
aimed at supporting the economic reform and decentralization processes, with a view to
maintaining the pace of reforms and improving economic management in the départements.

Component A: Financing of Priority Local Investments ($14 million). This component aims to
help relieve the economic and social hardship caused by the successive crises in areas that have

                                                    2
                                                                                                   ISDS



received little external support over the last years, while strengthening participatory mechanisms
for decision-making at local level. The component will help address some of the rehabilitation
challenges in all départements and tackle unemployment issues by promoting the use of
labor-intensive methods. Wherever possible and/or appropriate, special attention will be given to
providing employment to disenfranchised groups including former combatants, unemployed
youth and female heads of households. Activities under this component will also facilitate the
establishment of an adequate mechanism for selecting local investment priorities at the
département and municipal level. This is expected to help improve local governance over time
and could eventually form the basis for preparation and monitoring of poverty reduction
programs at the local level within the context of the PRSP process.

Each département will be allocated a notional maximum amount for activities in a given year.
The implementation agency will then facilitate a broad consultative process, to engage all
stakeholders in the selection and prioritization of investments. Once activities (which should not
exceed $200,000 each) have been identified, the implementation agency will procure the relevant
works, goods, and services, and supervise the execution of these contracts.

Component B: Support to Community Organizations ($3 million). This component aims to
strengthen social capital in départements as a key element of a successful decentralization and
empowerment process. By strengthening community-based organizations, the component aims
to create the type of social organization that is necessary for stakeholders to participate
effectively in the definition of key priorities for poverty reduction, as well as for eventually
increasing accountability of local authorities vis-à-vis the population. To that effect, the
component will finance both activities initiated by local NGOs and associations (on a
demand-driven basis, with a ceiling at $20,000 per activity) and programs to enhance the
technical and managerial capacity of these organizations. The component is critical in an
environment where social capital has been severely eroded by a decade of conflict and political
instability. Restoring some organizational structure in the non-government sector is essential for
the eventual success of the decentralization effort as well as for the stabilization of rural areas
and small towns.

Component C: Capacity Enhancement Support ($8 million). This component aims to
complement existing programs with a view to assisting the Government address some of the key
issues associated with the process of decentralization and economic reform. The component will
provide support to improve economic management both in the newly-created départements and at
the central Government level (in particular to help implement key economic reforms). At the
local level, the Project will focus on both improving the preparation, execution, and monitoring
of local budgets and identifying untapped sources of local revenues, and helping to de-bottleneck
collection efforts. At the central level, the Project will provide support to targeted areas,
including preparation of the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, implementation of the
public service reform, decentralization, review of forestry policies, and implementation of the
telecommunications and postal services reforms.

Component D: Support To Economic Management ($13 million). Under this component, the
Project will provide balance of payments support, to help finance critical imports and free up

fiscal resources which can be transferred to local collectivities ­ for these entities to be in a
position to effectively deliver basic social services. This is in particular aimed at helping the
Government put in place adequate mechanisms for the transfer of fiscal resources from the
central Government to the local collectivities ­ and for the monitoring of their effective use. It
will complement efforts under Component C by focusing on the audit and monitoring aspects.
Support will be disbursed in three tranches.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The Project will be implemented in all parts of the country - but for the two cities of Brazzaville and Pointe
Noire.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments:

The Emergency Recovery and Community Support Project is classified as environmental category B
because no activity financed under the Project is expected to have significant negative
environmental impact:

    Rehabilitation and economic revitalization activities, financed under Components A and C, will
    be screened through a process aimed at ensuring that only those activities for which
    environmental and/or social risks are adequately mitigated are funded.

    Economic reforms promoted through Components B and D are not expected to have a
    significant environmental impact. Activities in the forestry sector will consist of studies aimed
    at assessing the situation in the sector, and providing policy recommendations to the
    Government. Bank staff will ensure that such recommendations are consistent with policies and
    procedures under OP/BP4.36.

The Emergency Recovery and Community Support Project is an emergency recovery operation,

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01). Activities financed under Components A and B
   are expected to include some rehabilitation activities, in particular infrastructure repairs. These activities,
   however, are expected to remain limited in scope, and will be selcted through a process aimed at
   excluding all activities with a potential negative impact and no adequate mitigation measures. Activites
   financed under Components C and D are not expected to have any significant environmental impact (see
   below for forestry). Safeguard policy 4.01 for environmental assessment is therefore triggered.

Natural Habitats (OP4.04, BP 4.04, GP 4.04). Activities in natural habitats will be excluded from
   financing under Components A and B. Policy reforms supported under Components C and D are not
   expected to have an impact on natural habitats.

Forestry (OP 4.36, GP 4.36). Studies in the forestry sector possibly financed under Component C will
   trigger forestry safeguard policies to the extent that they aim to bring about changes in the management,
   protection, or utilization of natural forests or plantations. Activities financed under the Component,
   however, are expected to be limited to reviewing existing policies and strengthening administrative
   capacity for implementation of existing regulations (which were developed with the support of the Bank
   as part of the policy dialogue). It is expected that policy changes will be supported through a component
   of a follow up operation, possibly an Economic Recovery Credit to be prepared in FY04. The safeguard
   on forestry is therefore triggered.

Pest Management (OP 4.09). The Project is not expected to finance pesticides or activities which could
   have affect agricultural or public health.

                                                      5
                                                                                                        ISDS




Cultural Property (OPN 11.03). The Project is not expected to affect any cultural property. Activities
   under Components A and B which could have a negative impact on cultural property will be excluded
   during the selection process.

Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.20). The Project is not expected to include activities in areas inhabited by
   indigenous peoples.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12). Some activities financed under Components A and B may require
   the resettlement of limited groups of people. Such activities will only be considered for financing if they
   are accompanied with appropriate compensation measures. The involuntary resettlement safeguard is
   therefore triggered.

Safety of Dams (OP4.37, BP 4.37). The Project does not include the financing of dams, or dam-related
   activities.

Projects in International Waters (OP 7.50, BP 7.50, GP 7.50). No activity financed under the Project is
   expected to be located in international waters.

Projects in Disputed Areas (OP 7.60, BP 7.60, GP 7.60). No activity financed under the Project is expected
   to be located in disputed areas.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

No such impact is expected.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

Although the Project is expected to contribute to economic recovery in rural areas and smaller
municipalities, such recovery is not expected to translate into the type of economic activities which could
have a significant environmental or social impact.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

N/A

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

Compliance with safeguards for activities financed under Components A and B will require: (i) a
mechanism to screen proposed activities, and exclude those which would not be consistent with Bank
policies; and (ii) a definition of adequate processes and procedures to design and implement sound
environmental and social mitigation measures. This is expected to be achieved through the preparation
of an Environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework, which
will define both screening criteria and mechanisms for mitigation. These Frameworks will be reflected
in the Operational Manuals to be prepared by the implementation agencies for components A and B as a
condition of disbursement for these components.

Compliance with safeguards for activities financed under Components B and D will not require any

specific action.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders will be the communities living in rural areas and smaller municipalities. These
communities are expected to be associated to the selection of priorities through facilitated consultation
process. As a first step of this process, they will be informed of the provisions of the Operational
Manual, including those pertaining to safeguard policies. Disclosure of an Environmental and Social
Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework will be in-country and in the Bank's
InfoShop in Washington, DC as soon as available and at the latest, within a year of effectiveness. The
same groups are also expected to play an important role during implementation in the monitoring of
compliance with the policies.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
          in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
          similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
          safeguard issues.
