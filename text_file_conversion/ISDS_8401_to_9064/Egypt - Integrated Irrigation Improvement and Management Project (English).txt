I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
    Project Scope and Objectives: In line with the GOE's development strategy and the planned
    reforms in the water sector, the World Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2001) and
    MNA Strategy (2002) which has water as one of the key focus areas; the proposed project
    will assist in the implementation of measures aimed at ensuring the efficient and sustainable
    use of the country's water and land resources. The proposed project would provide for
    introduction of a framework for integrated water resources management, support planned
    institutional reforms, together with support for the rehabilitation of irrigation, drainage and
    pumping stations and removal of system bottlenecks in the major canals in three command
    areas in the Nile Delta (Mahmoudia, Meet Yazid and Bahr Tanah), one in Middle Egypt
    (Serry Canal Area) and one in Upper Egypt (Tomas and Afia). The total areas benefiting
    these five commands is expected to be about 500,000 feddans.

    The following are the broad objectives of the project reviewed and agreed with the Project
    Preparation Team (PPT) and the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation's (MWRI's)
    Steering Committee:

        (a) develop a framework for integrated water management plan and program in selected
        command areas, combining water quantity and quality management through inter-agency
        and stakeholder consensus;

        (b) improve institutional, financial, and environmental sustainability of water services
        through intensive user and private sector participation in the investment, and operation
        and maintenance at the district/branch canal levels and below and improved water quality
        management practices; and

        (c) increase farm incomes through improved agricultural production based on efficient,
        more equitable and sustainable use and management of water and land resources.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
    Project Components: The following are the components of the proposed project that were
    discussed and tentatively agreed with the Project Preparation Team and the MWRI's Steering
    Committee during the identification mission:

    (a) Preparation and implementation of integrated water management plans in selected
    command areas. This component would include support for irrigation, drainage, pumping
    stations and groundwater sub-sectors of the MWRI, for piloting integrated plans and
    coordinated implementation arrangements for the project areas including technical assistance
    and training and supply of equipment, materials, vehicles and office equipment;

    (b) Establishment and expansion of Water User Associations (WUAs) and the Water
    Boards in line with Government policy of integrated irrigation and drainage water
    management. This would include support for WUAs at the tertiary level and up scaling them
    to branch canal level and their incorporation in the Water Boards at the district level;

    (c) Improvement and modernization of irrigation and drainage infrastructure. This
    component would include the implementation of improvements, modernization of main,
    branch canals, tertiary systems, drains, irrigation and drainage pumping stations,
    implementation of new, and rehabilitation of existing sub-surface field drainage systems,
    their subsurface collectors and open drains, covering a total area of about 500,000 feddans;

    (d) Environmental Management Plan: GEF support would be sought to address
    environmental assessment and mitigation measures focusing on water quality for integrated
    irrigation and drainage in the three regional project areas which have distinctive ecological
    systems, and would build on site-specific pilots under the ongoing IIP, NDPII, and Pump III
    projects. The GEF component would be fully developed during project preparation; and

    (e) On-Farm demonstration program: The project would support the establishment of
    about 50 on-farm demonstrations spread over the five project areas during the five years of
    project implementation to demonstrate proven technologies for improved water use.

    The three command areas are located in: (i) Northern parts of the Delta Region (Mahmoudia, Meet
    Yazid and Bahr Tanah; (ii) Middle Egypt( Serry Canal area); and (iii) Upper Egypt (Tomas and Afia
    areas). The demographic, social and environmental data required will be determined as part of the
    project preparation work.


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: For the purposes of O.D. 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, the project has been classified as
Category B, and will be subject to field-based review. An Environmental Assessment will be carried out for
the three project regional areas which have distinctive ecological system and reviewed at pre-appraisal. The
recommended actions will be incorporated into an Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The EA and
EMP will be carried out with full consultation with the concerned stakeholders. While the overall
environmental impact of the proposed project are expected to be positive, an environmental screening
process will provide detailed information with regards to the impacts of construction and operation stages
for project components.

The proposed Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management Project (IIIMP) follows and

builds on a series of successful World Bank's financed projects over the last three decades, all of
which have had significant positive impact on the irrigation, drainage and pumping stations
infrastructure and water delivery systems. The lessons learned from the implementation of EMPs in
the on-going relevant projects, as well as other environmental donor initiatives in the water sector
indicated that the issue of water quality management remains a very high priority in relation to the
improvement of irrigation management. This includes: (i) regulations, standards and enforcement
concerning the reuse of drainage water for irrigation; (ii) uncontrolled discharge of domestic
pollution loads into irrigation and drainage systems and their impacts on public health; (iii) water
quality monitoring results at the national and localized levels and their utilization as a
decision-making tool; and (iv) problems of cross-sectoral coordination for water quality
management. In addition, the issue of environmental assessment capacity and enforcement is
important both at the different sectors and the ministry as a whole.

Overall, the project is expected to generate a number of positive environmental impacts through
contributing to improved land and water management in the irrigated agricultural sector of Egypt.
The rehabilitation of the infrastructure will help maintain the water tables at low levels, and thus
prevent water logging and soil salinization. The on-farm irrigation component will lead to a more
efficient and thus reduced use of irrigation water, as well as to increased yields due to the
introduction of on-demand irrigation. The project will seek to secure GEF grant financing to support
the capacity building, institutional set-up and potential pilot infrastructure for integrated water
quality and environmental management in the water sector. This will fit within the integrated
approach adopted for the IIIMP bringing together the different stakeholders within and outside the
ministry, including beneficiaries.

The project preparation will review earlier environmental assessments undertaken by USAID and
IIP, as well as results from on-going World Bank, METAP and other donor operations to determine
the scope of the TOR for the preparation of an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for the
project. The EMP will address: (i) strengthening of the environmental assessment and management
capacity of MWRI and its different relevant sectors; (ii) setting-up of successful coordination and
implementation mechanisms for water quality management, including monitoring; (iii) reporting
and enforcement; (iv) supporting for small-scale infrastructure to mitigate potential adverse impacts
of water quality deterioration; and (v) final disseminating of the lessons learned to benefit other
areas with similar problems at the basin or regional levels. Finally, the EMP is envisaged to include
clear mechanisms for monitoring of successful implementation with the full participation of all
relevant stakeholders. Extensive consultation on the EA and the EMP would take place with all
concerned stakeholders during project preparation and before project appraisal.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

OP 4.01 has been triggered on account of the potential adverse impacts of project works related to irrigation
and drainage infrastructure. This will be assessed through an environmental assessment to be completed
prior to appraisal. Safeguard issues related to natural habitat (OP 4.04) will be assessed to verify any
significant impacts not already covered under OP 4.01. As the target population which will benefit from the
project is estimated at about 220,000 farm households which is based on the prevailing land ownership and
cropping patterns, most of the farmers in the project area are smallholders who have an average size of land
holding of two feddans. As 63% of the poor and 74% of the ultra poor in Egypt live in rural areas,
increasing productivity of agriculture remains an important prerequisite for increasing the income of the
rural poor in a sustainable manner. As mentioned earlier in the PCD, the alleviation of rural poverty, in
particular, is cited in the CAS as the most relevant target for the coming years.



II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

The environmental impact of the project are expected to be minor and there are no irreversible adverse
environmental impacts generated by the proposed project since all its individual and integrated components
have been the subject of highly successful World Bank cofinanced projects in the last three decades.
Overall, the project is expected to have a positive environmental impact and contribute to improved land and
water management in the irrigated agricultural sector in Egypt.            In particular, the on-farm irrigation
improvement will lead to a more optimum use of water thus resulting in more produce for less irrigation
water. The project will also help improve the drainage of irrigated areas, thus reducing the possibilities of
water logging and soil salinization in addition to monitoring the reuse of drainage water in mixing with
irrigation water in addition to effects of agricultural, industrial and domestic vast pollution in the irrigation
and drainage conveyance channels.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No potential long-term or cumulative impacts on the ecosystem are expected to result from the project.
However, this will be verified during the environmental assessment.



II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
If alternatives are required , then they will be identified and included in the project preparation.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Generally speaking , a minimum of pesticides is used in Egypt with the main reliance being on Integrated

                                                     6
                                                                                                        ISDS



Pest Management (IPM) where the use of pesticides is reduced considerably. This will however need to be
further verified during the preparation stage.




II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project would expand the coverage and role of participatory WUAs and coordinate their activities with
other agencies on a command area basis, where they exist in the same area. In addition, beneficiaries in
'basic units' would be represented on pilot Water Boards in the project area, which will be determined during
project preparation, in coordination with the management of the ongoing Water Boards Project. The Social
Assessment, which will be part of the project preparation stage, will include : (a) the assessment and
incorporation of the social lessons of the ongoing IIP and also ongoing NDP and Pumping Stations
Rehabilitation Project; (b) ensure that farmers' needs are taken into consideration in project design; (c)
identify social constraints or problems that could put the execution of the proposed project at risk; and (d)
provide recommendations for effective farmer involvement. The SA will also ascertain whether any of the
social safeguards will apply. Workshops will be organized as part of project preparation to solicit user
views and concerns.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
          in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
          similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
          safeguard issues.
