A. Basic Project Data
Country: PAKISTAN                                 Project ID: P077288
Project: National Education Assessment System     Task Team Leader: S. Ameer Naqvi
Authorized to Appraise Date: April 17, 2002       IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: June 3, 2003                       IDA Amount ($m): 3.63
Managing Unit: SASHD                              Sector: Primary education (100%)
Lending Instrument: Technical Assistance Loan (TAL)  Theme: Education for all (P)
Status: Lending
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
Development objectives of NEAS as stated in Annex I are: to design and administer assessment
mechanisms; to establish administrative infrastructure and capacity for assessment administration,
analysis and report writing; and to increase stakeholder knowledge and acceptance of assessment
objectives and procedures.
Under those broad objectives, specific objectives of the assessment system to be piloted include
development of an empirical understanding of the following:
*      how well the curricula are being translated into knowledge and skills among students;
*      subject, geographic and gender-related areas of inequity in student performance;
*      the principal determinants of student performance including teacher, student background and
other causal variables;
*      how resource allocations (fiscal, material and human) might be redirected to improve student
performance;
*      how to assist teachers to use data to improve student performance; and
*      how to create a sustainable capacity to conduct quality surveys of student learning and to apply
findings to policy formation.
The NEAS is planned as a sample-based national assessment, to be conducted at grade 4 and grade 8
levels, in four subjects - Language, Mathematics, Science and Social Studies/lslamiyat/Life Skills. This
project will provide the basis for designing and pilot testing the administrative process, the measurement
instruments and the information dissemination strategy associated with assessment of learning outcomes.
In addition, this project should enable the Government of Pakistan (GoP), Provinces/Areas to make
assessment a permanent feature of the education system in the country.

I.A.3. Project Description:
By its very design this project is experimental / developmental in nature. Because of the specialized
skills and the paucity of them in Pakistan, a sizeable portion of the credit will be used for learning- in
terms of both skill acquisition and applied learning through the pilot testing and experimental procedures
of the assessment design. As shown in the table below, the project would have three broad components:
capacity building; pilot testing and implementation of the assessment activities; and information
dissemination.
Components:
Capacity Building
Pilot testing and implementation of assessment activities
Information Dissemination
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will conduct student assessment on representative samples of students from the schools of all
areas of Pakistan. There are no issues of an unusually sensitive nature involved in the design and
institutionalization of this system.
