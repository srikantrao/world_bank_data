I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The project's ultimate goal is to contribute to poverty reduction. The project development objective is to
enhance the living standards of the poor in the city of Djibouti (which accounts for 83% of the country's
total population) by increasing the quality of and access to basic economic and social infrastructure and
services and by generating employment opportunities. The project is expected to achieve this objective
through approaches that foster labor-intensive techniques, comrnunity participation and the development of
small local entrepreneurs in the construction sector.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The project has three components:
(1) Social and economic infrastructure. This component includes: (i) street works and drainage on
secondary and tertiary networks; (ii) constructionlrehabilitation of commercial infrastructure (markets,
public spaces, Etc.); (iii) construction/rehabilitation of social infrastructure (standpipes, health posts,
primary and secondary schools); and (iv) rehabilitation of public buildings forming part of the city's
cultural heritage;
(2) Support to community development. This component complements the activities funded under
Component I through: (i) the implementation of a social mobilization program; and (ii) the provision of
comnunity subproject grants; and
(3) Institutional capacity building. This component includes the provision of: (i) financial support to the
National Bureau of Statistics for poverty monitoring and analysis ; and (ii) technical assistance for project
management and implementation.
I.A.4. Project Location:
The social and economic infrastructure investment projects funded by the project are generally located in
the poorest neighborhoods of the city of Djibouti. None of them are located in proximnity to any protected
areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas. The rehabilitation of
public buildings forming part of the city's cultural heritage is an environmentally friendly activity, by
nature.

Comments: The rating of the original lending operation was B. It was subsequently changed into FI given
the fact that ADETIP, the implementing agency, operates similarly to a financial intermediary. Indeed, the
investment subprojects that ADETIP implements have a programmatic nature and are planned yearly in
cooperation with the central and local authorities as well as the local communities.
