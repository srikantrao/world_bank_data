I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The purpose of this sector adjustmnent operation is to provide core budget support for the
attainment of the MlG targets in basic education. The project would be the first part of a long-
term program to support sector wide development through a series of single 'tranche adjustment
programs that would be.linked to achieving specific qualitative and quantitative targets in the
education sector. By itarting with Pakistan's largest province with a population of over 60%, the
project targets a major part of the challenge to meeting MDG goals in the country.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
There project's take advantage of a major opportunity for improving education access and quality
in Pakistan's largest province presented by the combination of strong political support and
Pakistan's devolution reforms. The newly elected government in Punjab has developed a reform
program which strongly places governance issues at center stage. The government proposes to
take advantage of the opportunity offered by Pakistan's decentralization which transfers
responsibility for education to elected district govemments and proposes to take this up in
partnerships with the elccted district govemments who have the responsibility for delivering
education and health services. The Government is putting in place policies and programrs which
will be difficult to reverse such as transparent recruitment criteria, restructuring public private
partnerships through its Education Foundation, reinvigorating teacher training programs, and
establishing performance based agreements with District Governments. The Bank support would
be channeled through the provincial budget and would represent an additional increase in
resources for the sector over and abovc increases funded from thc provincial government's own
resources. The reform agenda is very wide ranging and will be implemented over a three to five
year period. During this period the Government expects to almost double total expenditures on
education frpm the current base of 33 billion rupees, The agenda covers improvcments in access
particularly among the poor though provision of nissing facilities, scholarships, provision of free
text books and elininating fees. The reform agenda also targets qualitative issues such as teacher
training, teacher entry qualifications and support for teachers through appropriate provision of
teacher aids. Govemance issues are addressed by tackling teacher absenteeism, system
management and role of school based comununities.
I.A.4. Project Locarion: (Geographic location, information about the key environnimntal and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximIry to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.) The Program will cover che entire province , wherever, government
