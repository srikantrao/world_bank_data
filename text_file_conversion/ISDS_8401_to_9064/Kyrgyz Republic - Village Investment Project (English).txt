services and infrastructure (P); Rural non-farm
income generation (P); Gender (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The overarching aim of the project is to contribute to the alleviation of rural poverty. It seeks to achieve
this by pursuing three specific objectives: (a) improving governance and capacity at the local level; (b)
strengthening the provision of, and access to, essential infrastructure services; and (c) supporting private
small-scale enterprise development. It does this at the grassroots level, by supporting income and
employment generating investments in village infrastructure and in group-managed small and medium
enterprises, and by helping communtities and local authorities work together to achieve key development
objectives at the local level. This approach is firmly in line with the country's policy of devolution of
responsibilities. It will strengthen local govermnent administrations (aiyl okmnotus) and councils (aiyl
keneshs) and grassroots institutions -- making them more inclusive, accountable and effective at meeting
villagers' self-identified development needs.
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project will support the development of capacity at the community level (village governments and
community-based organizations) to plan, prioritize and implement local investments and to manage
financial resources in an efficient and transparent manner. Funds will be provided to eligible coimmunities
in the form of small block grants. The communities will use these to support small-scale demand-driven
community or group investments that will directly or indirectly generate off-farm employment and income
or that will alleviate serious deficiencies in local infrastructure and thereby allow villagers to turn their
attention to economic ventures. Investment decisions at the community level will be made on the basis of
participatory plamuing, involving all local stakeholders.
Component 1, Capacity Building and Empowennent, will support local capacity building and promote
community empowennent. Training will be provided to strengthen the capacity of communities, CBOs,
NGOs and local governments to plan, coordinate, finance and implement sustainable investments, and to do
so in a participatory and transparent manner.
Component 2, Village Investments, will support community-driven investments in local micro-projects that
will generate employment and raise incomes in the participating communities. Funding will be provided for
economic and social infrastructure projects that are included in their annual community investment plan as

meeting critical local needs as detenrmined by the comrununities themselves as well as for income generating
group- or community-operated business ventures that are considered beneficial for the community. The
emphasis will be on non-farm activities, but viable investments in agricultural diversification and
specialization in higher-value products will also be considered, as will critical investments in natural
resource management. Eligible investments will need to be community or group ventures. Communities
will receive project funds on a grant basis and will use these to support micro-projects within the
commnmity. Commnunities and individual micro-projects receiving project funds will be required to account
publicly and regularly for all ftmds received and the progress of activities financed with these funds.
Beneficiaries will contribute part of the investment cost from their own resources, appoint a project
implementation team, procure the necessary goods and services, and implement, operate and maintain the
micro-projects. Up to 4,000 such small micro-projects will be financed, based on cormnunity demand.
Component 3, Project Management, will provide support for overall project management, including but not
limited to a Project Management Agency that will manage and oversee the implementation of the village
investnent program. The agency will not be large, as its functions will not include direct implementation of
micro-projects. The project will finance key agency staff, consultants, essential equipment, operating costs,
technical assistance, training, and office refurbishment. Funding will also be provided for intensive
publicity campaigns, beneficiary assessments, periodic surveys, participatory M&E activities, project
audits, widely representative Advisory Cotmcils at the national and regional levels, and to fuirther legal,
regulatory and administrative reforrn to promote and advance administrative and financial decentralization
and community-driven development.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Project activities will be located mainly within or close to existing settlements. Proximity to protected or
sensitive areas is not anticipated.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)
Commenis: Since the nature and location of actual micro-projects are not known, the project is environmental
category Fl.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summntary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please ill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be talken to obtain necessary data.
IH.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated withl the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or inreversible impacts.
The project will fund micro-projects of different types, primarily of a social and economic community
infrastructLure type within or veiy close to existing settlements, but including also very small-scale
investnents in local services, agroprocessing and natural resources management. All will be very
small-scale activities and are not expected to have significant negative envirornental impacts individually
or collectively. Possible minor impacts would most likely be related to construction residues and
management of waste materials from small-scale agro-processing facilities. Investments that may carry
environmental risks that are unlikely to be manageable at the local level, such as mining or dam
construction are not eligible for financing under the project.
II.D. lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not expected.
II.D. Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No adverse impact is expected.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed t-eatmenit of alternatives (if required)
N/A
ILD.3. Describe airangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Each micro-project will be reviewed for safeguard purposes. The Operational Manual for the project
includes a chapter providing enviro-unental guidelines to assist the implementing communities, the Project
Management Agency and any participating FIs in this function. Specific and detailed Guidelines for
Environmental Review of Micro-Projects have been prepared, are part of the Operational Manual, and will
be provided to all participating communities and institutions. The procedures to be followed are consistent
with OP 4.01 and Kyrgyz requirements and will ensure compliance with safeguard procedures and issues.
They clearly describes institutional arrangements and responsibilities and the process of environmental
assessment requirements, focusing on transparency and on comprehension by the target communities and
local officials. Where needed, local officials will be trained in preparing simple and appropriate
environmental management plans. The Operational Manual includes a list of ineligible micro-projects.
The relevance of the guidelines will be reviewed after the first 100 micro-projects have been implemented;
this review will be shared with IDA's Safeguards Specialist and adjustments will be made if warranted.
IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project will be highly participatory and demand-driven. The main stakeholders are members of rural
communities, leaders and staff of local administrations, community and village leaders, political leaders,
traditional leaders, CBOs and NGOs. Although the involvement of each stakeholder will be different, the
principal participatory mechanisms will be extensive interviews, workshops at different levels, and
structured participatory planning and M&E processes. As appropriate, stakeholders will be given training
or experiential awareness-raising exercises to increase their own capacity to participate or to enable them to
include others in the process. The EMP was disclosed prior to appraisal.
