I A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The household energy and universal rural access (HEURA) iroject tntends to support the
Government of Malt's efforts to increase access to energy s rvices to help achieve its poverty
reduction targets including those linked with the Millenniun i Development Goals (MDC(s)
The detailed objectives include
(i)    accelerating the use of modern energy in rural and p n-urban areas in order to improve
living standards, to enhance quality and efficiency of healtl and education centers, and to
increase productivity of small and medium enterprises,
(ii)   promoting further community based woodland manr gement to reduce unsustainable
pressure on forest resources while simultaneously encouraE ing interfuel substitution and energy
efficiency initiatives, and,
(iii) strengthening the energy sector reform processes an I institutions to create a favorable
investment environment for increased private sector particil ation in energy services delivery
in rural and peri-urban areas
I A.3 Project Description (From PDS)
1.1 Component 1: Capacity Development and Institutional S rengthening
In the Malian context of power sector reform, a support of I )A will ensure that the regulatory
and institutional reform is deepened and pave the ways for Jecentralized energy in ruraL and
pen-urban areas Specifically, for the Regulatory Commissi n, which oversees the management
of decentralized energy schemes, IDA will support the folli vwing activities

ISDS
*   Training and capacity building program for the member: of the commission in the areas of
regulatory analytical accounting, finance and economics tariff design,
*   Technical assistance to develop and implement the mon tonng and evaluation program of the
operators, and to build awareness among consumers and technical ministnes staff.
For the DNE, IDA will support the following activities:
*   Training and capacity building program for the staff in t ie areas of policy formulation,
monitonng, evaluation, and impact assessment,
*   Technical assistance to set up a monitoring, evaluation, md impact assessment systems,
including the supply of equipment, tools, and best pract ce.
1.2 Component 2: Energy Services Delivery
To date, the rural electrification rate is at the core of the Go remment's rural development
strategy with the following objectives
*   Contribute to the economic development by providing E dditional means to create wealth and
revenue flows;
*   Improve the living conditions of the rural populations a id provide social incentives to
maintain communities m their local environment;
*   Protect the environrment through the use of environrnen al friendly technologies, which meet
modem standards
However, an ambitious energy development program requi es on one hand hefty investnents and
on the other hand, the involvement of new players - private "investor-operators" - beside
traditional institutional actors under private-public partners iip
This component will in the first two years assist the GOM
)> in the strengthening of the implementation agency, "Ag ence Malienne d'Energie Rurale"
(AMDER), for the promotion of energy services in rura L areas, and the rural energy fund
(REF)
>  in developing financial mechanisms to facilitate the pai ticipation of private sector operators
in rural electnfication projects using new schemes such as the Output-Based Aid,
>  in providing business development support services to irospective private operators,
>  in promoting the development of the PV market and th use of local and renewable energies
>  in developing "adaptive" demonstration projects to te: t both the institutional and financing
mechanisms to sustain rural energy schemes During th s first phase, the project will support
the two operations underway, the DSC Yelen Kura of t ie cotton zone and the DSC of the
River Area, in order to validate (<by doing>> the financir g mechanisms and operational rules
for the implementation of the RE strategy, and at the same time, and will also define new
locations, candidates for RE, and prepare bidding docu nents for the selection of operators in
these locations
The component will accelerate investments and increase th.e regional coverage by shifting from
demonstration projects to processing projects through the i istitutional framework, with
continuing business development assistance.

1.3 Component 3: Household Energy
The household energy component will build on achievement s of thc previous Household Energy
Projet co-financed by the GEF and IDA This follow up inte vention is intended (a) to
encourage Government agencies to withdraw themselves fro -n day to day project execution in the
household energy sector to a role where they formulate policies and strategies, monitor and
evaluate activities of the sector, (b) to transfer the managem. nt of forest resources to local
communities by generalyzing community based forest mana ;ement initiatives which will include
the introduction and the promotion of efficient charcoal pro( uction technologies; and, (c) to
empower local communities, NGOs and the pnvate sector tc operate demand side interfiel
substitution initiatives such as the manufactunng, commerci ilization and dissemination of
improved (wood, charcoal) stoves as well as kerosene and L 'G stoves. Woodfuel taxes will be
levied in the villages and compliance will be high because ( f the inherent benefits at the village
level Taxes collected will contribute to fund basic modem i ifrastructure services and income
derived from activities of this component will help participa ing local communities afford
modem infrastructure services. The streamlining of the woo I fuel sector essentially transfers of
forestry management and commerce control know-how fron public to private actors will lead to
the technical and managerial professionalization of wood ac ivities, creating new opportunities
for skilled self-employment in rural communities. Developn ,ent of new products, such as new
stoves, biomass briquettes, low-consumption lamps or air-coolers which would contribute to the
creation of new commercial or industnal businesses.
I.A.4 Project Location' (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, ar d proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sen! itive areas)
The project will cover rural and pen-urban areas of Mali No neg ative environmental impacts nor any
displacement of populations are envisaged The global objective ,f the project to reduce atmospheric carbon
emissions through removing barriers and reductions in cost of ren ewable energy are expected tc have
positive enviommental benefits For example, solar home system; would contribute to reduce imdoor air
pollution from unsustainable use of woodfuels and kerosene Thi promotion of sustainable woedland
management and the generalization of improved carbonization ai d utilization of improved stoves will also
contribute to preserve carbon sequestration potentials of forests
B. Check Environmental Classijication: B (Partial Assessmer t)
Comments The proposed project is not expected to have any sig uificant negative environmental or social
impacts that cannot be effectively mitigated Negative impacts ol (cultural heritage, sites of historical
significance and natural resources resulting from project activitii s will be avoided An Environmental and
Social Management Framework will be prepared that will specif' a clear and systematic process for the
effective assessment of any potential environmental impacts that result from project-funded activities. The
framework should spell out the institutional arrangement, along, vith their capacity building requirements,
for sound environmental and social review and screening of sub- )rojects, as well as monitoring of the
implementation of mitigative measures of potential environment d and social impacts In accordance with
OP4 12, resettlement, either in the form of land acquisition or th~ restriction of access to legally designated
parks and protected areas resulting in adverse impacts on the liv lihood of the displaced persons will be
avoided or adequately mitigated

Section 11 - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Pleasefill in all relevant uesl ions If information is nor available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
IT D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated wit i the proposed project Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible i npacts
Overall, the project is expected to have positive environmental be iefits World Bank's environmental and
social safeguards will be complied with by the private sector o )erators involved in decentrali zed energy
services delivery
If D I b Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to applica ion of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component
It is anticipated that that there will be no cumulative adverse imp: cts.
11 D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipati d future activities in the project area
At this point project sites are not yet identified, this does not allo v predictions on long term impacts of
project activities in the project area However, as the global ot jective is to contribute to positive
environmental impacts, it is expected that only minor adverse mpacts will occur. Both the energy
services delivery and the household energy components will u idergo social and environmental
assessments to identify mitigation measures for issues that cot Id result in long term impacts.
1I D 2. In light of I, describe the proposed treatment of altemativ. s (if required)
The alternative of no action has been rejected prior to the choice )f renewable energy systems Trhe
generahzation of renewable energy systems is preferred to a situation where inferior fuels arn used by the
majority of the population.
11 D 3 Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safegua d issues
The borrower is preparing and Environmental and Social Manage ment Framework and a Resettlement
Policy Framework. During implementation, these frameworks wi I serve as basis to screen all
sub-projects Sub-projects presented by private operators will be ;ubject to environmental and social
assessments based on the frameworks In view of potential land e quisition and/or loss of acces; to
resources, the government will prepare the appropriate resettlem. nt instrument based on
recommendations of the Resettlement Policy Framework

11 D 4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosur: on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected peop e.
Sites for future sub-projects are have not yet been identifiedc Discussions are on-going w.th the
Directorate of Energy and the Directorate of Nature Conserv ition on the prospective sub-projects
sites. The Environmental and Social Management Fraimewot c will outline public particifation
plan that will be applied dunng the preparation of future sub projects. Safeguard documents will
be distnbuted to the affected peoples and other stakeholders. Participation will be reques:ed by
local communities in energy services delivery schemes and % roodland management initia:ives
Through workshops and consultations, environmental and sc cial issues will be addressec during
project preparation and implementation using participatory r zeds assessment techniques The
project will ensure that the consulation processes are mainsti eamed in project activities ?nvate
sector operators and NGOs involved in the project will also )e subject to sensitization or
safeguards policies
The Environmental and Social Management Framework and the Resettlement Policy Framework
will be submitted to the Bank for review and then disclosed in-country (durng a workshop
organized by the Directorate of Nature Conservation) and b ' the infoshop on March 24. 2003
