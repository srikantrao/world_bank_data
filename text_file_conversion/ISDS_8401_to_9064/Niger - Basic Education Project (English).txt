L.A 2 Project Objectives:
The proposed project will provide support for the first phase (2002-2006) of the Government's
1 0-year Program, designed to be implemented in three phases Although in June 2002 Niger was selected
for the EFA-Fast Track Initiative partnership with its accelerated thrust towards the Millenillum
Development Goals, the initial objectives of the Project have been maintainied as the most realistic
objectives at this time. They are in line with the initial objectives of the first phase of the Governmenit
Program and are: (i) to increase enrollmenit and completionl in basic education programs aiid (iH) to
improve managemenlt at all levels by improving the use of existing resources, focusing on rural areas to
achieve greater equity and poverty reduction in the mediulIl to long termi The project, also in alignment
with the first phase of the Government program, aims at building capacity in the Ministry of Education
(MOE) for the developmenit of policies, expenditure programs, monitoring and evaluation, procurement,
financial, and humani resource management, and at strengtlheniniig responsibility for management and
results at local levels. These latter objectives are of the highest importance from The Bank's perspective
in that they will establish the primordial foundations of the programmatic support lending planied for
Niger.
I.A.3 Project Description.
The proposed project will support the first phase of Niger's Ten-Year Program, in collaboration
with other partners, focusing on areas fundamental to an increased attendance and completion of primary
school, and where the Bank has a comparative advantage,
Increased enrollment in basic education. IDA finanicing will support programs to increase
supply and demand-side factors. On the supply-side, IDA will support. (i) the primary school
construction program targeting rural areas and community schools, (ii) scaling up double-shift and

ISDS
multigrade teachinig to increase the numliber of spaces in existing facilities, (iii) consolidation of the
expanded contractual teacher program to staff the sclhools, (iv) developing public-private partnerships in
providing lower secondary schoolinig in urban areas, and (v) expanding the funictional literacy program
On the demanid-side, IDA will support the program to increase girl's sclhoolinig by lowering the direct
costs for houselholds (free textbooks and other inputs, particularly in rural areas), by supporting IEC
campaigns to bulild communiity awareness, and by supportinig the implementationi of local action plans to
improve girl's enrollnmenlt and retentioni In addition, a detailed map on school supply and demand sides
will be prepared using the 2000-2001 census figures along with a social assessment of girl's education
which is expected to be funded under the Partnersilip for Sustainable Strategies on Girl's Education.
Thle primary school constructioni and renovation program will Finanice the construction and
furinishlin1g of 600 new hard-walled classrooms and 1,500 ilmproved mud-and-thatch classrooms requested
by rural communities which meet miniimum enrollment criteria. IDA will finance 90% of construction
and equipment costs, and Government the other 10%. IDA will also finance the development of a
school construction network linking the MOE planning unit with community maniagemenit and oversight
committees to ensure timely and good-quality construction of schools. The teacher contractual program
involves the recruLItment of 10,850 contractual teachers by the community and paid by the Government at
an initial rate of FCFA 420,000 annually. Support to pay teachers' salaries would be done through
budget-support instruments such as the PLiblic Expenditure Adjustmelnt Credit (PERAC) or the Poverty
Reduction Support Credit (PRSC). The project would provide assistance to evaluate and consolidate the
implementation of the teacher recruitment program. Togetherv with the EU, the IDA credit would finance
the increase and improvements of the four existing training facilities A feasibility study would be
carried out to assess public-private partnership possibilities for developing lower secondary schools in
urban areas by contracting out the managemenit of existing schools or selling schools to the private
sector Simultaneously, the Government policy on private educationi woild be revised to facilitate and
encourage the establishment of private schools. In collaboration with CIDA, IDA would support a
functional literacy program for youths and young women (about 181,000 beneficiaries) who missed the
opportunity to attend school. The programs will be developed and delivered by NGOs and other legally
established associations according to a procedural manual.
Increased efficiency and quality of basic elucation. The contractual teacher program vwilI
contribute significantly to cost reduction whichi is necessary if access is to be expanded even moderately.
In addition, the following measures will be introduced to lower costs without a loss in quality -- putting
double-shifting into effect in urbanl areas (limited to lowver grades), reducing the lengthl of pre-service
teacher training for primary education, and training multi-disciplinary teachers for lower secondary
education IDA would help finance the accompanying investmenits to revise the pre-service teacher
training programs and materials necessary for the implemenitationi of these policies. These measures are
expected to save an estimated FCFA 7-9 billion annually (see Annex 4)
To improve learning outcolmIes, the IDA credit will support the textbook program vwhich will
provide all students with textbooks and teacher's guides in core subjects (mathematics, reading, sciences)
at a ratio of 1:1 book in primary schools and at a ratio of 2.1 in lower secondary schools in rural areas
Teacher in-service trainilng will be expanded through reinforcemenit of the Cellutle d'Animation
Pedagogiq7/e/CAPED (which are schools where teachers in a surrounding cluster of schools meet to
exchange experiences and learn from each other), and throughi the training of school heads in ways to
improve teacher productivity, teaching quality and parent participation in school managemenit The
project will assist the MOE to prepare an HIV/AIDS action plan to be funded by the recently approved
MAP project. Support would be provided to piloting a rulal school model (200 schools) to respond to
the needs of isolated rural communities that cannot be effectively served by the normal service delivery

scheme Remediationi programs will be piloted in 15 (to be confirned during appraisal) targeted
localities to help retain girls. With the support of the Frencli Cooperation and CIDA, primary school
curriculum will be revised wvith a 20% input from parents to include an HIV/AIDS module. Also, the
Agence Francaise de Development (AFD) will suppor-t the piloting of school innovation projects in 500
targeted schools.
Strengtlhened inistitutional capacity of MOE and empowering local entities and communities.
IDA will support (i) improved division of labor amonig the center, the regional, and the local entities,
including support to the implementation of MoE's restructuring plan, with a focus on management
reforms, (ii) enhancingi leadership at key levels (particularly that of the school) by strengthleninlg the
capacity to plan and strategize, and strengtheniing school managemenit committees to effectively play
their role; (iii) development of managers and management systems in the MoE, with a focus on financial
and procuremenlt management, Human Resources managemlienit, and a development of an EMIS; (iv)
provision of training to improve the performance of technical leaders in the system at the Director level;
(v) progressive establishmiienit of results-based budgetinig and execution mechanisms; and (vi) financing
of core studies to help prepare the second phase of the program, including the preparation of a
sustainable framework for expanding access to secondary and highier education
Components:
Improve access to primary and lower secondary educationi
Increase quality and efficiency of primary and lower secondary
Strengthen management capacity of MOE and empowering local entities and communities
