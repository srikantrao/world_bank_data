.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The proposed project will provide support to two key Government of Timor-Leste divisions involved in
overseeing petroleum sector development: (1) the Timor Sea Office (TSO) in the Office of the Prime
Minister; and (2) the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), specifically, the Timor Sea Tax Division
(TSTD) and, separately, a petroleum revenue management function. The objective of the project is to
ensure continued and enhanced functioning of these critical agencies over the next 24 months in support
of an orderly, beneficial development of the petroleum sector. The grant will focus on maintaining and
increasing capacity in core functions, including the retention and/or recruitment of essential international
advisers, the provision of programmed and just-in-time technical assistance, critical operating costs (e.g.,
travel for essential negotiations and tax audits), and the provision of selected infrastructure for basic
office functions (TSTD).
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Over the next several years Timor-Leste's petroleum sector is expected to provide revenues accounting
for up to 50 percent of GDP and 85 to 90 percent of government revenues and foreign exchange. These
figures will drive future poverty reduction programs, facilitate economic recovery, and allow for donor
exit.
Against this background, technical assistance to Timor-Leste in the petroleum sector to date has been
significantly under-funded, amounting to a mere 0.2 percent of the budget and less than three percent of
donor flows. In the near-term, a considerable shortfall relative to needs exists. Although issues related to
the entry into force of the Timor Sea Treaty and signing of the Greater Sunrise Unitisation Agreement
have been resolved, challenges facing Timor-Leste's petroleum sector are daunting; they include:
complex ongoing and new negotiations with companies and governments (on the development of the
Greater Sunrise field and Jahal and Kudatasi fields, among others); agreement of a new petroleum mining
code and model production sharing contract for the Timor Sea Treaty area; oversight of the development
of Bayu-Undan, a major liquids and liquefied natural gas project; maritime boundary negotiations;
increasingly significant tax compliance issues; the development of minimum technical capacity; the
design and implementation of a sustainable adrninistrative framework for the sector; a growing need for
domestic and international public information outreach programs; and transparent and efficient
management of petroleum revenues to ensure that they contribute to the development of the people of
Timor-Leste.



Thus, in line with vital needs, the proposed project will provide support to two key government divisions
involved in overseeing petroleum sector development: (1) the Timor Sea Office (TSO) in the Office of the
Prime Minister; and (2) the Ministry of Planning and Finance (MOPF), specifically, the Timor Sea Tax
Division (TSTD) and, separately, a petroleum revenue management function. The TSO has been the lead
agency on all sector policy and strategic topics and has conducted all international negotiations; the TSTD
is now facing rapidly escalating oversight demands; and there currently exists no office in the
Government charged specifically with the critical task of implementing a petroleun revenue
management strategy. Funding for these areas will focus on maintaining and increasing capacity in core
functions, including the retention and/or recruitment of essential international advisers, the provision of
programmed and just-in-time technical assistance, critical operating costs (e.g., travel for essential
negotiations and tax audits), and the provision of selected infrastructure for basic office functions
(TSTD).
Technical assistance support to Timor-Leste' s petroleum sector to date has already generated significant
returns. By means of example, relying on funds provided in part by the first Trust Fund for East Timor
(TFET)-funded Petroleum Technical Assistance Project, the TSO negotiating team successfully shifted
more than USD 200 million in value to the Timor-Leste Treasury in the negotiations on the Greater
Sunrise Unitisation Agreement and an estimated USD 300 million to the Treasury in the Bayu-Undan
negotiations, assuming these projects proceed as currently scoped. Without the critical technical
assistance provided under the first Petroleum Technical Assistance Project, it is unlikely that Timor-Leste
would have realized such gains. Similarly, the few visits to petroleum company headquarters in Perth
already taken by the TSTD have boosted company tax compliance considerably.
The selection of activities for funding over the next 24 months under the proposed project has been
closely coordinated with the other donor programs in the sector (see Section D, 2). These programs
remain relatively limited, however, and are still fragmented. During implementation and over the next 24
months, the Bank will continue to work with the Government and other donors to develop a more
strategic, sustainable approach to funding medium- and longer-term activities related to petroleum sector
development.

In addition, a Petroleum Mining Code included in the Timor Sea Treaty permits the Designated Authority
to issue environmental regulations. The Code, and associated regulations to be issued under the Treaty,
prevent the Designated Authority from issuing contracts unless companies can show their ability to meet
the environmental standards established; oblige companies to protect the environment in and around the
contract area; and empower the Designated Authority to make a company pay for the remedy of any
environmental damage. Furthermore, the Production Sharing Contract concluded with the Bayu-Undan
operator ConocoPhillips and its joint venture partners requires the joint venture to: develop an
Environmental Management Plan to be approved by the Designated Authority; prevent pollution of the
marine environment; and pay for the costs associated with clean-up of any pollution from petroleum
operations within the contract area. The Production Sharing Contract also requires the contractor to
submit to the Designated Authority a plan for decommnissioning the project. This plan must include: steps
reasonably required to prevent hazard to the environment, and environmental, engineering, and feasibility
studies reasonably necessary to support the plan.
As a Category C project, an Environmental Assessment will not be undertaken. It is considered that the
existing environmental regime and successor regime, as described above, will provide adequate
safeguards with respect to the environment. During project implementation, World Bank experts will
review these regimes and provide feedback to the Govemment as necessary. Since successful
development of Timor-Leste's petroleum resources, which the proposed project would support, will have
environmental implications, the possibility of preparing a strategic Environmental Impact Assessment
will be explored with the Government during project implementation.
Though the Timor Sea contains areas of overlapping boundary claims by Timor-Leste and neighboring
countries, the Projects in Disputed Areas Safeguards are not invoked under the proposed project. The
overlapping boundary claims could become the object of maritime boundary negotiations, and the
proposed project provides Timor-Leste with the possibility of expert advice and support in this area. The
project does not, however, involve any activity in a disputed zone. The World Bank's other Safeguard
Policies are not relevant to the proposed project.
