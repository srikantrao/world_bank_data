Project Objectives
The additional financing will allow the Government to meet its original objectives of expanding water and sanitation
services to an additional 130,000 people in the pen-urban slums of Lima.
Project Description
The proposed additional financing would provide resources to finance the expansion of water and sanitation services
to 200,000 residents of the pueblos j6venes (under Part C: Network Expansion Component) at a total cost of
USD29.4 million (of which USD20 0 million would be financed under the loan).
To accommodate the differing economuc, topographical, and urban charactenstics of the beneficiary communities,
the project would offer a choice base on two different levels of service differentiated by cost. In terms of water, this
would mean either a pnvate tap in the household or a public tap designed to serve groups of 10 dwellings.
Irrespective of the choice made by the community, SEDAPAL would build a secondary distribution network
capable of supporting individual private connections for all households, to ensure that the community would have
the option of eventually upgrading as its economic circumstances improved. In terms of sanitation, the communities
would again be offered a choice between ventilated dry pit latrines, or appropriately designed sewerage networks.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social charactenstics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or cntical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
These services would benefit the Districts of Carabayllo, Comas and Puente Piedra, in the northern cone of the city,
the Districts of Villa Maria del Triunfo and Villa El Salvador in the southern cone of the city, and the Districts of
Ate-Vitarte and San Juan de Lurigancho in the eastern cone of the cltV.
B. Check Environmental Classification A [ ], B [X 1, C [ J, FI [], TBD []
Comments:The original project received a B rating, and this remains appropriate for the additional financing. No
major impacts are expected. The only minor environmental issues that arise are: (a) the disruption caused by the
civil works required to build the secondary networks; and (b) the generation of a small volume of additional waste
water wherever sewerage networks are built. However, the latter are deemed insignificant in that the new works
would add at most 0.1 cubic meters per second of waste water to a citywide total of 20 cubic meters per second.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
The onginal project underwent a full Environmental Impact Assessment, which incorporated the network expansion
activities that will be financed through this additional operation.
2. Identify and descnbe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any potential
cumulative or long term impacts.
None
3. In light of 1 and 2, descnbe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The borrower has developed environmental guidelines for construction contractors and these will be included in all
works contracts tendered under the loan. This is already the borrower's current practice on all works contracts.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies,
with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The environmental construction guidelines will be submutted with the Board Package, and will be posted on the
World Bank website for public access.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is detenimned by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
I XI S2 - One or more safeguard policies are tnggered, but effects are linited in their impact and are technically and
institutionally manageable
[I S3. - No safeguard issues
[I SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard iss.ues.
