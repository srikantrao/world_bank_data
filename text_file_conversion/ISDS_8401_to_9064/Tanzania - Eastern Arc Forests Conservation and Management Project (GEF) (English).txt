I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The GEF financed Eastern Arc Forests Conservation and Management project is a component of the
broader Forest Conservation and Management Project (FCMP) (P058706) which was approved by the
Board on February 26, 2002. The Eastern Arc Forests Conservation and Management Project has been
fully blended into the FCMP. The FCMP was processed as a Category B without separate EA as the
rules at that time dictated. The new disclosure rules require that the EA be disclosed as we have retained
the Category B rating for the processing of the Eastern Arc component. Therefore the original
environmental annex for the FCMP, which also covers the Eastern Arc component, has been submitted
to the info shop for the Eastern Arc project. The Eastern Arc component was appraised separately from
the main project due to constraints in the GEF approval process, which has necessitated the separate
processing of the grant component. This ISDS covers only the activities of the Easteni Arc component
and addresses safeguard issues and the application the safeguard policies pertaining to only the Eastern
Arc component. A separate ISDS for the Forest Conservation and Management Project was prepared and
submitted to the info shop on October 5, 2001. For consistency sake, we have retained the B rating from
the Forest Management and Conservation Project. The environmental analysis for the overall project
including the GEF Eastern Arc component was disclosed in the Project Appraisal Document, Annex 11,
in the info shop on January 25, 2002.
The specific project objectives are to: develop the institutional capacity within the forestry sector for
coordination, financing, and management of biodiversity conservation interventions within Tanzania's

forests, in particular in the forests of the Eastern Arc mountains.
The global environmental objectives of the project are to: develop, and implement on a pilot basis, a
sustainable financing mechanism for conservation activities in the Eastern Arc forests.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The Eastern Arc Forest Conservation and Management Project has four components, the first two are
implemented by the Bank, the second two are implemented by UNDP:
The main global environmental objective of this GEF activity is to promote the sustainable conservation
and management of the Eastern Arc forests. The GEF activity is expected to have four sub-components,
the first two of which will be implemented by the World Bank:
(i)   Institutional reforms for forest biodiversity conservation, in particular of the Eastern Arc
forests at central, district and local partnership levels to incorporate specific responsibilities for
biodiversity conservation, oversight, monitoring and coordination. Such reforms will be linked
with other reforms and institutional restructuring proposed for the forestry sector as a whole,
which are to be financed by IDA. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would
be the Bank;
(ii)   Mechanisms for sustainable financing of biodiversity conservation, will be developed
including the establishment of the Eastern Arc Mountains Conservation Endowment Fund
(EAMCEF). It is envisaged that a pilot endowment trust fund will be established by the project,
with GEF resources. The EAMCEF's initial operations and programs will be co-financed by
IDA. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would be the Bank.
Two additional components are to be implemented by the UNDP and are complementary to the
Bank-implemented activities:
(iii)  Development and preparation of an integrated Conservation Strategy for the Eastern Arc
Mountain Forests using a broad-based participatory process, with a focus on institutional
capacity building, and which considers links to other sectoral activities, such as agriculture,
water, land, and energy. A wider dialogue on the impacts of sectoral activities on forest
biodiversity conservation in the Eastern Arc will be developed amongst the key institutions
involved in sectoral activities. Mapping and baseline activities will be undertaken as part of the
Strategy development, and will include an assessment of the multiple tenure regimes found in the
forests of the Arc. The GEF implementing agency for this sub-component would be UNDP.
(iv)   A forest conservation intervention through government and community partnership
initiatives which will be undertaken at priority sites in the Uluguru Mountains - one of the most
important mountain forest blocks in the arc. Firm linkages will be established with partners
(other donors, NGOs, Community-based organizations, government agencies, etc.) The GEF
implementing agency for this sub-component would be UNDP.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

ISDS
The bulk of the country's forest biodiversity is found in its mountain forests, and in a narrow strip of
forests along the coast which in total comprise less than 5 percent of the total forest area. Amongst the
most important of these are the Eastern Arc forests, a focus of this project, which cover an area of around
5,350 square kilometers spread across 10 separate mountain blocks in Tanzania (and one in Kenya). The
Eastern Arc forests represent one of the oldest and most stable terrestrial ecosystems on the continent and
are recognized globally as one of 25 biodiversity hotspots, which are characterized by high
concentrations of endemic species under considerable threat. The Eastenm Arc forests have the highest
known number of plant and animal species of any region in Tanzania. The Eastern Arc is also
characterized by high concentrations of endemic species. Indeed, the Eastern Arc forests are known as
one of the most important sites in Africa for endemic birds, amphibians, reptiles, many groups of
invertebrates, and plants, and contains one of the highest proportions of endemic species of any region
worldwide. There are at least 16 endemic plant genera in the Arc. Twenty of 21 African violet species
(Saintpaulia spp.) are endemic to the Arc. Of the known species occurring within the Eastern Arc,
approximately 23 percent of montane plant species, 82 percent of linyphiid spider species, 39 percent of
the butterfly species, 63 percent of forest dependent amphibian species, 68 percent of forest dependent
reptile species, 3 percent of the bird species, and 6 percent of the mammal species are endemic.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments:
This project is a component of the Forest Conservation and Management Project, P058706, which was
approved by the Board on February 26, 2002.
The Forest Conservation and Management project is a category B project, and therefore we have retained
the B category for the processing of this component. An Environmental Analysis has been included as an
Annex to the Project Appraisal Document, Annex 11. Proposed GEF support (P057234) has been fully
blended into the Forest Conservation and Management Project.

Protection of forest areas that are considered critical natural habitats and preservation and sustainable use
of forests of high ecological value - OP/GP 4.36, OP/BP 4.04. The project proposes to support a number
of activities that will adhere to forest sector provisions for identification, protection and management of
critical habitats. These include, in particular, the Eastern Arc Mountain Forests. The environmental
benefits of this approach are expected to be substantial as the project will support research, park
management and community activities targeted at biodiversity conservation.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
No alternatives were considered to be necessary, as environmental and social impacts are expected to be
minimal.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Because of the nature of the project, there are no safeguard issues anticipated.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders include: villages and communities in the Eastern Arc Forest area; local governments;
and staff of the Forest and Beekeeping Division.
The identification of the GEF component was an outcome of a UNDP implemented PDF/A activity
which in itself was highly consultative. PDF/A support from GEF was sought in 1997 to characterize
more fully the nature of the perceived forest conservation problem in the Eastern Arc Mountains, and to
propose possible solutions. The Block A grant was approved in late 1997, through UNDP, on the basis of
a proposal which suggested potential for collaboration and partnerships with other agencies such as the
World Bank. Implementation of PDF/A activities commenced after the December 1997 International
Conference on the Conservation and Management of the Eastern Arc which brought together a range of
interests in academia, research, and local government. Activities which were financed by the PDF/A
grant included: a preliminary assessment of biodiversity values and conservation problems in the Eastern
Arc; an assessment of priority actions for conservation of the Arc; an assessment of financial constraints,
sustainable financing requirements, and the effectiveness of donor interventions in the Eastern Arc; and
the development of preliminary proposals for GEF financing for conservation of the Eastern Arc on the
basis of stakeholder consultations in priority sites. PDF/A activities provided an opportunity for closer
collaboration between multiple donor and national institutions with interests in the Arc. Stakeholder
discussions followed the preparation of background papers, prepared using PDF/A and separate World
Bank resources, and these were reviewed and discussed in a number of fora by a range of stakeholders,
which helped to provide a stronger framework for future action.
A series of consultations and workshops financed with PDF/B resources drew on the skills and expertise
of practitioners familiar with the approaches proposed in the project concept. Two stakeholder
workshops on the project concept and design were convened in February 2001 and June 2001 in
conjunction with the Pre-appraisal and Technical mission. Finally, to build on the synergies possible

through better donor coordination, the project concept was discussed with and reviewed by the Forestry
Adviser's Group, a group of donors and other stakeholders with interests in forest sector development in
Tanzania, which is chaired by the Director of Forests and Beekeeping.
E. Safeguards Classiflcation. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
] S3. -No safeguard issues
SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
