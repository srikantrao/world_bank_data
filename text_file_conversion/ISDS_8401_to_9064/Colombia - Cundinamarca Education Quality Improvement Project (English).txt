I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The developmental objective of the project is to assist the Government of the Department of
Cundinamarca in improving the productivity, competitiveness and citizenship of young people joining
the labor force after completing basic and secondary education. This development objective, which
supports the Department's economic and social progress strategy, would be achieved by improving the
academic outcomes of the basic and secondary education system and achieving better competencies and
life skills among young graduates. These goals would be accomplished through the following main two
components: (i) improving the pedagogical and management performance of schools; and (ii) increasing
the management capacity and effectiveness of the Education Secretariat of Cundinamarca at both the
central and decentralized levels. The pedagogical and management performance of schools would be
strengthened by improving the quality and relevance of the learning process through continuous and
comprehensive interventions with respect to the classroom pedagogical process, educational inputs and
school management. This approached recognizes the crucial complementarity of five dimensions of
academic performance:  teacher effectiveness, quality of the learning experience the classroom
(pedagogical practices, instructional resources and competency-based content); school management;
partnerships with enterprises and social actors, and systematic evaluation of the educational outcomes.
The institutional capacity of the Educational Secretariat of the Cundinamarca Departmentwould
by strengthened by: (i) improving the educational evaluation system; (ii) developing the tools for a
medium term participatory educational planning process; (iii) improving educational statistics; and (iv)
enhancing decentralized management at the municipal and school levels.
These objectives would contribute to: (i) supporting the educational quality improvement policy and
strategy of the Department of Cundinamarca targeted to disadvantaged schools in rural areas and
peri-urban areas and students under high educational risk; (ii) achieving increased equity by providing
better educational inputs in socially and economically deprived areas; (iii) increasing coverage in

agreement with the goals of the Departmental Development Plan 2001 - 2004; (iv) strengthening the
participation of key stakeholders in the educational process and management of schools; and (v) offering
new opportunities for continuing education to dropouts and graduates.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The Project includes the following three components (i) Improving Quality and Relevance; (ii)
Institutional Strengthening; and (iii) Project Administration and Monitoring
Component 1. Improving Quality and Relevance (80% of the total amount).
This first component would entail: (i) improving pedagogical practices; (ii) developing and providing
adequate instructional resources, learning materials and competency-based curriculum guides; (iii)
building up the managerial capacity of school principals; (iv) establishing strategic partnerships between
the schools, the productive sectors and civil society to increase the relevance of education and facilitate
the labor market insertion of secondary graduates. The partnerships will be the recipients of funds and
those will be allocated on a subprojects competitive basis.
Component 2. Institutional Strengthening (10% of the total amount).
This component will strengthen the institutional and management capacity of the Cundinamarca
Education Secretariat. It will address, in particular, the institutional and organizational needs generated
by an increasingly decentralized system. Ihis component will focus specifically on: (i) improving
assessment methods for the continuous evaluation of education quality, including the expansion of the
existing student achievement tests to all grades; (ii) improving education statistics and performance
indicators; and (iii) designing and implementing a Ten Year Education Development Plan. The main
focus of the Plan would be on: (a) setting objectives and targets for each educational level; (b)
strengthening the decentralization process in terms of the new responsibilities and accountability
structures in the provision of educational services at the municipality and school levels; (c) developing
strategic partnerships for the management of the education system ; (d) implementing an equity strategy
to reduce regional and social disparities in the delivery of education services; (e) formulating a strategy
to improve the internal and external efficiency of the education system; and (f) using the quality
assessment system to measure the educational results for policy-making decisions.
Component 3. Project Administration and Monitoring (10% of the total amount).
This component will finance the Project Coordination Unit operating within the Education Secretariat of
Cundinamarca. The PCU will be in charge of (i) planning and programming, (ii) monitoring project
implementation including disbursements and collection of expenditure documentation, (iii) carrying out
the procurement of goods and services financed by the project (Loan and counterpart funds), (iv)
coordination of technical activities of the project with the national Ministry of Education, the
municipalities in Cundinamarca and the partners in the productive sectors and civil society, (v)
communicating with the Bank.
Project Cost. During the project preparation process the costs and sources of financing will be more
thoroughly defined.
