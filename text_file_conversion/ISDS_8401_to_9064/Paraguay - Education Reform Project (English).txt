I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The overall project goal is to build human capital in Paraguay which, in turn, will contribute to the
diversification of the economy and more sustainable growth. This objective will be achieved by
supporting a comprehensive secondary education reform program for Grades 10- 12, building on the
successes achieved under MECES. The development objective of this project is to improve
management and efficiency, educational outcomes, and equity in opportunity of the secondary
education system. This will be achieved by: (i) creating additional capacity for sub-sector analysis,
planning, monitoring and evaluation, and introducing revised employment practices; (ii) introducing
a new approach to teacher development and enhancing the school environment through better
on-site support for teachers and stronger school-community ties; and (iii) establishing innovative
mechanisms to ensure more equitable access to secondary education
I.A.3. Project Description:
This project will have three components:
(a) Improved tools for planning and managing the education sector, including. (i) improved
methods for data collection, analysis and research, (ii) new management techniques for
evidence-based decision making, (iii) a revised policy for hiring teachers and (iv) a new MOE
facility;
(b) Improved educational outcomes through a new approach to teacher development and enhanced
school environment, including: (i) reoriented approaches for pre- and in-service teacher
training, (ii) revised curriculum in secondary classes, including the creation of three prototype
schools, new approaches to student-centered learning and the teaching of science and

technology, (iii) new approaches to school supervision, (iv) a program to train school
principals in management and supervision aspects, (v) socio-community programs to establish
strong school-community linkages and (vi) a public awareness and political support campaign
for secondary education reform; and
(c) Mechanisms to ensure equitable access to secondary education, including (i) an innovate pilot
program for distance/open learning for secondary education and (ii) sustainable scholarship
programs.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will affect secondary education stakeholders across the country, since it involves the
central Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC), state education statistics units (UDPs), state
education councils, teacher training institutes nationwide, secondary school principals, teachers and
students. Programs aimed to increase access to poor students will target secondary school-aged
youth in rural and marginal urban areas.
