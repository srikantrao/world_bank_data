Project Objectives (From PDS)
The proposed Sector Adjustment Loan would: (i) help strengthen Argentina's response to the urgent healti
needs of the poor, particularly uninsured mothers and children, (ii) introduce key changes to Federal-
Provincial coordination for health policy, (iii) help to change the incentive framework of the poorest
provinces and provincial health services providers to improve efficiency in the sector, responsiveness and
to target public subsidies to the uninsured population, and (iv) support consolidation of regulation on
consumer protection in the health sector both, through consolidating and further improving the regulatory
framework for the National Social Health Insurance System (SNSS) and the quality control of
pharmaceuticals.
Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed loan would support key public health programs and a series of initial health reform steps
taken by the new Government including: (i) Strengthening the Federal - Provincial health policy
coordination capacity through the "Consejo Federal de Salud-COFESA", (ii) Start up of the Maternal and!
Child Health insurance in the most needy provinces in the country as a way of addressing urgent needs of
this segment of the population while simultaneously changing the incentive framework for the provinces
and provincial providers through separation of purchasing and provision and through strengthening
strategic purchasing of health services at the provincial level, (iii) Protecting priority public health
programs such as HIV/AIDS, vaccination and other, (iv) Strengthening consumer protection on quality of
pharmaceuticals, and (v) Consolidating the efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework of the social
health insurance system supported by previous Bank operations which aimed to protect social security
participants and to reduce leakage of scarce public subsidies away from the uninsured poor.
