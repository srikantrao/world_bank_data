Section I - Basic Information
A. Basic Project Data
Country: MALAWI                               Project ID: P080368
Project: EMERGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY           Task Team Leader: Ousmane Sissoko
CREDIT
Authorized to Appraise Date: August 5, 2002  IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: October 24, 2002              IDA Amount ($m): 50.00
Managing Unit: AFTRI                          Sector: General agriculture; fishing and forestry
Lending Instrument: Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL)  sector (50%); Other social services (50%)
Status: Lending                               Theme: Natural disaster management (P); Other
social protection and risk management (S); Social
risk mitigation (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The objectives of the proposed Emergency Drought Recovery Project are: (a) to allow the
Government to maintain key commitments to economic priorities and investments consistent
with the PRSP process while at the same time fulfilling its immediate obligations to avert
famine; (b) to help restore the productive capability of the populations; and (c) to support longer
term disaster management by the Government. The operation does not directly finance food for
purposes of relief, because the Government and other donors are undertaking this effort. In line
with the Bank's guidelines for emergency operations, activities financed under the project will
complement relief efforts, contribute to recovery, facilitate continued progress on key economic
priorities and investments consistent with longer term reduction of poverty, and address the
needs of vulnerable groups during this difficult period of crisis.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The proposed operation will include the following components: (a) a quick-disbursing assistance
to support critical imports through a positive list of import requirements linked to the drought
and assist the Government in drought recovery efforts. The Government seeks the emergency
credit to help rebuild productive capacity, and to avoid a situation whereby the additional cost of
the drought undermines developmental goals, particularly for health and education. An amount of
US$40 million would be available under this component; (b) support for expansion of public
works programs and essential social investments and services to vulnerable groups through

ISDS
MASAF, which has developed substantial expertise in the field, for an amount of US$8.0 million
; and (c) support for implementation, technical assistance, and studies for a total amount of
US$2.0 million. The positive list of items include: petroleum and fuel products; agricultural inputs;
agricultural equipment; spare parts; livestock, animal products and veterinary supplies; school supplies;
and medical supplies and equipment. No pesticides will be purchased under the operation.
Regarding activites to be implemented by MASA, the proposed project would transfer funds directly to
MASAF for the entire component's activities, as MASAF's management unit would be responsible for
implementing such activities. MASAF's management unit has demonstrated extensive experience in doing
so under two previous IDA operations.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be implemented throughout Malawi.
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments: The operation is not expected to have any major environmental impact as it is largely a
quick-disbursing instrument to provide financing on the basis of a positive list. A limited portion of
about 16 percent will support other activities and the public work activities through MASAF project
which is classified under environmental category B. None of the project activities is expected to
lead to or involve resettlements. However, a Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared,
approved and submitted during project implementation to guide any potention
resetllement/compensation issues. Safeguard measures including environmental and social
screening, assessment and mitigation will be applied during implementation through MASAF's
environmental and social management mechanism. This operation will prepare its own EA. The
operation is classified as Category B, according to the Operational Directive (OD) 4.01, Annex E.
This is being processed under OP 8.50 and the necessary clearances as stated in OP 4.01 (par. 13)
and especially BP 4.01 (par.5) have been obtained.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. I a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Under the operation, apart from the quick disbursing component, works would involve primarily the
maitenance of rural and peri-urban roads by the communities as income earning activities that would
allow them improve their nutritional status through acquisition of commercial maize. Works will include
manual labor by communities to maintain existing access roads. The potential negative environmental
impacts are therefore minimal.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Negligible given the smallness of such road maintenance interventions and the national scope of such
activities.
II.D.Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Ditto.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
A Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared, approved and submitted during project implementation.
Safeguards measures including environmental and social screening, assessment and mitigation will be
applied during project implementation through MASAF's environmental and social management
mechanism. The project will prepare its own EA.
The submission and approval of these two documents are condition of disbursement for the MASAF
component (public works program) as reflected in the legal documents.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Any public works undertaken in support of Malawi Social Action Fund - Phase II Project (MASAF II)

activities will be subject to same EA principles that have been agreed under MASAF TI.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
