I.A.2 Project Objectives:
The proposed project would be a first phase of a long-term effort by the Government of Iran (GOI) to
improve environmental management in the country. The main project objective would be to enhance the
capacity of the Department of Environment (DOE) to monitor air and water quality. This would be
realized through pilot targeted interventions in four provinces: Tehran, Isfahan, Khorasan and Khuzestan.
Subsequently, this intervention would be scaled up to include more provinces through a programmatic
approach, based on lessons learned.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Component 1 - Strengthening institutional capacity to monitor air and water quality. Capacity
bullding for DOE offices in Tehran, Isfahan, Khorasan and Khuzestan in water and air quality
management will be supported by
(i) Mainstreaming environment into sector policies andprograms. This subcomponent will be mainly
non-lending technical assistance and will include analytical studies such as the costs of environmental
degradation, the ongoing environmental energy review, industrial air and waste water pollution and a
country environmental analysis.
(ii) In2proving the legal and institutionalframework governing air and water quality management. This
will include diagnostic assessments and updating of the institutional and legal frameworks consistent
with standard international practices. This component will also fund studies on development of economic
incentives.
(iii) Strengthening the capacity of Environnmental ImpactAssessment (EIA) unit The recommendations
of the METAP report on strengthening the EIA system will be implemented. Specifically, EIA
information within the central and provincial offices will be consolidated. EIA units in the provincial
DOE offices of Mashhad and Isfahan would be established.
(iv) Establishing an environmental managem7ent information system. The three pilot provincial

directorates and the Tehran Headquarters will be connected through a shared and consolidated
information network. Furthermore, the subcomponent will build DOE capacity to analyze data collected
and thus provide the tools for sound decision-making.
(v) Supplying air and water quality monitoring equipment. This subcomponent will finance a maximum
of 48 air quality monitoring stations for Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan and Arak and about 24 water quality
monitoring stations on the Karoon river.
Component 2. Building partnership through pilot environmental projects. This component will
strengthen DOE's partnerships with line ministries, municipalities, universities and civil society
organizations by financing joint pilot environmental technical assistance subprojects in the provinces of
Tehran, Isfahan, Khorasan, and Khuzestan on a demand driven basis. The subprojects will focus on
activities that relate only to air and water quality management.(Examples of potential subprojects are
described in Annex 2).
Component 3 - Training and Public Awareness Programs to improve air and water quality.
Strengthening environmental training in air and water quality The Institute for Applied Environmental
Science and Research (IAESR) within DOE will develop curricula for air and water management
programs. The programs will be offered by the IAESR in Tehran and through a partnership with existing
universities/research institutions in the pilot provinces. The programs will be designed to (i) improve the
performance of public sector personnel and NGOs involved in management of water and air activities
(through short and focused workshops and seminars) and (ii) provide technical and applied two year
degree programs for students with a high school diploma. It will also finance the purchasing of
equipment for the institute, upgrading an air and water laboratory, and the construction of a girls'
dormitory in the vicinity of the training center.
Undertaking environmentalpublic awareness programs this subcomponent will strengthen DOE's
capacity to undertake public awareness campaigns on air and water quality issues. The activities will
focus on (i) informing the public on air and water pollution; (ii) improving its understanding of the
potential consequences of air and water pollution on health and the natural environment; and (iii)
encourage mitigating behaviors. Activities financed under this sub-component include the development
of an outreach strategy and the preparation of TV clips and mass publications. Surveys evaluating the
knowledge and behavioral changes of respondents will also be undertaken to monitor the effectiveness of
the outreach program.
Component 4 - Project Management: This component will finance incremental operating costs of the
Project Coordination Team (PCT) within the DOE, including financing office equipment, technology,
supplies and other activities to implement and monitor the project. The project team will be responsible
for procurement and management of project funds, and hence will be trained in project management,
procurement and financial management. Training will also,be extended to selected DOE staff in the four
provinces. The component will also finance the preparation of a follow-up environmental project.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The EMSP project would be targeted at the provinces of Isfahan, Tehran, Khorasan, and Khuzestan.
Projects are likely to be located within municipalities and districts of the province. Air quality
stations would be located in various areas of the main cities of Arak, Isfahan, Mashhad, and Tehran.
Water quality stations will be located in various areas along the Karoun River Basin in Khuzestan.
Likewise small environmental projects would be located in both urban and rural areas of the
provinces. It should be noted that the project for the most part, is a technical assistance project and

as such will have minimal negative impact on the population or natural and cultural resources
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments*
This is a technical assistance (TA) project which has no adverse social and environmental impacts On the
contrary, the overall project is expected to generate positive impacts due to the capacity building and
training activities. The project would include minor civil works (rehabilitation of girl dormitories) and small
platforms to anchor the air quality monitoring stations Furthermore, the demand driven partnership projects
under Component 11 will focus on training, studies and advisory services and will not include any civil
works or purchase of major equipments. Hence in accordance with OP 4.01, the project is placed under
category "C".
