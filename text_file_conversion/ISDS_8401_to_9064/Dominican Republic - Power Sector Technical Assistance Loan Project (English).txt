I.A.2. Project Objectives.
The proposed five-year Power Sector Technical Assistance Project (TA) is an element of an overall
assistance package to the Dominican Republic power sector, which also includes a Power Sector
Program Loan (whose first component is being processed in parallel with the TA), and might later add an
investment operation.
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Dominican Republic's electricity service was marked by frequent
power cuts, large energy losses, poor collection, and deficient operations and maintenance. The poor
service led to a vicious cycle of non-payment of power bills and insufficient financial capability to
improve service. During the late-1990s, the Government carried out a major sector restructuring, ceding
management control of distribution and thermal generation to the private sector, with minority
Government ownership. The Electricity Law of July 2001 furthered the reforms with a new regulatory
and policy framework.                                          I
In response to the international rise in fuel prices of 2000-01, the Government instituted a freeze in retail
prices and a resultant subsidy that reached an unsustainable US$25 million per month. By mid-2002,
sector entities were in a financial crisis, and service was being cut sharply. On September 2002, the
Government introduced measures to deal with the crisis and to seek a longer-term solution to the
problems, including: renegotiation of contracts together with payment of outstanding debt: elimination of
the generalized subsidy, while maintaining focused subsidies for the poor; payment of the Government's
electricity bills; and an efforl to fight electricity theft.
The long-term objectives oF the total program assistance package are to support the Government in

realizing its original vision and completing the second-generation reforms in the electricity sector.
Specifically, these objectives are to:
a  improve the quality of service, especially by ending the persistent black-outs of recent years;
b. increase the percentage of population with access to electricity;
c. raise the efficiency of sector operations; and
d. ensure that the operating entities in the sector have the opportunity to achieve financial
sustainability.
The Government remains committed to achieving these objectives through a competitive electricity
market with private participation and an autonomous, transparent and consistent regulatory system,
complemented with clear obligations and incentives for universal access to electricity.  This sectoral
vision was well articulated in the Electricity Law passed in July 2001, and demonstrated by a series of
first-generation reforms to unbundle the sector, privatize the distribution and thermal generation
companies, and put in place a new sector framework with autonomous regulation.
Within this framework, the technical assistance project will have five specific objectives, which are to
provide expert assistance to help:
*   Strengthen the Government's regulatory and consumer protection perfornduyce,
reviewing and correcting problems with the regulatory system, and strengthening SIE and
PROTECOM;
* Improve policy formulation and portfolio management, by strengthening the National Energy
Commission (CNE) and the Fondo Patrimonial (FONPER);
*   Develop the transmission grid and the wholesale power mat&keduce the risk of
blackouts and improve operational efficiency;
*   Increase the quantity and quality of electricity for the pabigugh rural electrification
programs and by improving the Blackout Reduction Program 1programa Nacional de Reduccl6n
de Apagones, PRA) in urban barrios; and
*   Protect the environment, by analyzing and addressing sectoral environmental issues.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
This Technical Assistance Pioject is not region-specific, therefore it will focus on the Dominican Republic
as a whole.

measures will apply for the rural electrification program to be supported by the project.
E. Safeguards Classification Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1.- Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[X] S3. -No safeguard issues
SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
