B.  Project Objectives  
 
The main development objective of the proposed program is to support the progressive 
transformation and improvement in the living conditions of rural Senegal.  This should be 
achieved by: (i) providing lighting and access to modern communication to rural households; (ii) 
improving delivery of social services by providing electricity to potable water delivery systems, 
health clinics, schools, etc.; and (iii) enhancing economic productivity through the provision of 
electricity for productive purposes in particular in agriculture.
 
The program is conceived as a long term effort covering 10 years (mid 2004 to 2013) to be 
implemented in 3 phases.  Both the Government and the private sector operators would want the 
Bank group to be committed to the whole program, because of the long term nature of the 
concession contracts. 
 
The RE program’s policy, legal, institutional and managerial framework 
will have been designed in detail and approved during project preparation phase.  The
 first phase 
(mid 2004 
–mid 2008)
 will focus on making effective the instruments designed during the project 
preparation phase, on capacity-building and on technical assistance, and on investing and 
Page  2
managing four or five concessions and  some ERILs.  The
 second phase
 (2008-2010) will 
complete the building of capacity and of institutions while scaling up the investments.  The 
third 
phase
 (2011-2013) will complete the development of the 18 concessions and RE through ERILs 
and densify the coverage.  By its nature, the program is suited to an instrument such as an APL. 
The total costs of the program are estimated to be $115 million, of which IDA will contribute 
about $60 millions.  The first phase cost is estimated to be $32 million and the IDA contribution 
to be $16 million. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The Phase I objectives would be reached through the implementation of following components: 
 
(1) A line of credit within the Rural Electrification Fund (FER) focusing on the basic 
electricity needs of rural households.  The financial resources will be used for installing 
photovoltaic equipment, small diesel generators, mini-
grids, extension from SENELEC’s 
grid for concessions and ERILs that have been bid competitively and for which contracts 
have been awarded.  Disbursement will be made by the FER - managed by a commercial 
bank- in part as “Output-Based Aid” (OBA) subsidies; provision of partial risk 
guarantees leveraging commercial funding is also proposed.  Total cost: $21 million; 
IDA: $9.75 million; 
(2) A line of credit within the Rural Electrification Fund (FER) focusing on social programs 
requiring electricity services.  This would allow the provision or the enhancement of 
water delivery, services in health clinics, schools, etc.  Total costs: $5.0 million; IDA: $ 
3.75 million; 
(3) Resources for institutional capacity development and strengthening of  Senegalese 
institutions (in particular ASER, CRSE, FER, and the social and rural development 
ministries).  Total costs: $3.1million; IDA:$1.1million; 
(4) Resources for an Information, Education and Communication program.  Total cost: $1.5 
million; IDA:.75 million;   
(5) Resources for Monitoring and Evaluation.  Total cost $ 1.5 million; IDA: .75 million; 
and, 
(6) Resources for the preparation of the second phase of the APL.  Total cost: $1.5 million; 
IDA: $.75 million. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will cover all of Senegal.  Eighteen rural electrification concessions have been set-up 
to cover the whole country. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The main implementation agencies 
–
the Agence Sénégalaise d’Electrification Rurale (ASER), 
the Commission de Régulation du Secteur Electricité (CRSE) and the social ministries have little 
experience in implementing such activities.  However, they have to be involved in the project 
preparation.  The project proposes an important capacity-building component, particularly during 
the first phase of the APL.

If Applicable, How Might It Apply?

Environmental Assessment
(

BP
4.01) 
It is likely that project related activities will impact the natural environment.  The 
requisite safeguards instrument which will be prepared by the Borrower will be 
approved by ASPEN and disclosed in-
country and at Bank’s Infoshop, prior to 
Appraisal.

[x] 
Involuntary Resettlement (
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
It is unlikely that resettlement will be required.  However, as some power 
distribution lines may be built, some resettlement or compensation may be 
required to that end.  A Resettlement Policy Framework will be prepared 
accordingly.
