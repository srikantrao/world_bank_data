B.  Project Objective 
 
The project development objective is to improve the delivery of basic local public services in 
selected small towns by local governments and their utilities to a satisfactory level of availability, quality, 
and efficiency.  This objective would be achieved by (a) financing the rehabilitation and/or repair of local 
public infrastructure and utility services, and (b) assisting local governments in: (i) increasing the 
effectiveness of their budgetary planning and management;  (ii) adopting management reform of local 
utilities and starting to operate on a commercial basis; and (iii) strengthening involvement of local 
communities in decisions on investments in local public infrastructure and utility services.  
 
 
The expected project outcomes are:  (a) the selected small towns will experience better quality 
and availability in the provision of basic public services;  and (b) local government and local utilities  
enterprises will have access to better budget management techniques and be able to increase their  
revenues and  provide local public services more efficiently.

C.  Project Description 
 
 
The main components of the project are: 
 
Component A: 
 Local Public Infrastructure and Local Utility Services Upgrading
: The component 
will finance the rehabilitation and/or repair of local public infrastructure (roads, drainage, sanitation, etc.) 
and local utility services (water supply, district heating, etc.) in about ten small towns jointly selected by 
the Government and the Bank. When feasible, investment priorities and project features will be developed 
in close consultation with community-based organizations and business community representatives.  
 
Component B: 
Capacity Building and Training
: The component will finance: (a) technical assistance 
and training for developing the professional capacity of local government staff in administration and 
financial management; and (b) technical assistance to support the Government in the further development 
and implementation of its decentralization strategy and allow it to pursue work on issues in the areas of: 
(i) structuring intergovernmental finance relations; (ii) building and maintaining data bases to monitor the 
fiscal performance of regional and sub-regional authorities and local governments, and (iii) designing 
mechanisms for the efficient transfer of fiscal and external financial resources to regional and sub-
regional authorities and local governments.
 
 
 
Component C: 
Project Management and Supervision
: The component will support project 
implementation by financing: (a) incremental costs of the Project Management Unit (PMU), including 
staff salaries, and (b) consulting services to provide technical expertise required for project management. 
  
While detailed component cost estimates will be determined during preparation, the 
current cost estimate of the project is about US$16.5 million, of which U$15.0 million financed 
by IDA.  
The proposed project design represents the most effective approach to addressing the 
current public infrastructure and service deficiencies in small towns.  Combining infrastructure 
rehabilitation with institutional capacity building at the local government level will allow 
resolving problems that currently are obstacles to economic growth and reduction of poverty.  
Options considered but not selected included a project that would have simultaneously 
addressed sector policy issues at the national level and delivery of infrastructure and utility 
services by local governments.  Mixing national and local political agendas, however, carries a 
high risk of failure because solving national policy issues is subject to political debate. Such 
issues are generally more efficiently addressed through structural adjustment programs than 
through specific investment operations.  
A Specific Investment Loan (SIL) is the most appropriate lending instrument, given the 
urgent need for investment in urban infrastructure rehabilitation.  Other investment lending 
instruments were considered unsuitable because they are too complex for a first time operation 
in an environment that has no familiarity with procedures of international finance institutions.  
No co-financing is considered at this time, but opportunities for it will be explored during project 
preparation.  
 Project preparation will be carried out in consultation with USAID and its consultants 
who have been working in the Kyrgyz Republic developing, 
inter alia,
 a pilot program for 
capacity building for local governments.

D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will support rehabilitation of local public infrastructure in towns across the Kyrgyz 
Republic based on selection criteria (geographical, economic and social criteria) agreed in 
advance between the Government and the Bank. 
 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
Project management capacity in the country is considered to be weak, particularly in financial 
management and procurement.  The project plans to address this risk through intensive technical 
support both during preparation and implementation. [see below]

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
The proposed project is expected to rehabilitate existing local public infrastructure such as in 
water supply and distribution networks, district heating supply and distribution, roads, drainage 
pipes, etc.  The first year of investment will include environmental impact assessments as part of 
the preparatory work.  The same approach will be used for the preparatory of downstream 
investments for subprojects that will be selected during project implementation.  Capacity will be 
established within the project implementation unit for the environmental screening of 
subprojects. 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
The proposed project is expected to have positive direct and/or indirect environmental impacts 
through improved operation of water supply, heating and other local public infrastructure.  
Disclosure and consultation requirements shall apply where appropriate to investment sub-
projects.  Fulfillment of consultation and disclosure requirements are expected to be part of 
requirements for project appraisal.
