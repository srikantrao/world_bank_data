A. Basic Project Data
Country: ROMANIA                                 Project ID: P075959
Project: Afforestation of Degraded Agricultural Land  Task Team Leader: Benoit Bosquet
Authorized to Appraise Date: August 15, 2002     IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: October 20, 2002                  IDA Amount ($m):
Managing Unit: ENVCF                             Sector: Forestry (35%); Sub-national government
Lending Instrument: Specific Investment Loan (SIL)  administration (65%)
Status: Lending                                  Theme: Climate change (P); Land management (S)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The Project has one main objective, namely (1) the reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations through
carbon sequestration in planted trees and in soils. In the process of working towards this objective, the
Project will also achieve two subsidiary objectives: (2) stabilization of degraded sandy agricultural lands
through the planting of Robinia sp. (Poplar) and a number of minor species; and (3) ecological
reconstruction of degraded lands in the lower Danube floodplain through planting of native broadleaf
species.
The Project will also enable Romania to enter and benefit from the carbon market. (4) Beyond the carbon
sales proceeds from the Prototype Carbon Fund, the Project should be able to keep earning revenues from
other carbon buyers. (5) Romania will garner trading experience and relations for the future, in the fields
of forestry but also energy. Being able to harness the carbon market will catalyze public and private
investment flows to Romania.
Furthermore, the Project contributes to (6) the transformation of the rural economy, from exploiting
natural resources to acting as steward of natural resources.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project will afforest 6,922 ha of State-owned degraded agricultural lowlands in 7 Counties in
Southern Romania, hereby helping the local and global environments. The species planted initially will
be black locust (Robiniapseudoacacia), native poplars (Populus sp.) and oak (Quercus cerris).
This Project is somewhat different than a typical Bank investment, in that it consist of only one
component, namely afforestation of degraded agricultural lands. Afforestation consists of several
activities, all of which will be included in the Project, namely site and soil preparation, seedling
plantation, and maintenance.

The first year of the Project will be supported by a public informationi campaign targeting the local
populations, to ensure their understanding and support for the Project.
Monitoring (referred to as verification and certification) will occur throughout the 15 years of the
Project. The costs of verification and certification are estimated at around $15,000 a year, to be paid by
the PCF and reimbursed by the Project.
There is no Bank or GEF financing, only Host Country financing, with a PCF contribution payable upon
receipt of certificates that the carbon has been sequestered. In other words, the PCF will reimburse the
Host Country for expenses it has incurred to start the Project keeping pace with carbon sequestration. As
is the case with other PCF projects, however, the PCF does prefinance a portion of Project preparation,
including the baseline study, monitoring plan and validation. These are the requirements of the Kyoto
Protocol. All these costs are then charged back to the Project and reimbursed to the PCF in the form of
lower annual payments for emission reductions.

characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Note: according to the Romanian system there are 5prodziction c/assesfor each spe4ies from class I (the hi,ghest prodiaLtion) to
V (the lowest).
Environmental characteristics: All the sites are state-owned degraded agricultural land, where
agricultural activities have been stopped or some low-quality grazing takes place in a free access
situation. In the southwest, afforestation will typically be done on poor sandy soils (low, medium or high
plain). In the southeast, there is greater diversity (sandy soils, alluvials soils, seoded soils). The
southwest sites are not located near protected areas. The soils are consistently of very poor quality, and
only robinia is capable of surviving in the current conditions. The southeast includes sites of much
greater ecological importance, in particular one Ramsar site (Insula Mica a Brailei). However, the species
planted on that island are the same as the natural vegetation (mostly poplar and some willow on the
banks). Afforestation will contribute to: (a) soil stabilization in the southwest; and (b) soil stabilization
and ecological reconstruction in the southeast. Ecological reconstruction in the southeast (forest and
wetland reconstruction) is expected to enhance flyways for migratory bird species.
Social characteristics: The communities surrounding afforestation sistes typically a couple of thousand
people in each village. Seven such villages have been surveyed and consulted so far and more will be in
the course of the baseline study in April 2002. The analysis conducted to date suggests that afforestation
is sustainable from a social point of view. Communities are generally not interested in the land
earmarked for afforestation. According to the social scientists reviewing the Project, gains to local
communities are obvious in many cases. These benefits are not limited to the availability of firewood or
other natural resources offered by the forest. In the Southeastern area (Olt and Doij Counties) the main
role of the forest is to stop sand from spreading and to stabilize the climate. In Galati County,
afforestation will help fight landslides and combat droughts. In both areas the direct and indirect benefits
are higher than the provision of firewood and other natural resources. The local communities' gains
consist primarily in the improvement of surrounding agricultural land and of living conditions.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If infornmation is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental Assessment: The Project has no major or potential adverse environmental impacts. The
afforestation aims to (a) stabilize degraded and sandy agricultural lands and (b) ecologically reconstruct
native Poplar vegetation. In the Insula Mica a Brailei, where native Poplars will be planted, the scale of
afforestation is relatively large and is of some concern. However, the planting aims at reproducing the
dominant native vegetation which is extensive in the area. This will reduce the potential impact of the
scale of afforestation.
Natural Habitats: The island of Insula Mica a Brailei is a Ramsar site and was part of a larger project to
protect bird populations in the lower Danube River corridor (a LIFE-NATURE project funded by the
European Union, concluded in February 2002). It will be important to ensure diversity of species to meet
the main objectives of planting - ecological reconstruction. The ecological reconstruction of this site is in
line with Bank's policy. None of the Robinia areas lie within or adjoin designated protected habitats.
However, it will be important to ensure there is proper screening prior to afforestation to ensure that no
natural habitats inadvertently are afforested.
Forestry: The Projects complies with OP 4.36 insofar as: (1) it does not finance commercial logging
operation or the purchase of logging equipment for use in primary tropical moist forests; (2) it involves
local people in forestry conservation management or in alternative income generating activities; (3) it
does touch forest areas of high ecological value. Furthermore, the Project is in line with the Bank's
forestry policy in that it: (a) promotes afforestation (of degraded and State owned lands); and (b) will
enhance the environmental contribution of forested areas through a combination of (i) use of native
species and ecological reconstruction in the Poplar areas and (ii) assist in soil stabilization and
prevention of extension of degradation to adjoining agricultural lands. Although not directly aimed at
reducing poverty, the Project will provide local employment mainly during the establishment stage. The
Project is also in line with the new forest policy currently being drafted, to the extent that it entails

ISDS
promoting forests for the benefits of global commons (climate change mitigation).
Pest management: The native Poplars planted under the Project are susceptible to Sapaerdapopulnea. It
is normal practice to: (a) treat Poplar seedlings in the nursery with Bumper (active ingredient is
propiconaazole and is a fungicide used for control of powdery mildew. Widely used under a variety of
trade names. USDA classification "general use") to prevent attack; and (b) only to spray crops with
DECIS EC 2.5 (Decis is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide with active ingredient deltamethrin. Toxic to
aquatic life and should not be sprayed within 25 metres of watercourses, rivers, streams etc. Widely used
in agriculture) in the event of a major infestation. The preventative treatment represents good nursery
practice. A major infestation in the project area cannot be ruled out over the life of the Project but is
regarded as being unlikely. Given that the Project will not directly fund the purchase of pesticides and
that spraying of crops will only take place in the event of a major infestation, there is no real risk of
contravening the Bank's Pest Management policy.
Indigenous Peoples: The Project will not affect any indigenous groups. According to OD 4.20's
definition, only Rom people from the Ocolna village (near Dabuleni) are indigenous people but the
Project will not affect their dwellings, their assets or access to assets or their income sources in any way.
Moreover, the project can offer them with some work opportunities through afforestation.
Involuntary resettlement: The proposed Project does not produce any involuntary resettlement since it
will not produce relocation or loss of shelter, no one will lose their assets or access to assets and nobody
will lose their income sources as a result of the Project. Afforestation will not affect the inhabited areas.
Fieldwork research data point out that nobody is interested in the land proposed for afforestation given
that it is degraded. Minimal, if any, loss of jobs is expected the ensue from the Project.
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
II.D.2. In light of I, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Should further issues arise in the course of the baseline study, the Project team will take the appropriate
measures to mitigate negative impact or alter site selection.
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Environmental Assessment: The baseline study will provide an extra opportunity to check the
environmental soundness of the approval process for afforestation activities. The monitoring plan will
also set up a number of indicators of soil quality, so as to be able to assess the avoided losses soil
expected from the Project.
Natural Habitats: A further assessment of the ecological importance of sites to be afforestated will be
carried out by Wetlands International during the baseline study. The baseline study will assess what
would happen without the Project and how the Project will impact the sites -- in good or bad. In addition,
the monitoring plan will provide for quantifiable indicators of project impact, such as the number of bird
species observed using the newly forested areas, etc.
Involuntary resettlement: The social assessment will continue during the baseline study. In addition to
proceeding with the community survey and setting up a monitoring system, several issues will be
addressed, which were highlighted during the first phase of the social assessment, including th eneeds

ISDS
for: (a) checking the exact land ownership status of the various plots to be afforested so as to prevent any
conflicts in the future; (b) preventing physically cutting people from their livelihood bases, e.g. access to
agricultural land or forest resources; (c) organizing an information campaign on the Project at the level of
local communities to secure the support of local communities; (d) minimizing the risk of uncontrolled
grazing by domestic animals on newly afforested state land; (e) the need for technical assistance to some
communities on how to improve agricultural land fertility.
IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are: (1) the local populations from the Counties of Doij, Mehedinti, Olt,
Braila, Galati, Tulcea and Vaslui. Local villagers; (2) the migrant workers from within Romania who will
be involved in the plantation establishment and tending operations; (3) the NFA, as sponsor and
executing agency; (4) the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forests, as co-sponsor and regulator; (5) the
Ministry of Water and Environmental Protection, as the authority in charge of climate change policy; and
(6) local and international NGOs active in the social and environmental fields.
Consultations: Two social scientists of the University of Bucharest were recruited to conduct an
assessment of the potential impact on local communities of this Project. They visited and interviewed
villagers in 7 villages. As noted above, communities are generally not interested in the land earmarked
for afforestation and are in many cases set to benefit from the Project. The full report is available on
request. One of the two sientists will participate in the baseline study and monitoring plan, during which
she will, inter alia, pursue her assessment of more villages, formulate recommenidations on how to
minimize negative impact in some areas, maximize the social support in others, and develop a set of
monitoring indicators to measure the social impact of the Project durinig implementation.
