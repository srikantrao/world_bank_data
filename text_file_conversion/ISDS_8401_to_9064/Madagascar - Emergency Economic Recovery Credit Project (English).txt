Section I - Basic Information
A. Basic Pro ect Data
Country: MADAGASCAR                           Project ID: P080345
Project: Emergency Economic Recovery Credit   Task Team Leader: Susanne Holste
Authorized to Appraise Date: October 3, 2002  IBRD Amount ($m):
Bank Approval: November 7, 2002              IDA Amount ($m): 40.00
Managing Unit: AFTTR                          Sector: Central government administration (100%)
Lending Instrument: Emergency Recovery Loan (ERL)  Theme: Other economic management (P)
Status: Preparation
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The EERC would support Madagascar during the critical transition out of crisis and would support the
government's short-term economic recovery program.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The World Bank proposes to make available US$ 30 million for an Emergency Economic
Recovery Credit (EERC) to address urgent financing needs until mid-2003 which cannot be
provided through the existing Bank portfolio or additional donor financing. The EERC would
provide quick-disbursing liquidity to assist Madagascar to rebuild its physical assets and to
restore economic and social activities. The EERC would finance imports that the country needs
for its short-term recovery program while at the same time ensuring macro-economic stability.
Critical imports for reconstruction, economic recovery and the mitigating of the social crisis
include petroleum, building materials, medical supplies, and inputs for fertilizers (see positive
list of imports). The positive list will not include pesticides. The counterpart funds of the credit
(domestic currency equivalent) would provide important budgetary funds to enable Government
to implement its priority spending program. The EERC would provide complementary funding
for those activities that cannot be financed through the existing Bank portfolio or through
planned, new lending. This would for example apply to Government's new and extensive public
works scheme to create short-term employment or to the waiver of fees for primary schools.
The overall management and coordination of the EERC would be entrusted to a project
implementation unit (PIU) set-up within the Ministry of Economy and Plan (MOEP). The PIU
would be a lightweight structure including a national Coordinator, an accountant and
procurement specialist who has been selected on a competitive basis, in conformity with the

ISDS
Bank/IDA procurement procedures. Since the PIU is not yet operational, the assessment carried
out at this stage of project cycle consists in advising the borrower on: i) the PIU's organizational
structure and the responsibility assignments of its key staff; ii) the design of the management
system to be implemented, including procurement, budgeting, accounting, financial systems and
procedures, staffing, financial reporting and auditing. The objective is to have a fully established
and functional unit prior to Board presentation capable of (i) selecting documentation of properly
procured imports eligible under the credit; (ii) reliably recording and reporting the financial
transactions of the program in a timely manner; and (iii) providing sufficient and relevant
financial information for managing and monitoring program activities. Bank and borrower have
agreed to an action plan to achieve these objectives.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Entire country as the credit is supporting the national reconstruction program
B. Clheck Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)
Comments: The implementation of the economic recovery program is not expected to have any negative
environmental impact; therefore the project's environment category is C.
