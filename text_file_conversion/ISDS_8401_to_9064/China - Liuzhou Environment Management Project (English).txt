B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
  
 
The project objective is to improve the quality of water of the River Liujiang, through: (i) 
development of a comprehensive waste water collection and treatment system in its urban 
districts and urban suburb of the rural Liujiang county; and (ii) introduction of  policy and 
regulatory measures to effectively control industrial waste water discharge.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project would consist of:(i) investment component and (ii) institutional development 
and capacity building component. 
 
Investment Component 
 
The preliminary scope of the Project, is focusing on a series of five sub-components of 
essentially primary sewerage network and treatment works in various areas of the city. One of 
them in the southwest is intended to assist the urban development of a township in the outskirts 
of the city (Liujiang District) and protect the use of water resources for agricultural purposes.  
All the proposed measures are currently in the sewerage and sanitation sector.  They would 
Page  2
 
 
complement and complete a series of similar investments already carried out by the city in 
various areas linked to the urban development and its road infrastructure. The total investment 
cost is preliminarily estimated at RMB 1,913,000,000.  (US$225 million) 
.  
The sub-components, with indicative scope, are below:  
 
1. 
Baisha Sewage Treatment and Conveyance  (30 km pipelines,100,000m3 capacity) 
2a.        Longquanshan  Sewage Treatment  (26 km pipeline,150,000m3 capacity) 
2b.       Comprehensive Renovation Project of Water Environment of Zhuerxi  
3.  Jinlan Sewage Treatment and conveyance   (8.6km pipeline,100,000m3 capacity) 
4.         Yanghe sewage treatment and conveyance  (pipelines-tbd, and 40,000m3 capacity) 
5. 
Labao Sewage Treatment and conveyance   (13 km pipeline, 40,000m3 capacity) 
 
Institutional Development and Capacity Building
:  
 
This component would help: (i) Liuzhou Construction Investment and Development 
Co.Ltd (ICDC), implement the project (procurement and construction supervision); (ii) LMG 
and  ICDC to develop an autonomous and financially sustainable waste water company; and (iii)  
Environment Protection Bureau (EPB) to enhance its capacity in enforcing environmental 
regulations related to industrial waste water discharge. This component will finance TA, Studies, 
Training and associated equipment and goods, including monitoring equipment. The ID and 
Capacity Building Component is preliminarily estimated at US$ 7 million. 
 
Implementing Agency 
 
The implementing agency of the  project is Liuzhou Construction Investment and 
Development Co. Ltd (ICDC), 100% owned by LMG.  Its department of sewerage will be 
responsible for construction of the wastewater system. A new financially autonomous waste 
water company which is ICDC’s subsidiary will be responsible for the operation and 
maintenance of the network and treatment plant. The Leading Group led by the Executive Vice 
Mayor and consisting of the representatives of various departments concerned of LMG, Liujiang 
District and ICDC, will supervise the project preparation and implementation, provide policy

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Liuzhou Construction Investment and Development Co. Ltd (ICDC) is the implementing 
agency and responsible for safeguard policies. Liuzhou Construction Investment and 
Development Co. Ltd (ICDC) is the implementing agency and responsible for safeguard policies. 
ICDC has contracted the Sino-Japanese Environmental Protection Center (the Center), holding a 
Class A certificate and based in Beijing, has been selected by ICDC to prepare the EA document, 
and Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences (SASS) to work on social assessment and preparation 
of RAP. Although ICDC is not familiar with the Bank safeguard policies, particularly regarding 
social and resettlement aspect,   the above mentioned units and experts have had experiences of 
preparing the safeguard documentation for World Bank- and ADB- financed projects.

Because the proposed project will finance investment in number of large scale 
wastewater treatment plants and sewerage collection system, categorization of the EA for this 
project would be classified as “Category A”EA. The project also include land acquisition and 
resettlement.
