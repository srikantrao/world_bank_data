weaknesses of the banking system and initiate the restoration of its soundness, which is a
prerequisite for sustainable growth and poverty alleviation. The project would achieve this
objective by providing technical assistance for: (i) the design and implementation of a banking
sector consolidation program, (ii) the institutional strengthening of the Comisi6n Nacional de
Bancos y Seguros (CNBS), (iii) the reform of the payments system, and (iv) the initiation of a

planned in FY04 to complement the proposed technical assistance operation and achieve the
objectives defined in the Country Assistance Strategy.
