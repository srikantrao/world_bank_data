I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The Transport Infrastructure Investment Project (TIIP) supports the CAS objective to accelerate poverty
reduction, and, in conjunction with APL1 and APL2, the goals of the country's transport sector policy and
strategy. The specific development objective of this project is to rehabilitate the country's major transport
infrastructure in order to reduce transport cost and to facilitate trade.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
1) National Road Maintenance, Rehabilitation and Upgrading (Total $588 million of which IDA $91
million)

Reflecting the Government's development priorities, this component is the most important of the project.
The program for upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance aims at bringing all the primary and secondary
national roads (7,313 km) to good and fair condition by end of 2008.

The overall program for the national road comes to $588 million of which this credit will finance US$ 91
million for the following interventions:
- 112 kilometers of upgrading to paved standard on the RN44 from Morarano to the junction with RN3A.
  This secondary national road connects the "rice bowl" of the country - the Lac Alaotra region - with the
  main road linking the capital Antananarivo with the main port Toamasina (RN2). The RN44 is currently
  inaccessible during the rainy season
- 69 kilometers of rehabilitation of the gravel road from Ambatondrazaka to Vohitraivo (RN44)
- 249 kilometers of periodic maintenance on the RN2 between Antananarivo and Brickaville
-       295 kilometers of periodic maintenance on various sections of the RN7 between Antananarivo and
  Fianarantsoa, the highest trafficked trunk road in the country
- 186 kilometers of rehabilitation and periodic maintenance on the bituminous RN32 from Ansohihy to
  Mandritsara, a departmental capital and a major agricultural production zone
- the repair of 40 ferries within a national plan for the renewal of the ferries system and the involvement of
  the private sector for their operation

2) Ports and Maritime Transport (Total $50 million of which IDA 22.51 million)

                                                        2
                                                                                                            ISDS




The Government's ports and maritime transport upgrading, rehabilitation and maintenance program aims at
contributing to trade facilitation, by increasing the efficiency of the system, its connectivity with other
segments of the transport network, consequently lowering overall transport costs. The total program cost
amounts to $ 117 million (excluding the planned construction of the new port at Fort Dauphin). To be
realistic the program was divided into first priority actions, to be achieved between 2003 and 2008 (the
time frame of the APL) and those planned for beyond 2008. The first priority actions amount to $50
million, out of which IDA is expected to finance $22.51 for the following actions:

- technical assistance, equipment and training for APMF, ENEM and CAM, as well as setting up of a
  management information system in APMF
- the rehabilitation and extension of the Mahajanga port and minor works on the Toamasina--Sainte Marie
  transport connection infrastructure facilities
- the rehabilitation of four main lighthouses in Madagascar and coastal navigation aids, as well as services
  and supplies to help make Madagascar compliant with the IMO-MARPOL convention it has joined in
  May 2003.
- first phase of littoral protection works of Toamasina.

3) Airport Safety and Facilitation of Public-Private Partnership (Total requirement US$56 million of
which IDA US$ 7.24 million)

The government's aviation policy aims at promoting trade and tourism, through institutional strengthening,
airport infrastructure rehabilitation, safety and security development and general modernization of the
airport system of Madagascar. Total investments programmed amount to about $56 million. Out of this,
IDA is planning to finance $7.24m.

IDA's support includes the following:

-        safety and security enhancements on the entire Malagasy airport network through the provision of
  respective up-to-date equipment to comply with ICAO standards
- financing of the necessary government contribution to complement private sector financing related to the
  rehabilitation of 7 provincial airports, which are to be managed by private operators under an affermage
  arrangement. These secondary airports are critical from an economic development point of view but their
  traffic volume will not allow full cost recovery

4) Support to the VPM (Total requirement US$12 million, of which IDA US$9.67 million)

This component will focus on strengthening the newly merged VPM to execute its function to oversee and
coordinate the sector, and to finalize the reform process. It will finance the following: (i) the social plan for
the redeployment of about 2,700 of the current 3,015 employees of the VPM costing an estimated US$3
million; (ii) the provision of technical support including technical assistance, training and equipment (US$4
million); and (iii) feasibility studies, preliminary design, detailed design and preparation of bidding
documents for future requirements in the sector.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
As mentioned in the project description, sites specific to the project are the national roads and the port of
Mahajanga in the second year. Population impacted, proximity of sub-projects to protected areas, cultural

                                                                                                         ISDS


sites, etc. are assessed in detail in the EA report.


B. Check Environmental Classification: A (Full Assessment)

Comments: As stated earlier, the APL3 Project will finance the rehabilitation of existing transport
infrastructure including national roads, ports and airports. Although most investment concerns the
rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, the general environmental situation in Madagascar and the size and
nature of the infrastructure concerned requires that the project be classified A - full assessment.

The Project EA is rather specific in terms of the roads component where all sub-projects are clearly
defined, where detailed design is on-going and which are considered as "first year projects". In respect of
the ports and airports, investments are planned as residuals to private sector investments as part of
concessioning agreements with private sector operators. Since this process is only commencing now, these
investments are considered as "second year investments". Thus, the EA focuses on specific National Roads
only.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The potential environmental and social impacts may include: soil erosion ("lavaks" or erosion gullies), noise
and dust presumed to induce adverse physical environmental impacts during road construction works,
increase of accidental risks, impairment of natural habitat close to quarries, disturbance in water quality,
marine and aquatic disturbances (contamination, oil/waste spills/disposal).

To address these issues, the following safeguards were suggested: sowing the slopes with grass seeds, canal
constructions, material and road dampening, avoidance of dangerous works during rush hours, elaboration
of emergency plans, application of technical and work standards for the selection of workers and machines,
installation of working areas in sites which are poor in biodiversity, prohibition of dredging works in the
vicinities of fauna reproduction areas and sensitive areas, as well as during aquatic fauna reproduction
cycles.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No cumulative impacts are anticipated at this point. However, the depth and breadth of the EMPs to be
prepared will provide a better indication of this and will take into consideration any mitigation related to
longer-term impacts.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Improved access to rural areas could trigger: deforestation, unless controlled by national policy against
deforestation; development of transmissible diseases, especially HIV/AIDS; resettlement of some aquatic
populations; cultural identity dilution.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
At this point, there are two main alternatives: one can encourage the synergy among various stakeholders,

                                                      5
                                                                                                           ISDS


especially among Ministerial Departments (Transport, Environment, Health, Agriculture,...) for better
coordination, and promote the use of other means of transportation, especially fluvial and railroad
transportation which have lower risks of accidents, cause less pollution and less infrastructure
deterioration.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An EA was disclosed August 4, 2003. A resettlement framework was prepared as a part of the
APL2 and was disclosed in July 2002. There will be no resettlement caused by APL3.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Participatory approaches are applied during the preparation of the EA and EMP. Thus, various public
consultations have been carried out through consultations and discussions with public authorities and local
governments during field missions; media campaigns, including compiling records in books to display at
various public authorities offices and public places, for observation; and the in-country disclosure
workshop was conducted on July 18, 2003.

Along with this EA, the entire APL is supported by a sectorial environmental assessment as well as a
resettlement policy framework. Both have been approved and disclosed. Subsequent EAs and RAPs, where
needed, will be prepared, approved and disclosed according to Bank and national policies.

The main stakeholders who participated in these consultations are: the various sectorial Ministries
(Transport & Public Works; Environment & Water and Forests; Health; Agriculture; Communication;...);
specialized institutions, especially the main NGOs like the ONE (National Organization of Environment);
various regional associations (carriers; farmers; water users; port users;...); and the Mayors.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
