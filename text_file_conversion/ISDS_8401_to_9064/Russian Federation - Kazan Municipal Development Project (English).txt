($m.) 
 
 
B.  Project Objective 
 
The direct target beneficiary groups will include: (i) those who live in multi-unit, municipal-
owned dwellings; (ii) individuals and small firms that are or will become engaged in the market 
for HCS services; and (iii) recipients of social protection and social housing.  More broadly, the 
project beneficiaries are the population of the city of Kazan, as the entire city will be impacted 
through structural changes in budget expenditures. 
 
The project development objectives are to: 
\01\02
support reforms that will result in significant structural changes to budget expenditures and 
improved municipal asset management, allowing the local government to re-orient resources to 
social and economic development; 
\01\02
specifically, reduce the high burden on the municipal budget of maintaining the housing 
stock and communal infrastructure and across-the-board subsidization of the consumption of 
utility services; 
\01\02
strengthen the local systems for delivery of social protection to needy members of the 
population; 
\01\02
support the development of a private market for housing maintenance services. 
 
 
 
C.  Project Description 
Page  2
 
 
 
Under the broad framework of support to municipal development and improved city 
management, it is envisioned that the operation will support multi-year reform programs in the 
following areas, which overlap in significant ways: 
 
(i) housing and communal services sector 
 
(ii) public expenditure management 
 
(iii) asset management 
 
(iv) social protection 
 
The lending instrument proposed for this operation is a subnational programmatic adjustment 
loan.  This instrument is the most appropriate for the given situation because of the multi-sectoral 
nature of the reforms that Kazan is undertaking and because of the inherent flexibility of the 
PAL.  A specific investment operation was considered as an alternative and rejected as not 
providing the best fit with the broad-based reform program proposed by Kazan.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN] 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
A social specialist is a member of the team and will be involved in assessing the social impact of 
the proposed reforms and developing the related mitigation measures. 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
Public consultation and disclosure are a central aspect of the proposed reform program, which 
will be very sensitive to public support (or, conversely, lack thereof) of the reforms.  At this early 
stage, it is expected that extensive public meetings and focus groups will be conducted with 
members of the target population, possibly more extensive measures (such as a survey of the 
population).
