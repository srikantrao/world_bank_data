I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objective of the Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) is, for a selected set
of woredas, to establish effective and functional models of local governance, investment, and
disaster management in pastoral areas that address communities' priority needs and reduce their
vulnerability.
If this development objective is achieved according to performance indicators, this will trigger
subsequent project phases within a programmatic approach. These phases will expand the program
geographically to a larger set of woredas to provide access of all pastoral communities to the program's
benefits.
I.A.3 Project Description:
Component 1. Sustainable Livelilhoods
This component would establish decentralized and participatory planning procedures at the community
and woreda levels, linked to the Regional Government framework. This would enable women and men in
pastoral communities to identify, prioritize, design, and implement micro-projects. Communities would
be supported by project-financed Mobile Support Teams (MSTs) who would work together with woreda
administrations. The MSTs would use participatory learning and action (PLA) tools to conduct needs
assessments and help communities develop modest local development plans. Individual communities



2
ISDS
will use simple micro-project application forms that make clear their objectives, proposed activities, and
budgets, while taking into consideration the environmental implications of these activities. Proposed
community investments would be approved by kebele committees, including representatives of local
community groups, business, NGOs and administration, and successful proposals would be forwarded to
woredas for funding through the Community Investment Fund (CIF). Investments covered under the CIF
would not be limited to specific sectors, in order to preserve the multi-sectoral nature of the project and
respect the priorities of the poor. As such, this component could finance micro-projects in livestock,
agriculture, water supply, small-scale irrigation, health care, education, rangeland management, etc.,
(subject to a short negative list). Investment assessment would be against transparent criteria known in
advance to all stakeholders. The development plans, which would require a significant community cash
or in-kind contribution to demonstrate commitment, would be implemented directly by communities to
build capacity, ensure correspondence of investments to needs, and guarantee accountability to the
community. Communities may also choose to write a memorandum of understanding with a government
department or NGO.
Community level investments would be complemented by the strengthening of district technical support
services such as natural resource management, health, education, and micro-finance institutions. Through
training and institutional strengthening, the component would link and coordinate with government plans
for decentralization. Agricultural services would also be strengthened through integrated participatory
research and technology transfer programs and contracted studies for more holistic technology and
resource constraints. The project would also provide policy, institutional and training support for the
development of community-based health and education services. These services would be provided
through project-financed mobile support teams. However, given the weak capacity currently present in
most woredas, project support in these areas would begin in more capable woredas and phased in
gradually.
Component 2. Pastoral Risk Management
This component includes a community-based early warning system which will build upon ongoing efforts
by DPPC and NGOs to establish, at the woreda level the collection and analysis of basic household
welfare data using a survey instrument designed for the primarily pastoral production system. Using
part-time data monitors at the kebele/community level, woredas would be able to compile and analyze
trends in household and environmental conditions in discrete areas. Regions would then receive these
reports, which would assist in planning and ultimately the implementation of a better system of targeting
early reaction to declines in the welfare of pastoralist communities. The component would begin in year
one in the focus project ivoredas, but as the early warning system should be region wide as soon as
possible, it should scale up to all pastoral woredas in the three Regions. In the Drought Contingency
Planning subcomponent, the project will invest in capacity building at woreda and regional levels to
prepare drought contingency plans, monitor local disaster indicators, and manage funds made available
for drought response, primarily from other donors and government, but also with small amounts made
available under the project. This should result in improved response as a result of the implementation of
appropriate disaster and drought mitigation, management, and recovery activities. As this process is
intensive in terms of human capacity, the project would only aim to produce functioning drought
contingency plans for the initial focus woredas. Finally, the Drought Preparedness and Contingency
Fund would provide the initial thirty woredas with development grants to finance activities identified in
their contingency plans. It is expected that woreda level drought contingency plans would include both
investments to better mitigate drought, such as small feeder roads, improved water management, fodder
banks, and range improvement, as well as funds set aside for rapid response, such as destocking, water
tankering, response to human and animal disease outbreaks, and the like An acceptable contingency

ISDS
plan, including documentation of the participatory process and environmental assessment, if applicable,
would be a condition for release of fund resources. A relatively small portion of this Fund would be
earmarked to jump-start investments in critical infrastructure identified in the regional inventory,
however it is expected that other government and donor resources would be the prime source of funds for
major infrastructure investments. Investments could include roads, livestock water points (based on
catchment management plans), flood control structures, grain stores and electronic communication
systems. Local labor would be employed and paid, providing an injection of cash into the local economy
Component 3. Project support and policy reform
This component will provide operational support and training resources to the project coordination unit
(PCU) in Addis Ababa and implementation units in the three Regions. The project support and
coordination subcomponent would ensure that the (PCU) would effectively perform the following
functions: (i) fiduciary obligations; (ii) policy analysis and liaison with stakeholder groups; (iii)
multi-sectoral coordination at the federal level; (iv) project communication; (v) aggregate project
monitoring; and (vi) mobilization of technical backstopping. The monitoring and evaluation
subcomponent would finance the information management system and project liaison activities. This
would comprise (i) a Management Information System; and (ii) a system that combines community
derived impact assessment of micro-projects with a system that tracks pastoral livelihoods at the woreda
and regional level. The M&E would be able to provide timely feedback to program management on how
well interventions are reaching the intended beneficiaries and how effectively the project resources are
being used, in order that rapid corrective action can be taken if necessary. The communication program
includes development and dissemination of information concerning program activities, approaches and
results, using a variety of media. It is envisaged that extensive use of radio networks would be made for
public awareness creation, for the transmission of technical messages, and for the sharing of experiences.
The policy analyses and reform sub-component would address policy and institutional reforms that
would strengthen pastoral livelihoods and reduce risk (see the following section), and would consist
mainly on targetted studies, training, and outreach activities.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The primary target population for PCDP is poor pastoral and agropastoral communities in the Afar,
Somali, Oromia and Southern regions. Other, smaller concentrations of pastoralists in locations suchi as
in Gambella and Benshangul-Gumz Regions would be engaged in the later phases of project
implementation. The project is expected to have a positive impact on the income and well being of what
could potentially be several million people living throughout the rangelands of Ethiopia.
Rangeland degradation, driven by rising human and livestock populations, is increasing in these pastoral
areas of Ethiopia as evidenced by soil loss, bush encroachment, reduced bio-diversity and deforestation
close to urban and refugee concentrations. Traditional range management systems, based on indigenous
knowledge, mobility, reciprocity agreements, fluid boundaries and traditional law are facing new
pressures, which require different institutions, technologies and systems for their redress. Grazing lands
in Ethiopia have, since the early 1900s, been regarded as property of the State. The new 1994
Constitution provides for pastoralists "not to be displaced without their wish". It does not, however,
provide the by-laws for the protection of the rangeland or for compensation for alienated land and
remains underphinned by a strong State sentiment for voluntary pastoralist settlement.

B. Chieck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The proposed PCDP was rated Category Fl under the World Bank safeguard policy on
environmental assessment. This category is intended for programmatic lending, requiring an environmental
management framework for sub-project screening. Within this, the Sustainable Livelihoods component has
been rated a category B (intended for projects or programs that may result in environmental impacts which
can be easily mitigated and managed) owing to the Community Investment Fund.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental Assessment.
An Environmental Assessment Management Framework (EAMF) for the PCDP was prepared in
November/December 2002. An assessment of the components to be financed under the PCDP indicates
that the Project is not anticipated to result in significant adverse impacts.
Of the three proposed components, the Sustainable Livelihoods component has the most positive
environmental intentions as it aims to provide communities with support to articulate their priority needs
in a local development planning process, working with Mobile Support Teams. Micro-projects derived
from these plans will be financed through the Community Investment Fund (CIF) provided that they are
prepared in a participatory manner, in accordance with project guidelines (technical and environmental),
and contingent upon a community contribution (in cash or in kind) to demonstrate commitment. A third
sub-component will strengthen and enhance the responsiveness of core support services to the needs and
priorities of pastoral communities. Although it is not possible to establish precisely what the
environmental impacts of these subprojects will be at this stage, it is not anticipated that the impacts will
be adverse as the projects will be small in scale (grants of approximately US$6,000 per community) and
geographically dispersed. Moreover, a component of the EAMF is the provision of an environmental
screening and appraisal process which will be used to evaluate subprojects prior to their appraisal.
The Pastoral Risk Management component (formerly called Disaster Preparedness) includes a
comnnunity-based early warning system, which will build upon ongoing efforts by the DPPC and NGOs



5
ISDS
to establish, at the woreda level, the collection and analysis of basic household welfare data. The system
would rely on community-provided and monitored indicators, which would then feed into improved
contingency plans and response mechanisms at the regional level. The component would begin in the
focus project woredas but would scale up to all pastoral woredas in the three regions, thus improving the
existing system. In Drought Contingency Planning, the project would invest in capacity building at
woreda and regional levels to prepare drought contingency plans, monitor local indicators, and manage
funds made available for preparedness and initial drought response. The drought preparedness and
contingencyfund would provide the initial thirty woredas with development grants to finance activities
identified in their contingency plans. The majority of fund resources would be dedicated to long-term
preparedness interventions. A small amount would be earmarked to jump-start initial mitigation activities
in the event of severe drought. As with the case of the Community Investment Fund (CIF), there are
potential minimal environmental risks associated with activities to be financed under this Fund. Hence,
the proposed environmental screening and appraisal process will be used to assess these subprojects and
to recommend mitigation measures to address them prior to appraisal.
The Project Support and Policy Reform component will provide operational support and training
resources to the PCU and RSTs. The project support and coordination subcomponent would cover
activities of these units as described above. Monitoring and evaluation would finance the information
management system and project liaison activities. The policy analyses and reform sub-component would
address policy and institutional reforms that would strengthen pastoral livelihoods and reduce risk There
are no negative environmental impacts associated with this component. In fact, this component will also
support the environmental training and capacity building which has been recommended under the EAMF
(refer to Table 8.2, Environmental Management Plan.)
Other safeguards
As discussed above, it is not likely that the Project will result in significant environmental impacts
particularly if the recommended mitigation measures are implemented, and the screening process
provided is used effectively during subproject identification and appraisal. Moreover, since the precise
location of subprojects is yet to be determined, it is not certain at this stage whether a number of other
safeguards will be triggered. Implications of these safeguards have been incorporated, to a certain extent,
in the Environmental Management Plan (refer to Table 8.2 in the EAMF).
*   Natural habitats Pastoral areas encompass some natural habitats which are protected by law, such as
the Awash and Yangudi Rasa National Parks (Afar), Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary (Borana), and the
Babille Wildlife Sanctuary (Somali). It is conceivable that the project may operate in woredas that
include or border upon these areas, or other areas that qualify as natural habitats under OP 4.36 As a
contingency, the EAMF has provided measures in the screening process to identify the potential for
impacts on natural habitats. During early project implementation, the PCDP must establish, with the
help of the Environmental Protection Agency, an working definition to identify natural habitats and
thus ensure that the project interventions will not impact them negatively.
*   Forestry Forests are not a common feature of lowland areas. As a contingency, the EAMF has
provided measures in the screening process to identify the potential for impacts on forests (for
example, the use of bush for charcoal or fuelwood) which would require a formal environmental
review. Therefore this safeguard policy is not triggered.
*   Pest management Promotion of rainfed and/or irrigated farming, where feasible and profitable, is
part of promoting sustainable livelihoods, and may indirectly involve use of pesticides. In addition, it
is conceivable that project funds would be used for animal pesticides directly or indirectly (such as
construction of livestock dips). Again, the EAMF has provided measures in the screening process to
identify the potential for impacts and, if triggered, then an Integrated Pest Management Plan will be



6
ISDS
required during project implementation to ensure compliance with the World Bank's policy
*   Culturalproperty: Unlike many areas in the highlands, there are few areas in pastoral areas that
constitute cultural property in the sense described in OP 11.03. Where they might occur,
micro-projects would be unlikely to involve excavation or inundation. Furthermore, the project
activities will be carried out only in areas selected by the local citizens in the pastoral zones, who
would give great importance to safeguarding their cultural property. Therefore, this safeguard policy
is highly unlikely to be applicable.
*   Indigenouspeoples: As an integrated set of "regional projects", the PCDP will be implemented by
and with the pastoral peoples that form the dominant society in the project areas. They will be the
beneficiaries of the project investment. Therefore, they cannot be regarded as "indigenous peoples"
in World Bank terms, i.e. social groups distinct from the dominant society that are vulnerable to
being disadvantaged by the project. Therefore, this safeguard policy is not applicable.
*   Involuntary resettlement. The project will not be causing or promoting involuntary resettlement. As a
demand-driven project, decisions about movement or settlement will be made by the pastoral groups
themselves, either as a normal part of the dynamics of pastoral households or as a decision of the
clan or subclan in the process of their own development planning. Furthermore, given the vast
amounts of land available to pastoralists and land's low marginal cost, any small parcels acquired
through the construction of micro-projects (such as a school or health post) are unlikely to impose a
significant cost to a pastoral community. Therefore, this safeguard policy is not applicable.
* Safety of dams. This project will not finance large investments aimed at dam construction and is in
accordance with this safeguard policy.
*   Projects in international waters: This principle applies specifically to irrigation with water use from
international waterways or which risks polluting them. The project does not foresee extensive use of
irrigation water or practices which would pollute water sources and therefore this policy is not
triggered.
*   Projects in disputed areas * PCDP does not foresee any possible activities in disputed areas and is in
accordance with this safeguard policy.
1l.D 1 b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
There are likely to be many community micro-projects which may in some areas create cumulative
impacts on environmental resources. Examples are:
*   Deforestation due to the exploitation of timber resources, e.g from use of poles and timber in
small-scale construction;
*   Impacts on groundwater from, for example, the construction of numerous shallow wells,
*   Large scale resettlement (or more than 200 people, as defined by the World Bank's Operational
Policy OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement) due to the acquisition of land for the constructioni of
schools, health centers, cereal banks, hand pumps, etc,
*   Waste and dumping sites due to the inappropriate disposal of waste materials during construction
Consideration of these impacts in the project design will provide the PCDP with an opportunity to learn
how to avoid or mitigate localized impacts from initial micro-projects, so that measures can be integrated
into subsequent activities.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

ISDS
The location of certain small-scale activities such as roads, reservoirs and small-scale dams (proposed
under the Drought Contingency and Preparedness Fund) might also have strategic impacts, which
require a more detailed assessment. Unlike schools, health centers, or fodder banks, infrastructure such as
a road requires an assessment of the location and design to take into account the potential impacts that
the road may may have on natural resources (soil erosion, encroachment on protected areas, changes to
surface run-off, dust, etc) and on the social environment (mobility of communities, migration of people,
introduction of diseases, etc). Water resource developments in particular must also be assessed for their
strategic impacts particularly in terms of their location in relation to wet season grazing areas,
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
To address these potential strategic impacts, detailed assessments will be carried out for such
developments. For policy reform activities (ie, strategies for bush control, and unlicensed transportation
of charcoal), a strategic EA should be carried out in consultation with the relevant stakeholders prior to
the policy being appraised by the Government of Ethiopia.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Government of Ethiopia and the implementing agency, the Ministry of Federal Affairs, will
be responsible for ensuring that the measures recommended under the Environmental
Management Plan are implemented. Responsibilities as they related to training, capacity
building, supervision of mitigation measures for micro-projects, and monitoring and evaluation
are described in detail in the EAMF.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholder consultation was one of the key methods used to achieve the EA objectives. An intensive
schedule of interviews with individuals and groups of stakeholders was carried out. A typical agenda of a
meeting would include an introduction of participants, a brief overview of the project, views and
comments of the participants, and specific questions from the EA team regarding the details of
environmental and social sensitivities, people's interaction with the environment, and potential impacts
of the project. Key stakeholders consulted on the project included:
*   Ministry of Agriculture Pastoral Extension Team, and other relevant federal government
agencies;
*   Regional bureaus;
*   Woreda and kebele administrations;
*   Pastoralists in Afar, Oromia (Borana zone), and Somali regions;
*   Environmental NGOs;
*   Research institutes;
*   International development agencies, and staff of agency-funded projects.
During two visits to Ethiopia in October and November 2002, the EA team conducted a series of
interviews and workshops with stakeholders and key informants in Addis Ababa, and the above pastoral
areas of Ethiopia. The first trip in October included meetings with stakeholders and key informants in
Addis Ababa, and a field trip to Afar. During the second visit to Ethiopia in November, the EA team
worked in close cooperation with the World Bank pre-appraisal mission, and with consultants working
on the preparation of the project implementation manual. Limited meetilgs were held with the
consultants working on the institutional assessment, and monitoring and evaluation. Field trips were
made to both Borana in Oromia region and the Somali region.

I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objective of the Pastoral Community Development Project (PCDP) is, for a selected set
of woredas, to establish effective and functional models of local governance, investment, and
disaster management in pastoral areas that address communities' priority needs and reduce their
vulnerability.
If this development objective is achieved according to performance indicators, this will trigger
subsequent project phases within a programmatic approach. These phases will expand the program
geographically to a larger set of woredas to provide access of all pastoral communities to the program's
benefits.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Component 1. Sustainable Livelilhoods
This component would establish decentralized and participatory planning procedures at the community
and woreda levels, linked to the Regional Government framework. This would enable women and men in
pastoral communities to identify, prioritize, design, and implement micro-projects. Communities would
be supported by project-financed Mobile Support Teams (MSTs) who would work together with ivoreda
administrations. The MSTs would use participatory learning and action (PLA) tools to conduct needs
assessments and help communities develop modest local development plans. Individual communities



2
ISDS
will use simple micro-project application forms that make clear their objectives, proposed activities, and
budgets, while taking into consideration the environmental implications of these activities Proposed
community investments would be approved by kebele committees, including representatives of local
community groups, business, NGOs and administration, and successful proposals would be forwarded to
woredas for funding through the Community Investment Fund (CIF). Investments covered under the CIF
would not be limited to specific sectors, in order to preserve the multi-sectoral nature of the project and
respect the priorities of the poor. As such, this component could finance micro-projects in livestock,
agriculture, water supply, small-scale irrigation, health care, education, rangeland management, etc,
(subject to a short negative list). Investment assessment would be against transparent criteria known in
advance to all stakeholders. The development plans, which would require a significant community cash
or in-kind contribution to demonstrate commitment, would be implemented directly by communities to
build capacity, ensure correspondence of investments to needs, and guarantee accountability to the
community Communities may also choose to write a memorandum of understanding with a government
department or NGO.
Community level investments would be complemented by the strengthening of district technical support
services such as natural resource management, health, education, and micro-finance institutions. Through
training and institutional strengthening, the component would link and coordinate with government plans
for decentralization. Agricultural services would also be strengthened through integrated participatory
research and technology transfer programs and contracted studies for more holistic technology and
resource constraints. The project would also provide policy, institutional and training support for the
development of community-based health and education services. These services would be provided
through project-financed mobile support teams. However, given the weak capacity currently present in
most woredas, project support in these areas would begin in more capable woredas and phased in
gradually.
Component 2. Pastoral Risk Management
This component includes a comnmunity-based early warning system which will build upon ongoing efforts
by DPPC and NGOs to establish, at the woreda level the collection and analysis of basic household
welfare data using a survey instrument designed for the primarily pastoral production system. Using
part-time data monitors at the kebele/community level, woredas would be able to compile and analyze
trends in household and environmental conditions in discrete areas. Regions would tilen receive these
reports, which would assist in planning and ultimately the implementation of a better system of targeting
early reaction to declines in the welfare of pastoralist communities. The component would begin in year
one in the focus project woredas, but as the early warning system should be region wide as soon as
possible, it should scale up to all pastoral woredas in the three Regions. In the Drought Contingency
Planning subcomponent, the project will invest in capacity building at woreda and regional levels to
prepare drought contingency plans, monitor local disaster indicators, and manage funds made available
for drought response, primarily from other donors and government, but also with small amounts made
available under the project. This should result in improved response as a result of the implementation of
appropriate disaster and drought mitigation, management, and recovery activities. As this process is
intensive in terms of human capacity, the project would only aim to produce functioning drought
contingency plans for the initial focus woredas. Finally, the Drought Preparedness and Contingency
Fund would provide the initial thirty woredas with development grants to finance activities identified in
their contingency plans. It is expected that woreda level drought contingency plans would include both
investments to better mitigate drought, such as small feeder roads, improved water management, fodder
banks, and range improvement, as well as funds set aside for rapid response, such as destocking, water
tankering, response to human and animal disease outbreaks, and the like. An acceptable contingency



3
ISDS
plan, including documentation of the participatory process and environmental assessment, if applicable,
would be a condition for release of fund resources. A relatively small portion of this Fund would be
earmarked to jump-start investments in critical infrastructure identified in the regional inventory,
however it is expected that other government and donor resources would be the prime source of funds for
major infrastructure investments. Investments could include roads, livestock water points (based on
catchment management plans), flood control structures, grain stores and electronic communication
systems. Local labor would be employed and paid, providing an injection of cash into the local economy.
Component 3. Project support and policy reform
This component will provide operational support and training resources to the project coordination unit
(PCU) in Addis Ababa and implementation units in the three Regions. The project support and
coordination subcomponent would ensure that the (PCU) would effectively perform the following
functions: (i) fiduciary obligations, (ii) policy analysis and liaison with stakeholder groups; (iii)
multi-sectoral coordination at the federal level; (iv) project communication; (v) aggregate project
monitoring; and (vi) mobilization of technical backstopping. The monitoring and evaluation
subcomponent would finance the information management system and project liaison activities. This
would comprise (i) a Management Information System; and (ii) a system that combines community
derived impact assessment of micro-projects with a system that tracks pastoral livelihoods at the woreda
and regional level. The M&E would be able to provide timely feedback to program management on how
well interventions are reaching the intended beneficiaries and how effectively the project resources are
being used, in order that rapid corrective action can be taken if necessary. The communication program
includes development and dissemination of information concerning program activities, approaches and
results, using a variety of media It is envisaged that extensive use of radio networks would be made for
public awareness creation, for the transmission of technical messages, and for the sharing of experiences
The policy analyses and reform sub-component would address policy and institutional reforms that
would strengthen pastoral livelihoods and reduce risk (see the following section), and would consist
mainly on targetted studies, training, and outreach activities.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The primary target population for PCDP is poor pastoral and agropastoral communities in the Afar,
Somali, Oromia and Southern regions. Other, smaller concentrations of pastoralists in locations such as
in Gambella and Benshangul-Gumz Regions would be engaged in the later phases of project
implementation. The project is expected to have a positive impact on the income and well being of what
could potentially be several million people living throughout the rangelands of Ethiopia.
Rangeland degradation, driven by rising human and livestock populations, is increasing in these pastoral
areas of Ethiopia as evidenced by soil loss, bush encroachment, reduced bio-diversity and deforestation
close to urban and refugee concentrations. Traditional range management systems, based on indigenous
knowledge, mobility, reciprocity agreements, fluid boundaries and traditional law are facing new
pressures, which require different institutions, technologies and systems for their redress. Grazing lands
in Ethiopia have, since the early 1900s, been regarded as property of the State. The new 1994
Constitution provides for pastoralists "not to be displaced without their wislh". It does not, however,
provide the by-laws for the protectioni of the rangeland or for compensation for alienated land and
remains underpinned by a strong State sentiment for voluntary pastoralist settlement.

B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The proposed PCDP was rated Category Fl under the World Bank safeguard policy on
environmental assessment. This category is intended for programmatic lending, requiring an environmental
management framework for sub-project screening. Within this, the Sustainable Livelihoods component has
been rated a category B (intended for projects or programs that may result in environmental impacts which
can be easily mitigated and managed) owing to the Community Investment Fund.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Environmental Assessment.
An Environmental Assessment Management Framework (EAMF) for the PCDP was prepared in
November/December 2002. An assessment of the components to be financed under the PCDP indicates
that the Project is not anticipated to result in significant adverse impacts.
Of the three proposed components, the Sustainable Livelihoods component has the most positive
environmental intentions as it aims to provide communities with support to articulate their priority needs
in a local development planning process, working with Mobile Support Teams. Micro-projects derived
from these plans will be financed through the Community Investment Fund (CIF) provided that they are
prepared in a participatory manner, in accordance with project guidelines (technical and environmental),
and contingent upon a community contribution (in cash or in kind) to demonstrate commitment. A third
sub-component will strengthen and enhance the responsiveness of core support services to the needs and
priorities of pastoral communities. Although it is not possible to establish precisely what the
environmental impacts of these subprojects will be at this stage, it is not anticipated that the impacts will
be adverse as the projects will be small in scale (grants of approximately US$6,000 per community) and
geographically dispersed. Moreover, a component of the EAMF is the provision of an environmental
screening and appraisal process which will be used to evaluate subprojects prior to their appraisal.
The Pastoral Risk Management component (formerly called Disaster Preparedness) includes a
commtuntty-based early warning system, which will build upon ongoing efforts by the DPPC and NGOs



5
ISDS
to establish, at the woreda level, the collection and analysis of basic household welfare data. The system
would rely on community-provided and monitored indicators, which would then feed into improved
contingency plans and response mechanisms at the regional level. The component would begin in the
focus project woredas but would scale up to all pastoral wvoredas in the three regions, thus improving the
existing system. In Drought Contingency Planning, the project would invest in capacity building at
woreda and regional levels to prepare drought contingency plans, monitor local indicators, and manage
funds made available for preparedness and initial drought response. The drought preparedness and
contingencyfund would provide the initial thirty woredas with development grants to finance activities
identified in their contingency plans The majority of fund resources would be dedicated to long-term
preparedness interventions. A small amount would be earmarked to jump-start initial mitigation activities
in the event of severe drought. As with the case of the Community Investment Fund (CIF), there are
potential minimal environmental risks associated with activities to be financed under this Fund. Hence,
the proposed environmental screening and appraisal process will be used to assess these subprojects and
to recommend mitigation measures to address them prior to appraisal.
The Project Support and Policy Reform component will provide operational support and training
resources to the PCU and RSTs. The project support and coordination subcomponent would cover
activities of these units as described above. Monitoring and evaluation would finance the information
management system and project liaison activities. The policy analyses and reform sub-component would
address policy and institutional reforms that would strengthen pastoral livelihoods and reduce risk. There
are no negative environmental impacts associated with this component. In fact, this component will also
support the environmental training and capacity building which has been recommended under the EAMF
(refer to Table 8.2, Environmental Management Plan.)
Other safeguards:
As discussed above, it is not likely that the Project will result in significant environmental impacts
particularly if the recommended mitigation measures are implemented, and the screening process
provided is used effectively during subproject identification and appraisal. Moreover, since the precise
location of subprojects is yet to be determined, it is not certain at this stage whether a number of other
safeguards will be triggered. Implications of these safeguards have been incorporated, to a certain extent,
in the Environmental Management Plan (refer to Table 8.2 in the EAMF).
* Natural habitats: Pastoral areas encompass some natural habitats which are protected by law, such as
the Awash and Yangudi Rasa National Parks (Afar), Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary (Borana), and the
Babille Wildlife Sanctuary (Somali). It is conceivable that the project may operate in woredas that
include or border upon these areas, or other areas that qualify as natural habitats under OP 4 36 As a
contingency, the EAMF has provided measures in the screening process to identify the potential for
impacts on natural habitats During early project implementation, the PCDP must establish, with the
help of the Environmental Protection Agency, an working definition to identify natural habitats and
thus ensure that the project interventions will not impact them negatively.
*   Forestry. Forests are not a common feature of lowland areas. As a contingency, the EAMF has
provided measures in the screening process to identify the potential for impacts on forests (for
example, the use of bush for charcoal or fuelwood) which would require a formal environmental
review. Therefore this safeguard policy is not triggered.
*   Pest management: Promotion of rainfed and/or irrigated farming, where feasible and profitable, is
part of promoting sustainable livelihoods, and may indirectly involve use of pesticides. In addition, it
is conceivable that project funds would be used for animal pesticides directly or indirectly (such as
construction of livestock dips). Again, the EAMF has provided measures in the screening process to
identify the potential for impacts and, if triggered, then an Integrated Pest Management Plan will be



6
ISDS
required during project implementation to ensure compliance with the World Bank's policy.
*   Culturalproperty. Unlike many areas in the highlands, there are few areas in pastoral areas that
constitute cultural property in the sense described in OP 11 03. Where they might occur,
micro-projects would be unlikely to involve excavation or inundation. Furthermore, the project
activities will be carried out only in areas selected by the local citizens in the pastoral zones, who
would give great importance to safeguarding their cultural property. Therefore, this safeguard policy
is highly unlikely to be applicable.
*   Indigenouspeoples: As an integrated set of "regional projects", the PCDP will be implemented by
and with the pastoral peoples that form the dominant society in the project areas They will be the
beneficiaries of the project investment. Therefore, they cannot be regarded as "indigenous peoples"
in World Bank terms, i.e. social groups distinct from the dominant society that are vulnerable to
being disadvantaged by the project. Therefore, this safeguard policy is not applicable.
*   Involuntary resettlement. The project will not be causing or promoting involuntary resettlement. As a
demand-driven project, decisions about movement or settlement will be made by the pastoral groups
themselves, either as a normal part of the dynamics of pastoral households or as a decision of the
clan or subclan in the process of their own development planning. Furthermore, given the vast
amounts of land available to pastoralists and land's low marginal cost, any small parcels acquired
through the construction of micro-projects (such as a school or health post) are unlikely to impose a
significant cost to a pastoral community. Therefore, this safeguard policy is not applicable.
*   Safety of dams This project will not finance large investments aimed at dam construction and is in
accordance with this safeguard policy.
*   Projects in international waters- This principle applies specifically to irrigation with water use from
international waterways or which risks polluting them. The project does not foresee extensive use of
irrigation water or practices which would pollute water sources and therefore this policy is not
triggered.
* Projects in disputed areas PCDP does not foresee any possible activities in disputed areas and is in
accordance with this safeguard policy.
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
There are likely to be many community micro-projects which may in some areas create cumulative
impacts on environmental resources Examples are:
* Deforestation due to the exploitation of timber resources, e.g from use of poles and timber in
small-scale construction;
*   Impacts on groundwater from, for example, the construction of numerous shallow wells;
* Large scale resettlement (or more than 200 people, as defined by the World Bank's Operational
Policy OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement) due to the acquisition of land for the construction of
schools, health centers, cereal banks, hand pumps, etc;
* Waste and dumping sites due to the inappropriate disposal of waste materials during construction.
Consideration of these impacts in the project design will provide the PCDP with an opportunity to learn
how to avoid or mitigate localized impacts from initial micro-projects, so that measures can be integrated
into subsequent activities.
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.



7
ISDS
The location of certain small-scale activities such as roads, reservoirs and small-scale dams (proposed
under the Drought Contingency and Preparedness Fund) might also have strategic impacts, which
require a more detailed assessment. Unlike schools, health centers, or fodder banks, infrastructure such as
a road requires an assessment of the location and design to take into account the potential impacts that
the road may may have on natural resources (soil erosion, encroachment on protected areas, changes to
surface run-off, dust, etc) and on the social environment (mobility of communities, migration of people,
introduction of diseases, etc). Water resource developments in particular must also be assessed for their
strategic impacts particularly in terms of their location in relation to wet season grazing areas,
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
To address these potential strategic impacts, detailed assessments will be carried out for such
developments. For policy reform activities (ie, strategies for bush control, and unlicensed transportation
of charcoal), a strategic EA should be carried out in consultation with the relevant stakeholders prior to
the policy being appraised by the Government of Ethiopia.
Il.D 3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Government of Ethiopia and the implementing agency, the Ministry of Federal Affairs, will
be responsible for ensuring that the measures recommended under the Environmental
Management Plan are implemented. Responsibilities as they related to training, capacity
building, supervision of mitigation measures for micro-projects, and monitoring and evaluation
are described in detail in the EAMF.
Il.D.4 Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Stakeholder consultation was one of the key methods used to achieve the EA objectives. An intensive
schedule of interviews with individuals and groups of stakeholders was carried out. A typical agenda of a
meeting would include an introduction of participants, a brief overview of the project, views and
comments of the participants, and specific questions from the EA team regarding the details of
environmental and social sensitivities, people's interaction with the environment, and potential impacts
of the project. Key stakeholders consulted on the project included-
*   Milistry of Agriculture Pastoral Extension Team, and other relevant federal government
agencies;
* Regional bureaus;
*   Woreda and kebele administrations;
*   Pastoralists in Afar, Oromia (Borana zone), and Somali regions;
* Environmental NGOs;
*   Research institutes;
* International development agencies, and staff of agency-funded projects.
During two visits to Ethiopia in October and November 2002, the EA team conducted a series of
interviews and workshops with stakeholders and key informants in Addis Ababa, and the above pastoral
areas of Ethiopia. The first trip in October included meetings with stakeholders and key informants in
Addis Ababa, and a field trip to Afar. During the second visit to Ethiopia in November, the EA team
worked in close cooperation with the World Bank pre-appraisal mission, and with consultants working
on the preparation of the project implementation manual. Limited meetings were held with the
consultants working on the institutional assessment, and monitoring and evaluation. Field trips were
made to both Borana in Oromia region and the Somali region.
