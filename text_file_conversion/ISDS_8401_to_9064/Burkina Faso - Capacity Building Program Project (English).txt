components 2-5). Six windows would be opened by the credit. Completion of phase 1, adoption
of a strategic plan and establishment of a multi-year capacity building work-program agreeable to
all parties (Government and IDA), would condition access to the other windows. An additional
window (performance award: component 6) is envisaged for those participating ministries that
succeeded in reaching planned outcomes of their capacity building program and in improving
service delivery performance. Eligibility criteria will be determined with Government during
project preparation and reflected in the project implementation manual should agreement be
