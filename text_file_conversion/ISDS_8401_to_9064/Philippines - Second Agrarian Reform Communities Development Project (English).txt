I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The overall goal of the project is to reduce rural poverty and enhance the quality of life of the
target beneficiaries, comprising primarily of agrarian reform beneficiaries, landless farmers and
farm workers. The main objective of the proposed project is to significantly raise household
incomes and the quality of life of targeted Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs) by improving
their productive assets, rural infrastructure and access to key support services. This would be done
by supporting the second phase of the Agrarian Reform Communities Development Project
(ARCDP) which would consolidate, sustain and broaden the reach of the gains made in
community development and in the provision of support services. Coverage would include both
finishing off critical infrastructure investments in a few late-starting ARCs which were covered
by ARCDP I and implementing the program on about 80 new ARCs. Support for the ARCs would
be provided through a number of activities, namely: (i) community development and capacity
building; (ii) rural infrastructure development; (iii) agriculture and enterprise development, (iv) a
capacity building program to facilitate rural financial services, and (v) provision of individual
land titles.
I.A.3. Project Description:
(a)    Community Development and Capacity Building. Provision of technical assistance and
training to strengthen: (i) the capacities and roles of the key organizations that would provide
essential infrastructure and support services to the target beneficiaries; and (ii) the ARCs and their
organizations in a manner that will ensure effective participation in planning, implementation and
maintenance of community-driven initiatives.
(b)    Rural Infrastructure. Provision of essential rural infrastructure which would contribute
directly to sustaining increases in rural incomes of the target beneficiaries based on a community

demand driven approach. The infrastructure would include rural roads and bridges, small-scale
irrigation, potable water supply systems, post-harvesting facilities and social buildings.
(c)    Land Titling. The provision of land surveying and titling services to enable community
titles to be broken into individual land titles in those areas where there are no disputes on
individual ownership and the ARBs themselves wish to have individual titles.
(d)   Agricultural and Enterprise Development. Provision of strategic support services to
participating ARCs to help generate viable increases in agricultural production and diversification
within and outside agriculture. The main activities would include: (i) provision of improved
agricultural technologies and related training; (ii) strengthening organizations, including
cooperatives their access to sustainable rural finance; (iii) strengthening of joint ventures and
market linkages; (iv) provision of improved land tenure and security services to enhance
investment; and (v) development of tree crops, particularly on upland farms under a scheme
whereby the project shares the cost of development with the farmer to the extent of providing
materials for the first two to three years, with the farmer providing labor and land.
(e)    Strengthening Cooperatives and Microfinance Institutions. Provision of training and
support to existing co-operatives and to the development of new co-operatives, and to
encouraging the involvement of microfinance institutions in the ARCs with the aim of increasing
the availability of market-driven rural financial services for both credit and savings.
(f)    Policy Studies.The component would support policy studies including: (i) analysis and
options to enhance sustainability of ARCs including generation of exit strategies and plans for
sustainability; and (ii) analysis of land-related taxes and tax administration at LGU level, and
options to generate more revenue to support LGU participation in agrarian reform and
development.
The management and implementation of these components would be assisted by the financing of
project management and implementation support. Technical assistance and services would be
provided to local govemment units and ARCs to prepare development and investment plans,
feasibility studies, packages of subprojects, detailed engineering, procurement and supervision
and monitoring of works. Similar support would be provided at national level to guide and
coordinate implementation of project activities including the registration of individual titles,
provision of credit and micro-finance services, and provision of technical and commercial
services. Furthermore, the project would include financing for project management, monitoring
and evaluation at national level including financial management, planning and procurement.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project will fund small scale infrastructure development, such as farm-to-market-roads,
communal irrigation and village tracks, in the ARCs. Based on the relevant Philippine laws and
legal requirements as well as the Bank's policies and guidelines, the preparation team has
developed guidelines on land acquisition and resettlement in the way of a resettlement policy
framework to assist the LGUs to address any potential issues that may arise under the project.
These guidelines will be included in an updated draft Operations Manual, as was done for
ARCDP 1, during appraisal.
The issue of project impact on indigenous peoples may or may not arise. Nevertheless, project
design has included measures to deal with impacts on indigenous peoples. In cases where ARCs
have indigenous peoples as beneficiaries and/or project interventions would affect areas inhabited
by indigenous peoples and of ancestral domain, the project preparation team has prepared an
Indigenous People's framework and guidelines to assist LGUs in the development of indigenous
peoples development plan and will have them incorporated in the draft Operations Manual.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
NA
II.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

IL.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The guidelines and screening procedures will be included in an updated draft Operations Manual,
as was done for ARCDP I, during appraisal. At project launch and during project
implementation, orientation and training will be provided to project staff on the policy
frameworks and on how to screen for and implement mitigation activities, if required. Monitoring
of safeguard issues is included in the M&E plan and in regular project reporting. Bank
supervision will include review of safeguard.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Extensive consultation was undertaken during preparation of the policies. The policies have been
disclosed at the InfoShop, WBOM Information Center and at the Office of the Department of Agrarian
Reform. Pamphlets on safeguard policies will be part of the information dissemination package for
project beneficiaries. The policies include a very strong consultation and participation component,
especially for the Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
