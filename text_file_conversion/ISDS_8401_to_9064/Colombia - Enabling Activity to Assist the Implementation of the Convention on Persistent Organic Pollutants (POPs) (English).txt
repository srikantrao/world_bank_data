Project Objectives (From PDS)
The objectives of the project are: (i) to prepare a National Implementation Plani (NIP); (ii) to build capacity support
for Enabling Activities; and (iii) to help develop indicators for incremental costs through the application and test of
techniques for cleaning POPs-contaminated sites.
Project Description (From PDS)
The project will support the preparation of a National Implementation Plan for management of POPs in Colombia.
To that end, the following activities will be conducted: (i) evaluation and improvement of the current knowledge
base, including inventories of sources of POPs, determination of contaminated sites, and definition of baseline
levels of the contamninants in the country; (ii) assessment of economic, environmental and health-related impacts;
(iii) evaluation of existing institutional and regulatory framework; and (iv) identification of priorities for handling
POPS. In addition, the project will contribute to the strengthening of the national institutional capacity in the
subject of POPs by sponsoring seminars, workshops and training activities for stakeholders around the country.
Lastly, the project will assess the applicability of current POPs remediation technologies in a developing country
environment, including accepted practices, technical capacity, cost effectiveness, and incremental costs.
The first and second components of the project will be funded by the GEF, as provided by Article 7 of the
Convention on POPs. The pilot study component of the Enabling Activities will be mostly funded with resources
from the Canadian Trust Fund on POPs; GEF will fund assessment of geological (including soils), climatic, and
hydrological (including hydrogeology) characteristics of areas selected.for remediation pilots of POP-contaminated
sites.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
aresa and populauton hlke[3 to he affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will primarily consist of studies and technical assistance activities. A pilot study component, which
includes clean-up activities in three POP-contaminated sites will be conducted, but the specific location of the sites
has not yet been deterrnined.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Although the focus of the project is environmental, it primarily involves studies and technical assistance activities
and will not implement any adaptation measures. However, the last component of the project consists of a pilot
study of remediation technologies applicable to POPs. For that purpose, three contaminated sites will be identified,
where the following activities will be conducted: of 1) environmental assessment of the site to determine the extent
of contamination; 2) economic assessment of potential remediation technologies; and 3) pilot demonstrations of
remediation methods for the mitigation/elimination of POPs. The fu-st and third activities of the pilot study will
likely involve handling of pesticides.
All activities pertaining the pilot study will be carried out following the Bank's Environmental Assessment and Pest
Management Safeguard Policies OP 4.01 and OP 4.09, respectively.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. Describe any
potential cumulative or long term impacts.
No large-scale impact is expected from the pilot study component. Remediation activities are intended as
demonstrations and they will be conducted at a small scale and in a contained manner.
3. In light of 1 and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Activities to be conducted are of remediation and therefore they will be addressing and eliminating existing
contamination issues.
4. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The locations of the three sites for the pilot study have not yet been determ-ined and therefore no specific
arrangements have been made with the government of Colombia to address potential safeguard issues. However, a
manual will be developed for the pilot study component of the project, in which the Bank's requirements for
environmental assessments, as well as the procedures for the handling of pesticides will be clearly outlined.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The environmental category assigned to this project is C and therefore no disclosure procedures are required.
.         ~~                   ~~~~~r  .
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[X] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[I I S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically-,and institutionally manageable
J I S3. - No safeguard issues
[ ] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
