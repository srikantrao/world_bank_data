Project Objectives
-   Strengthen the capacity of the NBI institutions to execute basinwide programs
-   Ensure effective oversight and coordination of the NBI's Shared Vision Program
Project Description
The NBI, through its executive arm the NBI Secretariat (Nile-SEC), is the executing agency for the Shared
Vision Program, which includes seven multi-sectoral, technical assistance type projects to be implemented
in the Nile Basin countries. Recognizing the need to strengthen NBI institutions to effectively oversee and
coordinate this complex, basinwide program, it was agreed at the 9th Annual Nile Council of Ministers
Meeting (February 2002, Cairo) to establish an eighth SVP 'project' to be referred to as the SVP
Coordination Project.
The present ISDS will describe the activities within the SVP Coordination Project which is attached to the
present Shared Vision Program Master PAD. Separate PADs and ISDSs are being prepared for the seven
basin-wide projects':
* Nile Transboundary Environmental Action- P0700073
* Nile Basin Regional Power Trade - P075945
* Efficient Water Use for Agricultural Production - P075946
* Water Resources Planning and Management- P075947
* Confidence-Building and Stakeholder Involvement (Communication) - P075948
* Applied Training - P075949
* Socio-Economic Development and Benefit-Sharing - P075949
The SVP Coordination Project is to establish, train and support a small coordination unit at the NBI
Secretariat in Entebbe to coordinate the program and put in place generic procedures to ensure quality
control and fiduciary responsibility. The SVP coordination unit will also be responsible for monitoring and
evaluation at the program level and for facilitating information sharing within the NBI and with the public.
Project components
Component I - Program Coordination - This component will establish and operate, within the existing
Nile Basin Initiative Secretariat at Entebbe, Uganda, the Shared Vision Program Coordination Unit.
Project activities will facilitate the start-up of and coordination among the seven SVP Projects as well as
monitoring and oversight of the execution of those projects.
The cited Project Identification numbers may change upon NBTF activation and project effectiveness.



Component 2- Financial Management and Procurement - This component will finance the consultants
and software necessary to strengthen the NBI Institutions' capacity to manage and oversee the financial
management and procurement activities required of a basin-wide project. It will also fund the annual audit
of the SVP Coordination and Facilitation Project.
Component 3 - Knovledge Management and Information Sharing - This component will finance the
software and consultants necessary to provide key SVP stakeholders with improved access to relevant
information as well as enhanced abilities to communicate with one another. Project activities will facilitate
the establishment of basin-wide SVP communication email/internet, establish and maintain an electronic
knowledge base, an SVP Website, and a repository for resources and documents at the NBI Secretariat.
Component 4- Monitoring and Evaluation - This component will finance the establishment and
operation of a Monitoring and Evaluation matrix for the overall SVP.
Component 5 - Training - This component will coordinate and implement a basin-wide training program
to strengthen the capacity of the NBI Institutions to manage and oversee regional projects and to provide
basic knowledge to regional suppliers and service providers to facilitate their participation in such regional
projects.
Expected Outputs
*   Effective coordination of the overall of SVP projects and improved capacity of the NBI
Institutions to manage basin-wide programs.
*   Development, within the NBI Institutions, of permanent financial management and procurement
system that meet international standards.
*   Establishment of an SVP Website and ongoing information sharing and knowledge management
for NBI activities.
*   The development and implementation of a Monitoring and Evaluation matrix for the overall SVP.
*   Training in the management requirements for regional projects for NBI officials and staff, as well
as other key public and private sector stakeholders.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas ) The project is building capacity at the Nile Basin Secretariat in
Entebbe, Uganda, to coordinate and execute the Shared Vision Program activities. There will be no physical
interventions in the project.

Shared Vis ion Program. It has attached to it a small project component, the SVP Coordination Facilitation
Project. The objective of this Project is to strengthen the Nile Basin Initiative and in particular its
Secretariat to coordinate and execute the Shared Vision Program (separate PADs and ISDSs for each SVP
project are being prepared and will be reviewed by the Bank's Africa Safeguards team). The SVP is
designed to enhance capacity, build trust and provide an enabling environment for cooperation between the
Nile Basin countries. The SVP is anticipated to significantly strengthen the ability of the Nile Basin
countries to cooperatively manage their resources in a sustainable way according to their Shared Vision "to
achieve sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the
common Nile Basin water resources".
