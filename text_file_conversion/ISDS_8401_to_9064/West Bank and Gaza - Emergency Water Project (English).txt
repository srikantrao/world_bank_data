I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The main objective of the project is to alleviate pressing shortages in water supply services in the southern
area of the West Bank by supporting strategic investments in water conveyance and distribution networks
I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The proposed project would finance on a grant basis critical components of the Palestinian Water Authority
priority emergency investment program, where water sources are already available and would be quickly
conveyed and distributed to consumers. More specifically the project would finance: (i) Equipping the
existing East Herodian #2 (EH#2) well; (ii) Installation of East Herodian and the Halhoul-Kharas pipelines
that would convey the additional water from EH#2 through the southern area of the West Bank; and (iii)
Installation and rehabilitation of the Kharas and Nuba water distnbution networks, which are considered
high priority municipalities and villages seriously affected by water shortages.
I.A.4. Project Location. The project area covers the southern part of the West Bank.
Bl. Check Environmental Classification A [ 1, B [XI, C [ ], Fl [ ], TBD []
Comments: No major negative environmental impacts are envisaged since the project will invest in
activities that support rehabilitation and improvements of infrastructure and service delivery. No land
acquisition is required and the works will be constructed through the public right of way. Potential
negative impacts that are localized and limited in nature will be avoided by providing instructions in the
contract documents that specifically address environmental issues in a manner acceptable to the Bank, as
well as following Good Management Practices during construction. Given the above justification, this
project falls into environmental classification "B" in accordance with World Bank Operational Policy 4 01
(January 1998) and requires the preparation and implementation of an Environmental Management Plan
(EMP).
