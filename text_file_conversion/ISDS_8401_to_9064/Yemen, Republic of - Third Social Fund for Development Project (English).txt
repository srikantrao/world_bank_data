Project: RY-SOCIAL FUND FOR DEVELOPMENT III                   Task Team Leader: Yasser El-Gammal

                                                              infrastructure (P)


I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project would enhance poor and vulnerable communities' access to social and economic services,
continue to build capacity for civil society institutions, selected local governments, selected central
government agencies and local consultants and contractors. The project will also continue to support
income generating activities to a number of economically active poor and vulnerable communities.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project will build on the success of the first two phases of the SFD. It will support the SFD to
continue to use participative approaches in delivering social services in an effective manner, focusing on
the sustainability of these activities, and the capacity building of local communities, NGOs, and selected
government agencies to enhance the way development is done in Yemen. The project will also support
the on-going decentralization process by: a) reorienting the approach the SFD uses to identify and
appraise projects to ensure full consultations with local councils, b) providing basic orientations to local
councils to ensure that they are familiar with basic concepts like community participation and project
formulation, and c) piloting the use of local councils as project intermediaries similar to the SFD's
integrated interventions.

The project will have three main components, similar to SFD II project:

1) Community Development: under which the SFD will continue to support small demand-driven social
and economic infrastructure sub-projects in rural and urban slum areas;

2) Micro Finance: under which the SFD will continue to support activities that enhance the economic
status of the economically active poor and vulnerable. During preparation, the SFD will assess whether
business support services can be introduced under this component; and

3) Capacity Building Activities: under which the SFD will continue to support activities that build the
capacity of local NGOs, cooperatives, selected governmental agencies, local contractors as well as the
capacity of the SFD itself. This component also supports the operational cost of the SFD.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social

                                                                                                          ISDS



characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The nature of this project, as in the first two SFDs, means that exact locations of project activities are not
determined until well after project launch; therefore, the selection and appraisal procedures for each
sub-project will include a simple questionnaire that will assist SFD staff to determine if any safeguard issues
exist (see below).


B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: An overall Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was prepared and is being utilized for the
implementation of SFD II. This EMP will be updated during project preparation to include:

a) more rigorous use of safeguards questionnaires early during the preparation of sub-projects;

b) where necessary, preparation of an environmental impact assessment and other safeguard related plans
(resettlement, pest management, etc.) as part of the preparation of sub-projects; and

c) more comprehensive training for SFD staff and clients on safeguards issues.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Impacts are expected to be minor and will be studied before sub-project implementation. A questionnaire
   will be completed so that the potential impacts can be understood and mitigated.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
n/a

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

n/a

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
n/a

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Each sub-project will be screened by SFD staff using a safeguard questionnaire (see B above) to determine
   if any environmental or social safeguard issues are triggered. If so, the SFD will ensure that appropriate
   documents are completed for the sub-project and include the recommendations contained therein in their
   supervision. The Project will also ensure that SFD staff and clients are adequately trained on these
   procedures, the safeguard policies and theory behind them. The Bank Team will spot-check the
   safeguard questionnaires as well as any resulting documents and actions required of the SFD during
   supervision.
   The project will not finance activities that include procurement of pesticides. Although no involuntary
   resettlement is foreseen based on the experience of the last six years, and none will be allowed, a
   resettlement framework will be prepared before appraisal as a protective measure for beneficiaries. The
   project will not be implemented in any area that endangers natural habitats.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders vary by sub-project. In general, they include line ministries, NGOs, local
   communities, local governments...etc. As part of every sub-project appraisal, safeguard policy issues are
   discussed and potential controversial areas are identified, and mitigation arrangements are put together in
   case of any potential negative impacts.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
          in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
          similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
          safeguard issues.
