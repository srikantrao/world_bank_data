I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS)
The proposed adjustment program aims to build on and complement the financial and enterprise sector
reforns already undertaken by the Govemment, supported by the World Bank and the First Private Sector
Adjustment Loan (PSAL 1). The loan will sustain momentum during a pivotal period in the economy and
seek to deepen and strengthen the reforms initiated under PSAL I by pursuing reforms in five key areas: i)
the financial sector, ii) the state enterprise sector, iii) the energy sector, iv) business environment, and v)
social protection and poverty reduction.



I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS)
The development objectives for each of the projects five main components are described below.
i) Financial Sector Reform
Objective: The exit of public banks from govermment ownership through privatization and other
options acceptable to the Bank. This will be accompanied by a series of measures to strengthen the
overall environment for private sector-based banking and financial sector modemization.
ii) Privatization
Objective: Divestiture of the largest public sector industrial and commercial loss-makers from the
government portfolio. This will be accompanied by other measures to complete privatization of pools
of enterprises and joint ventures, to ensure that procedures and practices related to privatization
transactions are transparent, fair and properly scrutinized-and that the residual effects of privatization
do not serve as an obstacle to future privatization transactions as needed.
iii) Energy Sector Reform
Objective: Modemization of the energy sector to introduce modem management principles and sound
regulation to ensure that utility companies (e.g., electricity, gas) are not used as a source of cross-
subsidization and soft credit (through arrears) that forestalls needed restructuring of enterprises. This
will be accompanied by the adoption of the necessary legal and regulatory framework for private
sector participation, increasing prices towards cost recovery levels, ensuring consistency and
transparency in tariff structures, and increasing collections for sustainable operations, needed
reinvestment, and higher quality service delivery.
iv) Business Environment
Objective: Strengthening of the business environment by establishing an appropriate unified corporate
income tax law that is non-distortionary in its incentive structure and establishes a level playing field
with regard to investment. This will be accompanied by the removal of administrative barriers that
impede investment and trade, the removal of most special funds for fiscal consolidation and
transparency, the consolidation and redefinition of the role of the financial guard and economic police
to rationalize fiscal operations in a more accountable manner, and a strengthening of accounting,
governance and bankruptcy standards and practices for a more competitive private sector-oriented
economy.
v) Social Protection
Objective: Providing meaningful social protection for those displaced by restructuring and
privatization.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project is country-wide; there are no specific environmental impacts expected.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The enviromnental concerns about the project are minimal and primarily relate to the privatizations of the
largest state-owned enterprises. The govermnent, however, has already taken some important measures to
ensure adequate environmental safeguards and minimize potential impact of the privatizations. These
measures are detailed below in section II. D. 3

ll.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Based on recommendations from the World Bank, the Government of Romania has adopted a number of
important measures to ensure adequate environmental safeguards under PSAL2. The measures clearly
demonstrate the Government's commitment to integrating environmental considerations into the
privatizations of its largest enterprises through environmental audits. They also coincide with the
Government's aggressive efforts to meet the environmental standards for EU accession.
Environmental Safeguard Measures
The following factors strengthen the Govermment's position to address the main enviromnental concerns
under PSAL2:
I. The government has amended its privatization legislation to comply with environmental safeguards
in accordance with EU legislation. The amendments were completed as a condition under PSAL I.
*   The privatization legislation regulates environmental obligations as a mninimum set of obligations,
incumbent on a company that is to be privatized and the obligation to conform with laws regarding
the environmnental protection. The public institution responsible for the privatization such as the
Authority for Privatization and Management of State Ownership (APAPS) or line ministry must
include these obligations in the presentation file or in the public offer prospectus. Such liabilities
are set by the enviromnental authority, based upon an environmental assessment.
*   In the case such liabilities have not been disclosed in the presentation file or in the public offer, the
public institutions involved must compensate the buyer, or the company, as appropriate, for the
damages incurred.
2. The RFPs and TORs for privatizations under PSAL2 include environmental safeguards.
*   As under PSAL I, the RFPslTORs for the investment banks to provide advisory services
throughout the privatization process include requirements related to environmental safeguards.
The due diligence report for the privatization also requires a review of the environmental impact
of the enterprise plants and operations.
*   Because most companies need to remedy the envirommental impact of their activities, the
privatization advisor is required to secure the assistance of environmental experts in order to
assess environmnental obligations and effectively negotiate liabilities during sales negotiations.
X   In accordance with the Govemment's privatization plan, advisors work with APAPS to carefully
consider buyer indemnification provisions under the law related to environmental liabilities and
disclosure of company information.
*   For the successful sale of the company, the consultant receives a Success Fee of a percent of the
total transaction value. The transaction value includes 50 percent of all investment commitments:
financing, modernization, environmental protection, management, and company development
programs proposed by the buyer for a two (2) year period.
3. The Government is benefitingfrom substantial support and technical assislancefrom the EU to
protect the environment and support Romania 's cleanup efforts. This support has been closely
coordinated with the PSAL 2 team.
*   The PSAL team closely cooperated with EU in order to identify the most appropriate support for
mitigating the environmental situations of the PSAL companies. Thus, nine companies under
PSAL I (Electroputere, Romvag, IUG, Nitramonia, Siderurgica, Uzinele Sodice, Colorom, Rocar,
Fabrica do Scule) have bocn included into the Phare program Environmental Compliance
Program, amounting to approximately 480,000 EUR. Under this program, the consultants
provided APAPS with Level I and Level 2 assessments, environmental compliance programs, risk
assessments and necessary documents for obtaining the Privatization Certificate.
*   The Environmental Auditor on Retainer 1 (498,000 EUR) is in progress and the Environmental
Auditor on Retainer 2 (850,000 EUR) is expected to start next year. These projects cover many



Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The environmental obligations related to each transaction will be disclosed and discussed with all
stakeholders involved with the privatizations including: the government agencies (APAPS and the line
ministries), consultants and investment bankers who will serve as advisor during the privatization process,
and potential investors.
E. Safeguards Classlkataon (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ I Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[XI S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable.
[I S3. - No safeguard issues
[ SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development fimds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
