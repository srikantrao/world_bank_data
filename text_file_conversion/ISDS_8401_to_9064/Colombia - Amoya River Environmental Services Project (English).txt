Unit will support the project through
carbon emission reduction credits valued at
US$17.8 million over the life of the
__ _  project.
Project Objectives (From PDS)
The development objective of the Rio Amoya Environmental Services Project (Amoya
Project, or AP) is to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
the power sector in Colombia through the promotion of a 78 MW run of river generation
facility. The project is expected to displace an estimated 8.78 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e) over an initial period of 14 years and will also
support an environmental program in support of the protection of the Paramol Las
Hermosas and a social program that will contnbute to improvements in the welfare of the
local community.
The Paramo is a unique wet ecosystem, of the northern Andes region, that appears at altitudes of 3,500 m
and higher; the flora of the Paramo acts as a sponge capturng moisture from the atmosphere and releasing
it in a controlled manner to feed downstream rivers and lakes.



Project Description (From PDS)
The project supports three activities (components)
a) A run of the nver power plant, with a nominal capacity of 78 MW and an
anticipated generation of 546 GWh/year. The turbines and other ancillary facilities will
be installed underground, along one side of the nver, thus minimizing impacts on the
landscape. The po%%er plant will be connected to the grid through an 18km transmission
line. The plant is expected to be in operation by the second half of 2005. Support will be
pro- idedl through the purchase of ghg emission credits.
b) Environment program for protection of the Piramo. The environmental
program will include activities to support the long term sustainability of the ecosystem of
the Paramo region and to divert anthropogenic interventions induced by global warmung
These activities will be developed in consultation with the local community and are
expected to include: i) a green employment, community-driven program that opens and
maintains alternative occupations (reforestation, organic and conservation agriculture,
water sanitation) targeted to improve environmental management in the area; and ii) a
program of environmental education and awareness, on the services and role that the
Paramo plays to sustain livelihoods in the area. Both programs will be outside of the
boundaries of the National Park of Las Hermosas. The environrmental program will be
financed with 10% of the value of the carbon credits and a matching grant from
Conservation International.
c) Social program.    The social program will include activities defined in
consultation with the local community (Municipality of Chaparral) and will be put in
place during construction and the first two years of operation of the plant. The program
will include health, education and other social services designed to improve the quality of
life of the inhabitants in the area of influence of the project. The social program will be
financed with 10% of the value of the carbon credits.
Project Location (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of the
arca and population likely to bc affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or cntical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
The Project will be located in the lower range of the Amoya River. The AMOYA River
Hydroelectric Project, in the municipality of Chaparral (Tolima). The region is
downstream of the Paramo de Las Hermosas, an ecosystem that occurs around the
Amoya River Basin, and the source of the AMOYA River.
The Municipality of Chaparral is located south of the department of Tolima at the
Colombian Central Andes at an altitude ranging from 800m to 4500m. Chaparral has a
population of 41,052 habitants, 51% of which live in urban areas. In the rural areas, the
main activities are agnculture, with the most important crops being coffee, sugar cane,
corn, and cattle.

* Comments:
The project will contribute to sustainable development in various ways:
*   It will demonstrate the potential for run of river facilities as an alternative to standard
hydro and thermal based plants, facilitating the further development of this option in the
country.
*   It will contribute to the reduction in the emissions of local crieria pollutants (such as
NOx, SOx, particulates and volatile hydrocarbons) which would otherwise be released
through thermal-based power generation.  The exposure of populations to these
pollutants has been linked to health effects and associated increases in mortality and
reductions in productivity.
*   It will add to the national private expertise in the installation and operation of on-grid run
of river based power generation technology and strengthen institutional capacities with
regards to national participation in international carbon markets.
*  Through the effective promotion of the run of river option, it will increase technology
diversification in the power sector, enhancing the robustness of the power system and
contributing to the security and reliance of supply.
*   It will demonstrate the potential for valuing environmental services in the region, in
particular through recognition of the role that Paramo ecosystems play in power
generation and facilitate investments in its conservation and protection.
*  Additionally, the Social Program will benefit the local population at the site addressing
key local welfare issues and ensuring ownership and participation of the local
community in the project.
*  Successful implementation will serve as an example of a new form of public-private
partnership and community involvement for economic and social deve opment. Public
funds will be used efficiently to leverage private investment in the energy sector.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Pleasc fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
dcscribe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
1. Descnbe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Pelton turbines with vertical axis and a rated capacity of 39.8 MW each will be used to
generate power making use of the kinetic energy carried by the fast flowing stream and
the potential energy between the entry points and exit points of the tunnel. This will
obviate the need for water storage and the use of reservoirs, therefore avoiding potential
environmental and social impacts in the area. The power unit and the civil works will be.
underground, therefore minimizing any impact on the landscape. A temporary access
road will be constructed to reach the site but it will be reverted to natural landscape after
construction. A transmission line will be built to connect the project site with the
national grid. An environmental impact assessment has been prepared addressing any
potential impact in the region caused by the project. This EIA is under review by the
Bank and will be submitted by end of February 2003.
Regarding social impacts, a preliminary EIA was conducted. Currently, Generadora
Unton is carrying out a detailed social impact assessment. Through this study, those
impact will be identified and assessed deeply. According to the results of this study, a
Social Management Plan will be prepared. In case some of the social safeguards policies
are triggered, adequate measures will be design to comply with the Bank's policies.
2. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irrever§ible impacts.
Describe any potential cumulative or long term impacts.
There are no potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts associated to the
project. There are no potential cumulative impacts. In the long tern, the project will not
change the current trends in land use in the area. On the other hand, thelenvironmental
and social programs are being designed to prevent and ameliorate pressures on the
Paramo ecosystem therefore contributtng to the sustainability of development in the area.
The project will demonstrate the sustainable use of the natural resources in the area,
illustrating the linkages between protection and sustainable use of the resource water for
power generation and the generation of a stream of revenues, created from addressing a
global issue, for the local government for social and environmental programs.
Specifically, the project will improve the welfare of the local community through a social
program targeting health, education and institutional strengthening. Likewise, the project
will support efforts to prevent further degradation of the Paramo ecosystem in the area of
influence of the project through a program of reforestation and support to alternative,
clean and productive, community activities.
3. In light of 1 and 2, descnbe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
The project is being designed as a Clean Development Mechanism Project, seeking
environmental and social sustainability. The alternative selected seeks to maximuze these
benefits.



4. Descnbe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues.
The environmental license was granted on December 16, 1999. It included a water
concession of 50 years. The construction permnit was authonzed on June 27, 2000. The
Environmental review was done and approved by CORTOLIMA. The World Bank is in
the process of reviewing the study. A social assessment serving as the basis for the social
program is also being prepared. A fraction of the carbon revenues will be used to finance
the environmental and social programs.
5 Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclos6re on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
HIDROGER & GENERADORA UNION have carried out a number of workshops and
consultation sin the region. A web site is being opened. The local community has
indicated a strong ownership and support to the project. The social assessment will be
the basis for the social program and will be based on an exhaustive consultation program
with the local community.
