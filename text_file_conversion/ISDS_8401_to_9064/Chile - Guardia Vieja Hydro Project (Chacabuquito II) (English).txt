I.A.2 Project Objectives (From PDS)
The project objective is to construct a hydroelectric plant to reduce dependence on coal and transition
into hydroelectricity, a cleaner fuel source. Thereby, a carbon emissions reduction would result and be sold
as an emission reduction credit in the global market This project would also provide local social benefits
in the form of employment for those in the surrounding villages during construction and beyond
I A 3. Project Description (From PDS)
The Guarda Vieja Project consists of a run-of-the-river power plant of 55 MW capacity that utilizes the
waters of the Aconcagua River and will produce an average gross annual generation of 284 GWh (270
GWh net). The project is being developed by HidrocIctrica Guarda Vieja (HGV) and is located in the 5th
Region administrative division near Los Andes, about 100 km Northeast from Santiago This plant is in the
head of a cascade with three existing other downstream hydropower plants (Chacabuqutto, Los Quilos and
Aconcagua) Guarda Vieja will be connected to the 5th Region's 110 KV sub-system within the SIC and
will generate power for industrial and residential consumers in the 5th Region. The useful life of the
project is over 40 years. The emission reductions will be produced displacing thermal power generation,
mainly coal The project will contribute to the sustainable development of Chile because it will help supply
renewable energy, create jobs, and stimulate economic activity in the Fifth Region with very low
environmental impact.
This project involves technologies well proven in Chile and a simple layout consisting of a small
reseryoir (172 500 m3), two diversion weirs, a system of channels and tunnels, a penstock, and a
powerhouse. Of the total anticipated cost of US$ 62 8 million, US$ 61.0 corresponds to the cost associated
with the hydroelectric plant and related equipment and US$ 1.8 is required for the expansion of the current
110 KV transmission line that connects Chacabuquito, Los Quilos, and the Aconcagua plants
I A 4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or ci itical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas ) Los Andes City. CHILE The hydro plant will be constnicted in the
Aconcagua Valley, 40 km cast of Los Andes City which is approximately 100 km north of Chile's capital city,
Santiago The project site is upstream from the existing Chacabuquito PCF project which is also located on the
Aconcagua River

Comments' Due to the civil works thlat will be utidertakern for this project, it merits a Category B
environmenital rating An environitiental impact assessment will be done of the hydro plant ii the context
of the watershed to assess water quality, sedimient control, stream flow, water balance, etc

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
descnbe steps to be tak-en to obtain necessary data
II D I a Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts
Major adverse environmental impacts from this run-of-river hydro project are not anticipated An
environmental impact assessment (EIA) will be done to determine what aspects of the operation may
require greater attention or monitoring and what additional actions may need to be taken to ensure
sustainability at the watershed scale
II.D lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component
NA
1I D Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
None detected at this point.
1I D 2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
NA
1I D 3 Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The project sponsor has the experience of Chacabuquito I in complying with World Bank safeguards The
EIA will touch on a range of issues, including water flows and balances, watershed-level sustainability,
archaeological chance find procedures, and attention to the welfare of downstream water users as well as
terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora It will conclude with a detailed Environmental Management Plan
including schedule of activities (tailored to project construction and operation schedules), institutional
responsibilities, and budget All construction-related impacts and mitigation measures (including
archaeological chance find procedures) will be included in an environmental manual for contractors which
will be part of bidding and construction contracts
II.D 4 Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people
People in the project area will be apprised of and consulted on the findings of the EIA Additionally, the
World Bank Infoshop and project sponsor will have copies of the EA available upon request
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply
[ ] SI - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts, or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[x ] S2 - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
I[I S3 - No safeguard issues
I I SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
Issues.
