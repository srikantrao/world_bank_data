I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objective of the project is to improve the quality and sustainability of the water supply
and wastewater services in the cities of Termitau, Karaganda and Kokshetau, located in the Nura/Ishim
river basin. The development objective would be achieved through: (a) strategic rehabilitation and
efficiency improvements of existing water and wastewater facilities; and (b) institutional strengthening of
the Nizhny Bief Vodokanal (NBVK) in Termitau, the JSC Vodokanal (JVK) in Karaganda, and
Gorvodokanal (GVK) in Kokshetau, through a performance-based management and operation contract
with an internationally experienced water utility operator (the Operator).
I A.3. Project Description:
Proiect Component 1 - Repair and Rehabilitation Fund (RRF).This component would support essential
short-term expenditures and a least-cost capital investment program aimed at improving operations and
achieving the performance targets in the management contract. The short-term expenditures would
include tools, equipment, computers, and inputs for repairs and maintenance, metering equipment, cars
and vehicles, among other items. A preliminary capital investment program for each city was prepared,
based on a technical assessment that was carried out during preparation. The most optimal investment
program for each city involves rehabilitation of key components of the water and wastewater system,
such as the distribution and collection networks, treatment plant and pumping station efficiency, and also
support demand management. The Operator, will identify on an annual basis, a detailed investment
program for implementation, and will propose how the Repair and Rehabilitation Fund would best be
used to improve efficiency and quality of services and to achieve the management contract targets (for
F1 etlea

example sections of the water distribution network, specific components of the water treatment plant,
pumping stations), as well as specific measures to improve financial management, accounting and other
commercial systems. All annual investments under the Repair and rehabilitation Fund will be subject to
Bank approval and the use of Bank procurement guidelines.
Project Component 2 - Managemenit Contract (M(TCis component would finance costs of the
management contract. These costs include a base fee and a performance based incentive fee to the
Operator, based on achievements of the targets in the Operator's contract. The Operator would have full
responsibility for the management of the utilities' investment program, operating the water supply
systems, developing and implementing the demand management program, managing the personnel and
establishing and managing the commercial (billing and collection) and financial management systems of
the three vodokanals. NBVK, JVK and GVK will continue to operate under their present independent
status as municipally owned enterprises.  The relationship between these vodokanals and the
municipalities is supposed to be at arms-length basis. However, in reality, particularly in the cases of
Karaganda and Kokshetau, the vodokanal decisions are strongly influenced and in many cases
determined by the municipalities. One of the objectives of this project is to change the role of municipal
governments to provide an enabling environment that will give the utilities real autonomy and
opportunities to strengthen their institutional and financial capacity. The involvement of the Operator in
strengthening the vodokanals technical capacity and institutional and financial performance will help in
clearly defining and clarifying the roles and responsibilities of each party in relation to the
municipalities.
Project Component 3 - Engineering designs, Studies, and Supervision of Construction: This component
would finance the preparation of engineering designs and bidding packages for the construction program
and supply of goods financed under the Repair and Rehabilitation Fund. This component would also
finance other construction supervision related to the project activities.
Project Component 4 - Consulting Services and Project Mananagement Uiflhis component would
finance: (a) consulting services to support the Project Management Unit (PMU), including the
incremental operating costs of the PMU; (b) independent technical and financial auditors that would
monitor the Operator's performance in relation to the targets in the management contract; independent
consultants to conduct project audits and financial audits of JVK, GVK, and NBVK and other
consulting and legal advisory services as required; (c) consultants to support institutional and legal
reforms to facilitate the longer-term involvement of the private sector in the provision of water and
wastewater services; and (d) training for PMU and vodokanal staff.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Project Area comprises the three cities of Karaganda,Temirtau, and Kokshetau. Kokshetau,
Karaganda and Temirtau are located in the Northeastern region of Kazakhstan. The regional/municipal
governments of the three cities have four water and wastewater enterprises (Vodokanals) in charge of
water supply and wastewater collection and treatment. These vodokanals serve an estimated 437,000
people in Karaganda, 170,000 in Temirtau, and 104,000 in Kokshetau. The entire population of the
project area that are served by the vodokanals are expected to benefit from the improved water supply
and wastewater service delivery, as well as from other associated positive benefits such as reduction in
water-related diseases and enhanced environmental conditions. Potential negative impacts of the project
activities that would affect the population will be mitigated through the implementation of an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) to be implemented by the Borrower for the project.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
Il.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and Impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts related to the Bank's Safeguards Issues
are expected to result from the project.
Environmental Assessment
The project is expected to result in significant environmental and health benefits, such as: improvements
in public health through better quality and improved availability of treated water; enhanced
environmental conditions as a result of more reliable wastewater treatment; reduction in flood frequency
and associated inconvenience and costs of damage repair; and economic benefits resulting from both
construction related activities and improved water supply and wastewater services.
Potential negative environmental issues relating to project implementation, operation of the water supply
and wastewater systems, and envisaged rehabilitation works under the Repair and Rehabilitation
Programme, have been identified, and include: (i) socioeconomic issues relating to decreased
affordability of services in view of tariff increases; (ii) changes in employment involving both Vodokanal
staff and construction workers; (iii) effects on long term water supply sustainability in view of increased
demand; (iii) health and safety of workers; (iv) fuel and chemical storage; (v) construction impacts such
as waste generation, soil compaction and erosion, habitat disturbance, and socioeconomic inconveniences
such as noise, dust, and traffic disruption; and (vi) general environmental impacts such as changes in
composition and volume of wastewater discharges, changes in abstraction levels and concentration, and
rise in groundwater levels. These impacts are however not expected to be significant, and can be
mitigated through good construction and utility operation practices. Technical capacity of the operator to
carry out a good environmental analysis and management will be a prerequisite. A comprehensive
Environmental Management Plan has been developed for the project to mitigate these potential impacts,
and will be implemented and closely monitored throughout the project.
Involuntary Resettlement
The project is not envisaged to entail expansion of existing facilities or construction of new structures of



5
ISDS
any significant size, hence will neither require resettlement of people nor extra land acquisition.
Construction works shall typically entail pipe replacement, which would include pavement demolition,
trench excavation, pipe-laying, trench refilling and pavement application,all of which will take place in
rights of way owned by the vodokanals or the local government. Other construction works will be limited
to rehabilitation of existing structures such as pumping stations and specific parts of water and
wastewater treatment plants. All works under the repair and rehabilitation program are expected to be of
rehabilitation nature, in properties owned by the respective vodokanals or rights of way assigned to
municipal infrastructure. Temporary disturbance to the population inhabiting areas adjoining the civil
works sites, and site personnel, during construction, including noise, dust, restricted access, interruption
of traffic flow, and vibration will be mitigated through implementation of provisions in the EMP.
International Waterways
The OP 7.50 applies to the Project as the cities of Karaganda, Temirtau, and Kokshetau are located on
international waterways as defined by paragraph I (a) of OP 7.50. However, considering the nature of the
project activities and focus, the exception to the external notification requirements of OP 7.50, set forth
in paragraph 7(a) of OP 7.50 is fully applicable. The Project involves rehabilitation of ongoing schemes
and construction that in the team's judgement: (i) will not adversely change the quality or quantity of
water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the other riparians' water use.
A memorandum was prepared by the legal department and Bank's management to seek their no objection
to the determination made by the project team that the Project falls within the exceptions to the
notification requirement under Paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy.
Il.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No significant cumulative impacts are expected to result from implementation of the project.
II.D.Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No significant long term negative impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area have
been identified.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable.
Il.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The necessary environmental mitigation measures needed to minimize potential negative impacts to the
environment associated with the project and rehabilitation activities of NBVK, GVK and JVK will be the
responsibility of the Operator, and a contractual obligation under the management contract. The PMU
will be responsible for monitoring compliance. The Bank will supervise the monitoring efforts.
ILD.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders for the project are the beneficiary populations, the national, regional and local
government bodies, and non governmental organizations. The main institutions responsible for
environmental and water resources management in Kazakhstan are the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Public Health, and the Anti-monopoly
Committee also have some responsibility for water resources management. Inter-agency coordination,
training and public awareness, high quality construction and monitoring are key to ensuring that the
project is managed in an environmentally acceptable way, and due consideration to these is to be ensured
during project implementation.

ISDS
In accordance with O.P 4.01, a public consultation process, involving consultations with donors, national
bodies, regional bodies, and local bodies was undertaken as part of the Environmental Assessment
process. This process was undertaken in two distinct stages: i) initial consultation stage, which was done
at the beginning of the EA preparation, and helped to identify the key stakeholders and key
environmental issues, as well as provided information on key stakeholder concerns; and ii) consultation
and disclosure stage, which was undertaken between March 11-21, 2002 (after the Bank's review of the
draft EA), and allowed the stakeholders to review the findings and comment on proposed mitigation and
management options. A public consultation document was sent to the local coordinators in each location
for distribution to key national stakeholders, local level stakeholders and NGOs. In addition copies of this
document were placed in easily accessible public locations, and an advertisement giving the details of the
locations of the documents and scheduled meetings was published in local periodicals. A series of
individual, group and open public meetings were then held. Comments received from the stakeholders
were incorporated in the EMP.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[  SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ S S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
[X] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts related to the Bank's Safeguards Issues
are expected to result from the project.
Environmental Assessment
The project is expected to result in significant environmental and health benefits, such as: improvements
in public health through better quality and improved availability of treated water; enhanced
environmental conditions as a result of more reliable wastewater treatment; reduction in flood frequency
and associated inconvenience and costs of damage repair; and economic benefits resulting from both
construction related activities and improved water supply and wastewater services.
Potential negative environmental issues relating to project implementation, operation of the water supply
and wastewater systems, and envisaged rehabilitation works under the Repair and Rehabilitation
Programme, have been identified, and include: (i) socioeconomic issues relating to decreased
affordability of services in view of tariff increases; (ii) changes in employment involving both Vodokanal
staff and construction workers; (iii) effects on long term water supply sustainability in view of increased
demand; (iii) health and safety of workers; (iv) fuel and chemical storage; (v) construction impacts such
as waste generation, soil compaction and erosion, habitat disturbance, and socioeconomic inconveniences
such as noise, dust, and traffic disruption; and (vi) general environmental impacts such as changes in
composition and volume of wastewater discharges, changes in abstraction levels and concentration, and
rise in groundwater levels. These impacts are however not expected to be significant, and can be
mitigated through good construction and utility operation practices. Technical capacity of the operator to
carry out a good environmental analysis and management will be a prerequisite. A comprehensive
Environmental Management Plan has been developed for the project to mitigate these potential impacts,
and will be implemented and closely monitored throughout the project.

any significant size, hence will neither require resettlement of people nor extra land acquisition.
Construction works shall typically entail pipe replacement, which would include pavement demolition,
trench excavation, pipe-laying, trench refilling and pavement application,all of which will take place in
rights of way owned by the vodokanals or the local government. Other construction works will be limited
to rehabilitation of existing structures such as pumping stations and specific parts of water and
wastewater treatment plants. All works under the repair and rehabilitation program are expected to be of
rehabilitation nature, in properties owned by the respective vodokanals or rights of way assigned to
municipal infrastructure. Temporary disturbance to the population inhabiting areas adjoining the civil
works sites, and site personnel, during construction, including noise, dust, restricted access, interruption
of traffic flow, and vibration will be mitigated through implementation of provisions in the EMP.
International Waterways
The OP 7.50 applies to the Project as the cities of Karaganda, Temirtau, and Kokshetau are located on
international waterways as defined by paragraph I (a) of OP 7.50. However, considering the nature of the
project activities and focus, the exception to the external notification requirements of OP 7.50, set forth
in paragraph 7(a) of OP 7.50 is fully applicable. The Project involves rehabilitation of ongoing schemes
and construction that in the team's judgement: (i) will not adversely change the quality or quantity of
water flows to the other riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the other riparians' water use.
A memorandum was prepared by the legal department and Bank's management to seek their no objection
to the determination made by the project team that the Project falls within the exceptions to the
notification requirement under Paragraph 7 (a) of the Policy.
Il.D. lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
No significant cumulative impacts are expected to result from implementation of the project.
Il.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
No significant long term negative impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area have
been identified.
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The necessary environmental mitigation measures needed to minimize potential negative impacts to the
environment associated with the project and rehabilitation activities of NBVK, GVK and JVK will be the
responsibility of the Operator, and a contractual obligation under the management contract. The PMU
will be responsible for monitoring compliance. The Bank will supervise the monitoring efforts
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders for the project are the beneficiary populations, the national, regional and local
government bodies, and non governmental organizations. The main institutions responsible for
environmental and water resources management in Kazakhstan are the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources and the Ministry of Agriculture. The Ministry of Public Health, and the Anti-monopoly
Committee also have some responsibility for water resources management. Inter-agency coordination,
training and public awareness, high quality construction and monitoring are key to ensuring that the
project is managed in an environmentally acceptable way, and due consideration to these is to be ensured
during project implementation.

In accordance with O.P 4.01, a public consultation process, involving consultations with donors, national
bodies, regional bodies, and local bodies was undertaken as part of the Environmental Assessment
process. This process was undertaken in two distinct stages: i) initial consultation stage, which was done
at the beginning of the EA preparation, and helped to identify the key stakeholders and key
environmental issues, as well as provided information on key stakeholder concems; and ii) consultation
and disclosure stage, which was undertaken between March 11-21, 2002 (after the Bank's review of the
draft EA), and allowed the stakeholders to review the findings and comment on proposed mitigation and
management options A public consultation document was sent to the local coordinators in each location
for distribution to key national stakeholders, local level stakeholders and NGOs. In addition copies of this
document were placed in easily accessible public locations, and an advertisement giving the details of the
locations of the documents and scheduled meetings was published in local periodicals. A series of
individual, group and open public meetings were then held. Comments received from the stakeholders
were incorporated in the EMP.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the

[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. - No safeguard issues
[X] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
