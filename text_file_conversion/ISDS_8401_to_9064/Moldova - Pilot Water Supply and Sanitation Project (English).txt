I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The development objective of the project is to improve the service quality, efficiency and
financial sustainability of the water supply and wastewater services in rural and medium-sized
towns and cities. This objective would be achieved through: (a) strategic rehabilitation and

L,east cost priority investments that are economically justified based on a broad investment
strategy for system improvement and lowering energy and other operating costs e.g. leak
detecting and repair, network rehabilitation, pressure zoning, and equipment for operations. A
Technical Advisor will be hired under Component D to assist MECTD and Apa Canals to
conduct additional measurements and analysis and identify further least cost priority investments.
Component B: Rural Water Protection
UJrgent rehabilitation and protection of shallow wells; hygiene and sanitation promotion
campaign; development of community groups under the rural development components focusing
on the poorest areas and economically disadvantaged segments of the population.
