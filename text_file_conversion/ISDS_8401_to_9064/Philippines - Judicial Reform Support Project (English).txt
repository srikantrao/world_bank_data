I.A.2. Project Objectives (Fiomii PDS).
Shortly after the present Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Hilario Davide Jr, assumed office in 1998
he announced the following Vision for the Philippinejudiciaiy:
"A .Judiciary that i. independent, eJfecilve and ejficient, and wortlly ofppublic trust and confidence,
and a legialprofe ssion that p-ovides quality, ethical, accessible and cost-effective legal service to
olr people and is willing and able o ainswver he call to plblic service"
This announcement built upon a momentuLmI for judicial reform that had been growing since the 1980s in
response to rising public dissatisfactio with lthe judiciary and widespread perception of corruption As a
foundation for reform to pursue this vision for the Philippine judiciary, the Supreme Court commlissionied
a series of diagnostic studies using Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) funiding. These
studies added to analytical support from the United Nations Development Program and bilateral donors
undertakenl during the 1990s These studies, together with the earlier analyses, identified six key
challenges confrontinig the Philippinejudiciary - delays in the delivery ofjustice and associated
limitation on access, widespread perception of corruption, ineffective administrative structures and
operating systems, deficient court technologies and facilities, a need to strengthen human resources, and
a need to improve public information and collaboration with civil society.
EquLipped with the findings of these diagnostic studies and with the baclung of the other members of the
Supreme Court, the Chief Justice condticted extensive consultations with judges, court staff, civil society,
development partners and the private sector to develop a judicial reform program to make this vision1 a
reality The result was the Supremrie Court's Action Plan for Judicial Reform (APJR), first issued in
November 2000, and revised periodically in response to reviews and suggestions
The proposed project would support a judicial reform program already under way within the Philippines
with strong leadership from the Supreme Court, in particular the Chief Justice, and strong support from
government and civil society Thlis judicial reform program is described in the Action Program for
Judicial Reform (APJR) 2000 to 2005, menitioned above The APJR envisages a major reform ofjudicial
systems and procedures (coUrt and case management), improved institutions systems (e.g. judicial,
financial and admiinistrative reform, reengineering the internal administrative structure, staffing, and
operating systems, upgrading informiiationi and communications technology, and providing the physical

infrastricture), human resource development, integrity infrastrLcture development, improved access to
justice by the poor, and actions to increase the under-standing of, and support from, civil society.
In line with the APJR, the proposed Project's development objective is to support the development of a
more effective and accessible judicial systemii that would foster public trust and confidence. Specifically,
the Project would strengthen the Philippine court system by making the judicial process more efficient,
timely and predictable and enhanice the integrity of the system through the establishment of new work
methods and behavior and increased institutional capacity. Support for selected infrastructure needs -
infonnation systems and some buildings - would complement the core reforms in policies and
procedures The proposed project would also contribute to the refinement of further reform of the
Philippinesjudicial system as a whole, and deepen comimlunity and government support for such reforms
The proposed project is not intenided to anticipate all the needs in these areas at this relatively early stage
of reform. It would focus on specific subsets of the court system: the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court,
the Sandiganbayan Court, the Court of Tax Appeals, and the Regional and Municipal/Metropolitan Trial
Courts (RTCs and MTCs) in thlee geograplhic locations To maximize the contribution of the project to
the proposed subsequent broader reforms for RTCs and MTCs, these three geographic sites would be in
Mindanao, Visayas and Luzoni.
Upgrade the integrity of the judLiciary, thlloigh developing a unified Code of Ethics for justices, judges,
lawyers and court personnel and alternativc feedback mechanisms on judicial perfonnance; implementing
the Judicial Performiiance Managemiient System, enhancing professional development within thejudiciary,
through the introduction of a H7u1.man Resources Development Master Plan for non-juridical personnel of
the judiciary, and strengtlheniniig thc Phlippines Judicial Academy (PHILJA) and strengthen the
institutional capabilities of the judiciary in developing broad stakeholder support for the APJR, in
facilitating knowledge sharing and in managinig the refonns.
L.A 3 Project Description (From PDS)
Bv Component:
Component A: Improving Case Adjudication and Access to Justice - US$ 5.69 million
Improvement in case settlemenit and access to justice mechanisms is intended to address the problem of
delay in the delivery of justice and associated limitations on access This component is intended to ensute
speedy and fair dispensationi of justice to all by improving the efficiency of case adjudication and access
to justice through the implementation of modern case management techniques, planning and tools and the
upgrading of information and communllication systems This component also aims to fill information gaps
regarding access to justice and test mobile courts which empower citizens and strengthen access to
justice, especially for the poor and vulnerable This case management reform will include electronically
integrating in the courts the various processes in the receipt, recording and tracking of cases, identifying
thelr nature, and generating other statistics that will enable analysis of cases and case management
performance of the courts The system will make )ossible the inter-court tracking of cases (transfers and
appeals) by the Supremiie Cour-t and the generation of micro and macro statistical reports usefuil in
evaluating performance at various levels and in formulating policies and systems for continuing case
maniagemiienit improvemienlt. The key ioundatioln for designing this improved case management system is
a study currenltly under way to analyze and determinile the nature and causes of case congestion and delay
in the Phillippinies Judiciary, and to make recommendationis for a case decongestion and delay reduction
strategy

Component B: Enhancing Institutional Integrity - US$ 0.24 million
The development of an integrity infrastructure for the judiciary is intended to improve public trust and
confidence in the justice system and to lay down the foundationl of institutional integrity upon which
efficiency and effectiveness in operations, and impartiality in judicial processes and decisions, can be
achieved and sustained This component will involve
*   strengtheniniig the Code of Ethics for justices, judges, lawyers and court personnel,
*   strengthening the feedback mechanismiis on Judicial Performance including the media, civil
society and commuLunity contributions in monitoring the conduct, operations and performance of
judges, court personnel and the overall court systems,
*   convert the judiciary-wide Judicial Performance Management System into a computerized
system, and implement it within the three pilot courts and the higher courts of the judiciary;
*   the introductioni of a Huumani Resources and Development Master Plan for non-judicial personnel
plus strengtlhening the overall capacities of the Philippine Judicial Academy
Component C: Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the Judiciary - US$ 15.76 million
Thlis component would strengthen institLtional capacity through implementing a decentralized
administration model for the judiciary, installing comprehensive computer-based financial and
administrative systems; developing model integrated court facilities; and strengthening policy, research
and development (PR&D) capabilities, and the development of an electronic judicial library By
empowering the lower courts in pilot locations to assume administrative and operational responsibilities
within their jurisdiction, it is expected that the performance of the courts and the delivery of services will
be significantly enhanced Financial management improvements will include reporting and information
system revenue management, fund management, physical asset management and the payroll system
Third, this subcomponent would begin to address infrastructure deficiencies by setting up a model
integrated court to showcase reforms in each of the three regions - Mindanao, Visayas and Luzon. Model
pilot courts would include space for family courts, interview rooms, survivor-sensitive facilities and
court administration functions, facilities for court-annexed mediation services; latnch of modern
Information and Communication Technology facilities according to Information System Strategic Plan
requirements; provisioIn of applropriate public access to judicial records archives and infonnation offices
to make legal and judicial infoinmationi accessible; provision of adequate food service facilities and
restrooms for staff, and thc public, and space for training, and meetings with media, lawyers and other
stakeholders.
Componenit D: Stakeholder Support for Reform and Program Management Office - US$ 0.72
million
This component would assist in developing and strengthening support for the reforn process, ensure that
judges and other stakeholders are able to participate in the development of modernization ideas, and the
implementation of key reform activities It would also provide assistance to the Program Management
Office (PMO) in facilitating and coordiniating the APJR and the Project
I A 4 Project Location (Geograpllic location, information about the key environmnental and social
characteristics of the aiea and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas )
There will be three project sites for the establishment of model integrated courts -Angeles City in Luzon,

ISDS
Lapu-Lapu City in the Visayas, and Cagayan de Oro City in Mindanao. This will provide maximum
exposure and visibility of the benefits by ensuring geographic dispersion. All three sites have been
assessed by both the project and Bank team in terms of possible social safeguards implications and were
found not to involve any land acquisition, resettlement, or cultural property issues. The project sites are
existing Halls of Justices wher-e improvement/upgrading interventions shall be made. None of these sites
were found to be culturally or socially sensitive Expected social impacts are limited to the expected
inconvenienice to coui-t users and the general public during construction.
