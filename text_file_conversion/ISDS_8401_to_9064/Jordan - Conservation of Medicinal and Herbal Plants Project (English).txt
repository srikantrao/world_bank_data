I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The Development Objective of the proposed project is to improve the livelihood and health of rural
communities through the conservation, management, and sustainable use of medicinal and herbal (M/H)
plants for human and livestock needs in specific areas of JordXbhe Central Upper Slopes of the Rift
Valley and the Mujib Nature Reserve) while ensuring effectiven-situ protection of threatened habitats
and ecosystems in these areas.
I A.3. Project Description:
Component 1. Institutional Strengthening (US$ 2.54 millid'djs component focuses on
strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of key players. Six sub-components are included
under Component I as follows: (1) developing and providing an organizational mechanism for project
implementation, (2) developing crucial inter-sector links (ministries, private sector, consumers,
producers) and regulatory instruments, (3) developing intellectual property rights (IPR) policy and
guidelines for indigenous knowledge and use of M/H plants for medical and other purposes by humans
and livestock, (4) establishing health and safety standards for M/H plants and products. International
certification of organically grown M/H plants will be adopted and legally endorsed and national
certification procedures will be based on these practices, (5) establishing a national M/H plants
database/GIS and plant gene bank, and (6) designing and implementing a Training Programme.

conservation are Mujib Nature Reserve adjacent to the Dead Sea, and the Central Upper Slopes of the
Rift Valley covering the Madaba area. Other areas can be incorporated into M/H plants conservation in
later periods, based on the experiences gained from these pilot initiatives
Site community management plans will be developed and implemented to enhance the sustainable use of
M/H plants in the 2 pi)ksitu areas.  These plans include grazing agreements with the local
community, water-catchment and harvesting measures, enrichment planting, contour planting with shrubs
to reduce erosion and planting at right angles to the prevailing wind with M/H shrubs and trees (including
nitrogen fixing perennials) to improve the micro-climate, soil fertility and provide nutritious feed for the
animals, and preparing guidelines for sustainable harvesting. In addition, income-generating activities
will be promoted based on local resources, and mitigation measures to relieve population pressures in the
project sites will be pursued.
2.2    Ex-situ cultivation trials. Trials in thein-situ areas will be used forex-situ production of M/H
plants to relievein-situ pressure. Two types of trials will be tested under this sub-component: (2.2.1)
ex-situ farming demonstrations, and (2.2.2) pilot-prototype fann demonstrations.
2.2 1  Ex-situ farming demonstrations Villagers/farmers will be identified for on-farm  pilot
propagation and cultivation trials of M/H plants to remove pressure on wild populations. The objective is
to demonstrate cost-effective and profitable cultivation methods for various high-demand M/H species
that can be reproduced by farmers at minimal cost and, at the same time, give added-income, provide
increased crop diversification and make better use of available moisture.
2.2 2  Pilot-Prototype Farm Demonstrations at ECOHERB Farms of Jordan (EFTIte project will
support demonstrations in this pilot-prototype farm in implementing the following strategy to develop the
ex-situ cultivation trials in Jordan: (1) development of a screening process for the M/H plants to be
cultivated in thex-situ farms, (2) promotion of the adoption of sound environmental practices,
Integrated Pest Management (IPM), organic farming and nitrogen fixing plants, (3) identification of
potential ex-situ farms for organic practices and certified as organic farms, (3) development of a label for
organic quality products for Jordan, (4) development of a prototype contract-farming model to
standardize the relationship between the growers and EFJ, (5) training of stakeholders in the M/H plants
sector on the ground in environmentally friendly techniques and procedures, and (6) establishment of a
monitoring and evaluation system.

program and public awareness initiatives will be outlined by the start of the project.
Component 4. Income Generation Activities: M/H Quality Enhancement, Product Development
(US$ 3.5 million)
Three sub-components will be included as follows: (1) standardization of M/H plants raw materials and
processing, (2) income generation through product promotion, and (3) facilitating Access to
Micro-Credit.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social

The two pilot areas forin-situ conservation are the Mujib Nature Reserve adjacent to the Dead Sea; and
the Central Upper Slopes Rift Valley/Madaba.
*  The Mujib Nature Reserveis a 215 sq km reserve, adjacent to the Dead Sea, in the central-west
region of Jordan.  A vegetation survey, including M/H plants, was undertaken by the RSCN.
Communities inside and outside the reserve graze sheep and goats. Grazing areas and grazing
patterns within the reserve were agreed upon by the shepherds and RSCN, and have been followed
except during drought. This working relationship will serve as a basis for the identification and
conservation of M/H plants and to gather information from shepherds and their families as to the
traditional uses of these plants. Such information will be used to formulate management plans for
the sustainable use of these resources. Because of the high water stress levels and the incidence of
severe erosion, the management plans will incorporate water conservation measures such as
micro-catchment and erosion control initiatives, including the planting of local M/H shrubs and trees.
*  The Central Upper Slopes Rift Valley/MadabaThe National Center for Agricultural Research and
Technical Transfer (NCARTT) started preliminary work in the field of M/H plants in 1998 in the
Madaba area. Field trials for thyme, cumin, chamomile and other high-demand medicinal, herbs,
spice and essential oil species have been planted with the objective of identifying sustainable
cultivation practices under rainfed condition. Information from these trials will be used as part of the
ex-situ sub component. Within this rift valley area, somein-situ "Hotspot" sites for the conservation
and management of M/H plants have been identified and others will be investigated. Demonstration
plots will be established to show improved management techniques to local farmers and communities
in similar agro-ecological zones.
B. Chleck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments-
The project is rated category B and is expected to have positive impacts on the environment.  An
Environmental Assessment (EA) of the project activities has been conducted and an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was chosen as the appropriate instrument to address potential environmental
impacts of the project and to propose mitigation and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) measures The
project will lead to the sustainable use and preservation of an important gene pool of M/H plants. This
initiative will act as a model for the conservation of M/H plants throughout Jordan. The project will
promote the conservation and sustainable use of naturally occurring areas of M/H plants, and through the
ex-situ sub-component coupled with the strengthening of the gene pool of M/H plants, encourage the
propagation of these plants in suitable habitats. It could be considered as a model for other countries in the
region and provide a platform for an exchange of experiences and best practices.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project's objectives are to achieve good conservation and management practices of M/H plants
There are no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The main features of the EMP are to
demonstrate best practices for in-situ conservation and ex-siltu cultivation of M/H plants in pilot areas
* Large areas of the rangelands are deteriorating because of drought conditions exacerbated, among
others, by overgrazing and over-harvesting of M/H plants.  This has contributed to reducing
biodiversity on these lands and there is an incipient loss of minerals from the soils, including carbon
due to decreased vegetation cover. This is compounded by an increase in wind and water erosion, as
a result of non-sustainable practices, leading to a spiral of decline in the carrying capacity of the land.
Some arable land is in poor condition due to repeated failure of grain crops and the invasion of
noxious weeds. Alternative M/H crops have been tried by NCARTT on a limited experimental basis.
These hold some promise as they mature earlier and require less water.
* Some flora (and fauna) is under threat as a result of these deteriorating conditions (as is the
livelihood of farming communities). If little or nothing is done to halt this decline then many
rangeland areas and marginal arable areas will slowly degrade and become non-viable even as
pastoral land. This will directly affect the livelihood of rural communities, as M/H plants are a major
source of accessible and affordable health care for human and livestock.
* Some of these lands will eventually reach desert status with adverse national, regional and even
global consequences for biodiversity, carbon storage and the quality and quantity of water flow. The
proposal to identify and utilize cultivation practices for threatened high-demand M/H plants does not
pose an environmental risk.
OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) OP 4.01, the environmental assessment process, has been
triggered since the implementation of the Conservation of M/H Plants Project could have potentially
adverse environmental impacts, e.g. overgrazing of rangelands, over-exploitation of M/H plants, potential
use of pesticides. The EA, however, has determined that there are no potential large scale, significant or
irreversible environmental impacts. Those potential impacts that were identified can be effectively
mitigated and are addressed in the EMP. The EMP identifies the major potential environmental issues
that could arise as a result of project interventions and propose measures to be taken to prevent and/or
mitigate these effects, including training and monitoring measures.
OP 4 04 (Natural Habitats): OP 4.04 is not triggered since the project will not support activities that lead
to significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. No agricultural encroachment will be
permitted, nor will the use of agro-chemicals be allowed in these areas. There might eventually be an



5
ISDS
increase in grazing and collecting of M/H plants due to the project's potential success in reversing
rangeland degradation. Thus, there is a slight possibility that there will be a tendency to overgraze such
areas by reducing bought-in feed and/or increasing animal numbers, and hence endanger M/H plants
Therefore, the project will demonstrate sustainable environmental friendly pastoral practices, provide
training on rangeland management and grazing management, agree with the community on a grazing
strategy. Grazing areas and grazing patterns within the Mujib Nature Reserve were agreed upon by
shepherds and RSCN, and have been followed except during drought. This working relationship will
serve as a basis for the identification and conservation of M/H plants and to gather information from
shepherds and their families as to the traditional uses of these plants.
OP 4.09 (Pest Management): OP 4.09 is not triggered since the project will not support the procurement
of pesticides or pesticide application equipment, nor will the project affect pest management in a way
that could cause harm. As the promotion of organic farming is one of the aims of the project, integrated
pest management (IPM) will be part of the demonstration, training and awareness activities as will be the
appropriate use of organic fertilizers, mulch and green manure. The project will closely monitor
activities regarding the production of M/H plants.
OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) OP4.12 is not triggered since conservation will take place without
restriction of access to grazing land in the Mujib Nature Reser\Fx situ activities will take place on
farms that are interested in this with the consent of the owners.
II.D. I b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not applicable
II.D.lc Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
Not applicable
Il.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The PMU/EEP will have the overall responsibility for implementation of the Conservation of M/H Plants
Project and will ensure that the recommendations made in the EMP are fully integrated into
implementation of the project It is anticipated that there will be no need for any specific Environmental
Assessment for sub-projects. The PMU/EPP will perform regular monitoring and evaluation of project
activities. Monitoring and evaluation will run continuously for the life of the project. Public awareness
and training programs will take place throughout the life of the project, on the basis of identified needs.
The program includes training on IPM, organic farming, sustainable harvesting methods, grazing
management, etc.
Il.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
From the start of the project identification there has been close consultation with the local administration
and farmers in selected project areas and local population within the vicinity. Also, as part of the PDF-B
surveys, potential beneficiaries were consulted and their opinions sought. Ministries, NGOs (e g. RSCN,
Badia Research and Development Program, Queen Noor Al Hussein Foundation), private sector
manufacturers of pharmaceutical drugs, professors of pharmacy and plant ecology, herbalists, healers



6
ISDS
and farmers were consulted during project preparation to determine the geographic distributions of M/H
plants, the extent of M/H plants use, the most important problems faced concerning conservation,
cultivation and marketing. A National Stakeholder Workshop was held in Amman April 24-25, 2002 to
discuss the overall outline of the project, institutional responsibilities and the involvement of the
different stakeholders Consultation will be an ongoing project activity and the implementation of the
EMP will be reviewed constantly.
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] SI. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.

B. Clheck Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments.
The project is rated category B and is expected to have positive impacts on the environment.  An
Environmental Assessment (EA) of the project activities has been conducted and an Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was chosen as the appropriate instrument to address potential environmental
impacts of the project and to propose mitigation and Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) measures The
project will lead to the sustainable use and preservation of an important gene pool of M/H plants. This
initiative will act as a model for the conservation of M/H plants throughout Jordan. The project will
promote the conservation and sustainable use of naturally occurring areas of M/H plants, and through the
ex-situ sub-component coupled with the strengthening of the gene pool of M/H plants, encourage the
propagation of these plants in suitable habitats. It could be considered as a model for other countries in the
region and provide a platform for an exchange of experiences and best practices.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The project's objectives are to achieve good conservation and management practices of M/H plants.
There are no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The main features of the EMP are to
demonstrate best practices for in-situ conservation and ex-situ cultivation of M/H plants in pilot areas.
*  Large areas of the rangelands are deteriorating because of drought conditions exacerbated, among
others, by overgrazing and over-harvesting of M/H plants.  This has contributed to reducing
biodiversity on these lands and there is an incipient loss of minerals from the soils, including carbon
due to decreased vegetation cover This is compounded by an increase in wind and water erosion, as
a result of non-sustainable practices, leading to a spiral of decline in the carrying capacity of the land.
Some arable land is in poor condition due to repeated failure of grain crops and the invasion of
noxious weeds. Alternative M/H crops have been tried by NCARTT on a limited experimental basis
These hold some promise as they mature earlier and require less water.
* Some flora (and fauna) is under threat as a result of these deteriorating conditions (as is the
livelihood of farming communities). If little or nothing is done to halt this decline then many
rangeland areas and marginal arable areas will slowly degrade and become non-viable even as
pastoral land. This will directly affect the livelihood of rural communities, as M/H plants are a major
source of accessible and affordable health care for human and livestock.
*  Some of these lands will eventually reach desert status with adverse national, regional and even
global consequences for biodiversity, carbon storage and the quality and quantity of water flow. The
proposal to identify and utilize cultivation practices for threatened high-demand M/H plants does not
pose an environmental risk.
OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment) OP 4.01, the environmental assessment process, has been
triggered since the implementation of the Conservation of M1H Plants Project could have potentially
adverse environmental impacts, e.g. overgrazing of rangelands, over-exploitation of M/H plants, potential
use of pesticides. The EA, however, has determined that there are no potential large scale, significant or
irreversible environmental impacts. Those potential impacts that were identified can be effectively
mitigated and are addressed in the EMP. The EMP identifies the major potential environmental issues
that could arise as a result of project interventions and propose measures to be taken to prevent and/or
mitigate these effects, including training and monitoring measures.
OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats): OP 4.04 is not triggered since the project will not support activities that lead
to significant conversion or degradation of critical natural habitats. No agricultural encroachment will be
permitted, nor will the use of agro-chemicals be allowed in these areas. There might eventually be an

ISDS
increase in grazing and collecting of M/H plants due to the project's potential success in reversing
rangeland degradation. Thus, there is a slight possibility that there will be a tendency to overgraze such
areas by reducing bought-in feed and/or increasing animal numbers, and hence endanger M/H plants.
Therefore, the project will demonstrate sustainable environmental friendly pastoral practices, provide
training on rangeland management and grazing management, agree with the community on a grazing
strategy. Grazing areas and grazing pattems within the Mujib Nature Reserve were agreed upon by
shepherds and RSCN, and have been followed except during drought. This working relationship will
serve as a basis for the identification and conservation of M/H plants and to gather information from
shepherds and their families as to the traditional uses of these plants.
OP 4 09 (Pest Management): OP 4.09 is not triggered since the project will not support the procurement
of pesticides or pesticide application equipment, nor will the project affect pest management in a way
that could cause harm. As the promotion of organic farming is one of the aims of the project, integrated
pest management (IPM) will be part of the demonstration, training and awareness activities as will be the
appropriate use of organic fertilizers, mulch and green manure. The project will closely monitor
activities regarding the production of M/H plants.
OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) OP4.12 is not triggered since conservation will take place without
restriction of access to grazing land in the Mujib Nature ReserxEx situ activities will take place on
farms that are interested in this with the consent of the owners.
Il.D. l b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not applicable
Il.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
Not applicable
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The PMU/EEP will have the overall responsibility for implementation of the Conservation of M/H Plants
Project and will ensure that the recommendations made in the EMP are fully integrated into
implementation of the project. It is anticipated that there will be no need for any specific Environmental
Assessment for sub-projects. The PMU/EPP will perform regular monitoring and evaluation of project
activities. Monitoring and evaluation will run continuously for the life of the project. Public awareness
and training programs will take place throughout the life of the project, on the basis of identified needs.
The program includes training on IPM, organic farming, sustainable harvesting methods, grazing
management, etc.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
From the start of the project identification there has been close consultation with the local administration
and farmers in selected project areas and local population within the vicinity. Also, as part of the PDF-B
surveys, potential beneficiaries were consulted and their opinions sought. Ministries, NGOs (e.g. RSCN,
Badia Research and Development Program, Queen Noor Al Hussein Foundation), private sector
manufacturers of pharmaceutical drugs, professors of pharmacy and plant ecology, herbalists, healers

ISDS
and farmers were consulted during project preparation to determine the geographic distributions of M/H
plants, the extent of M/H plants use, the most important problems faced concerning conservation,
cultivation and marketing. A National Stakeholder Workshop was held in Amman April 24-25, 2002 to
discuss the overall outline of the project, institutional responsibilities and the involvement of the
different stakeholders. Consultation will be an ongoing project activity and the implementation of the
EMP will be reviewed constantly
E. Safeguards Classification Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
[ ] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. -No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
