support the regions of the Russian Federation in the development and implementation of fiscal reform
programs that will promote financial transparency, budgetary accountability, and strengthened fiscal
management policies and practices at the regional level. It is undertaken in the context of recent
improvements in the framework for fiscal federalism in Russia.
I.A.3. Project Description: The proposed loan will provide financing to the Federal Budget to support a
broad range of reforms. The Government will create a Regional Fiscal Reform Fund (RFRF), a separate
transfer mechanism in the Federal budget, specifically to reward, on a competitive basis, regions that have
undertaken significant fiscal reforms. Operation of the RFRF will be governed by procedures agreed
between the Bank and the Government, including the process and timing of disbursement to regional
budgets. Three tranches will be released based on the accomplishment of agreed upon conditionality.
