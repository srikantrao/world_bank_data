 A.2. Project Objectives
 To assist the Metropolitan Area of Santiago in implementing the 2000-2010 Urban Transport Plan (PTUS),
 which will involve a series of sector policy reforms, in particular the modernization of the public transport
 system for the Metropolitan Area.

 The main development objectives of the proposed Sector Adjustment Loan for Santiago will be to improve
 the level of transport services to the residents (particularly low income residents) and businesses, reduce
 resource costs, and increase environmental quality. The specific objectives are to:

                (i)      improve the competitive mechanism in public transport services in the direction of
                         for-the-market competition;

                (ii)     introduce a unified and integrated pricing system for public transport services
                        making access more equitable;

                (iii)    concession public transport services, part of the required infrastructure (mainly
                         busways and bus terminals) and revenue collection function to the private sector,
                         with accompanying risk-sharing arrangements;

                (iv)     re-allocate the street space away from general traffic to exclusive use of (bus) public
                         transport vehicles;

                (v)      set up some form of a permanent special purpose metropolitan transport planning
                         organization.

                (vi)     facilitate coordination between urban transport policies and land-use policies.

                (vii)    dramatically reduce public transport-related emissions of air contaminants.

to promote formal companies, and offering training and reinsertion into the labor market for at least 20%  of



                                                                                                            2

the current labor force.


A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project area of influence is the Santiago Metropolitan Area, as the transport system will be changed as
a result of the public transport modernization under PTUS. As per the environmental and social safeguard
impacts, the main effects will be felt in the central municipalities (Santiago, Estaci6nCentral, Providencia),
which will benefit from the road upgrades. The works under the first stages of TRANSANTIAGO will be
confined to the following areas, and will mostly involve upgrading road corridors: (i) Alameda, 7.5 km; (ii)
Pajaritos, 7.7 km; (iii) Santa Rosa, 11.1 km; (iv) Suiza-Las Rejas, 2.9 km; and (v) Arica-Departamental, 1.7
km. Most involuntary resettlements are associated to the Santa Rosa corridor, which is a consolidated area
combining housing and businesses.

Comments: The DDO-SECAL is not funding specific infrastructure investment but MOP will be carrying
out works, mainly with private funds through BOT schemes, to maximize Transantiago             benefits. These
works would consist of (a) road upgrading to segregate busways (in the corridors        Santa Rosa: Alameda-
Calle Placer; and Pajaritos), including adequate pedestrian areas and bus stops; (b)       building of modal
transfer stations; and (c) connections (Blanco Encalada - Arica and Suiza - Departamental).       The plan will
have net environmental and social benefits, and relatively low potential negative impact   associated with the
construction phase; environmental impact will mainly result from nuisance associated to the levels of noise,
dust, air pollution, and traffic congestion during works. Guidelines for mitigating     environmental impact
during construction already exist and will be improved under the complementary TAL.         Some involuntary
resettlements will also result from the road upgrades, and will be handled through a Resettlement        Policy
Framework to be fine-tuned under the TAL and which will draw from the Bank's safeguard           policies. Also,
an Analytical Strategic Environmental Assessment of PTUS has already taken place. The            next Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) phase, including the Environmental Assessment              of PTUS programs,
increasing public participation, and strengthening institutional capacity for SEA will  be implemented under
a complementary GEF project on Air Quality and Transport for Santiago.

Section II- Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary ofKey SafeguardIssues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated      with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

No significant or irreversible impacts are expected.

The policy is triggered due to the potential adverse environmental      impacts associated with the construction
of the pieces of infrastructure that accompany the     reform program that the DDO-SECAL is supporting.
These impacts are related to (a) management of materials         and waste; (b) restriction of traffic flows and
access to homes and businesses; (c) increased     noise and emission of pollutants; (d) management       of work
camp sites; and (e) interference with urban infrastructure      (phone lines, piping, electricity wires, sewage).
The Ministry of Works (MOP), in charge of concessioning           most of TRANSANTIAGO's road upgrades,
already has guidelines for environmental management         plans of infrastructure works. These guidelines are
in agreement with Bank standards for this type of urban        intervention (mainly maintenance, rehabilitation,
and segregation of existing roads, with some upgrading). According          to the MOP guidelines, contractors
have to produce EMP and contingency plans for (i)      camp site; (ii) archeological and historical heritage;(iii)
management ofborrow materials and sites; (iv) management          of waste and disposal; (v) traffic management;
(vi) public participation; (vii) management       of green areas; (viii) health and safety; and          (ix) risk
management and contingencies. SERVIU also         has a set of Guidelines and practice procedures dealing    with
environmental management of camp sites; borrow          materials; wastes; traffic and signaling; occupational
health and safety; contingencies and risk management and contingency        plans.

Possible impacts during operation include air,    noise, soil and water contamination from the terminals      and
parking/maintenance areas. New bus terminals,          and some transfer stations will have to follow         the
procedures of the national system for environmental         impact assessment (SEIA). As explained below        in
paragraph D.4, the SEIA is a comprehensive single      window process of reviewing the environmental       impact
assessment of a project, which guarantees participation      from main public and government stakeholders.      It
is expected that appropriate environmental management        plans for the works and operation of terminals and
transfer stations will be produced.

Complementarily, to ensure that the Urban Transport           Plan is environmentally sound as a whole, the
Government of Chile, through its national transport       planning agency, SECTRA, decided to undertake a
Strategic Environmental Assessment to evaluate the        Urban Transport Plan for Santiago. TAU, a Spanish
consultant specialized in strategic environmental assessment,         was contracted to perform an Analytical
Strategic Environmental Assessment (ANSEA) of PTUS.            This work took place in 2001-2002 and focused
on (i) evaluating environmental decision domains;         (ii) assessing environmental mainstreaming at those
decision domains; and (iii) proposing a validation procedure        for PTUS involving public participation. To
advance to the next SEA stage, the GEF Air Quality       and Transport Project will fund additional studies, for
which Terms of Reference are being prepared. Next phase           will include (a) environmental assessment of
PTUS programs; (b) improvement of participatory approach;           and (c) development of institutional capacity
for SEAs. TORs for this phase will be ready by     appraisal of this SECAL.

          Although the project will not fund specific investments, upgrading     existing roads will imply some
          involuntary resettlements. OP4.12 is not triggered since it does not   apply to SECALs. However,
          OP4.01 does apply and requires that impacts related to resettlement     be identified and mitigated.
          Through technical support funded under the TAL, a       Resettlement Policy Framework will be
          developed, inspired by Bank standards.


 D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term    impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
 project area.

 The project is expected to provide net environmental     benefits in the long run, derived from a cleaner, more




                                                                                                                 4

modern and more energy-efficient transport system, with improved accessibility, and lower emissions of air
pollutants and greenhouse gases. PTUS implementation will include upgrading of existing urban roads to
enable an integrated system of trunk and feeder routes, which in most cases will also result in urban space
improvements in the form of upgraded pavements and adjacent green areas.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

In order to modernize the public transport system, and determine which corridors should become trunks
and which should become feeders, formal economic evaluation of various scenarios has been undertaken.
This involved the use of a internationally renowned transport planning model ESTRAUS, to forecast traffic
flows and transport demand, together with more specific models to assist in public transport network design
(MDTP), in economic evaluation (MODEC), and in the estimation of environmental impacts (MODEM).
The models are quite sophisticated and the technical skills in modeling appear to be high. Therefore, the
selected alternative is the one offering better environmental, economic, and technical conditions in the long
run. Potentially adverse environmental impact in PTUS will result only from the construction phase.
Involuntary resettlements have been kept to a minimum, in order to minimize associated costs, relatively
high in Chile.

D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

Chile has a relatively high capacity and standards for managing environmental and social safeguards. There
is a well instituted system for environmental impact assessment of projects with potentially high impacts,
regulated by Law 19.300. Depending on the type of projects, and on the anticipated level of impact,
projects need to enter the national System of Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA) with either a full
EIA or a Declaration of Environmental Impact. SEIA is a single window system operated by the National
Commission on Environment (CONAMA), where all relevant authorities and the public have the
possibility to provide feedback and recommendations on the proposed project, and its environmental
impact assessment.

Projects not considered as of high potential environmental impact, and therefore not required to enter SEIA,
will have to follow environmental and social guidelines existing at both the Ministry of Works and
SERVIU (local implementation service of Ministry of Housing). This is the case of most investments under
PTUS implementation. These guidelines are to be followed by contractors, who have to prepare
environmental management plans and contingency plans, and aim at mitigating environmental impact of
infrastructure works. In addition, MOP's practice includes environmental impact assessment of some of the
urban infrastructure works to be allocated to concessionaires (under BOT schemes).

Regarding involuntary resettlements, there is a Law of Expropriations under which all property owners and
dwellers with legalized titles are compensated according to market value of land and property. Other
dwellers can go to court for settlement of disputed cases. Also, all households living in   the area and not
compensated are always assisted to participate in government programs for housing subsidies targeting the
poorest segments of the affected population. SERVIU is the authority in charge of             handling most
involuntary resettlements in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago (except in some cases where concessions
are implied and therefore managed by MOP). A permanent Framework Policy for Resettlements,           inspired
from Bank safeguard standards, will be developed on the basis of the existing one under a     complementary
TAL.

For evaluation of urban transport plans, programs, and policies, Chile has started a process     of Strategic
 Environmental Assessment for Urban Transport Plans for the Metropolitan Area of Santiago,     and it aims at
 institutionalizing a more permanent mechanism, similar to SEIA. The GEF Air Quality           and Transport
 Project will fund, within the next 6 months, studies for the next phase of PTUS' SEA, including     capacity
 building and institutional strengthening strategies.


 D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure  on



                                                                                                            5

safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders are municipal and national government institutions (Municipalities, Ministries of Works,
Transport, Housing, SERVIU, Transantiago, National Commission on Traffic Safety -CONASET,
CONAMA, SECTRA, and the METRO); as well as community-based associations and community leaders;
and bus operators. Meetings and information about potential resettlements have already taken place. In
addition, communities of areas where current land-use patterns are not in compliance with land-use plans
are constantly being contacted and informed. Open consultation has also taken place with bus operators.
Additional work under the SECAL will include workshops with community participation,                  and
dissemination of public transport plans.
