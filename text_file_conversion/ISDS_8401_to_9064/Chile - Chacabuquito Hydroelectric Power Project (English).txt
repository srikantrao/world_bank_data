Project Objectives (From PDS)
The objective of the project is to support development of the international :n,ru.R mechanism for the new
commodity known as "Emission Reduction" (ER), developed in the -'rTrnieffI.d. bf the Kyoto Protocol. In
this particular case, the project will facilitate reduction of C02 emissions  .  ile through substituting
electricity prdduced by thermal plants with electricity from a Chacabuquito dn anof-the-river hydro plant.
The project is supported by the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF).
Project Description (From PDS)
The -nr:J.ct will consist of hydroelectric generation that will displace th rr,al generation, therefore
producing ER, The Chacabuquito Project is being developed by Hidroelectrija Guardia Vieja (HGV), a
Chilean private company, and consists of a run-of-the-river power plant of 25 $4W1 capacity that utilizes the
waters of the Aconcagua river and will produce an average annual generatiXii If 60 GWh. The project is
located in the 5*Region of Chile, near Los Andes, about 100 km Northeast ; or i Santiago. The project's
construction time is approximately 15 months and is expected to be completed li i 2002. The construction is
financed fnll:, by HGV.
Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and sicial characteristics of the
area and population likely to be affected. and proximity to any protected areas, or sites dr1critical natural habitats. or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project will be located on the Rio Aconcagua, 10 km upstream of Los Aoieg (Region V), Chile. The
watershed has been long intervened by human settlements, mining activities aind h. .roele tric projects that
date over 40 years. The region is served by an international highway with head t4aflic (3,600 vehicles per
day on average). Camp sites, hotels and other recreational areas have spra l  along the highway. In
addition to the highway, the area is crisscrossed by power transmission linesi  railroad from the copper
mines upstream, and irrigation canals that feed agricultural activities in the va}] y downstream. Although
the project area is not highly complex particularly from the socio-eco  ad logical perspectives, an
environmental baseline was conductedto highlight locations of highest
