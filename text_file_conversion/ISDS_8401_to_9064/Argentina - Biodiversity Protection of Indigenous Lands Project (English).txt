Project Objectives (From PDS)
Obiectives: to promote community-based management of natural resources and to provide the enabling
conditions for preserving and restoring biodiversity by strengthening social organization and culture as well
as by planning and testing sustainable use alternatives. _.
Project Description (From PDS)
The GEF Alternative (IBRD LIL and the GEF grant) will be carried out in three pilot areas where
indigenous occupants have legal collective title or are in the process of consolidating their traditional tenure
rights. The GEF Alternative will comprise the following components:
(1) A Social and Cultural Strengthening Component: US$150.000. It has been designed both to support
traditional comnunity-based social organizations and capacity building, and to promote h%e1rhood
activities closely related to their traditional knowledge and culture such as handicrafts and culture related
tourism. GEF will support incremental environmental education and, in general, activities oriented to
rescue the traditional knowledge about natural resources management and biodiversity conservation.
(2) A Sustainable Use of Natural Resources and Biodiversity Protection Component: US$700.000. It has
been designed to protect forests and to improve incomes derived from the sustainable use of forests, soils,
water and other natural resources, including support for priority land repularization. agriculture. soil
conservation, and water management activities. Under this component, GEF will provide incremental
funding for: stock taking of existing biodiversity as communities evaluate their natural resource base;
development of community management plans; identification and promotion of biodiversity fnendly
economic activities (such as eco-tourism) and biodiversity friendly infrastructure alternatives (such as for
provision of water to improve indigenous communities' income opportunities). GEF will also support in-
situ conservation for the recuperation and re-introduction of medicinal and other traditionally used endemic
species.
In sum, this project will finance the following type of activities:
*   Biodiversity inventories/diagnostics of the natural resources in each pilot area, including zoo-
genetic resources (their location and conservation condition, levels of risk/threats to their
sustainability, contingency plans, and actins to patent intellectual property rights);'
*   Participatory local community planning for the management of natural resources with
development potential (including feasibility studies);
*   Formulation of specific participatory resource management plans (water, soils, pastures, forestry,
agroforestry and eco-tourism);
* Implementation and evaluation of the management plans,
* Environmental extension, specially the training of trainers, focusing on the rescue of ancient
knowledge and the incorporation of new conservation practices.
(3) An Institutional Support and Strengthening Component: US$150,000. Is has been designed to facilitate
the effective implementation of the project, including administrative and financial management and a
system for monitoring and evaluation.
GEF support will be used for incremental institutional strengthening activities such as training in
conservation management, negotiation, and legal advise for legislative proposals to establish and manage
special protected areas for endangered species, with particular attention to sites considered to have critical
global biodiversity significance. GEF support will also be provided for assisting the communities in
monitoring and evaluating their existing biodiversity, capturing lessons learned in traditional management
of natural resources and disseminating replicable experiences through cross-fertilization exchanges
between indigenous communities.
Annex 3 provides a module of activities to be developed and the tentative budget for the
inventories/diagnostics.



Project Location: (Geographic location, infonnation about the key environmental and social charactenstics of the
area and population likely to be affected, and proxirmity to any protected areas, or sites or cntical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The proposed project will support three pilot operations in regions where indigenous communities
have obtained collective title to their lands or are in the final stage of securing State recognition
of their ancestral tenure rights. The three indigenous territories are
Mapuche territory of Pulmari in Neuqu6n Province;
Daiguita-Calchaqui and Quilmes territory of Amaicha del Valle in Tucumgn Province;
Kolla territory of Finca Santiago in Salta Province.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, describe
steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project
Forestry (OPIGP 4.36) - The project triggers the OP/BP on Forestry, since it includes forestry
protection. The preservation of the "pehuen" pine tree and fruits of the pine tree and the "algorrobo"
tree are examples of the use of non-timber forestry resources. The project will promote both the
protection of the forest, as well as a means of subsistence for the indigenous peoples.
Natural Habitat Policy (OP/BP 4.04)- Among the objectives of the project is incorporating new
tools for the management of fragile ecosystems. The Natural Habitat Policy is therefore triggered.
The project will contribute to protecting the ecosystems in the project area.
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) - The project is linked to an IBRD LIL Indigenous Comnmnunity
Development Project and concurs with the strategy of the GoA to build upon and strengthen the social
capital of indigenous organizations by supportng community-based natural resources management
systems and development of investments managed by the indigenous organizations themselves. The
Indigenous Peoples OD is therefore triggered. This is a higly participatory project, and in itself
constitutes an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP).
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03) - Ruins and ancestral remains of the Quilmes peoples are scattered
through parts of the project sites including the largest pre-Hispanic city in Argentina,. Thls triggers the
OPN on Cultural Property.
2. Identify and descnbe any potential large scale, significant andlor irreversible impacts. Describe
any potential cumulative or long term impacts.
None.
3. In hght of I and 2, describe the proposed treatment of alternauves (if required)
N/A
4.Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
* Social Assessment was carried out with indigenous participation and will be implemented
through the framework provided by the Community Development LIL already under
implementation.



5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
This project involves direct beneficiaries of the Mapuche, Diaguita-Calchaqui, and the Kola-indilgenous
communities, as well as other stakeholders such as the National Institute of Indigenous Affairs and
provincial government authorities (particularly those agencies in charge of indigenous affairs and the
environment). All of these entities will benefit from this project to the degree that they become involved in
the discussion and analysis of sustainable community development.
In addition to those directly involved in the project design and execution, there are other important social
and institutional actors who wili be involved indirectly. These include local, provincial and national
institutions of government, non-governmental organizations and the private sector, with which the pilot
indigenous communities will establish collaborative agreements, obtain support and assistance and work
with to implement a diversity of a activities and actions entailed in the project.
A Social Assessment was carried out during project preparation was the vehicle through which the three
indigenous communities participated directly in defining project objectives, designing components,
formulating implementation arrangements and structuring management procedures. Additionall). the
technical content of the Social Assessment, including historical information, socioeconomic analysis,
environmental analysis, and institutional analysis are the product of this participatory approach
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ ] Si. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or sigmficant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[ X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are linuted in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[3 S3. - No safeguard issues
[] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
sinilar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
