I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The development objective of the project is to improve enrolment, transition and achievement of poor
and disadvantaged students in primary and lower secondary schools. This goal will be achieved by (a)
enabling equitable access to education and (b) promoting educational quality through a participatory
approach to decentralized school cluster improvement planning, performance-based resource
management and supportive government policy and administration.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project will consist of two components: (1) Enabling Equitable Access to Education; and (2)
Supporting Education Quality Improvements.

The project will be structured around how the central government, provincial and district offices, teacher
training institutions and school clusters can best act as a support network to bring about changes in
teaching and learning at the classroom level. Sustainable and quality enhancing management, financial,
supervisory and pedagogical practices will be promoted so as to foster greater efficiency and
effectiveness in educational service delivery and administration.

Component 1: Enabling Equitable Access to Education for Disadvantaged Children. This
component seeks to achieve more equitable access to education by addressing constraints to schooling
access for disadvantaged children, especially in lower secondary and primary education. This objective
will be achieved through two approaches: (a) by expanding education facilities in currently poor and
under-served areas and (b) by supporting demand-side interventions and policies to foster participation in
schooling.

1.1. Expanding educational facilities in poor and underserved areas. This sub-component will
include assistance for additional classrooms in incomplete primary schools which do not offer the full
Grade 1 through 6 range, currently overcrowded schools and/or where demand is projected to grow
quickly. Facilities development at the primary level is expected to help increase student enrollments as
well as reduce high dropout and repetition rates. In addition, the project will also provide additional
Grades 7 to 9 facilities in districts and communes without lower secondary schools.

1.2. Reducing access barriers for disadvantaged children. MoEYS recognizes that simply expanding
the number of schools will not suffice to increase participation in lower secondary education, particularly
among the lowest poverty quintiles. The project will look to demand-side interventions and policy

                                                         2
                                                                                                           ISDS



measures as a means to address barriers to secondary education. The burden of direct and indirect costs
is an area of particular concern. MoEYS is currently piloting several scholarship schemes, targeting poor
children and especially girls and ethnic minority children. The lessons learned from these experiences
will inform the appropriateness, scope, design and sustainability of related interventions financed through
the project. A program of smaller awards, where financing would be available in selected poor
communities to all children enrolled in school, is also under consideration.

Component 2: Supporting Education Quality Improvements. The objective of this component is to
support education quality improvements through three broad avenues: by strengthening decentralized
school quality improvement planning, by enhancing teacher professional development, and by
establishing a quality assurance and monitoring system. This component will strive to guide Ministry
agencies at the central and local levels towards providing administrative and pedagogical support
services to school clusters as well as to strengthen the skills of educators and government officials to
enhance student outcomes.

2.1. Strengthening Decentralized School Quality Improvement Planning and Change. Clusters in
Cambodia were formed during the period of reconstruction in order to encourage schools to share scarce
human and material resources. They have since evolved into a vehicle for delivering teacher professional
training and improving communication between districts and schools. Some of the best clusters have
turned into true agents of development, with committees that meet regularly, conduct outreach activities
with communities, raise funds, and conceive and implement development activities in schools, including
cluster development plans to improve student access and education quality. The goal of this
sub-component is to strengthen and extend the cluster school network so that more clusters are prepared
to act as true "agents of development." It is expected to include: (a) provision of technical assistance at
the district and/or provincial levels to upgrade skills of local educators and administrators to develop
comprehensive school plans with community participation; (b) cluster capacity building in technical,
financial, and management skills to implement, support, and monitor quality improvement strategies; and
(c) training for staff to assume the role of school cluster "support agents."

2.2. Enhancing Teacher Professional Development. Working closely with the Teacher Education
Department (TED) and Provincial Offices of Education and Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs), the
project will support a comprehensive approach to improve pre- and in-service teacher training, strengthen
synergies between the institutions in charge of their delivery, and reinforce the linkages between cluster
improvement plans and decentralized teacher professional development. Activities will include the
development of a comprehensive pre- and in-service support program based at the TTCs. This program
would aim to support the increased production of newly qualified teachers, to upgrade teaching staff
skills, improve the quality of available (in- but also pre-service) training programs and bring teacher
training colleges more closely in contact with school practitioners. Activities would also aim to support
Teacher Education Department staff responsible for teacher professional development and to foster the
utilization of student assessment data to improve classroom teaching and learning.

2.3. Establishing a National Quality Assurance and Monitoring System. MoEYS has set as a goal to
establish a national assessment system. This will be a mechanism to evaluate education quality and
student achievement at the primary (and secondary) levels through a national standardized test on a
continuous basis. The national assessment system is expected to operate as a permanent tool for
monitoring student outcomes and will complement the existing education management information
system. Assessment data could serve as an input for diagnosing the performance of pupils as well as
providing feedback to enable the identification of gaps in learning outcomes not only at the national but
also, potentially, at the school, cluster, district, and/or province levels. This information will guide the

                                                                3
                                                                                                                   ISDS



development of relevant materials to enhance student learning, feed into teacher professional
development schemes, and inform curriculum policy and education reform processes.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

Component 1: Enabling Equitable Access to Education for Disadvantage Children:
1.1. Expanding Education Facilities in Poor and Underserved Areas
    Most incomplete schools are found in poor rural and remote areas (93%). In the poorest quintile,
    only 13% of schools offer the mandated six grades of primary schooling. Ratcliffe, Perry and Lee
    estimate that approximately 25% of the primary school student population face barriers to grade
    progression due to incomplete schools. This may be a factor contributing to student dropout rates.

    With regards to lower secondary education access, increasing representation from the poorest
    families is a key element of the Government's poverty reduction strategy. Approximately 60% of
    students enrolled in Grades 7-9 come from the richest two quintiles, while just over 20% come from
    the poorest two quintiles.

    Absence of lower secondary facilities in the poorest communes has been identified as a key obstacle
    for increasing access. According to Ratcliffe and Lee (2003), about 65% of communes--that is
    about 1,100 localities--have no lower secondary schools easily accessible.

1.2. Reducing Access Barriers for Disadvantaged Children to Attend Lower Secondary School
    No firm determinations have been made yet about the nature and characteristics of the demand-side
    incentive program to be implemented. In all likelihood, it will be a program with nationwide
    coverage, building on the pilot experiences already ongoing in Cambodia.

Component 2: Supporting Education Quality Improvements:
2.1. Strengthening Decentralized School Quality Improvement Planning and Change
    An effective school cluster depends to some extent on the ability of the member schools to meet
    frequently and share experiences. Proximity of the schools to one another therefore plays a
    significant role. Interaction becomes time consuming and expensive for far flung schools. Hence,
    the focus of this activity will likely be in the central plains provinces.

2.2. Enhancing Teacher Professional Development
    This component will likely be implemented at the Provincial and Regional Training Colleges of the
    following locations, where these two institutions are in close proximity: Battambang, Kandal, Phnom
    Penh, Prey Veng and Takeo. But these localities are still up for discussion.

2.3. Establishing a National Quality Assurance and Monitoring System.
    This component will be implemented from Phnom Penh.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
OP 4.01 -- Environmental Assessment
Due to the small scale of civil works in this project, a formal environmental assessment will not be
necessary for individual sub-projects. For construction on existing sites, appropriate clauses in
construction bidding documents and contracts regarding environmental issues such as dust and noise
control, waste management, site management, and provision of clean water and sanitation facilities will
be included. For construction on new sites, the project will use an environmental screening process.
OP 4.04 -- Natural Habitats
The project will not finance components that would significantly convert or degrade any known natural
habitats or any established or proposed critical natural habitats as defined under the policy.
OP 4.09 -- Pest Management
The project will not procure any pesticides nor will an increased use of pesticides result from the project.
OPN 11.03 (being converted to OP 4.11) -- Cultural Property
Due to the community-based aspect of the construction contracts and the limited size of the civil works,
the project will not likely finance activities that will adversely affect sites having archeological,
paleontological, historical, religious, or unique natural values.
OD 4.20 (being converted to OP 4.10) -- Indigenous Peoples (IP)
Project activities will be focused on poor areas and those areas may contain indigenous ethnic minorities;
however, at this stage of the project preparation process there are no specific interventions in the project
for them. Overall, the project will strive to have a positive impact on the livelihoods of indigenous
ethnic minorities and this will be subject of social analysis and consultation during the design process.
The task team and the safeguards team will meet again as soon as the geographic scope of the project has
been determined to discuss the project's approach to indigenous ethnic minorities.
OP 4.12 -- Involuntary Resettlement
It is highly unlikely that any land acquisition or resettlement will take place under the project. Sites will
be screened during project preparation to determine whether land acquisition is required.
OP 4.36 -- Forestry
The project will not finance activities that would involve significant conversion or degradation of critical
forest areas or related critical natural habitats as defined under the policy.
OP 4.37 -- Safety of Dams
The project will not be financing construction or rehabilitation of any large dams as defined under this
policy.
OP 7.50 -- International Waterways
There are no known project components involving international waterways as defined under the policy.
OP 7.60 -- Disputed Areas
The project is not located in any known disputed areas as defined under the policy.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues



II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Improving access to basic education demands close contact and dialogue with parents, communities and
local stakeholders. The project will promote local participation and involvement through a variety of
avenues, such as community-contracting schemes for school facilities development, participation of local
management committees in demand-side incentive programs and community involvement in school
cluster planning and management. The issue of gender disparity in schools is an area of particular
concern. The project design will strive to increase the share of female students at primary and secondary
schools.
