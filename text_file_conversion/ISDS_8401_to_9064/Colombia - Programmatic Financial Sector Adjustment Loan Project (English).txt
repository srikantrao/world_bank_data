I.A.2. Proiect Obiectives
The objective of the loan is to complete the clean up of the banking system as a result of the 1999-2001
crisis and to strengthen the government's capacity to manage and mitigate weaknesses in the financial
system At the same time the objective is to prevent crisis contagion effects from neighboring countries or
other exogenous events, by utilizing strong regulatory incentives for prudential management, market risk-
sharing mechanisms and optimal supervisory powers to expeditiously contain any emerging risks in the
financial system. The project also aims to strengthen and diversify the participation of the housing
mortgage market as well as of non bank financial services and securities institutions in the financial system
in order to implant a framework which provides more liquidity in the markets and diversifies the sources of
finance for investors and actors in the real economy. At an institutional level, the objective will be to
strengthen the capabilities and financial/supervisory institutions while strengthening the legislation to
incorporate areas of corporate accountability, governance and risk management as key elements in the
regulatory strategy.



I A 3 Protect Description
Banking Sector A key aspect of the proposed program is the design of a multi pronged effort to
first dispose of the financial system's residual loan assets (or collateral) remaining from the interventions
during the earlier crisis, by developing more agile and modern financial instruments and fiduciary
arrangements to package assets according to credit rankings while making collateral liquidation procedures
more agile and effective As part of this effort, the remaining intervened banks are expected to be divested
and the largest second tier problem bank will be wound down. Simultaneously, prudential regulations and
supervision would be strengthened to incorporate corporate governance rules, restrictions on related parties
and consolidated economic group activities, as well as the development of a graduated sanctions regime to
ensure corrective behavior by financial institutions.
Housing Finance and Non Banzks: As part of mortgage market reform, the program will address
the micro credit sector and promote further credit access through the development of credit instruments
targeted to the micro housing sector. This includes providing market funding from banks to local finance
companies for housing loans, and permitting banks to offer housing leases with conversion options. More
importantly the securitization industry will be further developed to support bank asset sales, to provide
more liquidity to the mortgage industry, and to help develop the capital markets Simultaneously, a reform
of the capital requirements and risk management regulations applicable to insurance companies, trusts, and
pension funds, will be implemented to ensure the solvency of these institutions which increasingly manage
large sums of savings which are channeled into financial and real investments in the domestic economy.
Capital Markets and Government Securities In additiun, a reform of the entire securities
legislation will be conducted as part of the program's second phase, to promote a more agile development
of the local capital market. This will involve reforming corporate governance and disclosure standards as
well as fit-and-proper criteria for securities industry participants. At the same time a streamlining and
adjusting of the benchmarks and exposure risks of the government debt market will take place to enable the
creation of a reference yield curve and a regular issuance cycle which can support the development of the
private fixed income securities market. Finally, given the unique environment in Colombia, the above
reforms are supported by specialized measures to monitor and detect laundered money flows associated
with the drug trade or terrorist activity
