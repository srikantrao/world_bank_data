I.A.2. Project Objectives
The overall objective of the project is to reduce emissions of greenh1ouse gases generated at Svilosa This
objective would be achiieved througlh: a) substitution of coal with residual wood as a fuel for power- and
heat generation resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and b) depletion of a stockpile of
wood residue which will reduce methane emissions
Emission Reduction units (ERs) will be sold to the Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF) followilig annual
independent certification of the emission reduction achievemenits. ERs will be certified under the
provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, which is a multilateral agreement to reduce greenhouse gases  The
Kyoto Protocol is not yet in effect since sufficient countries, representing 55%  of Annex B
(industrialized country) CO emission levels (1990), have not yet ratified the agreement However, with
the ratification by Russia, expected in 2003, the Kyoto Protocol would be effective Irrespective of the
regulatory risk of the protocol not being effective, PCF has pledged to purchase the ERs. This precludes
any risks to Svilosa arising from the delays in effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol.
I.A.3. Project Description:
Component A. Biomass Boiler The project will add a 14 MW biomass boiler to the Svilosa plaiit to
generate heat. The biomass boiler will be fueled by wood waste from two sources (i) waste generated in
the production process; and (ii) waste stockpiled on site since 1994  This will reduce the coal
consumption at the CHP plant (Figure 1).
A biomass boiler will be built to utilize the wood wastes produced at the plant and supply heat to the
cellulose part of the production process. The biomass boiler will displace approximately 13,679 tons/

year of coal used in the CHP power plant, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with using
coal in power productioni, and reduce methanie emissions associated with stockpiling waste by using
wood wastes as feedstock. Certified greenhouse gas emission reductions will be sold to the PCF
Component B: Emissioni Reductioll Monitoring and Certification A Baseline Study has been conducted
and a Monitoring Plan (MP) has been prepared to guide the monitorinig and verification process duriig
project implementation  The MP includes clearly defined indicators to observe and verify the continued
performance of the project. The verification process involves periodic auditinig of monitoring results, the
assessmenit of achieved emission reductionis and the project's contillued conformiaice with all relevant
criteria. Verification will be conducted at regular intervals durinig the operational phase of the project by
a third and independent entity. Verified emission reductions will be certified to provide assurance that, in
the verification period, the project has achieved the stated ERs in compliance withi all relevant criteria

Emission Reductions
The actual ERs would be dependent on the biomass produced at Svilosa which is linked to the market
and production of the company. The ERs are also dependent on the volume of methane generated from
the stockpiled wood wastes In the Term Sheet signed between the PCF and Svilosa, PCF has agreed to
purchase a minimum ERs of 500,000 tCO2eq over the period 2004 to 2012 with an option to purchase up
to 1,000,000 teCO2eq of ERs.
I A.4. Project Locatioin (Geograpihic location, information about the key environmenital and social
characteristics of the area and populationi likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Svilosa Pulp Factory, Svilosa AD, is located in the Shvistov area of Bulgaria This project will be
implemented within the grounds of the existing Svilosa pulp and cellulose plant site.
B. Clheck Environmenttal Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The project rating is B since no irreversible environmental damage will occur. In general the
environmental benefits of the project are significant. The environmental impacts of the project are minor and
related to the construction period.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Sumntary of Key Sofeguard Issues Please fill i17 all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data
II D.la. Describe any safeguard issues and iilpacts associated with the proposed project Identify and
describe any potential large scale, signilficanit and/or irreversible impacts.
Svilosa has received confirmation from the MOEW (Decision #2-PR/2003 dated February 3, 2003) that
an EIA report is not required for the Biomass Boiler project. An EMP for the biomass boiler project has
been prepared in line with Bank requirements
The installation of the biomass boiler has positive environmental benefits Apart from the reduction in
greenhouse gases, there will be a reduction in local air pollutants. Further, there will be a reduction in
the residual biomass stockpile. In addition, due to less use of coal there will be a reduction of 3,000 tons
of ash requiring proper disposal. The characteristics of the ash generated from the biomass boiler will be
similar to the ash generated from the CHP As a result, the ash from the biomass plant would be disposed
in the ash disposal site for the CHP plant.
II.D.1 b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
There are no cumulative impacts associated with the application of more thani one safeguard policy. There is
only a single project component.
11 D.lc Describe any potential long term iilpacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area
No future activities are expected to impact this project
II.D.2 In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not applicable
II.D 3 Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
The Environmental Managemilenlt Plan has been prepared for the installation of the biomass boiler on
Svilosa's site and covers both constructioni-related issues and operating impacts. Design of the boiler
provides for control of particulate emissions within the required levels by Bulgaria's environmenital
regulations  Provisions are made to miniilize dust, noise and water pollutioni during constructionl.
During operation, particulates, sulphur dioxide and NOx from the boiler will be monitored and ash will
be disposed as per Bulgaria's environimenltal regulations. Wood supply sustainability will be ensured

throughi compliance with Bulgaria's National Forestry Managemenit Plan.
IL.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechaniisimis for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Followinig Bank's environmental guidelines, a public discussion was held on December 11, 2002
regarding the Draft Environimiental Managemenit Plan (EMP) for the Biomass Boiler Project at Svilosa
During the hearing the EMP was presented and comments were solicited. Questions were raised on the
rationale for the project and the boiler design. No specific environimenital issues were raised. Minutes of
this meeting are included in the EMP.
E. Safeguardls Classification Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
] S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significanit technical and institutionial risks
in management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally maniageable
[ ] S3 - No safeguard issues
] SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development fuLids, community driven development or
similar projects whichi require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
safeguard issues.
