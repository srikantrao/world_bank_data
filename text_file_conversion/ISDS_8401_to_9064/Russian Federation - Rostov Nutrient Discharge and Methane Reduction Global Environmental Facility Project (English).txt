I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
(i) Global Objectives

In a period of only three decades (1960s-1980s), the Azov/Black Sea basin has suffered serious
degradation of a major part of its natural resources. The water resources of the basin are facing
particularly acute problems generated as a result of pollution from nutrients, organic materials, oil
products, and significant modification of the hydrological regimes of the Don River. The Greater
Rostov Environmental Strategic Action Plan (GRESAP) and various publications (e.g. A Water
Quality Assessment of the Former Soviet Union (1998)/Eds. V. Kimstach, M. Meybeck, E.
Baroudy, E&F.N. Spon, London. Chapter 14. The Lower Don Basin) name the RVK municipal
wastewater facility as the principal source of pollution on the Don River. It is the largest single
point source of discharges of phosphorus and nitrogen substances to the Don River and Azov
basin. Such discharges are responsible for the stimulation of aquatic plants and contribute to the
eutrophication of these bodies of water.        Estimates show that the city of Rostov-on-Dov
discharges annually about 2,000 tons of nitrogen, measured as Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN),
and about 200 tons of phosphorus into the Don River. This constitutes about 10% of the overall
nutrient flux from the Don River into the watershed of Azov/Black Sea. Also, as a result of
inadequate capacity and insufficient configuration of the sewage treatment network,
20,000-30,000 thousand m3/day of municipal wastewater are being discharged untreated into the
Don River's tributary, the Temernik River, just a few kilometers upstream from the confluence of
the Temernik River with the Don River. The estimated amount of nutrient load reduction into the
Don (and thus into Azov/Black Sea) resulting from the project is about 1000 tons of nitrogen and
about 100 tons of phosphorus per year, corresponding to a reduction of about 27,000 tons of
nutrients over the project life.

                                                     2
                                                                                                         ISDS




The existing sludge handling technology results in substantial (estimated at 24,000 m3/day)
emissions of Green House Gases (GHG), particularly methane, from the wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP) facilities (the GHP of methane is 21 times the GHP of carbon dioxide). Low
environmental fines for methane discharges ($0.09 per 1000 m3) are a poor incentive for methane
collection. Released methane, when collected and utilized for power generation for the WWTP
needs, substantially reduces the GHG release. The estimated reduction of GHG emissions as a
result of the project will be about 771,000 tons of carbon equivalent over the project life.

(ii) Sub-Project: Reduction of Nutrient Discharges

Objectives

The key objective of the proposed sub-project is to reduce the discharge of nutrients (nitrogen
and phosphorous) into the Don River and the Azov /Black Seas through: (i) rehabilitation and
improvement of the wastewater treatment plant of the city of Rostov-on-Don (RVK WWTP); (ii)
configuration of the sewage network to reduce untreated wastewater overflow into the Temernik
River, a tributary of the Ron River; (iii) policy reform and pilot activities to promote phasing out
of phosphates and polyphosphate discharges into the Don River watershed; and (iv) replication of
a comprehensive nutrient reduction approach in other parts of Russia and riparian countries of the
Azov/Black Seas.

(iii) Sub-Project: Reduction of Methane Emission

Objectives

The key objective of the proposed sub-project is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from RVK WWTP through: (i) rehabilitation and extension of sludge digesters; (ii) capture and
combustion of methane gas; (iii) electric generation displacement; (iv) heat generation
displacement; (v) completion of the full chain of the sludge treatment process with sludge
dewatering and final disposal; and (vi) promotion of the replication of methane emission reduction
in municipal wastewater utilities in other parts of Russia and CIS countries.

As discussed above, the project will address the largest single point source of discharges of
phosphorus and nitrogen substances to the Don River and Azov basin as well as address the
discharge of untreated wastewater into the Don River's tributary, the Temernik River. This will
positively impact on the quality of water for intake by down-river communities. The use of
methane for energy production will also impact emissions of Green House Gases (GHG) in the
metropolitan area. These actions are important also as models for application in other areas along
the Don River basin.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
Not Applicable

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Not Applicable

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Not Applicable

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues

OP 7.50 "International Waterways" applies to this Project because it is located on the Don river about 80
kms of its inflow into the Azov Sea. The Azov Sea is connected to the Black Sea. Given the nature of the
planned interventions to be supported by the project and the fact that they will not impact adversely on
riparian countries, the exception to the international notification requirements of OP 7.50, as set forth in
paragraph 7(a) of the policy has already been confirmed for project preparation (designs and tender
documents) by the Bank's legal department. The exception to the notification requirements for the project
implementation activities will be sought before appraisal.


The conduct of a comprehensive Environmental Assessment (EA) and a Social Assessment (SA)
is an integral part of project preparation. The scope of work for the EA includes: (i) a description
of the environmental status of the pilot area (including physical, biological, social, and cultural
conditions); the collection and analysis of legal documents related to environmental management
and protection; (iii) the identification and assessment of other possible options and the
identification of any possible negative environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of
such options; (iv) the development of an Environmental Management Plan; and (V) the promotion
of coordination between agencies and the inclusion of civic participation in public decision making

The SA will: (i) identify and specify the roles of the main stakeholders of the Project; (ii) identify
the main consumer groups to be positively or negatively influenced by the implementation of the
Project, mainly downstream from the waste water treatment plant; (iii) identify the interests,
needs, and concerns of selected stakeholders regarding the goals, design, and implementation of
the Project; (iv) asses the possible immediate and long-term impact of the Project on the existing
land and eater use (including municipal engineering, agricultural use, recreational use, and fishery
production; (v) review the role of municipal engineering as one of the pollution sources, including
the quality of service delivery; and (vi) the identification of negative social-economic aspects of

potential impact of the Project on local industry, markets, and the general public, including a
Mitigation Action Plan (MAP) .

Provisions to ensure compliance with safeguard policies, including the EMP and AP, will be made
after completion of the studies at appraisal at latest.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The project is being prepared in close cooperation with the Oblast Government, municipality,
RVK, and local PIUs for two other Bank's projects. General public and NGOs have already been
involved in the preparation of the sewerage system configuration and will be involved in the
preparation of the wastewater treatment components through the environmental and social
assessment process described above.


E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
