Bank Approval: December 9, 2003                  IDA Amount ($m):
Managing Unit: LCSER                             Sector: Irrigation and drainage (100%)

Status: Lending                                 resource management (P)
I.A.2. Project Objectives:
The Project's main objective is to assist the Government in its efforts to adopt a new model to improve
the competitiveness of irrigated agriculture, in both Irrigation Districts (Distritos de Riego, DR) and
Irrigation Units (Unidades de Riego, UR), that would include the development of partnerships between
the public and private sectors as well as effective institutional collaboration within the public sector, plus
the strengthening of a demand-driven approach to investment decisions and financing. Specifically, the
main objective would be achieved through: (i) the modernization of existing irrigation infrastructure
within the framework of Integrated Investment Plans; (ii) increased productivity of irrigated agriculture
and diversification into high-value crops; (iii) consolidation of the transfer of irrigation infrastructure to
water users; (iv) institutional strengtheninig of water users' organizations to enhance their participation in
the O&M of irrigation infrastructure as well as in investment decisions; and (v) establishment of a
comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system.
I.A.3. Project Description:
The project is essentially a demand-driven project whose geographic location cannot be predetermined.
Financed subprojects would result in a net-saving of water in areas of over exploited acquifers.
Components:
1. Modernization and Rehabilitation of Irrigation Infrastructure in DRs and URs, including rehabilitation
of infrastructure works; purchase, conservation and repair of machinery and equipment.
2. Diversification and Intensification of Irrigated Agricultural Production, including technical and
financial assistance for the adoption of improved irrigation and farming technologies and equipment, and
promotion of improved marketing systems and sustainable farm development.

3. Institutional Development, including support to improve O&M of transferred irrigation infrastructure,
to promote the establishment of new service providers, strengthening of water users' associations and
executing agencies, both at the central and regional levels. Based on the recommendation of the ongoing
EA the Institutional Development Component would include attention to developing better capacity in
terms of environmental management, both at the central level and at the level of water districts and water
users.
4. Project Management, including the Project Coordinating Unit and support for the development and
operation of the Monitoring and Evaluation System.
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Project area includes only land already under irrigation, and therefore, there is no risk of disputed areas
or areas with preserved natural habitats being affected by the project.
B. Clheck Envirotinmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)
Comments. The project will finance the rehabilitation and improvement of existing irrigation systems, but
not irrigation expansion onto new areas.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D. Ia. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
See II.D.3
II.D.lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
The EA currently being prepared would analyze potential cummulative impacts of the project.
Il.D. I c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
N/A
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An Environmental Assessment will be carried out as part of preparation by a specialized consultant
supervised by the Environmental Specialist of the Bank's project Team. TORs have been developed in
accordance with the recommendations provided by the QAT and the PCD Review Meeting.
The project area includes only land already under irrigation, and therefore, there is no risk of disputed
areas. NH could be affected by the project since they could occur inbedded in agricultural areas or
downstream of project areas. The ongoing EA would address the mechanisms to ensure adequate
assessement of these issues in each subproject proposal. Since there will be no new works, the project
will not have to deal with involuntary resettlements. The need to develop a framework to address the
implications of the eventual decision to reduce the size of certain irrigation districts would be determined
prior to appraisal.
The increase in production and productivity and diversification activities may alter the level of pesticide
use, but recommendations for the appropriate use of pesticides will be included in the Irrigation
Management Plans.
Some applications still depend on works to be done during project preparation, for which terms of
reference are being prepared.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
1.1)   Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The project would adopt a demand-driven approach and, consequently, water users associations would be
involved at every stage of the decision-making process regarding the design and execution of investment
proposals and other activities to be financed under the project. Project preparation is being carried out in
consultation with tihe National Association of Water Users (ANUR).
There was a participation of Users' Associations during the preliminary identification of demand for
investments to rehabilitate water infrastructure, and they will have an active participation in the
preparation of the Irrigation Management Plans for each of the areas in which project investment
proposals will be implemented.
[ x ] Name and describe groups (how involved, and what they have influenced or may influence.)
ANUR is actively being consulted during project preparation
Irrigation Water Users' Associations, will be encouraged to submit their demands through their
respective Districts or Units
E. Safeguards Classification. Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis of
cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the
provisions of that policy apply.
