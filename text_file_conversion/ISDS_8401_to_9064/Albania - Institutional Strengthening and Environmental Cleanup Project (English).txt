I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The main objectives of the project are to foster government commitment to strengthening its
environmental policies and institutions, and managing critical environmental risks, particularly
hazardous chemical waste dumps that affect the most vulnerable and impoverished population
groups. These will be achieved through (a) institutional strengthening at the Ministry of Environment, at
the central and local levels and (b) a pilot project that will focus on clean up of a contaminated site in the
Durrës region.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
Component 1: Durrës Environmental Remediation Program (US$ 5.0 million)

This component includes investments in clean up and closure of the former chemical plant at Durres, the
dumpsite, chemical storage area, and other sites posing significant risk to the population. It also includes
implementation of a long term environmental monitoring program; implementation of a resettlement
and/or compensation program; and a long term master plan for future development of the area.

Component 2: Technical Assistance for Institutional Capacity Strengthening (US$ 2.0 million)

This component will finance TA to the Ministry of Environment for institutional strengthening to support
the development of: (i) economic instruments for environmental management, (ii) a regulatory
framework for control of hazardous waste, (iii) assessment of environmental impacts of sector policies,
(iv) improved capacity to monitor and ensure compliance with environmental laws and regulations and
(v) regulations and standards especially in the area of hazardous waste. The TA component of the
project has been designed both to focus on the areas covered by the investment component
(environmental remediation, particularly with respect to hazardous waste sites), and to complement TA
being offered by other donor agencies.

Component 3: Support for Project Implementation (US$ XX million)

This component will provide support for the PMU to be established within the Ministry of Environment,
including financing for short-term consulting assistance in areas such as financial management and
procurement, audit of the project accounts, and recurrent operating costs of the PMU.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites
or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Durres environmental remediation program will be implemented in the area of Porto Romano which is a
suburb north of Durres city, located on the coast of the Adriatic Sea. Porto Romano has a population of
about 5000. There are no protected areas, or sites or critical habitats, or any other culturally or socially
sensitive areas in the vicinity. From a historical perspective, the area has a few shelters along the coast
which were used in the past as sentry posts and firing areas for attackers from the sea. However, the
project is not likely to affect these in any way.

The institutional strengthening component is intended to provide country-wide support for environmental
capacity building and covers the Ministry of Environment in Tirana and its regional offices in all Prefects.


B. Check Environmental Classification: A (Full Assessment)

Comments: The environmental remediation at Durres will impact an area broader than the sites or
facilities subject to the remediation. A detailed environmental impact assessment should be
undertaken to provide appropriate guidelines for the clean up works and ensure that the project will
result in positive environmental impacts.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Major environmental issues concern capping or excavation of a 6 ha dump site containing
   chromium, HCH isomers and other toxic compounds; demolition and disposal of contaminated
   soil/structures from the chemical plant and dump site; re-packaging and transport of 700 tons of

                                                       3
                                                                                                         ISDS



   chemicals; and resettlement of 10-15 families living on the premises of the former chemical
   plant. Appropriate mitigation measures will be needed to prevent, minimize or respond to any
   inadvertent releases of toxic materials into the environment while carrying out the clean up
   works. The excavation or capping of the dumpsite may affect groundwater supplies and drainage
   conditions in the area and the works will have to be designed with due consideration to the
   hydrogeology of the area. Guidelines will be needed for the transportation and storage of
   chemicals and waste materials off site and the final destinations for these materials will need to
   be assessed from environmental considerations. A long term monitoring program will be
   established to help asses the post-remediation contamination levels, and the degree of clean up
   and dilution and dispersion of contaminants achieved over time.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
N/A

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Long term enviornmental conditions in the project area are expected to improve significantly as a result
of the remediation works,
opening up opportunities for land development for housing, hotel or other construction with
ugraded/expanded utility works (water, power).

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
An evaluation of remediation alternatives from environmental considerations is integral to the project design
   and results of the technical study with respect to these will be incorporated into the environmental
   assessment report. The EA will state the basis for selecting the particular project design from
   among the available alternatives and justify the recommended remediation approach from
   environmental considerations.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
A detailed Environmental Impact Assessment and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be prepared,
focusing on: (i) protection of the local population from dissemination of contaminated material during
the site cleanup; (ii) ongoing monitoring of the site and landfill to guard against future re-contamination
of the area; and (iii) resettlement of families currently residing within the contaminated areas and
requiring relocation.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Public meetings will be organized (one during preparation of the TOR and another when draft
EA is available) to discuss the scope of the EA and its findings with the relevant stakeholders,
including the Durres environmental and health agencies, the Durres municipal authorities, the
water utlity, local experts and NGOs, and the population living in and around the contaminated
areas. The agenda, participants and proceedings of the consultation meetings will be recorded in
the EA report. The EA will be disclosed in the country (in local language and in English) and at
the Bank's Infoshop prior to Appraisal and the Executive Summary sent to the Board 120 days
prior to the Board date. The TOR for the EA will be provided to ECSSD for review and clearance.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy.
Or on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is

triggered the provisions of that policy apply.


[X] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks
         in management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
         technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
         similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address
         safeguard issues.
