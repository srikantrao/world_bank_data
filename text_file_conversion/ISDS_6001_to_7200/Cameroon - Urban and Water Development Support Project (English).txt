B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project development objective is to increase access of the urban population, particularly 
those living in low-income settlements to basic infrastructure and services, including water 
supply.  To achieve this objective, the project will (i) assist the various stakeholders of urban 
development in the preparation and implementation of tools and investments designed to 
increase access to services to as large a number of beneficiaries as possible; and (ii) support and 
facilitate the implementation of the public-private partnership in urban water services.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will include three main components, as follows: 
 
1. 
Capacity building and support to decentralization   (Estimated cost: US$3 million).  
 
(a)  National urban database: a database 
ñ
currently lacking ñ will be developed to (i) assess the 
demographic and economic importance of cities; (ii) identify their respective functions and 
hierarchy in Cameroonís urban network; and (iii)determine, at the local level, the public 
investments that would have the most impact on economic development and poverty reduction.  
The objective will be to establish a system for regular monitoring of urban data and management 
Page  2
indicators independent from projects and technical assistance.  In the long term, this system 
would provide the basis for implementing a national urban public investment program (PIP), 
facilitate identification of cities eligible for city development contracts, and contribute to 
reaching sector strategy goals.  
 
(b)  Capacity building:  provision of municipal management tools, training, and technical 
assistance to the municipalities in order to improve planning, programming, maintenance 
management, as well as mobilization and utilization of local financial resources. Training 
programs will be tailored to the size of the municipality; some support will also be provided to 
the ministries in charge of decentralization and urban development.  
 
(c)  Preparing and implementation of city development contracts in pilot cities 
ñ
Bamenda, 
Douala (three urban municipalities),Maroua, Mbalmayo, and Yaound√© (two urban 
municipalities)  (Estimated cost: US$1 million).  
 
The choice of cities was made by the Cameroonian authorities on the basis of their importance 
and representativity in the national urban setting, their accessibility, and the presence of previous 
initiatives carried out by the Bank (Douala) or other donors in the context of city consultations 
for example.  
 
The objective of the city contracts will be to render the municipalities responsible for the choice 
and financing of a set of actions to be carried out within the framework of a program by 
contracting interventions.  These contracts will be agreed upon and engage the responsibility of 
three partners ñ the local authority, the central government, and the beneficiary communities-.  
The contract will define reciprocal commitments by the three parties on the basis of a program 
including a definition of objectives, priorities, an action plan, responsibilities, a financial plan, 
and provisions for monitoring and evaluation.  
 
The component will include (i) the preparation of technical and financial audits in each of the 
municipality in order to identify the gaps in terms of capacity to carry out the city development 
contracts; (ii) support to implementation of a participative process of preparation of the contracts 
;
(iii) training and technical assistance, on the basis of the findings and recommendations of the 
audits; and (iv) strengthening of the financial management capacity in place in each of the 
municipalities, and support to increasing financial resources.  
 
2. 
Infrastructure works in low-income settlements.  (Estimated cost: US$30 million).  
 
Infrastructure upgrading operations will be carried out with a view to increase access to basic 
services.  The works will be carried out in the same pilot cities.  Selection of neighborhoods will 
be based on population density, existing level of access to services, areas suitable for 
construction, and presence of community participation.  Investments will include small 
infrastructure works (primarily roads and drainage) as well as construction or repair of social 
facilities (such as classrooms or health centers). The methodology will be based on the 
experience of Douala.  It will underline (i) the core role of the municipalities; (ii) extensive 
participation on the part of the beneficiary communities; (iii) search for an adequate level of 
service, on the basis of affordability and arbitrage by the beneficiaries; (iv) gradual solutions, 
Page  3
allowing for a progressive improvement in the level of service; (v) absence of resettlement, to the 
extent possible; (vi) planning and budgeting of maintenance activities from the start; and (viii) 
use of local resources (local SMEs, labor-intensive techniques, and local construction materials).  
 
3. 
Support to the implementation of the public-private partnership in urban water services.  
(Estimated cost: US$20 million)  
 
(a)  Capacity Building: to ensure a smooth implementation of the PPP, it is necessary to build 
the capacity of the public parties to monitor and regulate, as well as plan investments, which will 
remain the responsibility of the public sector. The project will thus assist in developing the 
regulatory framework and regulatory tools, providing technical assistance, and strengthening the 
capacities of the (public) asset-holding company and of the technical ministry.  
 
(b) ) Improvement and development of access and of the quality of services: the project will 
help finance priority rehabilitation works and equipment and to promote access of the poor 
through a social connections program and other poverty-focused activities.

E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Borrower institutional capacity in addressing safeguards issues will be further assessed, and 
the Government tea

will receive needed guidance from the Bankís Safeguards specialist on the 
project team.

The project is not anticipated to cause any irreversible damage to the environment, or to 
forcibly displace beneficiaries from their land. However, infrastructure upgrading and small 
scale civil works like construction or repair of social facilities (such as classrooms or health 
centers) have the propensity to generate potential site specific environmental and social impacts. 
To this end, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) will have to be 
prepared by the borrower.

It is stated that social and economic infrastructure projects will be supported by this project. 
These planned interventions are not expected to lead to new land acquisition or restriction of 
access to sources of livelihood. However, a Rese
ttlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be
