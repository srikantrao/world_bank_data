B. ProjectObjectives [fromsection 2 of PCN]:
The project development objective is to reduce emissionsof greenhousegas by rehabilitating
smallhydro power plants (SHP) and increasing the capacityby about 23 MW. In addition, the
project will supportthe development of an internationalmarket mechanism for "Emission
Reductions" (ERs) under the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, especiallythrough developing a
model to bundle small-scaleprojects to reduce ER in Georgia.

C. ProjectDescription [fromsection 3 of PCN]:
This is a carbon financetransaction of the World Bank in which ER credits generated from the
sub-projectsof the underlyingProject will be purchased by the World Bank carbon funds.
Project preparation is being supportedby USAID, with actual constructionproposed for
financing 50%by EBRD and 50%by the Bank of Georgia.

The Project is designed to provide the technical and financial tools required to rehabilitate
existinghydropower plants to create at least 16MW of additionalsmall,runof the river hydro

capacity. USAID has prepared the technical feasibilitystudiesfor 24 potential sub-projects to
determinetheir potential, technicalneeds, costs, and likelybenefits. Nine (9) sub-projects have
been pre-selected by USAID for the first year of the Project to develop at least 11MW of
additionalcapacity. Additional 10sub-projectshave been proposed for the second year of the
Project, which is expected to add 14MW capacity.

The vast majority of the sub-projectswill require simplerehabilitation of turbines, generators,
lines, transformers, waterways, and otherbasic components. USAID will assist in the
developmentof the sub-projects,and provide technical supportand grants (about 30% of total
costs). The sub-project developerwill provide a minimum of 5% equity in the rehabilitations.
The 50 %of the projects costs will be financedby EBRD and 50 %by the Bank of Georgia. The
loan of the Bank of Georgiawill be backed by EBRD.

D. Projectlocation and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguardanalysis
(if known):

The Project will rehabilitate about 24 existing,runof the river SHPs, includingnine in the first
year, in 10of 11regions in Georgia. These 24 SHPsare locatedmostly in a hilly terrainwith
sparsepopulation density. About a handful of off-grid Mini-Hydro Plants of the capacitybelow
10KW will also be newly constructedon the run-of-river.

E. Borrower's InstitutionalCapacity for SafeguardPolicies:
USAID will prepare EnvironmentalManagementPlan and monitor its compliance. USAID has
safeguardpolicies similarto the Bank and an environmentalspecialistwill be hired at the
CountryOffice.

11. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHTAPPLY

SafeguardPolicies Triggered (fieuse explain why)                   Yes          No         TBD
Environmental Assessment(OPIBP4.01)                                 X
    The project will rehabilitate 24 existingrun of the river mini-hydroplants that are located
mostly in hilly terrain and a couple of new mini-hydroplants will be constructedon the run-of-
rivers. The rehabilitationof 3 SHPswill involve constructionworks.
Natural Habitats (OPIBP 4.04)                                                                X
    The selectedrehabilitation and constructionof mini-hydro plants on run-of-rivers may
impact on natural habitats of the surroundingareas, including during the constructionstage.
Forests (OPIBP 4.36)                                                                         X
    The watersheds of these rivers where the min-hydro plants are located may have forests
coversthat need to be protected or rehabilitated to minimize silting of the rivers. The proposed
new facilitiesmay also encroachon existingforests. At least one SHP requires replacement of
the pressure channel leadingto the encroachmentto the forest. Access roads to the construction
sitesmay also lead to the encroachments.

Pest Management (OP 4.09)                                                                              X

PhysicalCulturalResources (OP/BP 4.11)                                                                                  X
    The proposed rehabilitation and constructionsof the mini-hydro plants may impact on
existing cultural heritage sites or the storage areasof the constructionfirms may be within
culturally sensitiveareas.
IndigenousPeoples (OP/BP 4.10)                                                                         X

InvoluntaryResettlement (OP/BP 4.12)                                                                                    X
    The rehabilitationand new constructionof the canals,weirs, dams, and power plants, and
accessto the facilitiesmay require the resettlement of the present inhabitants in the immediate
vicinities.
Safety of Dams (OPIBP4.37)                                                                                              X
    The planned works include earthworks that may have safetyof dams issues sinceGeorgia is
a seismicallyactivezone.
Projectson International Waterways (OP/BP7.50)                                                          X
