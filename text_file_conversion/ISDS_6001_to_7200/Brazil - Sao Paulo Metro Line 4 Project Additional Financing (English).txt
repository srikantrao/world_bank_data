                                                                                                            Brazil, within a metropolitan area comprising some 17 million inhabitants. Once built, Line 4
                                                                                                            will be concessioned to a private operator under a 30-year contract. The project has two main
                                                                                                            components. Part A is an Infrastructure and Equipment Investment Component to: (i) build Line

4 under a BOT type contract including the transfer stations between the metro, commuter rail,
buses, autos, and non-motorized transport; and (ii) finance the Project Management and project
supervision consultants. Part B is an Institutional and Policy Development Component: (i)
support the concession of Line 4 to the private sector; (ii) undertake a cost-efficiency study of the
Sao Paulo Metro.

D. Project location (if known)
The 13 km metrorail line is located mostly underground in the city of Sao Paulo, capital of the
State of Sao Paulo, Brazil extending from the Luz Railway Station in westward to Vila Sonia
west of the Pinheiros River. The Project will (i) serve as a "bridge" between Metro's Line 5 and
CPTM 's West commuter line to the Metro network, (ii) interconnect with all three existing
Metro lines to provide a grid flexibility to the Metro network that does not exist with the present
radial configuration, and (iii) interconnect two Paulista Metropolitan Trains (CPTM) commuter
rail lines. At the end of the project, the entire metrorail network will be interconnected thereby
facilitating access to most of the sectors of the SPMR.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
The Sao Paulo Metropolitan Trains Company has a professional staff of engineers, social
scientists and other professionals who manage and monitor programs from a social and
environmental perspective. It has built and currently operates a subway system that moves some
2.6 million passengers per day, making it one of the busiest systems in the world. As a public
authority, Metro works closely with the State Environmental Agency, CETESB to monitor the
environmental impact of its operations, particularly during the planning and construction phases.
The project received a construction license from the Sao Paulo State Environmental Secretariat
in 2001 following submission of an Environmental Impact Assessment and holding several
public audiences. The final stage of the licensing procedure will come when the system is
nearing readiness for operation.

 As a result of the accident that occurred at the Pinheiros Station site on January 12, 2006, Metro
has sought the assistance of the Institute for Technical Research (IPT) of the University of S?o
Paulo, one of the premier applied research institutions of South America to diagnose the causes
of the accident and to carry out technical studies on the geological substrate and structural
soundness of buildings in the vicinity of the accident site.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
    would be prepared: 04/03/2007

B. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage
    ISDS: N/A

C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
    Because this is an additional financing, the project already has an Environmental
    Assessment, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and a Resettlement Action Plan
    (RAP). During preparation of the Additional Financing package the project team will update
    the EMP and RAP and assess the adequacy of the original EA, EMP and RAP. The
    Borrower will prepare an updated abbreviated RAP and describe the procedures followed to
    accommodate the persons dislocated, temporarily or permanently, by the January 12, 2007
    accident.
