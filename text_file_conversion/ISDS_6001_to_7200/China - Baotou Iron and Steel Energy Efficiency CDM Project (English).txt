2. Project Objectives

The development objective of the proposed project is to mitigate global environmental
impacts of carbon dioxide (COz) emissions through purchase of C02 emissions avoided
by the operation of the Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) project of the Baotou Iron and Steel
Group Co. (BISCO) under the clean development mechanism (CDM).

3. Project Description

8.      The certified emission reductions (CERs) will be generated by the operation of
the CDQ project. The proposed project was approved as a CDM project by NDRC in
2007. It consists of three sets of CDQ heat recovery boilers (No. 1, 2, 3) and steam
turbine generators at the back of six coke ovens (No. 5 to 10)' to utilize the heat from
red-hot coke for power generation. The total installed capacity of the three sets of power
generators operating on recovered waste heat is 45 MW (3X15MW) with an expected net
electricity generation of around 250 GWh per year. The investment cost of the CDQ
project was US$67,5m.

9.      COz Emission Reduction Estimation. Electricity generated by these generators
would replace the same amount of electricity that BISCO otherwise would have to

purchase from the coal-fired power plants of the power grid, thus resulting in reduced
GHG emissions. The Danish Carbon Fund (DCF) intends to purchase an annual amount
of 214,000 tC02eemission reductions, with a total purchased amount of 1,070,000tC02e
during the five-year transaction period (2008-12) (Table 1).

11. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1.Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant andlor irreversible impacts:

The CDQ process utilizes pure nitrogen gas to quench newly formed coke in a quasi-
sealed quench chamber. The heated nitrogen is then circulated to a heat recovery boiler
that raises steam to drive a turbine generator.

Conventional coke wet quenching (CWQ) is done in a virtually open system with water.
There is no heat/energy recovery and substantial air pollution is incurred as the cooling
water sprayed onto the coke instantly vaporizes to steam and entrains particulates and a
variety of other pollutants (VOCs, H2S, phenols, etc.) formed as by-products of the
coking process.

The CDQ nitrogen quench cycle proceeds as follows: newly formed red-hot coke is
pushed from the oven in the same manner as with CWQ. However, the coke now drops
into a circular bucket shaped container with capacity for the full oven charge. The bucket
filled with hot coke then moves on rail track to a position adjacent to the nitrogen quench
tower. The bucket is lifted mechanically to the top of the quench tower and then moved
laterally until it is positioned over the tower inlet port. At this point, a cover is lowered
over the top of the bucket and the bucket bottom opens, releasing the hot coke into the
nitrogen quench tower. When the charge is completed, the empty bucket is moved back
laterally to the lift position and is lowered to the rail track to receive a fresh charge of hot
coke.

Since there is direct contact between the hot coke and the nitrogen quench gas, any
residual dust, VOCs etc. are transferred to the nitrogen quench gas. Build-up of these
pollutants is controlled in three ways: (a) some nitrogen quench gas is purged during the
charging of the hot coke at the top of the quench tower and the discharging of the cooled
coke at the bottom of the tower, (b) introduction of small amounts of air into the nitrogen
recirculation system oxidizes any residual VOCs and (c) bag house dust collectors
removes over 99.9 per cent of the dust in the nitrogen recirculation system. The hot
nitrogen gas is then sent to a waste heat recovery boiler, generating high pressure steam
to drive a turbine and consequently generate electricity.

The system is far superior to the wet quench systems utilizing water spray where air
pollutants are released in a completely uncontrolled manner. So in addition to the energy
recovery benefits, there are unquestionable environmental benefits as well. The
discharges of dust during the coke chargingldischarging processes were the only
environmental issue, and these emissions are far less than the releases associated with
CWQ.

Environmental due diligence has been carried out to confirm compliance with relevant
Chinese environmental laws and regulations. It was conducted in three steps: (a) review
of the environmental process related to the adoption of the CDQ technology; (b) review

of BISCO's past environmental and operational practices; and (c) review of BISCO's
environmental management (including a meeting with local environmental officials).
Finally, corrective measures have been defined to address the issues identified during the
due diligence.

Environmental Process Related to CDQ

Overall, the Chinese environmental approval process relating to the adoption of the CDQ
technology requires three phases as presented in table 1: (a) in the first phase, EA
approvals are required prior to construction; (b) in the second phase, measurement and
investigation are conducted by the agency which approved the EA after four months of
steady operation after the "shakedown period"; and (c) a permit for pollution release is
required from the Baotuo Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB).

         EA Report and Inner Mongolia EPB approval required because the project includes both the CDQ
and the coke oven construction
b        EA Report and SEPA approval required because the project is an element of an overall structural
adjustment program instituted by the iron and steel mill and the EA Report addresses the overall program


CDQ: All the CDQ sets are also included in the EIA report submitted for approval by the
State Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in Nov 2006 and the EIA was approved by
SEPA in June 2007. Environmental assessment steps and approvals of the CDQ systems
are presented in Table 1 above. The table shows that construction of the CDQ systems
for coke ovens 7 and 8 started before securing approval of the EA report. Also,
construction of the CDQ systems for coke ovens 9 and 10 has been initiated with no
approval of the EA report. BISCO clarified that they interpreted the approval of their
structural adjustment program was enough to initiate the construction work. However,
SEPA has in the latter case requested BISCO to stop further construction during their
EIA review process which started in early 2007 and BISCO complied with SEPA S
request. The SEPA approved the EIA in June 2007.

        One EA report was prepared for both coke ovens 7 and 8


As can be seen from the Table, construction for coke ovens 7, 8, 9, and 10 all started
prior to receiving EA approvals. However, all EA approvals have now been secured and
BISCO stressed that it initiated construction only after clarification meetings with Inner
Mongolia EPB during which the measures presented in its EIAs were recognized as
compliant with Chinese environmental regulations. Formal processing took longer than
expected.

Coke Oven-Environmental Performance: Coke oven wastewaters are first pretreated
separately and then combined with the overall plant sewage treatment system. Although
the pretreated wastewaters do not meet the Chinese discharge standards, it is not critical,
since this effluent is not discharged. Wastewater monitoring is done three times per
month at the company level and the effluent from the main treatment plant was always
found to be in compliance with the Chinese discharge standards. Baotou EPB also
monitors the efluent monthly, and the company has never received any penalties orfines
for wastewater discharges exceeding standards.

Although there are Chinese air emission standards for coke ovens, emission
measurements are not made by the company. Baotuo EPB performs ambient monitoring
annually. Again, the company has never received any penalties or fines for any air
pollution violations.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

Not applicable. The CDQ systems are installed in a large, existing iron and steel
complex.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.

Not applicable. The CDQ systems are in effect designed to offer much greater
environmental performance than the existing operation. It represents "state-of-the-art"
technology in terms of Best Available Technology for minimizing atmospheric emissions
from coke production and blast furnace operations in a steel-making complex.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

BISCO has a corporate level Department of Environmental Protection and Production
Safety. There are six divisions in the Department, three for environmental protection and
three for production      safety. The environmental protection divisions include:
environmental protection management (seven staff members), resources/waste utilization
(three staff members) and landscape activities (three staff members).

The environmental protection management division has two managers and five
professionals trusted with responsibility for different plant operations. One staff member
is responsible for coke, iron, and sinter plant operations, another for rolling mills and
steel production, the third for utilities and off-sites (water and gas supply, power, etc.).
Two other staff are responsible for rare earth production and iron mining operations. The
chief responsibilities are to assure that environmental measures are implemented and
equipment is operating in accordance with design.           They are also responsible for
reporting any deficiencies to plant management for corrective actions.

At the plant level there are three.to four full time associate environmental protection
engineers responsible for daily activities at each of the following operations (15-20 staff
total):  coking plants, iron production, steel production, sinter plant and mining
operations.

The company maintains a laboratory for environmental monitoring. Water effluents are
monitored three times per month at the coking plants and once per month at the steel mill.
Other effluents are monitored either quarterly or annually. Air quality monitoring is
performed semiannually at the coke plants and quarterly at the steel mill and blast
furnaces. Solid wastes are monitored semiannually.

However, the environmental laboratory is old and primitive: utilizing wet methods that
were common about fifty years ago. The only sign of any modern analytical capability is
a rather primitive spectrophotometer.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Not applicable. Both CDQ and TRT systems are installed within a large, existing iron and
steel complex.
