2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the project is to reduce the country financial vulnerability 
to natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Haiti.  This will be achieved through 
the establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the 
financing of catastrophe insurance coverage from the Facility.  
 
The project aims to allow Haiti to join the CCRIF and benefit from financial protection 
against catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events.  Without this grant, it is unlikely 
Haiti would join this pilot initiative that represents the first entity created to protect small 
island states from the financial impact of natural disasters.  
 
The key intermediate indicators for the project are:  
 
-
The establishment and effectiveness of the CCRIF;  
 
-
The level of catastrophe insurance coverage provided to Haiti.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project aims to provide Haiti with insurance coverage against natural 
disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes).  The project will finance the entrance fee and the 
Page  2
annual insurance premiums (for three years) necessary to participate in the CCRIF. The 
coverage provided would help the Government of Haiti face immediate liquidity needs 
emerging from the occurrence of a disaster.   
 
The IDA Grant will be provided in four installments issued to CCRIF at the request of 
the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). The grant will be withdrawn by the MEF 
for direct payment into the Facility.  The project will include the following two 
components: (a) payment of entrance fee, and (b) payment of annual insurance premium 
for the first three years.  
 
Component 1:  Payment of the entrance fee to the CCRIF (US$2.57 million)  
 
The objective of this component is to assist Haiti to join the CCRIF through the 
financing of the entrance fee.  This fee is equal to the first year's insurance premium of 
US$2.57 million.  
 
Component 2: Payment of annual insurance premium (US$6.43 million)  
 
The objective of this component is to assist the Haiti to purchase the catastrophe 
insurance coverage offered by the CCRIF during the first three years.  
 
Soon after its establishment in March 2007, the Facility will collect the entrance fee and 
first year premium for each participating country.  These payments will thus need to be 
submitted in April 2007, 2008 and 2009.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project contemplates no direct physical investments.  Instead, the project will finance 
payments from the Ministry of Economy and Finance to the CCRIF.  No safeguards will 
be triggered.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
N/A   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Positive indirect impacts of the project include the improved ability of the Government to 
meet the needs of their most vulnerable citizens in the immediate aftermath of a 
catastrophic event.  An immediate infusion of capital will enable governments to 
jumpstart recovery efforts quickly while not disrupting the budget appropriation process.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The project will have no adverse environmental or social impacts.  Therefore, it was not 
necessary to consider alternatives that would help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
While no safeguards are triggered under the project, a project is currently being 
developed to assist CARICOM member states in reforming outdating Emergency 
Legislation.  Improving emergency legislation will strenghten CARICOM government's 
capacity to disburse funds efficiently.  The project will assess current legal frameworks in 
the Caribbean with a goal of improving the legislative and administrative framework 
triggered in a state of emergency.   To revise the institutional framework, current laws 
and administrative procedures will be studied to identify areas for improvement.  Global 
best practice will then be considered and recommendations made that are most suited to 
the Caribbean region and to Haiti in particular.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
