C.  Project Description  
 
The Project involves setting up of a manufacturing facility in Chennai, India to produce an 
innovative, superior, stronger and eco-friendly alternative building material known as 
Gypcrete/Rapidwall building panels. This new composite product made of gypsum plaster, 
reinforced with chopped glass fibers, has broad construction applications—from load-bearing 
walls for individual domestic housing and multi-storey residential buildings to formwork for 
suspended concrete floor structures. This will be the first plant in India with a capacity to 
produce 33,600 panels per year (equivalent to 140 million bricks), whereas the total brick 
production in the country is estimated to be 200 billion per year. The plant is expected to 
commence production by end-2006. 
 
The Gypcrete/Rapidwall panels have a hollow cavity and are light-weight (1/8
th
 of concrete) but 
with a higher strength than concrete. These panels can be used in combinations with concrete and 
steel. The panels have a high degree of thermal efficiency and thus are most suitable for tropical 
climates. As this product is also cost-effective and affordable, it can contribute positively 
towards resolving the housing shortages faced by the masses in India.   
 
LPG will be used for calcinations of phospho gypsum and for drying of panels using hot air 
circulation; there is no need for additional energy in the manufacturing process. This use of LPG 
will lead to CO2 emissions, but apart from this, there are no further emissions of green house 
gases. The manufacturing process will involve use of Calciner for calcinations of phospho 
gypsum. Emission from Calciner plant will be controlled by the inclusion of bag filters. All 
collected dust is returned to the product stream. Small quantity of wastewater is generated from 
Page  3

washing of casting table. This water after passing through settling process is reused for panel 
manufacturing. 
 
Institutional Framework 
 
The project sponsor and developer, 
Gypcrete Building India (P) Ltd (GBIL),
 is a Chennai-based 
company which has entered into a technical collaboration agreement with an Australian company 
Rapid Building Systems Pty Ltd. (RBS). RBS is the technology and patent holder of 
Gypcrete/Rapidwall building panel manufacturing plants and machineries and will provide the 
Rapid Flow Calcinor technology to calcinate the phospho-gypsum waste. The principals of GBIL 
have considerable experience in design and construction of civil infrastructure, structural 
engineering, finance and management.  The Managing Director of GBIL, Mr. Sudhir Gupta, is a 
qualified Chartered Accountant with about 30 years of experience and was formerly the financial 
controller of the ABB Group.  
This Project is in line with the Country Assistance Strategy for India dated September 15, 2004, 
and more specifically with measures envisaged in the Partnerships for the Global Environment.  
It also supports the Millennium Development Goal No. 7, Ensuring Environmental 
Sustainability.  The Project would not only reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, but 
would also result in significant local environmental and so
cial benefits.  Therefore, the Bank’s 
involvement in supporting this Project under the Community Development Carbon Fund is 
considered appropriate.
 
The Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) of the World Bank will purchase the ERs 
generated from the activity and has already signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) with Gypcrete 
Building India (P) Ltd (GBIL) for this transaction
.
Risks 
 
Technological
.
The risk of failure of technology transfer is considered minimal.  Though the manufacturing 
technology is new to India, it has been used in Australia since 1990.  It was introduced in 
Malaysia In 1999 and in China in 2000
1
.
Rapid Building Systems Pvt. Ltd., (RBS) of Australia, 
the patent owner and technical partner for this Project, has extensive experience and expertise in 
this area.  RBS also owns a manufacturing facility that produces 7 million square meters of 
panels per annum.  These panels have been widely used in Australia for the construction of 
houses, residences, apartments, compound walls, cinema halls, factories, tourist resorts, star 
hotels, commercial buildings and industrial buildings ranging from single storey to 17 storeys.  
In 1998, Rapidwall was honored with the Australian Energy Award. 
Comprehensive tests were carried out by SERC (Structural Engineering Research Centre) under 
CSIR, Government of India and the Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T) in Chennai to analyze 
the material properties, thermal efficiency, and resistance of the panels to fire, water, 
earthquakes, etc. Following further extensive testing conducted by two national laboratories and 
research and analysis carried out by BMTPC, Gypcrete/Rapidwall panels were approved by the 
Page  4

Government of India for use throughout India to construct buildings up to a height of 10 storeys. 
This approval includes areas that experience high seismic activity.   
 
D.  Project location 
 
The Gypcrete factory is located on the outskirts of the city of Chennai; in the township of 
Padalam, district of Kanchipuram; 60km south of Chennai International Airport towards Trichy 
on NH-45.  
There are a number of other industries (sugar mill, paper Board mill, and a steel fabrication and 
PVC pipe factory) in the vicinity of the Gypcrete factory within 10 km radius area. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
Gypcrete/Rapidwall Building Material Project is industrial in nature and will be implemented by 
the entrepreneur who has fair understanding of environmental and social issues triggered by the 
construction and operation of the project. Moreover, the project is governed by the 
environmental regulations prescribed by the Tamilnadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB), 
therefore, entrepreneur is likely to institutionalize adequate capacity for handling safeguard 
policies. Project will be located on the outskirts of the city where the local government has 
allowed industrial activities and acquired land for the proposed project is approved for industrial 
use hence any significant adverse social issues are not anticipated from the project. The company 
has 
obtained Consent to Establish from the TNPCB. However, Entrepreneurs’ commitment to 
implement safeguard measures will need to be further assessed comprehensively during project 
preparation and necessary measures will be taken to ensure effective implementation of 
mitigation measures to address environmental and social issues associated with the operation of 
Gypcrete/Rapidwall Building Material Project
.
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment 
is triggered considering the potential for environmental 
and social impacts of anticipated activities during construction and operational phases of 
Gypcrete plant. An environmental and social review will be initiated at the project preparation 
stage, which will include, but will not be limited to, the following potential environmental issues 
requiring mitigation: 
 
·
Occupational health & safety and environmental issues associated with sourcing of raw 
materials from fertilizer plants; 
·
Social, environmental and occupational health & safety issues associated with transport 
and handling of raw materials at plant site; 
·
Environment, occupational health & safety issues associated with operation of the plant 
and machinery; 
·
Disposal of waste material generated from the operations of the plant 
 
Other environment safeguard policies on natural habitat, forestry, pesticides, indigenous peoples 
and cultural properties are not expected to be triggered. However, the environmental review at 
Page  5
5
project preparation stage will examine applicability of any such policies and recommend 
appropriate measures, if found to be applicable. 
 
On the social front, employment of contract and bonded labor, including child labor, are believed 
to be the common practices in India in the traditional building material industry. The possibility 
of the similar practice of labor employment will be reviewed and suitable measures will be put in 
place to ensure that such practices are not followed in the plants.
