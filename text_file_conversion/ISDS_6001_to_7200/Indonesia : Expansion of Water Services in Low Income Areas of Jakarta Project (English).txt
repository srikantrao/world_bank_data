2. Project Objectives
The proposed pilot project will implement an output-based approach for expanding water
service to selected low income areas of Jakarta. The goal of the pilot would be to extend
coverage (as per household demand) to these areas, by metered individual household
connections, which would subsequently receive services from Jakarta's water
concessionaires and pay tariffs.

3. Project Description
Since 1995, water supply in Jakarta has been managed by two private concession
companies (PT Pam Lyonnaise Jaya-"Palyja" and Thames Pam Jaya- "TPJ") who retain
responsibility for raising finance for and managing network investments.        However,
network growth in Jakarta remains far too slow (about 10,000 new connections a year) to
make significant impact on the low access rate, leaving large areas of Jakarta deprived of
network access, with only 51% of inhabitants having network water, compared to an
average of 79% for Asian Cities.

The main reason behind the low investment levels is that tariff revenues from services,
despite significant increase over the last years, have been insufficient to fund major
capital investment, largely because the government had accumulated significant arrears
towards both concessionaires during the high inflation period of 2000-05.

The proposed pilot project would test and output based approach (OBA) for expansion of
service coverage by providing grant based payments to the water concessionaire in return
for installing individual metered connections to selected low income urban areas of
Jakarta. The project will initially focus on the concession area of Palyja and at a later
date expand to the TPJ concession area.

The communities were chosen based on technical criteria (in areas with adequate levels
of service such that new connections will not affect the service in neighboring areas; in
areas where there is no need for secondary or primary network construction, and in areas
with limited or polluted groundwater resources), policy criteria (poverty level and
compatability with DKI Jakarta spatial plans) and social criterion (willingness to
connect). A total of nine communities (2621 households) will receive Type I connections
(standard metered household connection with an underground connection pipe) and one
community (500 households) will receive Type II connections (a community based
system with bulk metering and above ground connection pipes).

OBA payments will be made to the concessionaire upon confirmation of installation of
the connections. The payment amount is agreed upfront based on preliminary designs
and confirmed through an independent assessment and benchmarking process. Outputs
would be considered as met once customers have had their connection services rendered
to their satisfaction and in line with regulatory requirement over a specified period of
time and have paid their bills during that period. OBA grants will be disbursed upon
certification of outputs by an auditing firm in the amounts specified and consultations
with the regulator, from an escrow account established with the local branch of a
reputable international financing institution, directly to the concessionaires.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis

The communities are located in the areas of Jakarta outlined below. These are in urban
areas with modest housing and low income and all are in the Palyja Concession Area.

Kebon Jeruk                     Kepa Duri                        Palyja

As the numbers of communities may be expanded at a later date the project may include
other areas including those in the TPJ concession area.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible
impacts:

The works in the project trigger the Environmental Assessment Policy due to the safety,
construction and traffic related impacts. As no system will be designed that would
require land acquisition or resettlement, the Involuntary Resettlement Policy is not
triggered. An environmental management plan has been developed for the works that
utilizes requirements for the construction contractors and associated standard operating
procedures. Monitoring and reporting will also be undertaken as part of the program.

The environmental management plan is outlined in the "Minimum Environmental and
Community Requirements for Palyja Projects".             The measures include: personal
protective equipment for workers; trench safety procedures; public safety and traffic
management; handling removal of asbestos cement pipes if encountered; handling and
disposal of solid, liquid (including oils and fuels) waste; management of burrow sites for
backfill material and chance finds procedures for cultural property. Additionally, it also
requires that no asbestos cement pipes be used in the works.

If the project will expand to include the TPJ concession area, a similar approach will be
developed and reviewed by the Bank for consistency with safeguards policies.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated
future activities in the project area:

Impacts are small in scale, temporary and site specific,

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or
minimize adverse impacts.

No project alternative: The no project alternative is to have these communities exposed
to increased health risks by relying on informal sources of water that can limit the
quantity of water available for use in hygiene and by of uncertain quality (including
groundwater, public hydrants, push carts and water terminals).

Other alternatives: The main design alternatives were considered as part of the process
of community selection.        The criteria used in site selection helped maximize
environmental benefits and reduce impacts.        In particular, the criteria indicated that
project would focus on areas that required limited construction (no primary or secondary
networks), areas with adequate water pressure so as not to sacrifice water availability in
neighboring areas and areas with limited or polluted groundwater so as to maximize the
benefits of substituting the water resources with the new connections.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues.
Provide an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures
described.

Palyja has a corporate environmental policy and an adequate system of contracting and
contractor supervision for environmental and safety issues.        They have also begun
reporting environmental compliance through their environmental officer. As part of
preparation some additions to their environmental, monitoring and consultation approach
were made in order to strengthen their approach.        Given these improvements their
capacity to implement is adequate.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Consultation on the safeguards issues at the community level will be done on a
programmatic basis where the communities will be informed of the project activities and
environmental and safety management expectations and given an opportunity to provide
input before project work begins. A mechanism to allow communities to raise concerns
or complaints on the execution of the project works and environmental management plan
will also be provided. The environmental management plan has been disclosed in the
Infoshop and in country [STILL TO BE DONE]
