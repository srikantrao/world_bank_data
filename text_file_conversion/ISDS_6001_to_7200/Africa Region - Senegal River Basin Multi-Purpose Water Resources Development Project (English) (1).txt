2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the MWRD program which comprises 2 phases, MWRD 1 
and 2 is to enhance regional integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal River 
Basin through OMVS (Organisation p
our la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve SÃ©nÃ©gal) for 
multipurpose water resources development to foster growth including improved 
community livelihoods.  
 
.
This objective will be achieved through (i) consolidating and modernizing the 
institutional, legal and technical framework of the Senegal River Basin to better serve the 
Page  2
four riparian countries, (ii) developing concrete water resources development activities at 
the local level that generate significant income to reduce poverty, and (iii) defining and 
preparing new multipurpose infrastructure to harness the hydropower potential identified 
in the basin. In total, 2 million people are targeted in the first phase to benefit from this 
project. The project will focus on selected priority areas within the four riparian 
countries: the regions of Mamou and Labe (Guinea), the Circles of Bafoulabe and Kayes 
(Mali), the departements of Dagana and Matam (Senegal) and the Wilayas of Trarza and 
Brakna (Mauritania).   
 
3. Project Description 
Lending instrument and rationale. The proposed Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will 
span 10 years and be implemented in 2 phases (MWRD 1 & 2), of 5 years each.  The 
rationale for using the APL instrument is to ensure long-term commitment and 
sustainability in scaling up multipurpose water resources development activities in the 
Senegal River Basin. Adaptable program loans (APLs) provide phased support for long-
term development programs.  They involve a series of loans that build on the lessons 
learned from the previous loan(s) in the series.  APLs are used when sustained changes in 
institutions, organizations, or behavior are key to successfully implementing a program.  
The key advantages for clients are i) Less front-loading of policy conditionality. Realistic 
phasing of reforms; ii) it encourages long-term planning and sustainable institution 
building; and bridges administrations; and iii) Lower commitment fees.  
 
The phased approach facilitates the prioritization of investments in alignment with 
appropriate funding.  The APL instrument will also allow OMVS and the riparian 
countries of the Senegal River Basin to minimize the transaction costs and to consolidate 
the benefits deriving from jointly-owned and managed infrastructure. The scope, 
magnitude and timing of the second phase will depend on successes achieved during 
implementation of the first phase and on the prioritized investments identified by the 
riparian countries in Senegal River Basin Master plan, also to be financed under the 
MWRD1.  However, OMVS and member countries will know in advance that Bank 
support for the second phase will be forthcoming, provided the triggers from the first 
phase are met.  
 
It is proposed that IDA credit support be provided using the APL instrument, 
horizontally on a regional basis to support OMVS and its regional infrastructure program 
and vertically to supplement development water resources activities at the national level. 
In addition, through the use of the APL instrument, the commitment of substantial IDA 
resources is visible and complementarity with activities supported by donors can be more 
readily achieved.  The diagram below illustrates the linkages between the MWRD 1 and 
MWRD 2.  
 
Program objective and Phases  
 
Overview of program design. The overall amount proposed for MWRD 1 & 2 is 
US$261 million, of which the estimated budget for MWRD 1 is US$161 million, 
inclusive of an IDA credit of US$110 million and proposed US$51 million from national 
Page  3
counterpart funds, donor co-financing and parallel financing. Individual sector 
investment activities were considered as an alternative approach, in parallel with donor 
activities, however this does not advance regional integration. The regional integration 
process establishes the various parameters for sustainable multi-purpose development and 
multi-sectoral investments, realized only by strengthened institutions and engaged and 
informed stakeholders. The program will support the Nouakchott Declaration for the 
development of the Senegal River Basin by focusing on five key targeted activities, 
namely: (i) modernizing the river basin institutions within the context of the Inclusive 
Framework, (ii) regional water resources planning, management and development, (iii) 
expanding regional multipurpose water resources infrastructure, (iv) mitigating the health 
impacts from the related multipurpose water infrastructure, and (v) fostering economic 
growth through related water-sector development while improving the social and 
environmental conditions in the Basin.  The malaria control ‘boost’ to the plannedwater 
management and infrastructural development will focus on 3 primary strategic areas: (i) 
control of the mosquito vector (Anopheles gambiae, funestus, arabiensis) using 
insecticide-treated bednets, indoor-spraying, and environmental management; (ii) 
mitigating malaria infection risk related to population movements that may accompany 
water-management related activities; (iii) partnership coordination and operationale 
research/experience dissemination on malaria control within the context of infrastructural 
development.  
 
Overall, the program is designed in three main components to support OMVS develop 
integrated water resources management .with short, medium and long-term impacts.  
 
Based on consultations with OMVS, member countries and national parastatal agencies, 
clear triggers were agreed for the second phase of the progam:  
 
a) 
The policy trigger is the commitment of Guinea to continue cooperating within 
OMVS as the fourth member country;  
 
b) 
The technical triggers include: (i) satisfactory integration of Guinea into OMVS’ 
institutional, legal and financial structures; (ii) satisfactory installation and operation of 4 
intakes; (iii) at least 7% of communities in the coverage areas in the basin applying better 
agro-forestry practices; (iv) 60% ITN utilization among the river basin population for the 
Malaria reduction across the basin and (v) completion of Koukoutamba, Boureya, 
Balassa and Gourbassi feasibility studies and clear consensus among riparian countries 
regarding a decision to build at least 1 dam from the pre-selected list.  
 
Project development objective and key indicators  
 
The development objective of the MWRD program which comprises 2 phases, MWRD 
1
and 2 is to enhance regional integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal 
River Basin through OMVS for multipurpose water resources development to foster 
growth including improved community livelihoods.  
 
This objective will be achieved through (i) consolidating and modernizing the 
institutional, legal and technical framework of the Senegal River Basin to better serve the 
Page  4
four riparian countries, (ii) developing concrete water resources development activities at 
the local level that generate significant income to reduce poverty, and (iii) defining and 
preparing new multipurpose infrastructure to harness the hydropower potential identified 
in the basin. In total, 2 million people are targeted in the first phase to benefit from this 
project. The project will focus on selected priority areas within the four riparian countries 
located in the upper basin, the upper valley, the lower valley and the delta.  
 
Key progress and expected outcomes. The result indicators envisioned for the project 
include:  
 
a) 
OMVS legal, institutional, financial mechanisms updated and fully operational for 
effective execution of its mandate.  
 
b)
Sustainable multipurpose water resources activities implemented to effect income 
generation and poverty reduction at local levels; and  
 
c) 
Regional planning and management framework developed for economically, 
environmentally and socially responsible multipurpose water resources development.  
 
Project components (MWRD APL1)  
 
MWRD 1 does not directly engage in hydropower investments but will provide the 
framework for future engagement in such development. It includes three main 
components as outlined below:  
 
Component 1: Regional Institutional Development for Water Resources (US$8.1 
million) .  The first component will support actions at the regional level in order to 
consolidate and strengthen policies, plans and actions relating to integrated water 
resources development. Implementing the Inclusive Framework will require the 
strengthening of institutional knowledge and technical capacity but also strengthening of 
the legal, institutional and financial frameworks. Component activities will:  
 
a. 
Modernize OMVS and Enhance Institutional Capacities. This component will 
enhance the management and technical capacities as well as the systems of monitoring 
and evaluation.  The institutional coordination, communication, information exchange 
and stakeholder participation among relevant institutions  will also be improved thereby 
reinforcing the OMVS network and information management. This will likely involve:  
 
i
Review and expansion of responsibilities with supporting capacity enhancement 
for SOGED and SOGEM;  
 
ii 
Revamping of OMVS and National Cellules including the definition of human 
resources management and performance monitoring and evaluation tools, improving 
access to and the flow of information with more accountability and transparency at all 
levels;  
 
iii 
Modernization of the Permanent Water Commission 
–
to include modalities 
forwater flows and energy reserve (allocations) principles from multi-purpose 
infrastructure;  
 
iv 
OMVS strategic coordination and collaboration with national water and 
agricultural  technical bodies including SAED-SONADER-PDIAM –Direction Nationale 
du Genie Rural (DNGR) and SDE-SNDE-EDM;  
Page  5
v
Developing an exchange of experiences, best practices and management tools in 
water resources between national agricultural agencies, namely SAED, SONADER, 
PDIAM and DNGR;  
 
vi
Strengthening of local-
level organizations (such as WUAs, womens’ farmer 
cooperatives).  
 
b. 
Enable Guinea’s inclusion to OMVS. The continuation of the Inclusive 
Framework dialogue requires the update and adaptation of the OMVS institutions and 
legal arrangements to include Guinea as the fourth riparian country. This will include : (i) 
an update of the institutional and legal framework within the OMVS High Commission; 
(ii) preparation of the additional legal instruments necessary to effectively implement the 
Inclusive Framework in line with the Water Charter principles; and (iii) definition of a 
new cost-sharing formula to accommodate Guinea as a new member of OMVS.  
 
c. 
Rehabilitate the OMVS Documentation Center. Securing the institutional history 
and expanding the information and knowledge network of the OMVS requires the 
rehabilitation of the Senegal River Basin Document Center in Saint-Louis. Activities 
will:  
 
i
Rehabilitate, upgrade, and secure the building facilities;  
 
ii 
Acquire equipment for archiving and library establishment;  
 
iii 
Train and develop management capacity of center staff;  
 
iv 
Develop internet functionality with web access to relevant information; and  
 
v
Support or establish specific conventions with other institutions such as, the Sub-
Saharan Africa Foundation Institute (IFAN), the Documentalists and Archivists School 
(EBAD), and relevant universities for more effective management and dissemination of 
Basin information.  
 
Component 2:  Local Level Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development (US$96.4 
million)  . Increasing poverty in the basin especially Guinea and the Fouta Djallon region 
leads to degradation of the Senegal watershed with serious impacts downstream. Such 
impacts include reduced flows, greater flood and drought susceptibility, high 
sedimentation loads and consequent effects on energy, agriculture production, fisheries, 
wetland ecosystems and navigation.  In addition, within the OMVS espace, rural 
population have not yet benefited from OMVS’ regional infrastructure despite the new 
opportunities offered with the water availability from the artificial flows.. Instead, rural 
poor feel left out of the water resources development to date..  Long term sustainability of 
the basin and the people will in large part depend on finding solutions for socio-economic 
and environmental problems. By promoting income generation activities at grassroots 
level, this component includes critical water resources development in selected sub-
basins areas and ensure benefits spillover across the region. This approach also helps to 
ensure full ownership and commitment to secure the existing investments and those to be 
planed in the future. The planned activities will be undertaken in targeted areas suitable 
to realize fast results on the ground. They are framed in a manner to ensure appropriate 
responsibility assignments to- and accountability of- the relevant technical bodies with 
stakeholders’ participation and involvement in decision making.. The sub-component 
activities would be demonstration in character, with the objective of learning from the 
Page  6
experiences, dissemination of the acquired knowledge and scale up in other areas in the 
Basin during the MWRD 2.  
 
Three main criteria, technical, social and political were used to identify the selected 
areas by OMVS and the riparian countries. The technical criteria related to the in-country 
infrastructure needs as well as the suitability of location for development. The social 
criteria mostly related to the degree of poverty and incidence on vulnerable groups 
throughout the basin. And, the political criteria is linked to countries aim to re-balance 
development activities across the basin. The areas and related activities were selected in a 
participatory process to form the first set of interventions in the basin. The scaling up of 
these interventions will be considered within the Master plan in component 3. The 
priority areas for actions include: the Upper Basin in Guinea (regions of Mamou and 
LabÃ©);, the Upper Basin in Mali (Circles of Bafoulabe and Kayes), The Middle Valley 
in Senegal (departments of Dagana and Matam) and the Middle Valley and Delta in 
Mauritania (Wilayas of Trarza and Brakna). . The local level activities are the following:  
 
a. 
Development of small hydraulic infrastructure and related activities. This 
subcomponent will facilitate the development of recessional agriculture, expansion and 
rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes in suitable areas.  Key activities will : (i) 
design and develop infrastructure to improve access to and delivery of water for irrigation 
(intakes, pumping stations etc.), (ii) provide training for appropriate irrigation methods 
and related crop diversification and enhancement processes to enable farmers to make 
adequate choices for sustainable agricultural practices, (iii) identify suitable options for 
agricultural products, processing and marketing.  
 
b.
Improvement of traditional fisheries. This sub-component will contribute to the 
development of traditional fisheries.  Key activities will: (i) promote more effective 
fishing practices and fish production processing, (ii) provide technical modernization to 
enhance fishermen’s livelihoods (training and equipment such as nets, boats, processing 
and storage), and (iii) support institutional strengthening for sustainable development of 
the fisheries activities.  
 
c. 
Integrated Land and Water Management. This sub-component will support 
planning and management of land and water resources at the community and sub-basin 
levels to provide community stakeholders tools and mechanisms for sustainable and long-
term local development. Key activities will (i) map key micro-watersheds suitable for 
local income generation activities, (ii) introduce programs to restore and maintain river 
banks and (iii) provide support (develop a forestation map and program, training, etc.) for 
agro-forestry development.  
 
d.
Reduction of waterborne diseases. This sub-component will focus on addressing 
waterborne diseases, primarily as it pertains to reducing the prevalence of 
Schistosomiasis and Malaria in the Basin. Key activities for the Schistosomiasis will (i) 
provide appropriate schistosomiasis mass treatment and awareness compaigns for 
targeted communities. For Malaria, activities will focus on an Enhanced Malaria Roll 
Back Program (EMCP) including (i) development and implementation of an integrated 
vector management; (ii) support to health sector inclusive of malaria treatment and 
supervision of malaria control within the targeted areas of the basin; (iii) enhancement of 
Page  7
monitoring and supervision activities related to Malaria control and (iv) Sub-regional 
coordination support and operational research development across the basin.  
 
Component 3: Regional Multipurpose and Multi-sectoral Master Planning (US$5.5 
million) .  
 
The Comprehensive Senegal River Basin Master Plan or SDAGE (Schema 
d’Amenagement et de Gestion des Eaux du fleuve Senegal) will take into consideration 
all relevant sectors for optimal and sustainable planning, use, and management of the 
Basin’s water resources, and make available the appropriate information necessaryfor 
sound decision-making. The SDAGE will also complement the on-going efforts initiated 
under the WAPP.  The component activities will:  
 
a. 
Prepare the SRB Comprehensive Master Plan. Within the broad framework of the 
SDAGE, the sub-component activities will (i) evaluate and prepare several assessment 
studies, which take into account technical, policy, economic, environmental and social 
concerns (including health), over the range of potential multi-purpose and multi-sectoral 
investments in the Basin , (ii) prepare the SRB Regional Master Plan, and prepare sub-
basin development plans that would further guide OMVS and member countries in 
implementing decentralized water resources management.  
 
b.
Pre-investment support for the OMVS Gouina Hydroelectric Project (HEP): This 
sub-component will support OMVS to accelerate pre-investment activities for early 
development and deployment of the Gouina HEP to help alleviate the widening power 
supply deficits that have resulted in chronic load shedding in OMVS member states.  Key 
activities include: (i) preparation and public disclosure of the environmental Management 
Plan and Resettlement Action Plan associated with the implementation of the Gouina 
HEP, including facilities to interconnect with the existing 225 kV OMVS power 
transmission system; and (ii) preparation of comprehensive bidding documents for use in 
a
competitive process to select a contractor to implement the Gouina HEP  under a date-
certain, fixed price, performance-based contract to “Design-Build-Operate-Transfer the 
Gouina HEP to the OMVS asset holding entity.  
 
c. 
Pre-investment support for OMVS Multi-Purpose Dams (Balassa, Boureya, 
Gourbassi and Koukoutamba): This component will (i) support the OMVS to prepare 
comprehensive feasibility studies (and, if necessary update previous studies) for the 
prospective multi-purpose dams to be located in the Senegal River Basin at Gourbassi (on 
the Faleme River in Mali), Balassa, Boureya, and Koukoutamba, all of which are located 
upstream of the Manantali Dam in Guinea and have been collectively prioritized by the 
riparian states;  (ii) prepare an Options Assessment and a Strategic Regional 
Environmental Assessment for future deployment of these facilities in the Basin The 
relevant assessments to determine the nature and scope of environmental and social 
safeguards to be addressed for each prospective site will also be performed under this 
sub-component.  
 
d.
Ensure stakeholder participation in Multipurpose and Master Planning.  This will 
be done to facilitate and ensure consensus-building and to publicize support for the 
hydropower projects upfront of actual development and commencement of works.

MWRD 2 Components will depend largely on the implementation results of MWRD 1. 
This will include the selection of the second round of local level multi-purpose water 
resources development activities to be scaled up and the development of water resources 
infrastructure. Since the economies of the four riparian countries are highly vulnerable to 
water variability and energy shortages, additional multi-purpose infrastructure will be 
needed. Preliminary technical studies and consultations among the four riparian countries 
have already led to the pre-selection of the four dam sites (identified in component 3c 
above).  With the additional technical studies to be carried out in MWRD 1, the 
prioritization of the development of these dams will be possible and it is then envisaged 
that such development will be undertaken in MWRD 2. Suitable performance indicators 
will be introduced and the relevant institutional and other necessary adjustments made to 
transition from MWRD1 to MWRD 2.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
All project activities will be carried in the Senegal River Basin in the four riparian 
countries.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
No dams will be financed under MWRD 1 only the preparatory work for the planning of 
new hydropower facilities will be carried out under phase 1. No irreversible 
environmental impacts are expected of any of the investments made in MWRD 1.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There is a potential that new small water infrastructure could upset the balance of power 
in some of the villages involved in this new small water infrastructure through land-
grabbing by the more powerful elites in the villages when water will become available on 
a
more sustained basis. This will be thoroughly discussed with the beneficiaries and 
closely monitored.  
 
The project will finance reforestation activities in the Fouta Djallon to protect the 
watershed, which is one of the most critical watersheds in West Africa and from which 
most of the large rivers in West Africa originate. Forest management plans will be 
prepared during implementation, since the areas of intervention are not yet known. 
Because of this activity the Forests Safeguard Policy has been triggered.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
There are no project alternatives with the exception of the no project alternative.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has prepared a Strategic Regional Environmental and Social Framework 
for the small, community based, water infrastructure in the four riparian countries. The 
borrower has also provided the Bank with Dam Safety reports for the Manantali and 
Diama Dams. A dam safety report for the Foum Gleita Dam in Mauritania has been 
Page  10
obtained recently under the Bank financed PDIAIM project. The borrower has prepared a 
satisfactory Pest Management Plan and a Resettlement Policy Framework.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are the farmers, fishers and herders in the Senegal River Basin and their 
local governments. Key stakeholders are also the OMVS and its national cells, as well the 
national government agencies of the four riparian countries involved in the Senegal River 
Basin.
