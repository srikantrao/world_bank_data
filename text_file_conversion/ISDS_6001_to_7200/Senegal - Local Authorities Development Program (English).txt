2. Project Objectives 
The programís development objectives are to: (a) strengthen urban authorities to improve 
resource mobilization, municipal and urban management; and (b) increase the provision 
of infrastructure and services in urban areas.  These objectives will be achieved through 
the combined impact of two types of interventions:  
 
a) 
Implementation of management tools to: (a) further support the urban 
municipalities, CADAK and CAR efforts in programming and financing of service 
delivery; (b) improve local resource mobilization; and (c) rationalize municipal and inter-
communal management; and  
 
b) 
Implementation of physical investments and upgrading programs identified 
through participatory process in the 67 urban cities, CADAK and CAR, all eligible to 
LADP.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project would have two main components: (i) Institutional Development Capacity 
Building; and (ii) Municipal and Inter-Communal Physical Investments Programs.  
Page  2
Component A: Institutional Development and Capacity Building (estimated at US$16.5 
million).  This component will be carried out along two tracks: (a) implementation of the 
Municipal Adjustment Program for the local authorities (67 urban municipalities, 
CADAK and CAR) - the content of these programs will be detailed in each Municipal 
Contract as well as within the two specific contracts for CADAK and CAR; and (b) 
cross-cutting measures outside of the municipal contracts for the Government agencies, 
selected ministries and the Municipal Development Agency (MDA).  The IDA Credit 
would finance 100 percent of studies, technical assistance and training; and 90 percent of 
goods.  
 
Sub-component A.1 (US$12.0 million):  For the 67 municipalities, the activities would 
be identified during the updating exercise of the financial and organizational audits and 
would be targeted to specific adjustment or improvement measures along the main 
clusters of: (a) mobilization of local resources; (b) staffing and training; (c) municipal 
management of assets; and (d) financial management.  
 
For CADAK and CAR, in addition to the above, the subcomponent would add support 
to definition of their resources and specific technical assistance program aimed at 
strengthening their role as inter-communal bodies in charge of structuring infrastructure.  
 
Sub-component A.2 (US$4.5 million):  The activities will mainly target the Ministry of 
Finances (Treasury and Tax), the Ministry in charge of Local Authorities, the ìCour des 
Comptesî, the Association of Mayors (Association des Maires du S√©n√©gal) and the 
MDA.  They would include, inter alia: (a) development of fiscal registers based on the 
model of Thi√®s and Kaolack in municipalities which have been addressed; (b) 
installation of monitoring of use of COLLOC and COMMAIR software; (c) rewriting of 
the tax and monitoring of collection of revenues from public assets applications; (d) 
support to the management of revenue-earning facilities; (e) training of municipal agents; 
(f) consolidation of urban database on the 67 municipalities; (g) preparation of an urban 
atlas; (h) publication of the guide to financial ratios; (i) updating of aerial coverage; (j) 
study on prospects for the metropolitan region of Dakar; (k) audit of municipal 
management accounts; (l) improving FECL operations; (m) technical assistance to MDA; 
and (n) sector studies and other institutional development support activities which may 
appear necessary during project implementation.  
 
Component B: Municipal and Inter-communal Physical Investments (estimated at 
US$119.0 million).  This component will be carried out along two tracks: (a) municipal 
contracts for the implementation of Priority Investment Programs (PIP) and Priority 
Maintainance Programs (PMP); and (b) larger inter-communal projects for the Dakar 
metropolitan area.  This amount includes the fees to be paid to the delegated contract 
manager, currently being recruited.  
 
Specific arrangements have been agreed upon for the financing of the investments, 
depending upon the nature and size of the cities, based on the following principles:  
 
Page  3
-
AFD financing will concentrate on investments for CADAK, CAR and the urban 
municipalities of the Greater Dakar Area (Dakar, Pikine, Guediawaye, Rufisque and 
Bargny); and  
 
-
IDA financing will concentrate on investments for CADAK, CAR, the urban 
municipalities of the Greater Dakar Area (Dakar, Pikine, Guediawaye, Rufisque and 
Bargny) and the other regional capitals.  
 
Sub-component B.1 (US$73.0 million):  Municipal contracts and implementation of 
Priority Investment Program (PIP) and Priority Maintenance Program (PMP).  The PIP 
will include a wide range of investment categories and will favor rehabilitation rather 
than new investments. The catalogue of investments was redefined during project 
preparation taking into account the lessons learned from the implementation of the 
UDDP.  It includes social, administrative and economic infrastructure.  A new project 
data sheet will also be produced to strengthen the eligibility criteria with a special 
attention to site availability and management arrangements. The actual implementation of 
PMP will be key to access to the financing windows.  
 
Sub-component B.2 (US$46.0 million):  Larger scale investments in the Greater Dakar 
Area (GDA) to take into account the inter-communal needs.  The GDA is obviously the 
greatest challenge in urban management in Senegal and there is a need to finance long 
due investments needs at the metropolitan level and consolidate funding for subprojects 
which have a larger impact than their immediate surroundings. A tentative investment 
program was identified through the same consultative process held with the 
municipalities involved.  It is consistent with the updating exercise of the urban audits of 
the five urban cities of the Dakar metropolitan area and with the two other major IDA-
financed activities in the Dakar metropolitan area: the Urban Mobility Improvement 
Project (UMIP, Cr. 3354-SE, effective May 14, 2001) and the Dakar-Diam Niadio Toll 
Highway Project (under preparation, planned FY07).  The final program will be 
confirmed at negotiations.  
 
Component C: Support to Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation 
(estimated at US$5.5 million).  This component will provide financing for the efficient 
implementation of the Project through the MDA, including staff, operating costs, 
monitoring and evaluation, and cost of audits.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project is categorized as B and no major investments with potential negative impact 
are planned for most part of the investment program.  The Environmental Assessment 
(OP/BP 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (OB/BP 4.12) safeguard policies are being 
triggered by the Project.  
 
The proposed project is designed to have beneficial impacts on the population in terms 
of better service delivery and improved living conditions.  Given the programmatic 
nature of the project, an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and 
a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been prepared by the GoS, disclosed on 
disclosed in country and at the Bankís Infoshop on November 11, 2005 and presented to 
the public during a formal seminar with mayors in December 2005.  
 
Environmental and social concerns have been integrated into the project design and 
impacts on the environment and on people are included as criteria for the selection of the 
municipal subprojects at an early stage of the process:  
 
(a) 
Regarding the works to be implemented under the municipal PIPs, no resettlement 
is expected.  Subproject screening for environmental purpose will be done by the MDA 
in collaboration with the municipalities.  This screening will identify the nature and 
magnitude of the expected environmental and social impacts and classify the sub project 
as Category A, B or C (similar to the World Bank classification). Potential negative 
impacts will be mitigated, as they will have been identified at the early stage of urban 
audits before being included in the Priority Investments Plan. If needed, Environmental 
Assessments (EAs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared as part of the 
preliminary design stage so that recommendations can be included into detailed 
subproject design.  Overall monitoring of the inclusion of the Environmental 
Management Plans (EMPs), which are part of the EAs, into the bidding documents will 
be done by the MDA.  The supervision of the implementation of the EMPs and RAPs 
will be under the responsibility of the MDA.  Mitigation measures which cannot be 
Page  5
implemented by the contractors will be implemented under the responsibility of the 
MDA.  The MDA and the CMA will appoint a Focal Point for Environmental and Social 
Management issues before project effectiveness.  The supervising engineer and the 
contractors will also be required to appoint a Focal Point for Environmental and Social 
Management issues to supervise the implementation of the environmental and social 
mitigation measures included in their contracts.  
 
(b) 
Large civil works operations planned for the CADAK and the CAR, which may 
have larger environmental or social impacts, would have a particular protocol.  It was 
agreed that specific environmental and social assessments and relevant mitigation plans 
will be prepared for these large investment that are all planned in the Greater Dakar Area.  
Although the final list of structuring subprojects will be known only at negotiations, it is 
expected at this stage that only a limited number of large civil works projects (only one or 
two identified so far) will generate a limited number of household resettlements 
(estimated about 20 households).  The affected people are not yet identified.  When 
possible, EAs and RAPs will be prepared for all projects as part of the preliminary design 
stage so that recommendations can be included into detailed subproject design.  All 
Resettlement Action Plans will be prepared according to the Bankís Safeguard Policy on 
Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12.  MDA, in collaboration with the CMA, will be 
responsible for the preparation of the EAs and RAPs and their submission to the Bank for 
approval.  
 
All Environmental Assessments and Resettlement Plans will be handled as described 
above and according to the provisions made in the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).  These 
safeguard instruments (ESMF and RPF) have been prepared in accordance to national 
environmental policies and the World Bank environmental and social guidelines and 
safeguard policies.  The draft ESMF and RPF have been reviewed by the Bank in May 
and June 2005 and found to be in compliance with the World Bank Safeguard policies.  
These safeguard instruments have been disclosed in country and at the Bankís Infoshop 
on November 11, 2005.  The disclosure in-country included disclosure on the 
Government website, in universities and in libraries.  The safeguard documents are 
available upon request from the MDA and were distributed to all city representatives 
during a stakeholder meeting held in Dakar on December 16 and 17, 2005.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There are no potential indirect or long term impacts identified.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Alternatives routes for the larger-scale investments such as some new road segments in 
the greater Dakar area have been carefully analyzed.  For other project investments, a 
careful analysis of alternative sites will be carried out.  Resettlement will be minimized 
and if resettlement cannot be avoided, the Bank Safeguard Policy on Involuntary 
Page  6
Resettlement OP 4.12 will be applied.  A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) has been 
prepared and approved by the Government and by the Bank for this purpose.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower has prepared a comprehensive Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF).  The Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which is part of the 
ESMF includes a comprehensive capacity building program including stakeholders from 
the national to the town level.  For the implementing agencies, an on-the-job training 
program in environmental and social management in urban areas is being planned.  All 
subprojects will be screened and, if required, an Environmental Assessment will be 
prepared. Screening will include also potential resettlement.  All larger inter-communal 
investments in CADAK and CAR will benefit from an Environmental Assessment.  If 
people will need to be resettled, a Resettlement Action Plan will be prepared.  It is 
expected that resettlement in this project will be minimal.  
 
Both the ESMF and the RPF have been widely disclosed in November 2005 in all the 
towns where the project will finance subproject activities, in libraries and Universities 
and in the Bankís Infoshop in Washington.  
 
The MDA and the Senegalese Department of Environment will be responsible for the 
approval of the EAs.  The World Bank will supervise the implementation of the 
Environmental Management Plans for the larger investments and on sample basis for the 
smaller investments.  For each sub-project where resettlement is required, the Bank will 
have to give its no-objection.  The costs of the resettlement will be the responsibility of 
the Government of Senegal.  
 
The responsible staff of the MDA, the CMA, the municipalities, consultants, NGOs and 
other stakeholders will be trained in Environmental and Social Assessment procedures 
and in Urban Environmental and Social Management.  The Environmental Assessment 
and Resettlement Action Plan procedures have been included in the Manuals of 
Procedures.  
 
The MDA will be responsible to carry out awareness creating campaigns and IEC 
activities.  These activities have as objective to inform people in the municipalities about 
the planned activities and increase awareness with regard to sound urban environmental 
and social management.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are the Municipal Development Agency, the agency to be selected who 
will prepare the studies and bidding documents, municipal councils and town mayors, 
and also the local town population and NGOs working in the area.  Other stakeholders 
include consultant and construction companies and local decentralized government staff 
who will be trained in environmental and social management.
