2. Project Objectives 
The project will contribute towards the achievement of the universal primary completion 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) by: (i) strengthening human resource 
management capacity to enhance system efficiency; (ii) increasing the number and 
improved distribution of teachers; and (iii) increasing coverage at the basic education 
level in the most disadvantaged areas; particularly in first grade level.   
 
3. Project Description 
The project has two main components: (1) Providing technical assistance for improved 
human resource management and improved capacity to coordinate the delivery of early 
childhood education; and (2) Increasing the number and improved distribution of 
teachers.  
 
Component 1: Providing Technical Assistance to MEC for: (i) Improved Human 
Resources Management and (ii) Improved capacity to coordinate the Provision of Early 
Childhood Education (ECE) (Total Cost is estimated at US$4.0 million with 
contingencies).  
 
The objectives of this component will be achieved through the 2 sub-components 
described below:  
Page  2
Strengthening Human Resource Management.  Many of the existing problems require 
action at the legal, political and administrative levels; however extreme reforms are not 
likely to prove viable in the current political climate.  MEC recognizes that simply 
augmenting the number of teachers does not respond to the serious shortcomings in the 
current human resource management system.  At both the central and provincial levels, 
current systems for human resource management--in administrative areas ranging from 
selection, deployment, supervision, evaluation, training and retirement--impede the 
effective utilization of teachers.  In addition, serious weaknesses exist at all levels and in 
all areas of human resource management information.  To assure the sustainability of 
proposed efforts, the objective of this sub component is to str
engthen MECís ongoing 
efforts initiated under the Programmatic Human Development Reform Loan (PHDRL), to 
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the sectorís human and financial resources.  
The target groups are the administrative units of the Provincial Directorates, the 
supervision system (UTE) ultimately responsible to the Provincial Directorates, the 
professional development program administered through the National Directorate of 
Professional Development (DINAMEP), the National Directorate of Intercultural 
Bilingual Education (DINEIB) and the National Directorate of Human Resources 
(DNHR), responsible for normative, evaluative, and monitoring functions.  
 
A
principal subcomponent of the HRM system is the design and implementation of an 
effective Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS).  Currently, data 
on personnel exists in several different data bases (Finance/MEC for payroll, Human 
Resources for the personnel system, DINEIB, and DINAMEP for training and the 
Provincial Directorates for teacher placements), and among these data bases information 
is inconsistent, unreliable, and often incompatible.  Further, significant information 
relevant to human resource management is entirely absent or exists in haphazard form at 
either the central or provincial levels. Compounding the information gaps and 
inconsistencies is the weakness in the skill level of those responsible for managing both 
information and people.  Similarly, at the sub national level, information is inconsistent 
and manually maintained.  
 
Within the overall development of the Integrated Information System for Education 
(SIIE), a crucial module to be developed and implemented is the HRMIS.  The project 
would support development of an integrated HRMIS, accessible both from the central 
and provincial levels: (i) integrated software with appropriate sub modules related to key 
functional areas of HRM; (ii) computer hardware (computers, printers, servers, 
connectivity) for The National Directorate of Finances (DNF), the National Directorate of 
Administration (DNA), DNHR, DINEIB, and DINAMEP at MEC and 22 Provincial 
MEC Directorates; (iii) capacity building for the Information Unit within MEC and at the 
provincial levels through training and equipment; and (iv) subsequent training in the 
utilization of HRMIS for personnel within both the central and provincial  levels.  
 
Information is part of the answer, but management systems and processes are the other 
key subcomponent for improved teacher utilization.  The project will also support the 
design, modification and implementation of critical human resource management 
Page  3
processes and procedures for a more effective personnel system for teachers.  These 
management systems tend to concentrate at the provincial level where most teacher-
related activities occur.  In addition, some HRM functions appropriately reside at the 
school level (School Principal). Finally, the need to assure the normative, evaluative and 
oversight roles of the central level require management support at this level, as well.  
 
The project will address management improvement needs at the central and provincial 
levels and will support the determination of appropriate levels of decision-making and 
actions among them.  The activities to be supported include: (i) determination of the 
distribution of HRM functions within and between the central and provincial and school 
levels, support for the organization (reorganization) of the HR function at both the central 
and provincial levels, development of operating manuals for each of the key subsystems, 
and implementation of the newly structured subsystems and corresponding procedures; 
(ii) analysis of legal parameters, limits and opportunities for modifying current practices 
and procedures in HRM and a system design based upon legal requirements of the Ley 
General de Educaci√≥n and the Ley del Magisterio and subordinate legislation; and (iii) 
trainingfor administrative personnel in the HR management system at the central and 
provincial levels.  
 
Strengthening Provision of Early Childhood Education  
 
The objective of this subcomponent is to strengthen the Ministry of Educationíscapacity 
to deliver coordinated quality ECE services.  Currently ECE services are offered by the 
following institutions: Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Social Welfare, 
Ministry of Labor and Human Resources, Ministry of Public Health, and Ministry of 
Urban Development and Housing.  
 
The National Initial Education Directorate of MEC will be responsible for 
implementation of this subcomponent.  All the activities focus on quality and institutional 
strengthening and are intended to serve as many ECE institutions and beneficiaries as 
possible. The objectives of this subcomponent will be achieved through the activities 
described below: (i) printing and dissemination of curricular parameters for ECE 
providers (CP) including  workshops with staff of ECE institutions; (ii) designing, 
printing and distributing pedagogical ECE standards and competencies and providing 
technical assistance, training and validation workshops at the provincial level including 
training of ECE directors and educators on pedagogical standards and competency 
applications; and (iii) providing  technical assistance in the  design of teachersí and 
managersí training programs.  
 
Component  2:  Increasing the Number and Improved Distribution of Teachers (Total 
Costs are estimated at US$32 million, with contingencies)  
 
The problem of basic education coverage is one of teacher distribution as well as of 
overall teacher numbers. This component aims to improve basic education coverage by 
increasing the number of basic education teachers, particularly in rural and marginal 
areas. During the last five years, there has been a hiring freeze for teachers, which has 
Page  4
further reduced MECís ability to provide adequate coverage leading to a growing backlog 
of demand. The Ministry of Finance (MEF) has agreed to the need to increase the number 
of teachers, but has been concerned with the fiscal implications.  To hire additional 
teachers while minimizing fiscal impact, the GOE/MEC has developed a strategy to 
encourage those teachers eligible for retirement to retire, and then hire new and better-
trained (but lower cost) teachers who can be assigned to meet the demand in areas of 
greatest need for teachers (rural and indigenous areas).  
 
Teachers are eligible for retirement when they reach (i) 60 years of age and 30 years of 
service; (ii) when they are 70 years of age or older; or (iii) if they complete 40 years of 
service. Currently, there are an estimated 7,000 teachers who satisfy these criteria but 
have chosen not to retire because their income as teachers is roughly 4 times what they 
would receive as retirees. The voluntary retirement program will offer eligible teachers a 
single, lump-sum payment. After a nationwide consultation process using focus groups 
and a survey, MEC estimates that this incentive will encourage approximately 4,000 
teachers to retire.  
 
The resources from the Bank financed Programmatic Human Development Reform 
Loan (PHDRL) have co-financed the development and application of a demand-based 
formula, the purview of a national commission, formed to develop salary policy and 
which includes representation from MEC, MEF, the teacherís union, and the civil society.  
The formula takes into account the demand in the under-served areas (rural, poor, 
indigenous and Afrro-Ecuadorians). The initial definition of the number of teacher 
positions required in a given province or canton where a formula-based assignment 
indicates there is greatest need, will be made at the central level.  The selection and 
appointment will continue to be carried out at the provincial level.  Those teachers that 
are eligible for retirement are positioned at the upper end of the teacher salary scale and 
earn, on average, US$770 per month.  A newly-hired teacher, on the other hand, earns 
approximately US$250 per month.  Thus, MEC estimates that 2.5 new teachers could be 
hired for every retiree, with no additional fiscal burden.  A portion of new teacher 
assignments will be directed to those schools experiencing retirements from teaching 
posts where existing demand requires replacement; in schools that lack teachers and in 
schools that had been previously closed due to lack of teachers. The teachers would be 
assigned to schools that meet minimum functioning requirements regarding school 
infrastructure and provision of pedagogical materials. The newly appointed and better 
trained teachers will benefit close to 100,000 students.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Indigenous People (OD 4.10) is triggered and an Indigenous Peoples Plan has been 
prepared.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The proposed project will support Intercultural Bilingual Education by ensuring 
availability of teachers in schools serving poor, marginalized indigenous communities.  
Ensuring teacher availability would result from improved human resource management 
and redistribution of teachers based on identified needs.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Ministry of Education has a General Directorate (DINEIB) which deals specifically 
with intercultural and bilingual issues at all levels of the system.  The country has a clear 
constitutional mandate regarding education for indigenous population already in place.  
The project, as with previous projects financed by the Bank, will continue supporting 
intercultural bilingu
al education, following the MEís recommendations.  Staff from 
DINEIB working on early childhood education prepared the action plan (IPDP) to 
enhance the quality of the service provided in those centers coordinated by DINEIB.  
Their plan is fully incorporated and financed as part of component 2 of this project.
