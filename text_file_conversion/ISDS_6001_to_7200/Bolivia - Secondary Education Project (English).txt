2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to support the Governmentís education strategy 
which aims to expand secondary education coverage and retention of disadvantaged 
groups, improve the quality of education services in targeted areas where secondary 
enrollments are particularly low, and strengthen decentralized education management.  
 
Progress towards achieving the project objectives will be monitored through: (i) the 
already established education management information system, which regularly collects 
information on education indicators of students at all levels; and (ii) the recently re-
structured National assessment system (Observatorio de la Calidad).  Key project 
indicators include: (i) secondary school coverage provided to at least 16,000 students in 
secondary education in the 98 targeted municipalities; (ii) improved retention of at least 
20% (approximately 2,212) of students at risk of education failure; (iii) piloting and 
implementing at least one alternative secondary education model incorporating 350 out-
ofñschool youth; (iv) At least 50% of all secondary education teachers are trained in at 
least two subjects (math and language) and are using new pedagogical and curricular 
material sin the classroom and ; (v ) 850 secondary school principals  are fully aware of 
the secondary education transformation process and implementing management and 
pedagogical changes in the schools ; (vi) revision of the math and language curricula to 
Page  2
incorporate intercultural and skills-based parameters; and (vii) basic didactic and library 
materials provided  to all (2,500) secondary education institutions and effectively used by 
teachers and students (for a more detailed list of indicators see Annex 3 in the Project 
Appraisal Document).   
 
3. Project Description 
The project consists of three components: (i) improving access and retention of students 
at the secondary school level; (ii) improving the quality and relevance of secondary 
school education; and (iii) strengthening decentralized education management.  
 
Component 1: Access and Retention at the Secondary School Level.  This component 
supports efforts by the ME to promote expansion of coverage and retention in secondary 
education (grades 9 through 12) by: (i) increasing access to secondary schooling for at 
least 16,000 male and female students in 98 targeted municipalities, equivalent to almost 
3
%
of
secondary school enrollment; (ii) increasing retention of approximately 2212 
students representing 20% of the students at risk of educational failure in targeted 
municipalities; and (iii) developing and implementing a pilot of at least one type of 
alternative secondary education model in 7 targeted municipalities to incorporate 350 
out-of-school youth, aged 14 -19.  The objectives of this component will be achieved 
through the following 3 subcomponents:  
 
Subcomponent 1.1: Educational Infrastructure and Equipment.  This subcomponent 
aims to increase the availability of student places and improve the physical conditions of 
secondary schools by constructing 10 new schools, expanding and rehabilitating 88 
existing schools, and providing furniture and laboratory equipment.  The project will 
finance: (i) the rehabilitation and new construction of approximately 432 classrooms; (ii) 
the construction of 324 sanitary facilities for teachers and students; and (iii) the 
construction and equipping of 294 science, physics, and computer laboratories in 98 
secondary schools.  432 new teachers, 10 principals and 20 administrative support 
personnel will be reassigned or hired by the ME to support the provision of secondary 
education in the new and expanded facilities.  
 
Subcomponent 1.2: Pedagogical Support for Students at Risk of Education Failure.  This 
sub component aims to provide pedagogical support to 2212 students with low academic 
achievement and at risk of dropping out of school in the targeted municipalities.  
 
Subcomponent 1.3: Implementation of a Pilot of at Least One Alternative Secondary 
Education Model.  This sub component aims to improve access of approximately 350 
out-of-school youth, aged 14-19, by developing a pilot of at least one type of alternative 
secondary education model which has been proven to be an effective means of providing 
quality schooling in other countries.  This sub-component will finance: (i) a study to 
define the most appropriate modality(ies); (ii) implementation of at least one modality on 
a
pilot basis in 7 targeted municipalities; and (iii) an independent evaluation which will 
define the future expansion of the model(s) at the national level.

Component 2: Quality and Relevance of Secondary Education.  This component 
supports efforts by the ME to improve the quality and relevance of the education system 
by providing for the participatory development and implementation of a new curriculum, 
supported by the provision of new textbooks, school libraries, and science equipment; 
and the revamping of the pre-service and in-service training programs for secondary 
school teachers and principals.  The objective of this component will be achieved through 
the 2 subcomponents described below:  
 
Subcomponent 2.1: Development and Implementation of a New Secondary School 
Curriculum.  This subcomponent will finance: (i) the participatory design of a national 
curriculum to replace the present obsolete curriculum (dating back to1973), starting with 
Language and Mathematics and continuing with the subsequent yearly inclusion of 
Science, Social Science and other subject areas; and (ii) the provision of a basic library of 
about 80 titles for the use of both teachers and students, and a set of classroom didactic 
and learning materials for all 2,500 secondary schools.  
 
Subcomponent 2.2: Revision of Teacher Training and Management Programs.  This 
subcomponent aims to increase secondary school quality and relevance through the: (i) 
participatory design of a new curriculum for secondary school pre-service teacher 
training; (ii) implementation of the new curriculum in 8 teacher training institutes (INS) 
for Language and Mathematics; (iii) improvement of INS institutional organization and 
management; and (iv) revision and systematization of in-service teacher training for 
secondary school teachers and principals.  Approximately 9,250 (or 50% of all current 
secondary school teachers), will receive adequate in-service training in their knowledge 
areas, and all of the 850 secondary school principals will be trained on general 
management and pedagogical issues.  
 
Component 3: Decentralized Education Management.  This component aims to 
strengthen management capacity at the central, departmental, municipal and school levels 
to facilitate actions to improve access, retention and quality of secondary education. In 
line with the decentralization process of Bolivia, the project will involve municipalities as 
key actors.  The objective of this component will be achieved through the three 
subcomponents described below:  
 
Subcomponent 3.1: Strengthening of Local Level Education Management.  This 
subcomponent would support a strategy that includes the preparation of ìsecondary 
transformation municipal subprojectsî in selected schools of the 98 targeted 
municipalities, strengthening of the Municipal Education Committees, and creation of 
School Councils that would include members of the local community: teachers, parents, 
municipal administrators, Education District Director, and representatives of the private 
sectors.  
 
Subcomponent 3.2: Information, Monitoring, and Evaluation Systems.  This 
subcomponent aims to strengthen the education information system at the municipal and 
departmental levels.  The project will finance the provision of equipment to 98 targeted 
Page  4
municipalities and the establishment of a secondary education monitoring and evaluation 
subsystem.  
 
Subcomponent 3.3: Social Communication Strategy.  This subcomponent aims to 
develop a wide consultation process and disseminate the secondary education strategic 
actions among all key stakeholders by financing a communication strategy.  
 
As the Ministry of Education moves towards the full implementation of a SWAp, this 
component will focus on improving the capacity of the ME to enhance its financial and 
accounting practices at the central, departmental, and municipal levels and revise its 
procurement and financial management norms in accordance with international standards.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The World Bank Safeguard policies applicable to this project are: the Environmental 
Assessment Policy and the Indigenous Peoples Policy.  
 
Most of the school construction (additions and rehabilitations) will be conducted in 
schools already established and owned by the municipalities.  Only ten new schools will 
be built in sites owned by the municipalities.  By law, Bolivia has established that 
infrastructure at the municipal level has to be executed through the National Social and 
Productive Investment Fund (FPS).  As part of its official documents, the FPS has 
Page  5
produced a free-
standing environmental manual (Manual de Buenas Pr√°cticas 
Ambientales) which, in 2002, received a no objection from the World Bank and has been 
used during the execution of the ongoing projects financed by IDA.  Said manual takes 
into consideration most of the environmental risks associated with school construction 
and establishes mitigating actions to ameliorate them.  
 
Regarding the indigenous people, the Ministry of Education has a specialized office 
dealing with intercultural and bilingual education issues.  The project will adhere to its 
well-recognized policies regarding curriculum development, teacher training and 
textbook production.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The FPS as the institution that will carry out the school construction and rehabilitation 
subcomponent has been using environmental guidelines already approved by the Bank 
since 1992.  During project preparation, the environmental manual was revised and the 
consultantís recommendations were discussed with the FPS and it was agreed  these 
would be  added to said manual.  
 
Regarding Indigenous People, the Ministry of Education has a General Directorate 
dealing specifically with intercultural and Bilingual issues at all levels of the system.  The 
country has a clear constitutional mandate regarding education for indigenous population 
already in place.  The project, as with previous projects financed by the Bank, will 
continue supporting intercultural bilingual education, following the MEís 
recommendations.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The Ministry of Education will disclose the IPP and environmental guidelines on its web 
page.
