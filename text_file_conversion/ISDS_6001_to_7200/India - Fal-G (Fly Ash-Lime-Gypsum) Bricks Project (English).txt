A.2. Project Objectives  
 
The global environment objective of this project is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse 
gases by increasing the market penetration of a more climate-friendly brick 
manufacturing technology. The development objectives of the project include the 
creation of business opportunities for small enterprises using a more climate-friendly 
technology, including the possibility of more stable employment for seasonal brick 
workers, and improving the environmental sustainability of construction materials in the 
country. 
 
The use of the FaL-G technology for making fly ash bricks will significantly reduce the 
levels of local air pollution (including large amounts of dust and particulate matter) and 
greenhouse gases while also reducing the level of denudation of fertile topsoil which 
occurs during traditional clay brick production.  The project will displace the demand for 
fossil energy (primarily coal) because the FaL-G process does not require sintering. The 
project will also reduce the environmental impacts associated with the disposal of 
potentially harmful by-products of power plant operation such as fly-ash by utilizing 
these waste products as a building material.  The project also has positive employment 
aspects, as it will create business opportunities for small entrepreneurs who wish to open 
new FaL-G brick making units and will improve employment opportunities for brick 
workers who will now have more opportunity for year-round (as opposed to seasonal) 
work in peri-urban areas.  
 
The principal beneficiaries of the project include: 
o
The local community in the 108 proposed plant sites, who will be exposed to reduced 
negative environmental impacts which could occur from the traditional clay brick 
manufacturing process, such as land degradation and local air pollution 
Page  2
o
The local community, including small enterprises, who will have increased business 
opportunities and the local workers, who will experience an improvement in 
employment type from seasonal work to year-round employment. 
o
The industrial and utility sectors, which will benefit from the reduced cost and 
environmental impacts of fly ash disposal due to increased off-take by the fly-ash 
brick manufacturers. 
o
The global community, which will benefit from the reduction in GHG emissions 
 
A.3. Project Description  
 
The CO
2
emission reductions generated from the deployment of FaL-G technology in 108 
new brick plants to be set up in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, 
Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh will be verified by independent 
auditors and purchased by the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) managed 
by the World Bank.  
 
The FaL-G project aims to promote fly ash bricks as an alternative to burnt clay brick 
within the construction sector in India by facilitating  establishment of about 108 FaL-G 
plants in various parts of the country. The project will promote only small-scale plants 
(production capacity ranging from 2 to 6 million bricks per year) with a view to create 
business opportunities for the small enterprises.   
 
This project will result in sale of 600,000 ERs to the Community Development Carbon 
Fund of the World Bank. The sponsors have agreed to further enhance the community 
benefits of the project by ensuring implementation of health insurance schemes for the 
workers, providing proper water and sanitation  facilities to the workers and evolving a 
mechanism to discourage employment of child and bonded labor in FaL-G plants.  
 
Institutional Framework 
 
The project will be promoted jointly by the Institute for Solid Waste Research & 
Ecological Balance (INSWAREB) and Eco Carbon Private Limited (ECPL). 
INSWAREB is a non-profit and non-governmental organization (NGO) based at 
Visakhapatnam in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India and is engaged in research and 
development in the field of building materials. INSWAREB will provide technology 
know-how, O&M and logistical support to the micro enterprises under the project.  
 
Eco-Carbon private Limited (ECPL), a commercial entity based in Visakhapatnam, is the 
key agency which will implement the project. ECPL will also be responsible for the 
carbon transaction aspects of the project.  ECPL will play the role of a bundling entity 
(on behalf of the individual entrepreneurs) and would be the key counterpart for the 
CDCF. ECPL will provide services, along with INSWAREB, to catalyze the adoption of 
new production plants, supervise their operations, coordinate and bundle monitoring and 
verification procedures with the accredited agency, and transfer the ERs to the World 
Bank or its nominees under a mutually acceptable mechanism. In order to act as a 
bundling agency and have rights to sell the emission reductions achiev
ed by individual 
Page  3
entrepreneurs, ECPL will acquire the rights to these emission reductions by entering into 
legal agreement with individual entrepreneurs.  
 
The Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) of the World Bank will purchase 
the ERs generated from the bundled activity and will sign the Emission Reduction 
Purchase Agreement (ERPA) with ECPL in this regard.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project proposes to target the following Indian states: Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, 
Karnataka, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. FaL-G plants are 
likely to be set up in the vicinity of thermal power plants in order to have an easy supply 
of fly ash. The location of individual FaL-G plants will be decided by the entrepreneurs 
in consultation with the project sponsors considering various market, regulatory, 
economic, social and environmental factors. 
 
FaL-G plants are required to obtain necessary approvals from the State authorities, including those relating 
to environment. This process would ensure that there would be an independent check on appropriateness of 
individual unit locations. The project neither involves any land acquisition under eminent domain, nor any 
involuntary resettlement. Land required for constructing a FaL-G plant is either owned by the entrepreneur 
or is purchased directly from the land owners at an agreed price. 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
 : B  
Comments: The project involves deployment of a cleaner technology for brick 
manufacturing. There are no significant adverse impacts associated with the project. The 
adverse environmental and social impacts are far lower compared to the prevailing 
practices of brick production in India. The few residual impacts of the project (as 
discussed in the following sections) are addressable through adoption of appropriate 
mitigation and management measures. Therefore, the project has been classified as a 
Category-B  project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01)
:
While conventional brick manufacturing requires use of natural 
resources like soil and coal, which are non-renewable, the proposed project supports promotion of a 
technology, that would primarily use industrial wastes such as fly ash (from thermal power plants) and 
gypsum (from fertilizer industries) to produce alternative walling materials. By reusing the industrial 
wastes (fly ash from thermal power plants and gypsum from fertilizer plants), it would reduce the 
environmental impacts associated with disposal of these industrial wastes. Similarly, by promoting the 
production and use of FaL-G bricks and blocks, it would avoid the environmental impacts associated with 
clay brick production, as well as contribute to reduction of green house gas emissions.  
 
Other project impacts include occupational health and safety issues for the workers and those associated 
with the poor on-site living facilities provided to the workers. The occupational health and safety issues 
relate to exposure to high concentrations of particulates during handling of fly ash and other raw materials 
at the site. Air pollution due to particulates from removal, handling, transport and storage of large quantities 
of material like ash can also be significant where there are dwellings close to the site.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The inflow of migrant laborers, which is common in the brick making sector, could lead 
to increased risks of HIV/AIDs. Measures would be taken to generate awareness about 
HIV/AIDS and support would be provided to control the incidence of this disease.   
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
 
Compared to the conventional clay brick technologies, FaL-G technology offers an 
environmentally superior performance on global as well as local scales. It completely 
avoids the use of thermal energy and hence consumption of coal, resulting in 
corresponding reduction of CO
2
,
the major GHG. It also reduces the environmental 
impacts associated with disposal of industrial wastes, particularly fly ash and gypsum. 
Unlike conventional brick kilns that run for about 150 days, FaL-G plants can run 
throughout the year resulting in more stable employment for workers.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Addressing Safeguards Issues
:
As part of the project preparation, ECPL has prepared an 
Environmental and Social Report that includes measures that will be taken up by the 
individual units to mitigate the residual environmental impacts that are envisaged. The 
environmental study carried out for the project has identified certain adverse impacts 
related to the occupational health and safety of the workers, and to a limited extent, on 
local pollution due to dust emissions and inadvertent discharge of (waste) materials into 
the environment. Concerns rega
rding exposure to 
radioactivity from fly ash
were also 
Page  5
identified during the study. However, its levels have been documented to be well within 
the applicable norms. As the FaL-G activity falls in the small/micro sector, the 
entrepreneurs do not have established processes for managing the environmental aspects 
of their operation. However, ECPL has developed an environmental management plan 
that will be implemented at each FaL-G plant to address the environmental issues 
identified above. Obtaining relevant environmental clearances and commitment to 
implement certain minimum environmental and social measures are included as some of 
the upfront requirements for the entrepreneurs in order to participate in the project and 
benefit from the carbon credits generated. In addition to personal protection devices and 
improved plant level amenities like safe water supply and adequate sanitation that are 
mandatory, certain voluntary good practices have been included in the EMP. The 
implementation of this plan is a requirement for continued flow of carbon offset 
revenues.  
 
The social due diligence study carried out on sample FaL-G units indicate that the project 
would not involve any acquisition of land for undertaking project activities and, 
therefore, no involuntary resettlement is envisaged. Similarly, these units do not impact 
any adverse impacts on tribal communities. While about 20% of workforce (mostly 
technical and supervisory) is permanent, the rest of it is largely contractual and wages are 
paid on piece work basis and, therefore, there is no wage discrimination based on the 
gender of the worker. The use of child workers in the plants covered under the study was 
not reported. The entrepreneurs would ensure that no child labour is used in the working 
of the FaL-G plants. Workers in FaL-G units will have better living conditions. Some of 
the units provide permanent rooms for workers staying at site and have access to basic 
amenities. Further measures to enhance living and health condition are proposed (as part 
of Community Benefit Plan) under the project that include insurance scheme for workers 
(health and accident) and proper sanitation for workers.  
 
The sponsor will provide training / guidance to sensitize workers to increase awareness 
among the workers on HIV/AIDS, ensure periodical medical check ups and would 
network with local health workers and NGOs to check the occurrence of HIV/AIDS 
among FaL-G workers, and provide guidance where required.  Overall, the safeguard 
risks of the Project are considered to be minimal.  
 
In order to further enhance the social benefits of the project, a Community Benefit Plan 
(CBP) is included in the project, which provides workers and their families with group 
insurance scheme (health and accident), and improved on-site sanitation. Part of the 
earnings realized from the sale of emission reduction generated by the units is earmarked 
for the implementation of the CBP and the EMP.  
 
Assessment of capacity to implement the EMP
:
As the FaL-G activity falls in the 
small/micro industrial sector, the entrepreneurs are not expected to have the required 
capacity to implement the EMP The project proponent will provide training on safety and 
environmental protection to the participating units every year. Although ECPL, the 
project sponsor is a new entity, its promoters have considerable experience in dealing 
with FaL
-
G
entrepreneurs. ECPL will use carbon credits as the leveraging tool for 
Page  6
influencing better environment management at individual sites. ECPL will carry out 
periodic supervision of the implementation of the EMP, which will be supplemented by 
third party periodic audits.  
.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders
 are the workers in FaL-G plants, entrepreneurs, local government officials from SPCB, 
District Administration, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), commercial financing agencies, 
local health workers, NGOs, etc., and ECPL as project sponsor and key intermediary between all actors.  
 
Mechanisms for disclosure
:
Copies of the ESR will be accessible to the public in the FaL-G plants, offices 
of the respective District administrations, and the State Pollution Control Board. Copy of the ESR is also 
made available at the website of Institute for Solid Waste Research and Ecological Balance (INSWAREB). 
ECPL will also print posters for easier communication with local groups that are likely to be less literate.
