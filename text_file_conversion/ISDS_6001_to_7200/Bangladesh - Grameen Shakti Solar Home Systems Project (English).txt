2. Project Objectives: 
The objective of the proposed project is to contribute to sustainable development through the 
provision of renewable solar electricity to households not connected to the electricity grid and 
thereby reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by displacing kerosene and diesel use for 
lighting and off-grid electricity generation. 
 
3. Project Description: 
The project envisages installing 929,169 Solar Home Systems (SHS) all across Bangladesh 
between 2007 and 2015.  The SHS will provide facilities for lighting, TV and radio and comprise 
of: (a) a Solar Module (10 to 120wp); (b) battery ( 47 Ah to 130 Ah); (c) Charge Controller; (d) 
fluorescent tube lights with special electronic ballasts; (e) mounting structure; (f) installation kit; 
and (g) cables and connecting devices. The capacity of individual SHS will vary according to 
consumer choice and demand. The cost of SHS would be recovered through monthly instalments 
over a period of up to 4 years which will be within the affordable capacity of the targeted 
consumers.  Upon full implementation in year 2015, the project activity will replace 20,075 kilo 
litres per annum of kerosene usage, equivalent to an emissions reduction of 48,380.75 tonnes 
CO2e per annum and 16,600,500 KWh/ year of electricity generation using diesel generators.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The SHSs will have a variety of positive social impacts enabling the users to access radio and 
television signals, students and others to work in a safer and more pleasant environment, and 
prolonging the hours available to users for various commercial, educational, cultural and social 
activities.  They will also be environmentally beneficial as use of fossil fuel will be reduced.  The 
only potential environmental hazard may arise from improper disposal of lead-acid storage 
batteries used in SHS. However, these types of batteries have been used in the context of SHS in 
Bangladesh for more than 10 years now and good practice examples of safe disposal are well-
known and are being practiced.  No negative environmental impacts are therefore expected. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area: None 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts:  None 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
Grameen’s SHS program is partly funded from IDA’s Rural Electrification and Renewable 
Energy Development Project (REREDP) being implemented by the Infrastructure Development 
Company Limited (IDCOL).  As part of the IDA project an Environmental and Social 
Assessment Framework (ESAF) was prepared and as agreed under the ESAF, all borrowers from 
IDCOL, including Grameen, are required to adhere to the ESAF guidelines.  Since improper 
battery disposal is the only potential negative impact in SHS projects, IDCOL has a detailed 
“Policy Guideline for Disposal of Warranty Expired Batteries”.  The policy lays down detailed 
instructions as to how and when customers are to be notified about the expiry of battery 
warranties, how the batteries are to be collected by the POs and sent to six central collection 
Page  3
locations spread all over Bangladesh, how the battery manufacturers should collect the batteries, 
and how the manufacturers should recycle and dispose of the various components.   
 
Grameen is following these guidelines and as a part of its loan monitoring program IDCOL has 
systems in place to monitor the disposal of batteries as well.  Grameen has agents all over 
Bangladesh and it is already assisting SHS owners in the O&M of their systems, which includes 
the safe disposal of batteries.  These arrangements are an integral part of Grameen operations and 
will continue. No negative environmental impacts are therefore expected from battery disposal.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:  Not applicable.
