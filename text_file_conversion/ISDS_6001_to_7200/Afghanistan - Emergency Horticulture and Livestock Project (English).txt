2. Project Objectives

To stimulate perennial horticulture and livestock marketable output in focus areas by improving
the incentives framework for private investments and strengthening institutional capacity in
agriculture. Specific objectives include:

    · Improvements in the production capacity of the horticultural and livestock sectors and
        improvement of market channels for Afghan produces

    · Involvement of women farmers who will particularly benefit from project activities through
        the major role that they play in horticulture and livestock production

    · At a higher level, the project will have a positive impact on broad-based economic growth
        in focus rural areas by increasing the demand for rural non-farm sector output and from
        multipliers on farmers' expenditure

    · On the institution front, project support for the restructuring of MAAHF will help to
        develop the basis for a strong policy, regulatory and support organization for the
        agriculture sector




                                                                                               1

    · Overall, these benefits will contribute to the Bank's rural poverty reduction goals as well as
        providing a key element of a counter narcotics strategy by fostering an alternative to
        poppies and, at the same time, stimulating rural incomes through expanding the rural non-
        farm sector which encompasses the bulk of the poor.

3. Project Description

Project comprises three components: 1) Increasing marketable perennial horticulture output
(US$25.9 million) comprising works, goods, services and grants for: (i) rehabilitating existing
orchards and establishing perennial tree crop cultivations through TA and grants; (ii) establishing a
Horticulture Development Council of Afghanistan (HDCA) and developing MAAHF capacity for
policy planning and supporting horticulture producers; and (iii) supporting pilot activities on the
private sector green raisin and pomegranate export clusters; 2) Increasing Livestock Output and
Productivity (US $22.8 million) comprising works, goods, services and grants for strengthening
institutions in livestock-related services in areas not already covered by other projects. This
includes: supporting the reorganizing the General Directorate for Livestock Protection and
Development (GDLPD); promoting livestock production and marketing initiatives in order to
permit import substitution and stimulate exports of animal products; studies with pastoral
communities to improve rangelands management; and establishing a public/private partnership in
veterinary medicine to ensure a stronger regulatory government role and better profitability and
sustainability of privatized field veterinary services; 3) Capacity Building, Implementation and
Monitoring & Evaluation Support (US$6.4 million) comprising goods, services and incremental
operating costs for developing human and physical capacity in policy formulation, programming
development, financial management and procurement, supervising and monitoring and evaluating
impact. This will enable MAAHF to ensure efficient implementation of the HLP and other
projects.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project has a country wide coverage but the different components may focus on different
areas. The focus areas for the horticultural component of the project are:

    · Plains North of Kabul ­ Rehabilitation and replanting of vineyards that were neglected or
        destroyed during conflict.
    · Area around Mazar-Al-Sharif ­ In such area farmers are already involved in
        rehabilitating orchards. The project will support these and establish new activities.
    · Area around Kandahar ­ This area has the highest potential in terms of grape
        productivity. Sub-projects in this area are however on hold due to security constraints.

The livestock component of the project will focus on the provinces of: Ghazni, Kunduz,
Nangarhar, Parwan, Heart, Bamiyan, Mazar-i-Sharif. An additional 6 provinces that are
considered for inclusion are: Baghland, Takhar, Kapisa, Wardak, Samangan, Logar.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

An Environment and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) has been developed to ensure
compliance with the World Bank's safeguard policies under the current conditions in
Afghanistan and applicable to the HLP. The Emergency Horticulture and Livestock Project has
been prepared in accordance with the Bank's OP 8.50 Emergency Recovery Assistance.

Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework: Recognizing the emergency nature of the
proposed recovery and reconstruction operations, while also ensuring due diligence in managing
potential environmental and social risks, an Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework
(ESSF) has been prepared. The ESSF has been developed to ensure compliance with the World
Bank's safeguard policies under current conditions in Afghanistan and is applicable to the
Emergency Horticulture and Livestock Project. The intention of this framework is to: (i) prevent
the execution of sub-project that might cause significant and irreversible negative impacts; (ii)
decrease or manage potential adverse impacts through modifications to sub-project design,
location or execution; (iii) prevent or mitigate cumulative impacts of small scale investments;
(iv) enhance positive environmental and social impacts of sub-projects; and (v) prevent
additional stress on environmentally sensitive areas.

The ESSF includes: (a) tools for screening of sub-projects, including negative lists of
characteristics that would preclude project funding for these activities; (b) screening, assessment
and clearance procedures; (c) capacity building to ensure effective implementation of the ESSF
at the various implementation levels; and (d) requirements of supervision of implementation,
monitoring of environmental and social conditions, and independent audits of performance.

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:

Given the nature of proposed project activities, no significant adverse cumulative impacts are
anticipated. Moreover, no potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are
expected under the HLP. Any potential cumulative impacts would be recognized by detailed
monitoring that would be carried out to identify any potential concerns and changing conditions,


                                                                                                 3

especially in the initial set of activities to evaluate the impacts and design any additional
mitigation measures. On the positive side, the horticulture component of the project will
establish 10 tree nurseries and create 5000 ha of new orchards. These interventions would lead to
the production of 8 million tree seedlings during three years and 10,000 ha of new orchards in
ten years. Also, the project will finance alfalfa seedlings to be grown as a cover crop for fruit
trees. This would prevent erosion in the new orchards.

To mitigate against unforeseen risks, the ESSF (Appendix 8) has prepared a list of ineligible sub-
projects. Examples of such ineligible sub-projects include:

    · Sub-projects the require pesticides that fall in WHO classes IA, IB or II;
    · Sub-projects requiring new or expanded irrigation schemes;
    · Sub-projects that cause involuntary acquisition of land, or the resettlement or
        compensation of more than 200 people;
    · Sub-projects that Affects waters in riparian neighbors.

Small-scale impacts may arise inadvertently, in the unlikely event that the selection, planning,
and implementation of the sub-project interventions and demonstration sites are inadequate.
Although, specific sub-project interventions are not known at this point of time (but will be
known when locations for sub-projects are selected), attention in the selection of sub-projects
should focus on the following potential threats:

    · Use of pesticide and insecticides that may cause harm to natural resources and human
        health;
    · Unsustainable grazing causing land degradation (increased erosion);
    · Possible effluents from the diary units;
    · Limited construction activities.

The ESSF provides guidelines for controlling negative impacts that may arise as a consequence
of specific sub-projects.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:

No indirect and/or long term impacts have been identified. However, to mitigate against
unforeseen risks, the ESSF (Appendix 8) has prepared a list of ineligible sub-projects. The ESSF
also provides a framework for controlling negative impacts that may arise as a consequence of
specific sub-projects.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts:

The potential environmental and social issues in the project (with particular reference to the
OP/BP4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP4.09 Pest Management) should be considered on
a case by case basis. Potential impacts are addressed through an Environment and Social
Safeguards Framework (ESSF) for the project.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

As a result of more than two decades of conflict, exodus of trained personnel, low salaries, and
the lack of exposure to new approaches, the Borrower's institutional capacity is generally weak,
especially in such specialized areas as safeguard policies. To address this issue, the HLP will
establish an Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) within the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Food (MAAHF) which will be responsible for overall
Project Implementation including safeguard issues. The IMST will at the same time provide a
vehicle for transferring knowledge and skills to the MAAHF.

IDA is preparing a Technical Assistance project on capacity building of the National
Environmental Protection Agency Environmental (NEPA) and to support the creation of
Environment Units in line ministries, including the MAAHF. An Environmental and Social
Specialist will be working with the government and IDA teams to help facilitate the application
of the environmental framework for Afghanistan.

The Environment and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) has been prepared also with the
objective of facilitating the identification of relevant areas of skill building while providing
guidelines for controlling potential negative environmental impacts.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:

The overall responsibility of project implementation rests with the Ministry of Agriculture and
Animal Husbandry and Food. The MAAHF will act through an Implementation and
Management Support Team (IMST) which will be headed by a Manager who will be responsible
fro the minister MAAHF for overall Project Implementation.

This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed on the basis of an overall
Framework for World Bank-funded reconstruction operations which was prepared in
consultation with the principal NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction
activities in Afghanistan. Prior to approval of the project by the World Bank Board, it will be
disclosed by the Government of Afghanistan in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it
will also be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. It is worth noting that Government of
Afghanistan intends to make all project documentation publicly available through the Afghan
Information Management System (AIMS).
