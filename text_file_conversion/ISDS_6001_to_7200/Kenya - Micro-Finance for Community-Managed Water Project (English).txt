Project
Objectives
from
section
of
PCN
The
proposed
pilot
project
will
implement
an
output
based
approach
for
partial
finance
of
community
managed
water
supply
projects
in
rural
and
peri
urban
areas
which
use
loans
from
micro
finance
institutions
to
finance
their
investments
for
new
projects
or
for
rehabilitation
and
augmentation
The
purpose
of
the
pilot
is
to
demonstrate
that
microfinance
has
an
innovative
role
to
play
in
financing
small
water
infrastructure
in
the
country
Use
of
micro
finance
linked
to
OBA
is
also
envisaged
to
increase
sustainability
of
small
community
managed
water
supply
projects
While
the
pilot
is
for
the
Nairobi
region
lessons
from
this
experience
will
help
in
scaling
up
this
approach
in
Kenya
as
well
as
provide
lessons
for
other
countries

Project
Description
from
section
of
PCN
GPOBA
will
provide
partial
subsidies
to
about
CWPs
selected
through
a
transparent
and
demand
responsive
approach
Each
CWP
sub
project
will
be
pre
financed
through
a
combination
of
its
own
resources
and
a
loan
from
the
K
Rep
Bank
a
domestic
micro
finance
bank
in
Kenya
K
Rep
Bank
will
follow
its
normal
due
diligence
process
for
this
loan
offer
On
successful
completion
of
the
project
and
related
certification
of
the
outputs
by
an
independent
audit
firm
a
partial
subsidy
of
of
total
project
cost
will
be
made
to
the
CWP
to
refinance
a
part
of
the
loan
from
the
K
Rep
Bank
The
subsidy
amount
has
been
determined
on
the
basis
of
an
assessment
of
overall
household
affordability
applied
at
the
scheme
level
Responsibility
for
repayment
of
the
remaining
loan
will
be
with
each
CWP
mainly
through
operating
surplus
on
CWP
accounts
This
arrangement
will
ensure
injection
of
market
rigour
in
the
financing
of
investments
and
subsequent
operations
Typically
two
types
of
projects
are
expected
to
be
taken
up
i
Rehabilitation
and
or
augmentation
project
Many
on
going
CWPs
require
investments
to
upgrade
or
replace
existing
infrastructure
and
or
to
expand
services
to
those
who
do
not
have
higher
service
levels
e
g
house
taps
Such
investments
will
benefit
the
community
through
a
higher
average
level
of
service
e
g
higher
reliability
of
service
for
all
households
as
well
as
by
expanding
services
to
additional
households
These
investments
are
likely
to
include
increased
storage
facilities
expansion
and
replacement
of
pipelines
or
specific
new
connections
ii
New
Greenfield
projects
Investments
in
these
are
to
establish
a
new
water
project
and
would
include
all
normal
components
of
a
piped
community
water
project
Access
to
the
project
will
be
for
members
who
have
paid
membership
fees
as
suggested
by
project
s
by
laws
Such
systems
will
serve
the
entire
population
through
a
mixture
of
service
levels
with
members
accessing
water
through
individual
connections
and
others
through
shared
communal
water
points
Under
the
proposed
program
small

water
supply
projects
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
Nairobi
