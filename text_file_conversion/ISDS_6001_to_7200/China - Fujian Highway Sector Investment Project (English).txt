2. Project Objectives 
The project aims to increase the effective use of the road infrastructure in Fujian Province 
to support its social and economic development.  This objective seeks to contribute to: (i) 
improving living conditions in rural areas-particularly those in the areas of the Province 
where poverty rates are higher-by enhancing the transport accessibility of the rural 
communities to economic opportunities and social services; (ii) stimulating higher 
economic growth in Fujian Province by reducing transport costs; and (iii) facilitating the 
interconnection across the coastal provinces.  In this respect, the project will meet both 
the provincial government objective to improve the transport network to support the 
social and economic development of the province (especially in the economically lagging 
counties), and the central government objective to facilitate transport interconnections 
across Coastal Provinces.   
 
3. Project Description 
Component A. Rural Roads Improvement Program (RRIP)  
 
The RRIP aims at improving conditions of the lower class of roads that connect 
administrative villages to the main provincial road network.  The Bank loan will support 
the overall program and finance rural road investments following the rural roads 
implementation framework (RRIF) agreed upon with FPCD.  The RRIF is the integrated 
Page  2
framework of the Procurement Framework, Environmental Framework, Resettlement and 
Minorities Nationalities Framework, and Financial Management Framework, and 
includes the technical and quality control specifications for the rehabilitation and 
improvement of the rural roads and the implementation arrangements for this component.  
Disbursements will be processed based on completed outputs.  The Bank loan will 
support a subset of at least 3,500 km out of the 10,000 km of local road sections already 
identified based on the demand of counties, townships and villages that are part of the 
35,000 km provincial rural roads 2004-2010 program.  
 
The civil works for the RRIP include the improvement and rehabilitation of lower class 
rural roads (Class III and IV) and consist mostly of resurfacing the unpaved roads with 
concrete pavement.  A local consulting firm will supervise the implementation of the 
RRIP component.  FPCD will cover the necessary costs for the dissemination of the 
RRIF and the training of county and local units that wish to implement the framework.  
 
Component B. Yong'an - Wuping Expressway (YWE)  
 
The YWE will be a 195.2 km long section of the Changchun-Shenzhen expressway, 
which is one of the North-South corridors of the CNEN.  The YWE will connect Yong'an 
(Sanming Prefecture) with the border of the Fujian and Guangdong Provinces, at Yanqian 
in Wuping city (Longyan Prefecture).  This component includes the acquisition and 
installation of electrical and mechanical (E&M) works and the construction of buildings 
and annex areas for service and safety operations.  The expressway will consist of four 
lanes that have been designed for a speed of 80 km/hr in the mountainous terrain from 
Yong'an to Liancheng, and of 100 km/hr in the remaining section. The final alignment of 
the expressway has minimized the social and environmental impacts.  A joint local-
foreign consultant firm will supervise the construction of the YWE.  
 
The project's expressway will connect to the North with another expressway currently 
being completed by the Fujian Province and to the South with another expressway 
currently under construction in Guangdong province (expected to be completed in 2008), 
leading to one of China's most industrial and populated cities, Guangzhou.  The 
construction of the expressway segment under the project however will help achieve 
project's development objective and therefore no linkage issues are present in this case.  
 
Component C. Highways Maintenance Pilot Program (HMPP)  
 
The HMPP component consists of maintenance by contract in two highway sections of 
the (non-expressway) provincial highway network. This component seeks to increase the 
efficiency of force-account maintenance practices, which are currently being applied by 
FPCD through the city and county Highway Bureaus.  This component also includes the 
supervision of two contract pilots and it is complemented with technical assistance for 
FPCD maintenance staff as part of the ISP described below.  
 
Component D. Institutional Strengthening Program (ISP)  
 
The ISP includes a study on toll rates, the impact evaluation and monitoring for the 
RRIP, the technical assistance for the HMPP, and training for staff of the agencies and 
institutions involved in the project.  The analysis of toll rates will evaluate alternative 
Page  3
adjustments to maximize the use of the expressway network and optimize its economic 
value, building upon, expanding and updating a similar study undertaken under the 
Second Fujian Highway Project.  The impact evaluation and monitoring study seeks to 
establish a knowledge base of the impacts of the RRIP on rural livelihoods as an 
analytical base for the design of future interventions on those types of roads across Fujian 
Province.  The technical assistance for FPCD maintenance staff will provide the 
knowledge and analytical elements for exploring alternative mechanisms for contracting 
of maintenance activities as well as for the preparation, implementation, supervision, and 
assessment of the preferred contractual scheme under the HMPP.  The training activities 
were built upon those previously carried out under the Second Fujian Highway Project, 
and will focus chiefly on: road asset management, operational management of roads and 
expressways, construction quality control, road safety, and design and operational safety 
considerations for tunnels, innovative mechanisms for tolling and traffic surveillance 
systems, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). They will include both domestic 
training and courses and study tours outside of China as defined in the project training 
program.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The RRIP consists of the paving of existing lower class roads (Class III and IV) with 
concrete pavements.  The roads contained in the RRIP databank (a total of 34,868 km in 
all of the nine cities in Fujian Province) are eligible for a subsidy from FPCD if the 
completed works meet the quality and eligibility standards required by FPCD.  The Bank 
loan will finance the RRIP roads in line with the criteria already being applied by FPCD, 
as well as other World Bank requirements including environmental and social safeguards.  
 
The roads are scattered over the entire province.  They constitute the access from the 
administrative villages to the provincial network.  The roads have an average distance of 
about 5 km and are mostly unpaved and under poor riding conditions.  The project will 
help to improve their condition through paving.  The table below summarizes its main 
physical characteristics.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The construction and operation of YWE would cause such potential large scale impacts 
on the environment as follows:  
 
a) Although there are no protected areas or other valuable natural habitats within the 
project area, the alignment would occupy 605 ha of forestland including 405 ha of 
production forests that mainly consist of cedar and pine plantations.  
 
b)
The alignment would clear 1,317 ha of land and involve 54 million m3 of soil/stone 
works, soil erosion and subsequent water pollution during construction phase will be one 
Page  5
of the major environmental problems.  Water pollution may also be caused by the 
discharge of untreated wastewater from service areas and toll stations as well as spilled 
oil and hazardous materials.  
 
c) Among the 85 sensitive sites (near populated areas), noise levels were predicted to 
exceed the standards at 3 locations during day time and at 27 locations during night time 
in 2010.  Construction works including heavy machinery operation and earth works may 
also cause noise and air (dust) problems.  
 
The expressway component will require land acquisition and relocation of houses.  
Census and inventory survey shows that this component would require the acquisition of 
22,738 mu  of land, including 8,996 mu of cultivated land and 11,612 of forest and 
unutilized land.  It will also require the demolition of 281,251 m2 of housing.  The total 
population affected is 47,990 people of 10,784 households, including 9,522 households 
who will lose part of their land and 1,638 households who will lose houses.  There are no 
ethnic minority communities in the project areas.  
 
Because of its rehabilitation nature largely within existing rights-of-way, the RRIP is 
not expected to require land acquisition or structure relocation.  Though to a reduced 
extent, the implementation of RRIP could cause limited impacts on the environment 
including soil erosion and subsequent water pollution, damage on vegetation and wild 
animals, and noise and dust problems mainly during construction.  It might also be 
possible that roads be located in areas where ethnic minority population live.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
A
national level tourism resort, Guanzhaishan Tourism Area established in 1993, is 
located 1.5 km away from the alignment.  Its rich vegetation and unique landscape has 
attracted more than 1 million tourists in 2005.  The area is managed by Liancheng County 
Tourism Bureau and awarded an ISO14000 certificate for its excellent management 
practice.  According to its Master Plan 2004-2020, its capacity is about 20,000 tourists a 
day, which is far above the current actual tourist number so that likely tourist increase 
induced due to improved accessibility by the project is expected to be well managed.  
 
Three national level nature reserves, Liangyeshan, Meihuashan and Tianbaoyan Nature 
Reserves, are located 10 km, 30 km and 50 km away from the alignment, respectively.  
They distinct themselves by their rich and unique mountainous ecology and access to 
those areas is strictly controlled under their management practice.  Because of their 
distance from the alignment and strict access control, it is highly unlikely that the project 
will have any adverse indirect and long-term impacts on them.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The original feasibility study of the YWE considered the analysis of 16 segments for 
careful consideration of alternative alignments, for a cumulative length of 67% of the 
distance between the beginning and end points on the route.  The alignment finally 
selected minimizes the social and environmental impacts, and resettlement requirements; 
Page  6
and maximizes the overall benefits to the project beneficiaries by taking into account 
local development plans.  Furthermore, the selected alternative avoided most of the 
unfavorable geological locations while achieving appropriate horizontal curves and 
vertical slopes.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
YWE component.  
 
The EA for YWE has been carried out by the Highway Research Institute of MOC, an 
independent organization from FPCD.  The drafts of EIA and EMP were reviewed by the 
Bank and their final versions were submitted to the Bank in March 2006.  A stand-alone 
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) includes an environmental management system, 
environmental management plan, training, environmental monitoring and supervision 
plans, and mitigation measures.  WBPMO/FPCD is responsible for overall coordination 
and guidance while Longyuan YWE Company and Sanming YWE Company are 
responsible for the implementation of EMP.  Environmental monitoring will be carried 
out primarily by the monitoring centers of Longyuan City and Sanming City.  
 
FPCD has maintained a good implementation track record of Bank funded road projects.  
The Fujian Provincial Highway Project was approved in 1994 and was completed in 
December 2003; the ICR rated this project satisfactory including safeguard compliance.  
The Second Fujian Highway Project, which came into effect in 1999 and is currently in 
its final stages of implementation (with the main expressway works already completed), 
has also been rated satisfactory thus far in terms of its safeguard compliance.  
 
For the proper implementation of EMP, training for environmental management staffs, 
construction supervisors, contractors, and hazardous cargo transportation inspectors will 
be held in Fuzhou and in a foreign country.  Environmental monitoring on noise, surface 
water, ambient air and waste will take place at selected sensitive sites as well as 
construction sites, soil borrows and spoil disposal sites.  
 
Following the Chinese laws, regulations and World Bank OP 4.10 on Involuntary 
Resettlement, the borrower has developed a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to address 
the resettlement impacts.  The RAP includes detailed descriptions of the project impacts, 
a
resettlement policy framework, a compensatory and economic rehabilitation strategy 
with initial village plans developed for the 10 seriously affected villages, resettlement site 
planning and relocating arrangements, cost estimate and financing plans.  Fujian Province 
has set up a multi-level organization for the RAP implementation at provincial, city, 
county and township level.  Their arrangements, responsibilities, staffing and training 
plans are detailed in the RAP.  The RAP also details the consultation and participation 
process, as well as the mechanism for grievance redress.  An independent agency will 
also be contracted to monitor the RAP implementation.  
 
Rural Roads Improvement Program (RRIP)  
 
Page  7
Given its programmatic and demand-driven nature, an Environmental Management 
Framework (EMF) has been developed including baseline environmental data, 
environmental management and supervision scheme, EA procedures, training plan, and 
supervision and reporting system.  The draft EMF was reviewed by the Bank and its final 
version was submitted to the Bank in March 2006.  Based on the EMF, an EA is to be 
executed on a county basis prior to the commencement of construction works, and be 
subject to the approval of the County Environmental Protection Bureau. Mitigation 
measures proposed in the EA are to be translated into contractual obligations. The FPCD 
will be responsible for the overall guidance and monitoring, while the city/prefecture 
highway bureaus will be in charge of the monitoring of compliance, and county 
communications bureaus for the implementation of the EMF.  
 
The county communications bureaus will report from the environmental safeguards 
perspective on the completion of the construction activities and final quality of each road 
using checklists developed in the EMF.  For those roads applying for the Bank funds, a 
record of inspection will be submitted to the Bank together with the approval verification 
of FPCD on the compliance with the EMF. During supervision, the Bank will randomly 
check county EAs and the checklists for a sample of Bank-funded roads.  For reference, a 
similar procedure will be applied to a sample of non-Bank funded road segments, as a 
means to assess the dissemination of the framework beyond the Bank-funded roads.  
 
A
land acquisition and resettlement policy framework has been developed for the 
eventuality of exceptional cases where land acquisition or relocation is required.  This 
policy framework has been developed according to local laws and regulations on land 
acquisition as well as World Bank OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.  It describes the 
overall legal framework, planning principles, procedures, compensatory and 
rehabilitation approach, consultation and participatory requirements, grievance redress 
mechanisms, and organizational and monitoring arrangements.  
 
Considering the possibility of financing roads in ethnic minority areas, a stand-alone 
document for the minority nationalities development framework for the RRIP has been 
prepared and disclosed.  All roads to be financed under the project would follow this 
framework in identifying possible negative impacts to areas with minority nationalities, 
and in developing and implementing the necessary development plans.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
For YWE, three rounds of public consultation were carried out in November 2004, July 
2005, and November 2005, in accordance with the World Bank guidelines.  The first 
round of consultation was conducted by means of household visit interviews to 100 
households in which 83 valid answers were collected.  The second and third round of 
consultation included household visit interviews to 520 households (452 valid answers) 
and public meetings (17 places, 418 people).  During this process, project-affected 
individuals, NGOs, local governments and village committees were intensively 
consulted.  The consulted people showed concerns about noise, dust and air pollution 
problems, and requested such mitigation measures as planting, noise insulation, and other 
Page  8
measures.  These requests were incorporated in the engineering designs and EMP.  The 
draft EIA and EAP were disclosed locally at Yong?an City, Liancheng County, 
Shanghang County and Wuping County in March 2006, as well as in Washington D.C. in 
April 2006.  
 
Project information has been disseminated in the project areas.  The affected population 
and local governments participated in the resettlement planning process, including impact 
identification, assessment and planning of mitigation measures.  Villagers will lead the 
development of detailed village resettlement plans.  The RAP will be placed in public 
libraries  and its availability will be advertised in local newspapers.  The resettlement 
plan will be summarized into a booklet and distributed to all affected households.  The 
consultant is working on the summary.  I?ll check if it can be ready before our meeting.  
 
For RRIP, the EMF provides the basics and procedures for public consultation and 
information disclosure are developed, which are to be followed in the preparation of 
county EAs to meet the Bank?s requirement.  The policy framework for resettlement and 
ethnic minorities will be distributed to local areas for implementation.  Mechanisms are 
built into the framework for local population to participate in identifying negative 
impacts, development and implementation of mitigation measures.

Page  9
If in-country disclosure of any of the above documents is not expected, please 
explain why: 
The demand-driven nature of the RRIP does not allow the ex-ante knowledge of whether 
investments will actually take place in areas with ethnic minorities, though the possibility 
is low given the general situation in Fujian.  Nonetheless, this possibility is covered under 
a
stand-alone Minority Nationalities Development Framework.  This framework was 
initially included under the resettlement and land acquisition framework, which was 
disclosed "in-country" on March 28, 2006.  The stand-alone report was again disclosed at 
the end of April.
