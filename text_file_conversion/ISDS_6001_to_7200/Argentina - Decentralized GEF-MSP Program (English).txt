   2. Project Objectives:

   This project is a world-wide pilot initiative in decentralized MSP project selection, involving all
   three GEF implementing agencies and the Government of Argentina. The pilot was proposed as
   a way to try to1 improve the efficiency and transparency of the MSP selection process, to make
   GEF funding iivailable to a larger scope of organizations and institutions, and to strengthen the
   capacity of national and local organizations in Argentina to apply for GEF funding and address
   global envirorunental issues.

   3. Project Description:

   The Decentralized GEF-MSP Program in Argentina is a GEF-project that isjointly run by the 3
   Implementing Agencies IJNDP, UNEP and the World Bank, together with the Government of
   Argentina. A call for prol~osalswas issued in February 2006, resulting in 428 proposal
   submissions with a total value of over $120 million (for a $2.5 million program). After a careful
   screening process, involving screening, first round "short-listing", training workshops with the
   finalists, seco:ndround submissions and final evaluation, 19winning grants of between

US$50,000 and 200,000 were awarded in November 2006. The projects fall within the GEF
focal areas Climate Change, Biodiversity, International Waters, Land Degradation and Persistent
Organic Pollutants (POPS).The supervision of the projects will be divided between the three
Implementing Agencies, including six each for the World Bank and UNDP, and seven for
UNEP. The six World Bank-supervised subprojects are:

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

This project is located in Argentina. The projects are based in the following provinces Tucumh,
Salta, Rio Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz, Misiones, Mendoza and San Juan. The presence of
protected areas, high conservation value areas, indigenous people and the use of pesticides are
the most salient characteristics to the safeguard analysis.

The paragraphs below describe the scope of stakeholder involvement in the subprojects. As part of
ensuring adequate consultation and disclosure of safeguards policies, each subproject will develop a
strategy targete'dto its particular set of stakeholders.

Key stakeholders of this subproject are citric companies, and several small communities located near
rivers and streams in the target area. Government representatives will be also involved in the
consultations, as part of the process will seek to create new legal frameworks for the expansion of the
project.

This subproject directly involves 120families. Other relevant stakeholders are Iruya Municipality, la
Secretaria de Desarrollo y Promoci6n Comunitaria de Salta, OCLADE, and a technical team coming from
the PROINDEE1-PSA project (a World Bank financed project in support of small farmers). The
participation of'indigenous communities in the project area will be addressed and clarified at the very
beginning of the project.

Small producers in the target area of the project will be the direct beneficiaries of the project, and no
negative environmental impacts are expected. Both Ministerio de Ecologia, Recursos Naturales y
Turismo, Provincia Misiones and the Facultad de Ciencias Forestales (Universidad Nacional de Misiones)
will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures.
