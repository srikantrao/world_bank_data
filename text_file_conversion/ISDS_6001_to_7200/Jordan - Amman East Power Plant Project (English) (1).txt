B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The main objective of the project is to meet the electricity needs of the country in an 
economically and environmentally sustainable manner to contribute to economic growth and 
well-being of the population of Jordan.  The project would add about 370 MW of additional 
power to the system, help to ensure the reliability of power supply and help maintain a margin 
between available capacity and demand of at least 10%.  The purpose of the PRG is to enhance 
competition and therefore help reduce the project's financing costs.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project consists of a 370 MW gas-fired combined-cycle power station to be 
developed, owned, and operated by a private-sector project company.  The US$310 million 
power station will be constructed on a site located at Almanakher, east of Amman Jordan and 
about 1 km from the Jordanian Gas Transmission Pipeline.  The fuel supply will be natural gas 
from Egypt; Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) will serve as backup fuel for emergency operations only.

The first phase of the power station will comprise two simple-cycle gas turbines.  The second 
phase will add a Heat Recovery Steam Generator and thus increase the capacity by 50%.  The 
water for steam generation will be provided by the Water Authority of Jordan.  
 
The proposed contractual structure of the transaction is consistent with industry standards with 
respect to the allocation of commercial, technical, and political risks among the parties in a 
limited recourse project financing structure.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The US$310 million power station will be constructed on a site located at Almanakher, east of 
Amman Jordan and about 1 km from the Jordanian Gas Transmission Pipeline.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The Government of Jordan has prepared Category A projects to Bank standards in the past, most 
notably the Disi Water Project.  The Amman East Power Project EA will be prepared by 
independent experts engaged by the successful bidder, who has been selected.
