2. Project Objectives: 
Objective of the project is to support Bangladesh’s efforts to raise levels of social development 
and economic growth by increasing access to electricity in remote rural areas and to reduce 
carbon emissions by overcoming market barriers for renewable energy development. IDCOL’s 
Solar Energy Program has the mission of fulfilling basic electricity requirements in the rural 
areas of Bangladesh and supplementing government’s vision of ‘Electricity for All’ by the year 
2020.  IDCOL, with support from IDA, GEF, GTZ and KfW is channeling funds to small scale 
renewable energy projects under this program. 
 
3. Project Description: 
The program will be implemented through sixteen NGOs/MFIs referred to as Participating 
Organizations (POs). POs select project areas and potential customers, extend loans, install the 
systems, monitor their performance, and provide maintenance support. IDCOL will provide 
grants and refinancing, set technical specification for solar equipment, develop publicity 
materials, provide training, and monitor the PO’s performance. IDCOL will offer soft loans of 
10-year maturity with 2-year grace period at 6% per annum interest to the POs.  The households 
will buy Solar Home Systems (SHS) either for cash or on credit. POs extend loan to the 
households for purchase of SHSs. The loan tenor varies from 1 to 5 years, and interest rate varies 
from 8% to 15% per annum. In all instances, the repayment frequency is monthly.   
 
IDCOL had an initial target of financing 50,000 SHS which it achieved in August 2005, three 
years ahead of the project completion date and US$2 million below estimated costs. Following 
the success of IDCOL’s solar program, the World Bank has extended its support to this project 
and KfW has signed an agreement to provide EUR 16.5 million as a grant to the government to 
42107

be used for further expansion of the program. GTZ has also provided grant for 33,660 SHSs. 
However, the revised target has been set at 200,000 to be achieved by December 2009. Up to 
February 2007, a total of 105,048 solar home systems have been installed under the IDCOL solar 
program. Recently the World Bank has indicated interest to provide additional assistance to 
finance 300,000 more systems.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
 
The SHSs will have a variety of positive social impacts enabling the users to access radio and 
television signals, students and others to work in a safer and more pleasant environment, and 
prolonging the hours available to users for various commercial, educational, cultural and social 
activities.  They will also be environmentally beneficial as use of fossil fuel will be reduced.  The 
only potential environmental hazard may arise from improper disposal of lead-acid storage 
batteries used in SHS. However, these types of batteries have been used in the context of SHS in 
Bangladesh for more than 10 years now and good practice examples of safe disposal are well-
known and are being practiced.  No negative environmental impacts are therefore expected. 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area:  None 
 
Page  3
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse 
impacts:  None 
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described: 
 
IDCOL’s SHS program is partly funded from IDA’s Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy 
Development Project (REREDP).  As part of the IDA project an Environmental and Social 
Assessment Framework (ESAF) was prepared and as agreed under the ESAF, all borrowers from 
IDCOL are required to adhere to the ESAF guidelines.  Since improper battery disposal is the 
only potential negative impact in SHS projects, IDCOL has a detailed “Policy Guideline for 
Disposal of Warranty Expired Batteries”.  The policy lays down detailed instructions as to how 
and when customers are to be notified about the expiry of battery warranties, how the batteries 
are to be collected by the POs and sent to six central collection locations spread all over 
Bangladesh, how the battery manufacturers should collect the batteries, and how the 
manufacturers should recycle and dispose of the various components.   
 
The POs associated with the IDCOL program are all following these guidelines and as a part of 
its loan monitoring program IDCOL has systems in place to monitor the disposal of batteries as 
well.  POs have agents all over Bangladesh and they are already assisting SHS owners in the 
O&M of their systems, which includes the safe disposal of batteries.  These arrangements are an 
integral part of PO operations and will continue. No negative environmental impacts are 
therefore expected from battery disposal.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:  Not applicable.
