A.2. Project Objectives  
 
The development objective of the project is to improve the environmental sustainability 
of the Indian brick manufacturing sector by promoting and financing the introduction of 
an alternative cleaner brick making technology. The global environment objective of this 
project is to reduce the emission of GHG gases by promoting the usage of energy 
efficient brick manufacturing processes.  
 
The principal beneficiaries of the project include: 
 
o
Local communities in the vicinity of the brick manufacturing units who will benefit 
from improved air quality; 
o
Local business communities, including small enterprises,  who will have new 
business opportunities in brick making;  
o
Brick workers who will enjoy increased annual earnings in VSBK plants as opposed 
to the seasonal employment in traditional brick kilns. Workers will also benefit from 
specific community programs supported by the project (health and accident 
insurance, improved sanitation and HIV-AIDS awareness, etc.); 
o
The global community who will benefit from the reduction in GHG emissions 
 
A.3. Project Description  
 
The CO
2
emission reductions generated from the deployment of the VSBK technology in 
126 new brick plants to be set up in the states of Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, 
Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa will be verified by independent auditors and purchased by 
the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) managed by the World Bank.  
 
Page  2
Originally developed in China, and adapted in countries like Vietnam and Nepal, the 
VSBK technology was introduced in India in 1997 by the Development Alternatives 
Group (DA) with financial support from the Swedish Agency for Development and 
Cooperation. With subsequent technical modifications to suit the Indian context, the 
viability of technology has now been established. The project will further facilitate the 
deployment of this energy-efficient technology in the country.  
 
TARA, the social enterprise arm of the Development Alternatives Group, has played a 
key role in introducing and adapting the technology to India. TARA will be the 
implementing agency for the project. In addition to providing technological and technical 
support to the project, TARA will act as a bundling entity (on behalf of individual 
entrepreneurs) and it will acquire the rights to the emission reductions generated by the 
project by entering into a legal agreement with individual entrepreneurs.  It will also be 
responsible for all carbon transaction aspects of the project, and ensure that the monetary 
value of the emission reductions purchased by the Community Development Carbon 
Fund of the World Bank will be transferred to local entrepreneurs in accordance with the 
ERPA. TARA will develop and implement suitable programs and mechanisms to 
catalyze the adoption of the VSBK technology in 126 new plants to be set up prior to 
end-2007. TARA will ensure overall coordination of concerned entrepreneurs and 
monitor the implementation of all project components, including the Environment 
Management Plan (EMP) and the Community Benefit Plan (CBP) enabling the transfer of 
ERs to the CDCF. Individual entrepreneurs will be responsible for mobilizing the 
required resources to set up their individual brick plants and to market and sell the bricks. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will support the establishment of VSBK units in the states of Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, 
Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa. Within these states, locations of individual units will be decided 
by individual entrepreneurs in consultation with the project sponsor TARA, considering market, regulatory, 
economic, social, and environmental factors. Since brick kilns are regulated by respective State Pollution 
Control Boards (SPCBs), their locations would require a No Objection Certificate (NOC) and subsequent 
appropriate permissions from the respective SPCB. This process would ensure that there would be an 
independent check on appropriateness of individual unit locations. The project neither involves any land 
acquisition under eminent domain nor any involuntary resettlement. Land required for constructing a 
VSBK plant is either owned by the entrepreneur or is purchased directly from the land owners on agreed 
price. 
B. Check Environmental Category

Comments: The project involves deployment of a cleaner technology for brick 
manufacturing. There are no significant adverse impacts associated with the project. The 
environmental and social impacts are far lower compared to the prevailing practices of 
brick production in India. The few residual impacts of the project(as discussed in the 
following sections)are addressable through adoption of appropriate mitigation and 
management measures. Therefore, the project has been classified as a Category-B  
project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large-scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP4.01)
:
While conventional brick manufacturing requires use of natural 
resources like soil and coal, which are non-renewable, the proposed project will support promotion of a 
technology, which is proven to be less resource-intensive. Since soil is one of the key ingredients for 
making bricks, some irreversible loss of soil, which could otherwise have been utilized for competing uses 
like agriculture, will still occur. Similarly, although the consumption of coal will be reduced by 30-50% 
compared to the conventional technologies, irreversible loss of some amount of coal will still occur.  These 
losses are however significantly less compared to those that occur with the prevalent practices.  
 
Other project impacts include occupational health and safety issues for the workers and 
those associated with the poor on-site living facilities provided to the workers and their 
dependents. The occupational health and safety issues relate to exposure to high 
concentrations of particulates during coal breaking, exposure to heat during the placing of 
green bricks, and falling of (hot) bricks/brick bats on workers at the time of unloading. 
Air pollution due to particulates from removal, handling, transport and storage of large 
quantities of material like ash can also be significant where there are dwellings close to 
the site. Since brick kilns are seasonal operations, conventionally few facilities for health 
and hygiene of workers are normally provided on-site. Cumulative impacts of the 126 
kilns to be supported under the project would be spread widely across the five States.  
 
Digging up of land for soil to make bricks can potentially lead to some damage to nearby buried cultural 
properties. Normally, there is very little chance of proposed sites affecting any known significant cultural 
properties, even if just locally important. Therefore, this policy has not been triggered. However suitable 
procedures included in the Environment Management Plan, which will be followed by the entrepreneurs in 
the event that a culturally property is unearthed, are described in D4.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Potential indirect impacts of VSBKs are related to the abandonment and degradation of 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
areas from where soil is excavated for brick making and associated opportunities lost for 
other competing uses like agriculture. This can be particularly significant in areas where 
the rejuvenation of top-soil takes a long time, unlike in alluvial flood-plains of major 
rivers. Other long-term impacts could arise out of almost permanent stay of labour force 
in areas where they formerly stayed only for 6-8 months. These would be mitigated by 
having the required infrastructure facilities provided by the kiln owner(s) themselves.  
 
The inflow of migrant laborers, which is common in the brick making sector could also 
lead to increased risks of HIV/AIDs. Measures would be taken to generate awareness 
about HIV/AIDS and support would be provided to control the incidence of this disease.   
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
 
When compared to the conventional Bull Trench Kilns or Clamps, the VSBK technology 
offers an environmentally superior performance on global as well as local scales. It is 30-
50% more energy-efficient than conventional technology resulting in a corresponding 
reduction of CO
2
,
the major GHG. It also reduces dust pollution by reducing the emission 
of particulate matter by a factor of 3. Further advantages include the better process 
control and reduced risks for workers due to partial mechanization of the process. Unlike 
conventional brick kilns that run for about 150 days, VSBKs can run for more than 220 
days a year resulting in more stable employment for workers. The barrier of higher 
capital costs can be offset partially by the proceeds from the sale of verified GHG 
emission reductions through TARA.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Addressal of Safeguards Issues
:
As part of the project preparation, TARA has prepared 
an Environmental and Social Report that includes measures that will be taken up by the 
individual units to mitigate the residual environmental impacts that are envisaged. A 
specific section dealing with what measures need to be taken and how these are to be 
implemented has been included in the guidance document for entrepreneurs. Particular 
attention has been paid to creating safe and hygienic conditions of work and stay for 
migrant workers. The units participating in the scheme are required to obtain applicable 
regulatory clearances, which is expected to address the issues associated with improper 
siting and location of the units. To improve workers’ safety, the entrepreneurs are 
required to provide adequate personal protective equipment to their employees. The units 
are also required to provide proper sanitation facilities for the workers (as part of the 
Community Benefit Plan discussed later). 
 
In addition to the above mandatory requirements, the ESR also provides a list of other 
good environmental practices that the entrepreneurs need to follow. Training that TARA 
will provide for implementing the VSBK kiln operations will also include modules on 
environmental management of production processes as well as amenities that need to be 
provided for workers.   
 
Page  5
The Environmental and Social Report (ESR) includes a description of the chance-find 
procedures that the individual entrepreneur needs to follow in the event that a culturally 
important property (or remain/relic) is unearthed during the removal of soil for brick 
making. It involves informing the landowner and the stoppage of work until the 
appropriate state authority gives the go-ahead to resume work on that site to avoid 
damage.  
 
While, each entrepreneur is responsible for implementing the environmental measures, 
TARA will monitor the environmental performance of a representative sample 
(approximately 10% of the participating kilns) for on-site verification and report to the 
Bank. In addition, provisions have also been made to undertake environmental audits by 
external agencies (to be engaged by the Bank) at suitable intervals.  
 
On the social front, the project does not involve any land acquisition under eminent 
domain and therefore does not induce involuntary resettlement. The labor working in 
VSBK/brick kilns are largely migrant labor who work with entrepreneurs on piece work 
basis and therefore wage payment is based on the quantum of work performed regardless 
of gender. However, the living conditions of these labourers, particularly in terms of 
housing and sanitation, are poor. The entrepreneurs participating in the project are 
required to provide proper sanitation facilities for the workers. TARA will provide 
suitable training and sensitization programs for the entrepreneurs to encourage them to 
provide improved housing (permanent structures) for their workers, which will improve 
worker productivity and eliminate the need  for the entrepreneurs to reconstruct 
temporary shelters for their workers every brick making season.  TARA will ensure that 
child and bonded labor are not employed for tasks in kiln operations. TARA will 
undertake sensitization programs to increase awareness among the workers of HIV/AIDS 
and will use its influence among the local NGOs to monitor the incidence of HIV/AIDS 
among VSBK workers.   
 
In order to further enhance the social benefits of the project, a Community Benefit Plan 
(CBP) is included in the project, which provides workers and their families with group 
insurance scheme (health and accident), and improved on-site sanitation. Part of the 
earnings realized from the sale of emission reduction generated by the units is earmarked 
for the implementation of the CBP and the EMP.  
 
Assessment of capacity to implement the EMP
:
The DA Group has a strong record of 
providing effective services to small rural enterprises in India. As an integral part of DA, 
TARA can leverage this expertise to ensure that the participating units can implement the 
environmental management measures. TARA will provide training programs that will 
demonstrate to individual units the clear linkages between improved environmental 
management and increased profitability. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders
 are the brick workers, entrepreneurs, local government officials from SPCB, District 
Administration, Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), co
mmercial financing agencies, local 
Page  6
health workers, NGOs, etc., and TARA as project sponsor and key intermediary between all actors. TARA  
has extensive experience working with rural communities, especially in the brick sector.  
 
Mechanisms for disclosure
:
TARA has links with a number of local non-governmental organizations in 
all states in the project and therefore it would be easier to comply with the requirements of disclosure. 
C
opies of the ESR will be accessible to the public in the VSBK plants, offices of the respective District 
administrations, KVIC 
–
a
major financer of VSBKs, and the State Pollution Control Board. Copy of the 
ESR is also made available on TARA’s website. TARA will also print posters for easier communication 
with local groups that are likely to be less literate.
