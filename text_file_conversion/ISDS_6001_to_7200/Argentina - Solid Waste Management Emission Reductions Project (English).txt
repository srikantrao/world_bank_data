B. Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN]:

The objectives of the Salta Solid Waste Management Emission Reductions Project are twofold.
At global level, the project aims to help mitigate climate change through the effective reduction
of 79,664 tC02e caused by the methane (GHG) generated in landfill. At local level, the project
aims to improve solid waste final disposal practices, reducing the risk of uncontrolled fires and
explosions in landfills and contributing to better air quality through a reduction in hazardous
trace gases contained in LFG. Indirect development objectives include raising awareness of
climate change and demonstrating the feasibility of better final solid waste disposal practices
aligned with the CDM and Carbon Finance possibilities in the Southern Cone. The main
beneficiaries will be the formal and informal workers at the landfill and the population living in
the surrounding communities.


C. Project Description [from section 4 of PCN]:

The Salta Solid Waste Management Emission Reductions Project consists of the design,
construction and operation of a LFG extraction and flaring facility at Salta's San Javier I1 and I11
landfills. This facility will allow the capture and destruction of methane generated through the
anaerobic decomposition of organic matter disposed of in the landfills. GHG emission reductions
will be generated and sold to the Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF).

Salta is a 600.000-inhabitant town located at the center of Salta province, Argentina. At present,
Salta counts on an operating controlled landfill (the first cell was opened in October 1999) that
receives about 550 tons per day of municipal solid waste (MSW). The Landfill site, San Javier,
covers 33.5 hectares property of the municipality, it is located 14 km southeast if the City of
Salta,. The total lifespan of the site was estimated in 30 years if the solid waste generations rates
keep their historical levels

The site has three cells to dispose the waste.
                                       Surface (Ha)                         Name                          Status

                  Cell 2                       14.5                    San Javier I1                To be closed

According to preliminary estimates, the proposed project is expected to abate 42,969 metric tons
of COze by 2012 and additional 36,695 metric tons of CO2e by 2015. These quantities would
total 79,664 tC02e of ERs for the period 2008-2015. The World Bank's Carbon Finance Unit
intends to buy 75 percent of the estimated ERs by 2015 in a deal involving certified emission
reductions (CERs) and verified emission reductions (VERS).'


D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known):

The Landfill site, Sun Javier, covers 33.5 hectares property of the municipality, it is located 14
km southeast if the City of Salta, Capital of Salta Region. The total lifespan of the site was
estimated in 30 years if the solid waste generations rates keep their historical levels (450-500
ton/day)


The site has three cells to dispose the waste.
                                       Surface (Ha)                         Name                          Status
                  Cell 1                        10                      San Javier I                      Closed
                  Cell 2                       14.5                    San Javier I1                 To be closed
                  Cell 3                        9                     San Javier 111            To be opened 2007



'Thc Carbon Financc Unit (CFU) expects that all ERs generated up to 2012 will be eligible for certification under the CDM framework and thus
will bc CERs. Thcrc is no guarantee as of the time of project appraisal that the CDM framework will still hold after 2012, and thus there may be
no CERs from 2013 onward. Thc CFU can purchase a limited amount of ERs generated post-2012 (up to 30 percent of the contract) as verified
cmissions rcductions (VERs), which are not subject to registration under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The first cell, San Javier I, was operated during 1994 to 1999, where the disposal was not
adequate. The second cell, San Javier 11,was opened in 1999 and it is under its closure. And the
third cell, San Javier 111, is under excavation to start operations later this year, 2007.

An environmental audit report concluded that the landfill management requires improvement. In
particular the recommendations address to the following landfill improvements:
    -  Improving leachate management and isolate waste from contact with water bodies to
        avoid surface water and groundwater contamination.
    -  The construction of LFG plant to avoid the gas emission and reducing the GHG effect
        and the odors.
    -   Improving the surrounding barrier with a live barrier to reduce the visual impact, the odor
        and other particle spreading.
    -   Create a closure plan for San Javier I1 that includes an environmental monitoring plan.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies:

The project is expected to have no negative environmental effects. Combustion of the methane
will be monitored and an international 'best-practice' flare system installed. As part of the
Environmental Audit carried out, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) was designed by
the operator of the landfill; the municipality has agreed to include that cost in the monthly
contract. This CDM project will help offset part of the recurring costs of operating the landfill
properly following international waste management standards.

As a Community Development Carbon Fund (CDCF) project, this project will incorporate a
Community Benefits Plan, currently being developed by the municipality of Salta.                  The
development and implementation of this plan it; expected to be financed from the CDCF, which
provides a premium over and above the market price for ERs in order to fund such projects. The
community benefits will build a waste separationlrecycling facility close to the landfill, hence
improving the working conditions of the waste-pickers. A grant program run locally by UNDP
will provide additional fbnds to the municipali.tyto ensure sustainability of the recycling plant
through training and awareness activities.
