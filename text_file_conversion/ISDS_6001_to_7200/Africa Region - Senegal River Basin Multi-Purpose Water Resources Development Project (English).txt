2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the MWRD program which comprises 2 phases, MWRD 1 
and 2 is to enhance regional integration among the riparian countries of the Senegal River 
Basin through OMVS (Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal) for 
multipurpose water resources development to foster growth including improved 
community livelihoods.  
 
.
This objective will be achieved through (i) consolidating and modernizing the 
institutional, legal and technical framework of the Senegal River Basin to better serve the 
four riparian countries, (ii) developing concrete water resources development activities at 
Page  2
the local level that generate significant income to reduce poverty, and (iii) defining and 
preparing new multipurpose infrastructure to harness the hydropower potential identified 
in the basin. In total, 2 million people are targeted in the first phase to benefit from this 
project. The project will focus on selected priority areas within the four riparian 
countries: the regions of Mamou and Labe (Guinea), the Circles of Bafoulabe and Kayes 
(Mali), the departements of Dagana and Matam (Senegal) and the Wilayas of Gorgol and 
Brakna (Mauritania).   
 
3. Project Description 
Lending instrument and rationale. The proposed Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will 
span 10 years and be implemented in 2 phases (MWRD 1 & 2), of 5 years each.  The 
rationale for using the APL instrument is to ensure long-term commitment and 
sustainability in scaling up multipurpose water resources development activities in the 
Senegal River Basin. Adaptable program loans (APLs) provide phased support for long-
term development programs.  They involve a series of loans that build on the lessons 
learned from the previous loan(s) in the series.  APLs are used when sustained changes in 
institutions, organizations, or behavior are key to successfully implementing a program.  
The key advantages for clients are i) Less front-loading of policy conditionality. Realistic 
phasing of reforms; ii) it encourages long-term planning and sustainable institution 
building; and bridges administrations; and iii) Lower commitment fees.  
 
The phased approach facilitates the prioritization of investments in alignment with 
appropriate funding.  The APL instrument will also allow OMVS and the riparian 
countries of the Senegal River Basin to minimize the transaction costs and to consolidate 
the benefits deriving from jointly-owned and managed infrastructure. The scope, 
magnitude and timing of the second phase will depend on successes achieved during 
implementation of the first phase and on the prioritized investments identified by the 
riparian countries in Senegal River Basin Master plan, also to be financed under the 
MWRD1.  However, OMVS and member countries will know in advance that Bank 
support for the second phase will be forthcoming, provided the triggers from the first 
phase are met.  
 
It is proposed that IDA credit support be provided using the APL instrument, 
horizontally on a regional basis to support OMVS and its regional infrastructure program 
and vertically to supplement development water resources activities at the national level. 
In addition, through the use of the APL instrument, the commitment of substantial IDA 
resources is visible and complementarity with activities supported by donors can be more 
readily achieved.  
 
Program objective and Phases  
 
Overview of program design. The overall amount proposed for MWRD 1 & 2 is 
US$341 million, of which the estimated budget for MWRD 1 is US$141 million. This 
includes an IDA credit of US$31 million to each of Senegal, Mali, and Mauritania, an 
IDA grant of US$18 million to Guinea, and a proposed US$30 million from national 
counterpart funds, donor co-financing, and parallel financing. Individual sector 
Page  3
investment activities were considered as an alternative approach, in parallel with donor 
activities, however this does not advance regional integration. The regional integration 
process establishes the parameters for sustainable multi-purpose development and multi-
sectoral investments, and is realized only by strengthened institutions and engaged and 
informed stakeholders.  The program will support the Nouakchott Declaration for the 
development of the Senegal River Basin by focusing on five key targeted activities: (i) 
modernizing the river basin institutions within the context of the Inclusive Framework; 
(ii) regional water resources planning, management, and development; (iii) expanding 
regional multi-purpose water resources infrastructure; (iv) mitigating the health impacts 
from related multi-purpose water infrastructure; and (v) fostering economic growth 
through related water sector development while improving social and environmental 
conditions in the Basin.  
 
Increasing poverty in the Basin, especially in Guinea and the Fouta Djallon region, leads 
to degradation of the Senegal watershed with serious negative socio-economic and 
environmental impacts downstream. Such impacts include reduced flows, greater flood 
and drought susceptibility, high sedimentation loads and consequent detrimental effects 
on energy, agriculture, fisheries, wetland ecosystems, and navigation.  In addition, within 
the Basin the rural population has not yet benefited from OMVS’ regional infrastructure 
despite the regular water availability from artificial flows. Instead, rural poor have been 
left out of water resources development to date. Long term sustainability of the Basin and 
the people largely depends on finding solutions to these problems.  
 
Overall the program is designed to support OMVS in developing an integrated water 
resources management program with short, medium, and long-term impacts.  MWRD 1 
has three main components.  Component 1 is comprised of institutional strengthening. 
Component 2 includes a set of integrated activities to address those issues outlined above, 
including a health sub-component.  The malaria control ‘boost’ within Component 2 will 
focus on four primary strategic areas: (i) use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets 
by at least 60 percent of the River Basin population by the end of project implementation; 
(ii) improvement of capacity to treat severe malaria at district and regional hospitals, 
particularly in cross-border areas; (iii) adoption of a sub-regional effective malaria 
treatment policy in the Senegal River Basin and availability of increased prompt and 
effective treatment along the Basin; and (iv) sub-regional coordination, surveillance, 
epidemic prevention, and monitoring to control malaria. Component 3 addresses planning 
and upstream pre-investment support for water infrastructure.  
 
Based on consultations with OMVS, member countries, and national parastatal 
agencies, clear triggers were agreed for the second phase of the program:  
 
a) The policy trigger is the commitment of Guinea to continue cooperating 
withinOMVS as the fourth member country;  
 
b)
The technical triggers that constitute the minimum threshold for approval of MWRD 
2
include the following: (i) satisfactory integration of Guinea into OMVS’institutional, 
legal, and financial structures; (ii) satisfactory installation and operation of at least two 
intakes; (iii) at least 7 percent of targeted Basin communities applying improved agro-
forestry practices; (iv) 10 percent of farmers in targeted areas are using irrigation 
Page  4
facilities to improve agricultural yield; and (v) clear consensus among riparian countries 
to build one dam from the pre-selected list of options.  
 
MWRD 2 components will depend largely on the implementation results of MWRD 1, 
including the involvement of Guinea. This will include selection of the second round of 
local level multi-purpose water resources development activities to be scaled up and the 
development of water resources infrastructure. Since the economies of the four riparian 
countries are highly vulnerable to water variability and energy shortages, additional 
multi-purpose infrastructure will be needed. Preliminary technical studies and 
consultations among the four riparian countries have already led to the pre-selection of 
four dam sites (identified in Component 3c below).  With the technical studies to be 
carried out in MWRD 1, dam development will be prioritized, with the expectation that 
their development will be undertaken in MWRD 2. Suitable performance indicators will 
be introduced and the relevant institutional and other necessary adjustments made for the 
transition from MWRD 1 to MWRD 2.  
 
Project development objective and key indicators  
 
The development objective of the MWRD program is to enhance regional integration 
among the riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin through OMVS for multi-
purpose water resources development to foster growth including improved community 
livelihoods.  
 
This objective will be achieved through: (i) consolidating and modernizing the 
institutional, legal, and technical framework of the Senegal River Basin to better serve 
the four riparian countries; (ii) developing concrete water resources development 
activities at the local level that generate significant income to help reduce poverty; and 
(iii) defining and preparing new multi-purpose infrastructure to harness the hydropower 
potential identified in the Basin. The project will focus on selected priority areas within 
the four riparian countries located in the upper basin, the middle valley and the delta.  In 
total, two million people are targeted to benefit from Phase 1 of the project.  
 
Key progress and expected outcomes. The result indicators envisioned for the project 
include:  
 
a) 
OMVS legal, institutional, and financial mechanisms updated and fully 
operational for effective execution of its mandate;  
 
b)
Sustainable multi-purpose water resources activities implemented to effect 
income generation and poverty reduction at local levels; and  
 
c) 
Regional planning and management framework developed for economically, 
environmentally, and socially responsible multi-purpose water resources development.  
 
Project components (MWRD APL1)  
 
MWRD 1 does not directly engage in hydropower investments but will provide the 
framework for future engagement in such development. It includes three main 
components as outlined below:  
Page  5
Component 1: Regional Institutional Development for Water Resources (US$8.1 
million) .  The first component will support actions at the regional level in order to 
consolidate and strengthen policies, plans and actions relating to integrated water 
resources development. Implementing the Inclusive Framework will require the 
strengthening of institutional knowledge and technical capacity but also strengthening of 
the legal, institutional and financial frameworks. Component activities will:  
 
a. 
Modernize OMVS and Enhance Institutional Capacities. This component will 
support institutional reform of OMVS and enhance the management and technical 
capacities as well as the systems of monitoring and evaluation.  The institutional 
coordination, communication, information exchange, and stakeholder participation 
among relevant institutions  will also be improved thereby reinforcing the OMVS 
network and information management. This will involve:  
 
i
Review and expansion of responsibilities with supporting capacity enhancement 
for the Societe de Gestion de Diama (SOGED) and Societe de Gestion de l’Energiede 
Manantali (SOGEM);  
 
ii 
Modernizing OMVS headquarters, including revamping the institution, the 
definition of human resources management and performance monitoring and evaluation 
tools, improving access to, and the flow of, information with more accountability and 
transparency at all levels;  
 
iii 
Modernizing OMVS’ National Cellules, including coordination and collaboration 
with OMVS headquarters;  
 
iv 
Modernizing the Permanent Water Commission to include modalities to prevent 
overexploitation of the water resource and to handle competing water users and conflict 
resolution;  
 
v
OMVS strategic coordination and collaboration among national water and 
agricultural technical bodies, including Societe d’Amenagement et d’Exploitation des 
Terres du Delta (SAED), Societe Nationale de Developpement Rural (SONADER), 
Programme de Developpement de l’Irrigation en Aval de Manantali  (PDIAM), and 
Direction Nationale du Genie Rural (DNGR), developing an exchange of experiences, 
best practices, and management tools for water resources;  
 
vi
Implementing the principles of the Water Charter for integrating environmental 
and social issues into water resources development in the Basin;  
 
vii 
Strengthening local-level organizations (such as women’s farmer cooperatives).  
 
b.
Enable Guinea’s inclusion in OMVS. The continuation of the Inclusive 
Framework dialogue requires the update and adaptation of OMVS institutions and legal 
arrangements to include Guinea as the fourth riparian country. This will include: (i) an 
update of the institutional and legal framework within the OMVS High Commission; (ii) 
preparing the additional legal instruments necessary to effectively implement the 
inclusive framework in line with the Water Charter principles; and (iii) defining a new 
cost-sharing formula to accommodate Guinea as a new member of OMVS.  
 
c. 
Rehabilitate the OMVS Documentation Center. Securing the institutional history 
and expanding the information and knowledge network of OMVS requires the 
Page  6
rehabilitation of the Senegal River Basin Document Center in Saint-Louis. Activities 
will:  
 
i
Rehabilitate, upgrade, and secure the building facilities;  
 
ii 
Acquire equipment for archiving and library establishment;  
 
iii 
Train and develop management capacity of center staff;  
 
iv 
Develop internet functionality with web access to relevant information; and  
 
v
Support or establish specific conventions with other institutions such as the 
Institut fondamental d'Afrique noire (IFAN), the Ecole de BibliothÃ©caires, Archivistes 
et Documentalistes (EBAD), and relevant universities for more effective management 
and dissemination of Basin information.  
 
Component 2:  Local Level Multi-Purpose Water Resources Development (US$96.4 
million). To promote income-generation activities at the grassroots level and ensure that 
benefits spillover across the Basin, this component includes a number of critical water 
resources development activities in selected sub-basin areas. This approach also helps to 
ensure full ownership and commitment of the riparian population to secure the existing 
investments and those to be planned in the future. The planned activities will be 
undertaken in targeted areas suitable to realizing results quickly on the ground. They are 
framed in a manner to ensure appropriate responsibility assignments to- and 
accountability of- the relevant technical bodies with stakeholders’ participation and 
involvement in decision-making.  
 
Three main criteria -- technical, social and political -- were used by OMVS and the 
riparian countries to identify the selected areas.  The technical criteria related to the in-
country infrastructure needs as well as the suitability of locations for development. The 
social criteria mostly related to the degree of poverty and incidence of vulnerable groups 
throughout the Basin. The political criteria are linked to countries’ aim to re-balance 
development activities across theBasin. The areas and related activities were selected in a 
participatory process to form the first set of interventions in the Basin. The scaling up of 
these interventions will be considered within the Master Plan in Component 3. The 
priority areas for actions include: the upper basin in Guinea (regions of Mamou and 
LabÃ©); the upper basin in Mali (Circles of BafoulabÃ© and Kayes); the middle 
valleyin Senegal (the departments of Matam and Dagana) and the middle valley and delta 
in Mauritania (Wilayas of Gorgol and Trarza). The local level activities are the following:  
 
a. 
Development of small hydraulic infrastructure and related activities. This 
subcomponent will facilitate the development of recessional agriculture, and expansion 
and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage schemes in suitable areas.  Key activities 
will: (i) design and develop infrastructure to improve access to and delivery of water for 
irrigation (intakes, pumping stations, waterways, etc.); (ii) provide training for 
appropriate irrigation methods and related crop diversification and enhancement 
processes to enable farmers to make adequate choices for sustainable agricultural 
practices; and (iii) identify suitable options for agricultural products, processing, and 
marketing.  
 
b.
Improvement of traditional fisheries. This sub-component will contribute to the 
development of traditional fisheries.  Key activities will: (i) promote more effective 
Page  7
fishing practices and fish production processing; (ii) provide technical modernization to 
enhance fishermen’s livelihoods (training and equipment such as nets, boats, processing, 
and storage); and (iii) support institutional strengthening for sustainable development of 
the fisheries’ activities.  
 
c. 
Water Resources Protection. This sub-component will support planning and 
management of land and water resources at the community and sub-basin levels to ensure 
sustainable development of the resource and provide community stakeholders with tools 
and mechanisms for appropriate development. Key activities will: (i) map key areas and 
develop plans for local income-generation activities based on suitable land and water 
conditions; (ii) introduce programs to restore and maintain river banks; (iii) develop 
lowland areas ‘Bas-fonds’ for appropriate income-generation activities; and (iv) provide 
support (develop a reforestation map and program, training, etc.) for agro-forestry 
development.  
 
d.
Reduction of waterborne diseases. The sub-component will support reductions of 
malaria and schistosomiasis at the community level.  It takes a strict interpretation of 
regional activities, and limits activities to only those with clear regional rationale, leaving 
country-specific private-good activities to country-specific programs.   Contracting out to 
Implementing Partners will play a critical role in the smooth and effective 
implementation of this sub-component.   Key activities will include: (i) mass distribution 
of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets and other vector control measures as 
appropriate (e.g. indoor-spraying, larviciding); (ii) health impact and mitigation measures 
relating to water-resource development activities (e.g. flushing of irrigation and drainage 
canals); (iii) mass treatment with Praziquantel and Albendazole for schistosomiasis; (iv) 
disease surveillance and operations research on joint malaria-schistosomiasis control 
activities.  
 
Component 3: Regional Multipurpose and Multi-sectoral Master Planning (US$5.5 
million) .  
 
The Comprehensive Senegal River Basin Master Plan (SDAGE Schema 
d’Amenagement et de Gestion des Eaux du fleuve Senegal) will take into consideration 
all relevant sectors for optimal and sustainable planning, use, and management of the 
Basin’s water resources, and make available the appropriate information necessary for 
sound decision-making. The SDAGE will also complement the on-going efforts initiated 
under the WAPP.  The component activities will:  
 
a. 
Prepare the SRB Comprehensive Master Plan. Within the broad framework of the 
SDAGE, the sub-component activities will: (i) evaluate and prepare several assessment 
studies, which take into account technical, policy, economic, environmental, and social 
concerns (including health), over the range of potential multi-purpose and multi-sectoral 
investments in the Basin ; and (ii) prepare the SRB Regional Master Plan and sub-basin 
development plans that would further guide OMVS and member countries in 
implementing decentralized water resources management.  
 
b.
Support pre-investment for the OMVS Gouina Hydroelectric Project (HEP): This 
sub-component will support OMVS to accelerate pre-investment activities for early 
development and deployment of the Gouina HEP to help alleviate the widening power 
supply deficits that have resulted in chronic load shedding in OMVS member states. Key 
activities include: (i) preparation and public disclosure of the Environmental 
Page  8
Management Plan and Resettlement Action Plan associated with the implementation of 
the Gouina HEP, including facilities to interconnect with the existing 225 kV OMVS 
power transmission system; and (ii) preparation of comprehensive bidding documents for 
use in a competitive process to select a contractor to implement the Gouina HEP  under a 
date-certain, fixed price, performance-based contract to Design, Build, Operate, and 
Transfer (DBOT) the Gouina HEP to the OMVS asset holding agency.  
 
c. 
Support pre-investment for OMVS Multi-purpose Dams (Balassa, Boureya, 
Gourbassi and Koukoutamba): This component will: (i) support the OMVS to prepare 
comprehensive feasibility studies (and update previous studies if necessary) for the 
prospective multi-purpose dams to be located in the Senegal River Basin at Gourbassi (on 
the Faleme River in Mali), Balassa, Boureya, and Koukoutamba, all of which are located 
in Guinea upstream of the Manantali Dam and have been collectively prioritized by the 
riparian states;  and (ii) prepare an Options Assessment and a Strategic Regional 
Environmental Assessment for future deployment of these facilities in the Basin. The 
relevant assessments to determine the nature and scope of environmental and social 
safeguards to be addressed for each prospective site will also be performed under this 
sub-component.  
 
d.
Ensure stakeholder participation in Multi-purpose and Master Planning.  This will 
be done to facilitate and ensure consensus building and to publicize support for the 
hydropower projects prior to actual development and commencement of works.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
No dams will be financed under MWRD 1 only the preparatory work for the planning of 
new hydropower facilities will be carried out under phase 1. No irreversible 
environmental impacts are expected of any of the investments made in MWRD 1.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There is a potential that new small water infrastructure could upset the balance of power 
in some of the villages involved in this new small water infrastructure through land-
grabbing by the more powerful elites in the villages when water will become available on 
a
more sustained basis. This will be thoroughly discussed with the beneficiaries and 
closely monitored.  
 
The project will finance reforestation activities in the Fouta Djallon to protect the 
watershed, which is one of the most critical watersheds in West Africa and from which 
most of the large rivers in West Africa originate. Forest management plans will be 
prepared during implementation, since the areas of intervention are not yet known. 
Because of this activity the Forests Safeguard Policy has been triggered.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
There are no project alternatives with the exception of the no project alternative.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has prepared a Strategic Regional Environmental and Social Framework 
for the small, community based, water infrastructure in the four riparian countries. The 
borrower has also provided the Bank with Dam Safety reports for the Manantali and 
Diama Dams. A dam safety report for the Foum Gleita Dam in Mauritania has been 
Page  10
obtained recently under the Bank financed PDIAIM project. The borrower has prepared a 
satisfactory Pest Management Plan and a Resettlement Policy Framework.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakeholders are the farmers, fishers and herders in the Senegal River Basin and their 
local governments. Key stakeholders are also the OMVS and its national cells, as well the 
national government agencies of the four riparian countries involved in the Senegal River 
Basin.
