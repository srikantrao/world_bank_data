 2. Project Objectives:

 The proposed GPOBA program will increase coverage and facilitate access for low- to middle-
  income households that currently have no access to piped water. Specifically the project would
  subsidize the cost of new connections for domestic customers in five (5)cities (Maputo, Pemba,
  Nampula, Quelimane, and Beira) to piped distribution networks that already exist or are being
  financed by others (e.g. AfDB, Water Aid, World Bank NWDP I1 and WASISP).

  3. Project Description:

 Program for Maputo: The proposed GPOBA program would subsidize the cost of new
 connections for domestic customers in Maputo. This will facilitate access for low- to middle-
 income households that currently have no access to piped water. It is proposed that a per
 connection subsidy be adopted equal to the connection cost paid by the household to the
 Operator [(Agus de Mocambique (AdM)]. This approach will avoid any change in the present
 lease agreement or any additional direct benefit to AdM (the operator), other than the increased
 revenue base from the provision of additional services to new costumers. By enlarging the

installed base (number of connections) AdM can increase their revenue base. The revenues of
AdM are related to the consumptions of water (m3) by households.

Program for Beira, Pemba, Quelimane, and Nampula: The present management contract for
these four cities will expire in July 2007. Fundo de Investimento e Patrimonio do Abastecimento
de Agua (FIPAG) would like to procure a new set of contracts by the second half of 2007.
Under the new set of contracts, probably following the lease model, the private operator will be
responsible for the entire operation of the water infrastructure. FIPAG will continue to be the
asset holder responsible for financing the necessary civil work to rehabilitate and expand the
systems, and Water Supply Regulatory CounciVConselho de Rugulacao de Abstecimento de
Agua (CRA) will continue to perform the tariff and service regulation independently. It is
proposed that a per connection subsidy be adopted equal to the total cost of the connection paid
by the household to obtain each new connection.

This is an EA Category C project since it involves installing only simple yard taps fed from
water distribution pipes in the roadway adjacent to the households. Thus, it is likely to have no
or minimal adverse environmental impacts. Similarly, land acquisition will not be required.

 FIPAG's normal contracting arrangements will ensure that operators, as needed, restore
 household property (e.g. fences, walls, walkways, yards) to at least their pre-existing condition.
