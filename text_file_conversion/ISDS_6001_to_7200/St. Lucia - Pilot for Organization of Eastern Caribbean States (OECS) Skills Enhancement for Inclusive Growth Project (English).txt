B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project would be the first phase of a multi-phased APL, customized to the needs of a small 
country and flexible enough to allow for horizontal expansion to other small countries in the 
OECS.  In sum, the  
 
objective of the first phase of the APL is to assist the Government of St. Lucia to increase the 
employability of youth.  This objective will be pursued through the establishment of a 
competitive training fund that finances demand-driven training and traineeships.  The two key 
indicators are:  
 
?
Outcome: % of unemployed trained youth who are employed six months after the 
traineeship.  
 
?
Immediate outcome: Number of trainees that successfully complete the training program 
and traineeship.  
 
Ultimately, it is expected that improved employability of St. Lucian youth will contribute both 
to reduced vulnerability among youth as well as to improved competitiveness of the St. Lucian 
economy.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would consist of two components. The first would support the design and piloting of 
a
training fund for financing pre-service training on a competitive basis. The second would 
support evaluation of the training fund, as well as institutional strengthening and action-planning 
related to complementary programs and policies, designed to enhance the sustainability of the 
impacts of the first component and to lay the groundwork for subsequent phases of the APL.
