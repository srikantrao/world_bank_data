B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The primary objective of the project is to assist the Government of Uganda to increase thermal 
power generation in order to minimize increased load shedding and economic disruption over the 
short to medium term (2006-10) in a sustainable and affordable manner.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
A
key aspect of the project would be to develop a financial plan that balances hydropower and 
thermal output with a mix of tariff adjustments, budgetary and other financial support.  The exact 
combination of Bank support for generation investment would be determined on the basis of a 
co-financing partnership and donor financing preferences.  
 
The following components  are considered for Bank participation under this Project:  
 
A. 
Financial support for the Existing Aggreko Leased Thermal Plant  
 
B. 
Financial support for the proposed 50MW extension of the Aggreko Leased Thermal 
Plant.  
 
C. 
Financial support for an additional 50MW of Leased Thermal Generation Plant.  
Page  2
D. 
Financing of Electricity Imports from Kenya, and/or co-generation output.  
 
E. 
Financial support for purchasing 50MW of permanent Thermal Generation Plant running 
on HFO.  
 
F. 
Demand Side Management and Energy Efficiency measures (US$10 million).  
 
Bank financing of components A,B and C would be achieved mainly through the financing of 
fixed capacity payments, with the remainder of funds to be allocated for energy (fuel) and/or 
kilowatt hour payments.  Bank financing of kilowatt hours could be envisaged for D above, and 
for financing the capital costs of the permanent plant in component E. This approach would 
permit the maximum flexibility for other donors to contribute to the project (as noted above, this 
is subject to completion of a review of the procurement process and existing/proposed contracts, 
for which some additional documentation is required).
