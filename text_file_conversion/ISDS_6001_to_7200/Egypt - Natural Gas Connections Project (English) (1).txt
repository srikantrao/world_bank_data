B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
The project development objective is to assist the Government in reducing the subsidies in the
energy sector by switching consumption ofLPG for natural gas through investment in new
connections and development of an improved sector policy framework. Besides the macro and
micro benefits expected, increased consumption of natural gas relative to LPG also creates
important social, environmental and health benefits.

C. Project Description [from section 3.of PCN]
The proposed project would finance about 1.1 million household connections in the Greater
Cairo area which covers the three governorates of Cairo, Giza and Qalyubia. The rationale for
selecting the proposed geographical location is that Greater Cairo is where most ofthe 4 million
targeted connections can be made, allowing for the most efficient way to achieve LPG
consumption reductions. Furthermore, the Greater Cairo area offers several un-connected
districts where extension ofthe existing network exists, and where there is high population
density; two prerequisites for the economic viability of distribution projects. The Greater Cairo
area also offers districts with good land use management, including the new extensions ofthe
city and where road access exists. Given the concession arrangements in place, several LDCs

with concessions in the Greater Cairo area would be likely to implement the project (including
TownGas and NatGas).

 The connections will be made through investment components including medium and low
pressure pipes,' regulators, meters, internal installations and conversion of appliances. The
project will include laying around 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers of gas distribution pipeline. There
will also be some investment towards pressure reduction stations. A feasibility study is under
preparation, which will present in detail the investment components, their cost and their technical
and economic feasibility. This study is expected to be ready in June 2005. The preliminary
project costs have been estimated at US$500 million, of which the Bank would finance US$200
million, reflecting EGAS's share. A Technical Assistance component addressing the sector
policy framework would possibly increase the Bank loan amount.

D. Project location (if known)
The project covers districts in the greater Cairo area, and it is likely to provide gas to around 1.1
million households. There are certain requirements to provide gas connection pipeline in a
district, such as availability of other utilities (water, sewerage, and electricity), minimum width
ofroads, etc. The project is unlikely to target areas where right of way, informal land use
arrangements, and difficult road access may be an issue, such as Old Cairo, Shoubrah el Kheima,
Sayeda Zeinab, etc.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
Egyptian environment regulations are comprehensive and efforts are underway to harmonize
Bank and GoE regulations. As such, enviromental assessments and screening are routinely
carried out for the sector. To our knowledge, MoP/EGAS has a good track record in paying due
attention to safety measures in the development of the gas sector, this will be further reviewed
during project preparation.
