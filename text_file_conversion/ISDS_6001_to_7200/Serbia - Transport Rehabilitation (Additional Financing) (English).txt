follows: (a) rehabilitation of Prokuplje - Mala Plana(M-25, 8.3 km; (b) rehabilitation of
road M3 between Odzaci and Kula along 23.5 km; (c) rehabilitation of Medjuluzje -
Krcevac (M23, 10.4 km) and Krcevac - Topola (M4, 2.64 km); (d) rehabilitation of
Marcovica (West of Cacak) - Ovcar Banja (M5, 11 km); (e) rehabilitation of Kac (East of
Novi Sad) - Za Zabalj (M7, 13.3 km); (f) rehabilitation of Kruzni Put - Grocka ?
Smederevo (Regional road R100, along the Danube in the East of Belgrade, 31.9 km);
and (g) rehabilitation of Valjevo - Pricevici (M-4, 12.4 km).

 Component 3. Road Rehabilitation Supervision [ Estimated total cost - US$3.01 million,
of which IBRD Loan US$2.47 million and Borrower financing US$0.54 million]: The
project will finance consulting services for supervision of road maintenance and
rehabilitation works and environmental monitoring.



 Component 4. Road Safety Improvement [ Estimated total cost - US$2.1 million, of
which IBRD Loan US$1.82 million and Borrower financing US$0.28 million]: The
project will support road safety improvement activities, including elimination of
dangerous (black) spots on the main road network and road safety audits of the
rehabilitated sections and in the pilot districts.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Country-wide. All works for the proposed sections for rehabilitation will be done within
existing right-of-way.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
All works for the proposed sections for rehabilitation will be done within existing right-
of-way (ROW). There will be no road widening outside the existing ROW, no changes
of curvature etc. The sections do not appear to come close to or encroach on any areas of
cultural significance, or protected areas. The proposed extension of the project is not
likely to present any unusual or difficult environmental safeguard issues, and
environmental management for this extension is entirely within the capacity of the RSR
organizational structure. The ongoing project was categorized as 'B', which requires
implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The proposed project is
also expected to be category 'B', and the EMP, whilst entirely adequate for the additional
financing, is being revised to reflect any changes in the policy and legal framework,
organizational changes in the Road Directorate and revised baseline conditions, and
project schedule for the new sections for rehabilitation. The mitigation plan and
monitoring plan will be similar to the current EMP. This is considered adequate for the
additional financing.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No direct or indirect negative impacts are anticipated that would result from project
activities.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
No adverse impacts are expected

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
In accordance with the requirements of the EMP of the ongoing project, an
Environmental Unit was created in RSR in 2003. It consists of two professional staff: a
civil engineer and a geographer. In addition, IZP was hired as the monitoring contractor

                                                                                         43859


in 2004, again in accordance with the requirements of the EMP. With support from the
Swedish Government and a twinning arrangement with the Swedish Road Directorate,
RSR performed all the training and study tours as indicated in the EMP. It also included
seminars to RSR by Swedish experts in environmental management.

 18.    The contractor is obligated to document the 'company approach'for environment
and worker health and safety before they start any works. The supervision consultant
provides monthly reports to RSR. The RSR Environmental Unit in turn provides frequent
environmental reports for inclusion into quarterly progress reports. Copies of three
environmental monitoring reports prepared by the Environmental Unit were reviewed and
found to be of very good quality, indicating that they have taken an active role in
