B. Project Ob~jectives[from section 2 of PCN]
The project objiective is to increase production and market access of rural families living in
Chambo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins, through investments in irrigation, roads
improvement and conservation of water resources. The major outcome indicators are: increased
value of production and increased sales (as value of marketed production). By the end of the
project, around120,000 rural families would have increased their value of production by 30% and
their sales by 2.0%.

The investments are given within the context of the Provincial Development Plan Minga for
Life, which also includes a GEF funded project (US4 4.0 million in GEF grant) aimed at
improving the management and conservation of natural resources.

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]

 The project components are: (I) production supportinvestments: and (2) Project Management.
 Componentone essentially involves: a competitive fund for improvement of irrigation systems;
 and improvemerlt of two strategicroads for production areas in both river-basins.

 D. Project location (if known)
 The Chambo and Chanchan-Chimboriver basins within the territory of the Chimborazo
 Province.

 E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
 The proposed project will be the Borrower's first loan with the Bank (first Bank funded
 subnationalloan in Ecuador). The Provincial Government of Chimborazo has assigned staff
 working on environmentaland social issues. Safeguard management capacity will be assessed
 during preparation of proposed new project, and if needed, an action plan to strengthenand to
 ensure adequate capacity will be prepared and agreed upon with the client before appraisal.

  The roads and irrigation improvementworks will allow an increase in production and market
  access of rural families living in Charnbo and Chanchan-Chimbo river basins. Given the scale of
  intervention,it is not expected that increased agriculturalproductionwould entail a substantial
  increase in the use of pesticides. The recommendations of the EA will prevent additional impacts
  due to the potential increase in the use of pesticides by incorporating a Integrated Pest

      It is expected that the project triggers OP4.10. Given the large number of indigenous
I population   in the province, it is likely that a separate IPP will not be needed. A social assessment                               I
