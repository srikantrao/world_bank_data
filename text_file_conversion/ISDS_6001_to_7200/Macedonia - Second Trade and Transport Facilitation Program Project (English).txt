4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The proposed upgrading of the road corridor between Tabanovce and Kumanovo and the
proposed modernization of the passenger border crossing at the Blace border are the only
two components which have potential environmental and social impacts. These impacts
are not likely to be significant because the proposed interventions will be limited to
modernization or upgrading of existing infrastructure. The project is not located in an
environmentally sensitive area and only small portions of agricultural land will be
acquired for expanding the existing road corridor. The only key impact would be the need
to relocate a portion of a graveyard in the Tabanovce village.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Potential environmental and social issues/impacts are related to expansion of the existing
road between Tabanovce and Kumanovo (upgrading to motorway standards) and
modernization of the passenger border crossing at the Blace border with Kosovo.
Potential environmental impacts are mostly construction related, reversible in nature and
can easily be minimized or mitigated by applying relevant design and construction
standards. Accordingly, the proposed project is categorized as a B project and the
borrower has prepared a stand alone EA/EMP in accordance with Bank OP 4.01
Environmental Assessment.

 A small portion of a graveyard currently used by Tabanovce village will be affected by
the proposed expansion of the existing road corridor and as a result, seventeen graves
need to be relocated to a nearby site identified by the local community. Therefore, the
proposed project will assist the local communities in purchasing a new piece of land,

close to the existing graveyard, and in actual relocation process, in accordance with
OP/BP 4.11 Physical Cutural Resources.

 Potential social safeguards related impacts are primarily due to the proposed land
acquisition for expanding the Tabanovce and Kumanovo section. A total of 102
households are expected to lose part of their land holdings and the borrower has prepared
an abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan in accordance with Bank OP 4.12 Involuntary
Resettlement.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No significant adverse long term or indirect impacts are anticipated.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The proposed project involves modernization of existing border crossing infrastructure as
well as expansion of an existing road corridor. As a result, there are not many alternatives
to consider, except for a no-project alternative. The chosen option would result in
environmental (reduced emissions due to smooth flow of traffic and less idling and
reduced waiting time at the border crossing etc.) and social (increased safety etc.)
benefits compared to a business as usual situation.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Borrower has prepared draft EA, including a plan for relocation of seventeen graves, and
draft abbreviated RAP which has been disclosed locally as well as in Bank Infoshops in
Washington DC and Skopje, Macedonia.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
There are 294 parcels of land affected by the Project, owned by 102 households, some of
which own more than one of the affected parcels. No residences are adversely affected;
so there will be no physical displacement of persons. There are no buildings that will
need to be demolished --- there is one gas station that sits along the side of the current
road, but the building will not be affected by the Project. A census of persons affected is
available in the Project files.

 The Fund for National and Regional Roads held several meetings with the local
population in the period between January and February 2007. Around 80 representatives
from the local communities -- persons whose properties will be expropriated for the
construction of the Tabanovce-Kumanovo motorway, the persons affected by the
exhuming of the graves, representatives from the relevant church authorities --
Kumanovo and personnel from the Department for Property Issues in the Municipality of
Kumanovo, took part in the meetings and public debates.

 Specific objectives of the public information campaign and public consultation were (i)
to fully share information about the proposed project, its components and its activities,
with affected people; (ii) to obtain information about the needs of the affected people,
and their reactions to proposed policies and activities; (iii) to ensure transparency in all
activities related to land acquisition and compensation payments.

 The socio-economic survey of 294 affected households revealed that 100% of the
respondents were aware of the project prior to the survey taking place. Project authorities
will ensure that local authorities, as well as representatives of PAPs, will be included in
the implementation process. The project team plans to hold additional meetings (during
project appraisal) to further discuss compensation levels and time schedule for payment
and implementation of civil works, procedures of grievance, and mechanisms for
monitoring and evaluation. The project authorities will continue the dialogue with local
officials and representatives of the PAPs during the project implementation process. PAP
participation would also be ensured during final assessment of compensation and
monitoring.
