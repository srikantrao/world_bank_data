B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective for the second phase of the APL is to sustainably increase attainment 
of tertiary education by expanding the availability of student loans in Mexico, and contribute to 
the establishment of a financially sustainable student loan system. Further, the project would 
indirectly contribute to improved quality, relevance and efficiency of tertiary education by 
empowering students to choose among providers and by reducing students' propensity to drop 
out.  
 
The key outcome indicators for phase II would be: (i) number of tertiary education students 
assisted with loans (an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 students would benefit from the project 
depending upon the overall loan amount and students' average loan amount); and (ii) 
performance of supported state student loan programs. State programs' performance would be 
measured by: (a) percentage of supported students from households in the three lowest quintiles 
of the income distribution; (b) short term delinquency rates; and (c) unit costs.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Project design would be relatively simple and include one component:  
Page  2
Support to State Student Loan Programs.  The project would scale-
up
BANOBRASí state 
student loan program to accommodate demand from states. Project cost is estimated in US$ 60 
million; potentially increasing to US$ 90 million or more, depending upon the Statesí needs, 
level of preparation, and fiscal limitations. The expenditures would finance two sub-components:  
 
Student Loans. The bulk of the project investment would finance student loans to support 
studentís attainment of tertiary education, approximately US$ 55 million or 92% of project costs. 
This would increase student loan supply in Mexico by 60% to 120%. States would prioritize 
beneficiaries according to detailed criteria in the State Operational Manual.  Selection criteria 
would include: (i) socio-economic status of the studentís family; (ii) level of tertiary studies to be 
pursued; (iii) relevance and/ or market potential of a given career; and (iv) cost of attendance.  
 
The implementation arrangement would follow each Stateís preferred arrangement subject to 
minimum requirements established in the operational manual. Some states plan to initiate loan 
programs under their Ministries of Education, using trust funds and commercial bank services for 
fund management.  Other states with operating student loan institutions would continue with 
such institutions.  Finally, some States consider outsourcing implementation to the private sector, 
while maintaining supervision responsibilities within the government. The State Student Loan 
Programs would receive resources as loans (guaranteed by the State government) from 
BANOBRAS. The states would be required to co-finance the program.  Readiness would be 
determined by the approval of the Stateís Operational Manual (SOM) by BANOBRAS and the 
Bank.  The SOM would form an integral part of the loan agreement to be signed with 
BANOBRAS and would contain:  (i) organizational structure for the Loan Program; (ii) required 
staff and capacity building plan (iii) beneficiary eligibility and selection criteria; (iv) operational 
procedures; (v) loan projections; (vi) strategies for capitalization, including the state 
governmentís contribution, and collection of student loans; and (vii) project implementation 
plan.  The interest rates for student loans would as a minimum be the interest rate of the loan 
from BANOBRAS to the State (9-10%), and would not be higher than the students can pay 
based on expected future income.  
 
Capacity Building.  A small but important sub-component would finance capacity building of 
the State Student Loan Programs, approximately US$ 5 million or 8% of estimated project costs. 
Given the importance of financial sustainability for long term impact, the success of these 
activities is very important. The project would finance start-up and learning costs such as 
training, consultants, equipment, and information systems.  
 
At the federal level, BANOBRAS would be the main supervising agency. Further, an Advisory 
Committee would be constituted with representatives of SEP, BANOBRAS and State Student 
Loan Agencies. In addition, the National Banking Commission (Comisi√≥n Nacional Bancaria y 
de Valores) and the State Ministries of Finance would be invited for membership given their 
expertise in supervision of financial entities and interest in a financially sustainable student loan 
system. The Committee would have the following functions: (i) recommend changes to the rules 
for the student loan system; (ii) monitor and evaluate the system (including maintaining common 
databases); (iii) promote the sharing of best practices; and (iv) promote private investments into 
Page  3
the student loan system. It is envisioned that this Committee evolve into a permanent body 
devoted to the promotion of a coherent and financially sustainable student loan system.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Through BANOBRAS, the Bank would on-lend funds to support State Student Loan Programs. 
Nine state governments have expressed interest and prepared preliminary project proposals: 
Aguascalientes, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Nuevo 
Le√≥n, and Tamaulipas.
