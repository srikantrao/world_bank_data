B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objective of the project is to reduce the country financial vulnerability to 
natural disasters (earthquakes and hurricanes) of Haiti.  This will be achieved through the 
establishment of the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) and the financing 
of catastrophe insurance coverage from the Facility.  
 
The project aims to allow Haiti to join the CCRIF and benefit from financial protection against 
catastrophic earthquake and/or hurricane events.  Without this grant, it is unlikely Haiti would 
join this pilot initiative that represents the first entity created to protect small island states from 
the financial impact of natural disasters.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project will finance Haiti's entry fee and insurance premium for three years.  
Annual payments will be made to the CCRIF, with an entry fee to be used as last year premium 
in the year a country decides to leave the Facility.  The Grant proceeds will be transferred on an 
annual basis from the Association to the CCRIF at the request of the Ministry of Finance.

D.  Project location (if known) 
The project contemplates no direct physical investments.  Instead, the project will finance 
payments from the Ministry of Finance to the CCRIF.  No safeguards will be triggered.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The project is rated Category C and involves only the transfer of funds from the Ministry of 
Finance to the Facility on an annual basis.  To strengthen the absorption capacity of the 
Government, a Caribbean Emergency Legislation Project - to be financing by the Institutional 
Development Fund - is currently being developed.
