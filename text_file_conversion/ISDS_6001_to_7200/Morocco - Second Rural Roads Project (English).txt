II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Rural roads to be constructed under the Second National Program of Rural Roads 
(NPRR-2) have a wide range of potentially positive and negative impacts, depending on 
their location within the country. Roads located in the escarpments are characterized by 
hairpin bends, whereas in flat areas they follow rather straight alignments. These 
geometric features affect the volumes of earthworks to be carried out and consequent 
impacts on the environment. Disruption of drainage is a major consideration in road 
design as it may hamper free drainage, cause stagnant pools of water, lead to increased 
sediments into ponds, streams and rivers due to erosion from road tops and sides, as well 
as increased run-off and flooding. In the case of mountain roads, borrow excavation into 
the mountainside to achieve the planned design width of the roadbed may lead to the 
erosion of exposed slope surfaces and possibly to slides of slopes onto the road. Slope 
stabilization is therefore a key design issue in mountainous areas. Loss of natural 
vegetation may also occur during construction, especially when widening works are 
planned. In that case, revegetation and replanting will be envisioned to protect susceptible 
soil surfaces. Loss of access is possible in case roadbeds are raised or villages bisected by 
road widening. During construction, inadequate disposal of oil and bitumen, as well as 
the introduction of work camp or hazardous wastes, may lead to soil and groundwater 
contamination. Environmental impacts resulting from road works are expected to be 
Page  3
localized and it is therefore reasonable to assume a negligible risk of cumulative negative 
impacts.  
 
For the vast majority of NPRR-2 roads, works will mainly consist of improving the 
conditions of existing roads in the country’s classified road network. Some roads may 
however require expansion or realignment and thus necessitate land acquisition and 
involuntary resettlement. As per the Resettlement Framework Policy (RFP) developed for 
the project, all land/structures/assets to be acquired will be identified and carefully 
recorded in the Land Acquisition Plan (LAP). The RFP favors a policy of minimizing 
private land acquisition.  
 
Positive impacts stemming from the project are numerous. The rehabilitation/upgrading 
of all-weather rural roads should give isolated populations year-round access to basic 
social and economic services (health, education and markets). These roads will have a 
significant impact more specifically in the agricultural sector, by facilitating the 
distribution and marketing of agricultural products, thereby increasing the sector’s 
productivity. The rehabilitation/upgrading of rural roads should also lead to significant 
improvement in both transport services’ quality and competitiveness, and to a large drop 
in transport fares. Finally, the use of labor-intensive techniques, which will be 
encouraged under the project, will provide local population with opportunities for 
temporary work.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Indirect impacts include induced commercial and business developments along the 
rehabilitated/upgraded rural roads. An increased risk of road accidents due to higher 
speeds could also occur. Such risk is however limited, considering that most of these 
roads handle a very low volume of traffic (less than 30-50 vehicles per day).   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Analysis of alternatives for each rural road project will be carried out during project 
preparation, in case adverse impacts are identified. Alternatives considered will include 
design (especially earth works and drainage structures), technology, construction 
techniques and phasing, as well as operation and maintenance procedures.  
 
In terms of land-acquisition and resettlement, and as per the RFP, the Directorate of 
Roads and Road Traffic (DRCR) will explore all possible alternatives before taking 
definitive action to acquire land.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and a Resettlement Framework Policy 
(RFP) were developed under the first Rural Roads Project (adopted in June 2004) with a 
view to limiting the negative impacts of road projects on the environment, and to evaluate 
and address the socioeconomic impacts of projects on the population. The EMP and RFP 
have been reviewed and slightly modified for the present project. The main mitigation 
measures that will be implemented under the EMP and RFP include, among others:  
Page  4
–
Improved and environmentally-sound road standards, especially: (i) use of surface 
drainage controls on vulnerable surfaces and slopes; (ii) size and location of roadside 
drainage and culverts to handle maximum anticipated flows; (iii) line receiving surfaces 
with stones or concrete; and (iv) location and design of borrow/quarry sites for erosion 
control during road construction and future maintenance operations  
 
–
Adequate measures during construction, such as: (i) collection and recycling of 
used lubricants; (ii) minimizing wastes generated during construction and reusing 
construction wastes where practicable; (iii) management of construction period worker 
health and safety; (iv) use of archeological chance find procedures and coordination with 
appropriate government agencies; and (v) ensuring adequate maintenance of culverts, 
roadslide slopes, drainage control measures, road surface and vegetation.  
 
–
Systematic public consultations with people affected by the NPRR-2 due to land 
acquisition. Moroccan expropriation procedures include publicly informing concerned 
parties. The public may review the land acquisition plans and provide comments, 
questions/concerns or objections, which is documented in an official register that is 
reserved for this purpose. Land will be acquired through expropriation, amicable 
arrangement or land donation. The RPF outlines the procedures for each of these 
scenarios.   
 
Although the CFR is the project’s implementing agency, it has delegated the 
implementation of the road projects it finances to the Directorate of Roads and Road 
Traffic (DRCR) of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). In that context, 
the DRCR is expected shortly to appoint an “Environmental and Social” Specialist within 
its Studies and New Construction Division (DETN) to ensure that all roads improved 
under the NPRR-2 comply with the standards set for social and environmental 
safeguards. At the local level, the Regional Offices (DREs) and Provincial Offices 
(DPEs) of the MPWT which will carry out the rural road projects and assume 
responsibility for their operation and maintenance will also appoint an “Environmental 
and Social” liaison officer to ensure that safeguard procedures are thoroughly applied 
throughout the project and report to the DRCR on progress achieved. The DRCR, DREs 
and DPEs should therefore be adequately staffed to implement the EMP. During project 
implementation, training activities will be regularly carried out to build capacity and 
further strengthen those institutions.  
 
In terms of land acquisition, the DRCR has a department (Service de Domaine Public) 
staffed by competent personnel with in-depth knowledge of Moroccan legislation on 
expropriation.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include all rural population living along or nearby 
rehabilitated/upgraded roads, who will significantly benefit from all-weather roads; local 
authorities (collectivitÃ©s locales); the Caisse de Financement Routier (CFR); and the 
Directorate of Roads and Road Traffic (DRCR) within the Ministry of Equipment and 
Transport (MET).  
 
In the preparation phase of the NPRR-2, all provinces in Morocco, as well as elected 
officials and representatives of local authorities, were consulted by the DRCR (through 
its DPEs) on those roads to be included in the NPRR-2. In a number of provinces, 
Page  5
provincial councils organized pre-consultation meetings on their own, at the commune 
level, in order to present projects in greater detail and gather comments prior to the 
consultations organized by the DPEs. The consultations led to approval of the majority of 
roads selected by the DRCR (and therefore of the selection methods applied), as well as a 
few changes aimed at meeting specific local demands. The objective of consultations was 
also to strengthen the impact of road projects for the populations concerned, by enabling 
local authorities to match, as much as possible, their own investment programs with the 
NPRR-2.  
 
The public will be consulted extensively during the screening phase and preparation of 
the Environmental Management Plan for each road project. Arrangements allowing for 
consultation with the public at each worksite have been included in the environmental 
procedures. Local populations that may be affected by road projects will be 
systematically consulted in a view to gather their views on the projects’ environmental 
and social aspects. Moroccan expropriation procedures require the public announcement 
of an intent to expropriate at least twice in a national newspaper and in the Bulletin 
official. The expropriation proposals and plans are also to be posted in the offices of the 
relevant communes. Locally elected representatives will play an active role in informing 
their constituents of the expropriation plans.  
 
Finally, each province will receive annual reports on progress of the NPRR-2, with 
specific information of environmental and social matters.
