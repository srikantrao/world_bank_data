B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The overall development objective is to assist the Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) to 
implement its child health and reproductive health strategy through placing a strong focus on 
results, particularly toward reducing the level of under five mortality (currently at 284/1000 live 
births), by supporting health system strengthening and implementation at scale of integrated 
packages of high-impact and low-cost health and nutrition interventions.  
 
The Project will use an APL like approach where the Africa Catalytic Grant Funds? (ACGF) 
contribution would be divided into two phases covering 4.5 years, from mid 2007 to end 2011.  
In this phase (Phase 1), the Project would cover the last six months of 2007 providing necessary 
resources to scale up existing district health plans that are currently being financed under the 
ongoing Institutional Reform and Capacity Building Project (IRCBP, IDA Grant Number H080-
SL).   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Page  2
Under Phase 1, the ACGF will support two components: (a) the scaling up of the Local Councils 
2007 district health plans, including (i) strengthening outreach services; (ii) improving logistics 
for improved service delivery; (iii) improving commodity security (pharmaceuticals, medical 
supplies, etc.); (iv) setting up a Monitoring and Evaluation system; and (b) project coordination 
and management to enable fiduciary and technical oversight for Phase 1 implementation.  
 
Responsibility for primary health care (PHC) was devolved to the Local Councils (LCs) in 
2005.  Since that time all recurrent funding for PHC goes directly to the LCs and not the 
Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS).  Phase 1 of the ACGF proposal envisaged that 
funding would pass through the LCs using the same modalities as in the case of the ongoing 
Institutional Reform Capacity Building Project (IRCBP, Grant H-080-SL).  Hence, the 
institutional and implementation arrangements of the IRCBP will be used to manage the scaling 
up of the LC 2007 district health plans for PHC.   The MOHS will provide technical oversight 
during implementation and will work closely with the IRCBP team accordingly.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Project location is in the 12 health districts of the country.  
 
All Local Councils have already prepared District?s annual primary health care plans which use 
a
standard format and are organized around outcomes and related activities, expected outputs, 
and sources of funding.  The original plans have already been reviewed by the respective LCs 
and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS).  
 
These plans are available and a financial gap analysis has been completed which indicates that 
approximately $4.3 million could be absorbed by the districts in the second half of 2007, which 
is an overall increase of 15 percent.  Approximately 55 percent would be for program costs 
(supervision and monitoring) , 11 percent for training, 12 percent for vehicles, including 
motorcycles and boats, and 22 percent for drugs and medical supplies.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Under the ongoing Health Sector Reconstruction and Development Project (HSRDP), the MOHS 
prepared an Environmental Assessment (including an EMP) and a Medical Waste Management 
Plan in 2001-2002, which were disclosed both in-country and in the World Bank's Infoshop. 
These are being implemented.  
 
In-country and in the World Bank?s Infoshop disclosure of an Updated EIA/EMP in the context 
of the Additional Financing for the Health Sector Reconstruction Development Project (HSRDP, 
see ISDS, AC2753) took place on April 10, 2007.  Board date for the Additional Financing is 
scheduled for May 15, 2007.
