II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
There are no potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. For components
1 civil works include the rehabilitation of the existing headquarters building and the
adjoining annex. For component 2 civil works will be on the 14th floor of the Public
Television building where the IPARD paying agency is currently located. For component
3, equipment will be purchased for two laboratories located on the premises of the
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. A laboratory waste disposal system, including an
incinerator, is already in place. The project also plans to identify alternatives for a facility
that would enable safe disposal of contaminated animal carcasses and eventually finance
the construction of the facility in the 3rd or 4th year of the project.

 Environmental Category B

 Applicable Safeguards:

 OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment
 This safeguard may be triggered by: (a) rehabilitation of buildings (small-scale civil
works) associated with components 1 and 2; (b) disposal of laboratory waste associated
with component 3; (c) facility for contaminated carcass disposal under component 3.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No long-term or cumulative impacts are expected.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Alternatives to specific construction or rehabilitation impact mitigation measures will be
considered and assessed during preparation of the feasibility studies and terms of
reference for the works contracts, as per guidelines to be included in the Operations
Manual. Once the feasibility study for the carcass disposal facility is completed and the
preferred alternative for investment identified, an environmental and social assessment of
that alternative will be undertaken prior to possible investments in civil works.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Environmental Assessment is being prepared for the project. Draft EA report has been
completed and discussed in Macedonia on March 28, 2007. Comments have been
incorporated and the final report was submitted to the Bank by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Economy on April 5, 2007. The EA report includes the
review of current Macedonian legislation relevant to agriculture, solid waste and
agriculture, permitting procedures relevant for activities that will be undertaken under the
Project, assessment of the potential impacts of the proposed project components as well
as likely significance of such impacts, recommended mitigation measures together with
an outline of the monitoring plan and organizations responsible for implementation of
mitigation measures.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Consultations on the EA report were held on March 28, 2007 at the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy from 12:00 to 13:00 pm. The meeting was
attended by representatives from Ministries and NGOs. A summary of the public
discussion is included in the EA report and no major issues were raised.
