A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the Infrastructure Reconstruction Financing Facility is to assist the province 
of
Aceh and 12 local governments in Aceh and Nias to reconstruct/rehabilitate strategic 
infrastructure and extend key infrastructure services of adequate quality standards that meet 
the needs of communities where infrastructure was damaged by the tsunami of 2004 and the 
subsequent earthquake. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The BRR is the Implementing Agency for this project and the World Bank will act as partner 
agency as required under MDF procedures. The main components necessary for attaining 
project objectives are grouped as follows:
 
Component 1: Financing of Infrastructure Reconstruction and Rehabilitation  
Financing of individual infrastructure reconstruction and rehabilitation subprojects in 12 local 
governments and strategic investments in the provincial government, including civil works 
and installed equipment in subprojects in the following sectors: roads, ports, water and 
sanitation, drainage, flood control, coastal protection and restoration of major irrigation 
canals.

Component 2: Targeted Support to Infrastructure Subproject Planning, Design, Supervision, and Implementation 
Oversight
.
Need-based support to local and provincial governments for identification, design and preparation of 
infrastructure reconstruction subprojects, technical assistance for transition to a post-BRR timeframe and 
institutional arrangements beyond June 2009, including extension of TA provided under IREP, and capacity 
b
uilding and infrastructure asset maintenance programs for local and provincial governments, as well as 
assistance in conducting performance and financial audit (over and above external audit) of project financial 
statements.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
From a physical environmental perspective, the project will cover all tsunami and earthquake 
affected areas in Aceh and Nias with a specific focus on Banda Aceh, the west coast 
(including Meulaboh and Calang) and built up areas in Nias. These areas have been severely 
damaged both in terms of marine and terrestrial environments.  In many places coastlines have 
been physically altered, particularly the inter-tidal zones.  Shallow coral reefs have been 
affected resulting from the large amounts of solid waste, silts and clays generated by the 
waves.  Mud laden residues have infiltrated both man made and natural water sources, and 
blocked drainage lines.  Many of the heavy clay soils that predominate in the coastal region 
have been inundated with salt water.  In Nias large tracts of coastal land have been lifted up 
and an estimated 250 ha of coral reefs are reported to have been destroyed.   With the loss of 
sea defenses previously built up areas have been reclaimed by the tides leading to coastal 
inundation and the recreation of marshy areas juxtaposed with human settlement.

Comments:
 
This project works jointly with the Infrastructure Reconstruction Enabling Programme (IREP) 
and will use the same PMU and supporting arrangements.  It will provide technical services 
and capacity building for infrastructure planning, development and implementation, directed 
primarily at local government level, as well as related financing of up to US$ 300 million.  
The safeguards arrangements for this financing have largely already been put in place under 
IREP, including the establishment of a fund to cover all necessary social and environmental 
work associated with the preparation of individual sub-projects.  Additional resources for 
environmental and social safeguards are provided for under IRFF to cover expansion from a 
total of 9 districts under IREP to 12 districts under IRFF, as well as increased support for 
province level infrastructure projects.  At the same time the likely scale of individual sub-
projects is small to medium-scale, and may not trigger the need for full AMDAL/EIA under 
GoI environmental regulations.   Any sub-project likely to lead to significant environmental 
and social impacts will be screened out early on during the planning projects through 
eligibility criteria to be developed and applied by the BRR.   Sub-projects will not be deemed 
eligible if they likely to: (i) significantly impact on environmentally or culturally sensitive 
sites; (ii) result in inter-basin transfer of water resources; significantly alter coastal zone 
morphology and processes; (iii) result in large scale land-clearance; (iv) use or emit toxic 
and/or hazardous wastes; or (v) result in large-scale resettlement.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Safeguards policies under the project will be addressed in the following manner: 
Safeguard policies triggered by this project include environmental assessment, involuntary 
resettlement and Indigenous Peoples.  These policies are triggered by virtue of the fact that 
the project will deliver ‘finished’ projects for financing and will therefore have had to 
consider a full range of safeguards issues as part of project preparation and detailed design.  
Key social and environmental impact areas to be considered during project preparation work 
will include: 
 
·
resource extraction impacts (primarily sourcing of sand, gravel and other quarry 
material); 
·
construction impacts (excavation, fuel spills, noise and dust management, obstruction 
to drainage, pollution and sedimentation of water courses);  
·
migrant labour related impacts (increased social tension in the community, spread of 
HIV/AIDs, …); 
·
inclusion of views/needs of vulnerable groups in planning and preparation work; 
·
land acquisition and resettlement related impacts, with focus on compensation 
entitlements for widows and other marginal groups to ensure equitable treatment; 
·
special needs and concerns of indigenous peoples living on Nias. 
 
The approach taken by the project in addressing impacts will be subject to the IREP social 
and environmental framework, revised and consolidated under IRFF providing : (i) strategic 
advice to BRR on the overall environmentally sustainability of the infrastructure 
development strategy; (ii) expertise built into the planning and design teams to assist BRR 
and LGs in screening proposed projects and to identify/mitigate likely impacts; (iii) 
establishment of a facility to carry out all required environmental and social studies to be 
managed by the IPM team; (iv) a process framework for the monitoring and management of 
environmental and social concerns 
during implementation of sub
-
projects

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
capacity building to BRR and local governments; (vi) support for BRR in preparation of 
environmental guidelines and standards for infrastructure projects. 
 
The Project will be subject to an orientation paper on environmental and social issues to be 
prepared by the PMU/IPM team to inform strategic advice provided to the BRR as well as 
individual project appraisal, based on the emerging results of the Bappenas Strategic 
Environmental and Natural Resources Assessment (SENRA) Study of Aceh and Nias.  The 
project will not plan/prepare new investments likely to impact on protected forest areas. 
 
Although there are no distinct indigenous peoples in Aceh, special measures to ensure that 
particularly vulnerable groups are consulted during the preparation of individual investments 
(widows, women, single parent households, those that have lost assets and/or livelihoods) 
will be required.  By contrast, conditions in Nias are more complex.  There are distinct 
indigenous communities living in parts of the island requiring an adequate IP approach, 
including appropriate consultation arrangements, if investments are located in and around 
these areas.  Previous experience indicates that village based elites in some parts of Nias are 
prone to monopolising consultative processes directed at project affected people, requiring 
additional measures to ensure that consultations are meaningful.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.   
The project area will be subject to widespread development related impacts for the next 5-10 
years. These are likely to place increasing pressure on locally available natural resources 
required for the reconstruction process (sand, gravel, quarry material), placing fragile and 
stressed environments under increasing pressure.   Related impacts include inflationary 
effects on construction materials limiting access to these resources among the poorest, 
physical environmental effects on river hydrology, slope stability and coastal 
geomorphology, and continued destruction of sensitive coastal natural habitats.  Further 
indirect impacts could include increased friction with local communities caused by 
continuing influx of local migrant labour and foreigners.  On the positive side, the effects of 
5-10 years of reconstruction will result in high year on year growth in the local economy 
leading to increased opportunities to convert surplus cash and assets into viable new 
livelihood activities.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
The IREP/IRFF Infrastructure Program Management (IPM) Team will provide strategic level 
advice to the BRR and local governments based on an initial assessment of programming 
needs.  This assessment will need to take account of higher order environmental and social 
concerns associated with infrastructure planning and development and, in this sense, will be 
able to address alternatives in terms of design (bridges, coastal protection, configuration of 
ports) and sequencing.  Although there may be opportunities to consider alternatives in terms 
of the location of individual projects, such alternatives will be more restricted given a 
primary focus on the replacement of pre-existing infrastructure and the need to minimize land 
acquisition.  
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide a
n
Page  5
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Both the BRR and Local governments are poorly equipped to handle social and 
environmental issues.  Even the provincial Bapedalda is under-resourced to handle the 
current volume of new projects despite direct support being provided by the Ministry of 
Environment and a GTZ/DANIDA environmental management support program.  Therefore 
it will be incumbent on the Project to ensure that all necessary safeguards procedures are 
followed during preparation work, and that a suitable mechanism is put in place to support 
post-design supervision and review also.   
 
In order to 
ensure full compliance with the World Bank’s environmental and social safeguard 
requirements, and based on the best-practice models in similar earthquake recovery 
operations, a Social and Environmental  Framework was prepared and approved under IREP 
covering screening, assessment and required mitigation.  The IREP framework provides for 
IRFF also, with a number of revisions mainly reflecting the extension of IREP support from 
9-12 districts under IRFF.  The main elements of the safeguards approach include: 
 
·
a
staffing plan for safeguards specialists within the IPM team and geographical teams; 
·
use of eligibility criteria to identify particularly inappropriate and damaging sub-
projects early on based on a range of criteria (including social and environmental) 
·
formal screening of all new projects, based on GoI regulations and WB requirements, 
entering the pipeline for likely social and environmental impacts; 
·
consulting services to carry out all necessary project related social and environmental 
studies (AMDAL, UKL/UPL, LARAP), to be managed by BRR/IPM; 
·
approval of all required environmental studies by relevant local government 
authorities; 
·
ensuring that recommendations from social and environmental studies are integrated 
into the detailed engineering design phase and that land acquisition and resettlement 
plans are developed as required; 
·
tracking and monitoring system for the implementation phase of individual 
investments (prioritized towards high impact type projects), linked to the project 
monitoring database; 
·
a
program of training for BRR and concerned LG authorities (Bappeda, Bapedalda, 
Bina Marga) covering preparation and supervision phases; 
·
a
separate Indigenous Peoples’ Planning Framework to be applied if the project 
comes into contact with local communities in some pre-identified located in Nias 
·
development of a policy and plan of action for extraction of materials based on survey 
and mapping of existing and potential quarry sites, development and application of 
suitable standards, and enforcement measures. 
·
resources to help to prepare, disseminate (and provide related training on) guidelines 
to ensure environmentally sound and sustainable implementation of infrastructure 
projects – including integration into contractual documents.  
 
Infrastructure sub-projects to be prepared under IREP/IRFF will not be considered complete 
until (i) mitigation plans for any associated land acquisition and resettlement are finalized, 
and (ii) the 
budgets for compensation of land/assets acquired are inscribed in the annual 
Page  6
budget (DIPA) of the responsible agency.  All acquired land and other assets will be paid for 
at their replacement or market cost. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The project’s ultimate beneficiaries are the people of Aceh and Nias who will directly benefit 
from the economic effects of the rehabilitation of critical district and province level 
infrastructure.  More directly the project will be providing support to district level planning 
and infrastructure authorities (Bappeda and Dinas Bina Marga), helping to ensure that the 
speed of reconstruction is increased and that an appropriate system of prioritization is 
applied.  One of the roles of the BRR supported by the IPM team will be to ensure broad 
consultation and public outreach during infrastructure planning and preparation phases, and 
to develop and instill these approaches within the BRR and local governments.  The ToRs for 
the IPM team will elaborate on this important task and ensure that sufficient technical 
capacity is included and financial resources allocated.  The social and environmental 
framework will be made available to the public through the Bank's Project Information 
Centers in Jakarta and Washington, and also will be published in the project manuals and be 
made available by the BRR to the participating local governments. Individual investments 
resulting from the TA requiring LARAP, UKL or AMDAL will, in any case, follow required 
GoI and WB consultation and disclosure procedures.  The safeguards framework will be 
discussed with the BRR and LG representatives prior to appraisal.
