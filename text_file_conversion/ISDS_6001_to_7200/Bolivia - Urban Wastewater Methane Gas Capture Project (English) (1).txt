B. Project Objectives
The overarching objective of the proposed Project is to help mitigate global climate
change, by facilitating the use of market-based mechanisms sanctioned under the
Kyoto Protocol through support to the urban sanitation sector in Bolivia. To this end,
the Project is anticipated to displace over 60 thousand tons of C02equivalent per year
of operation, rising to over 100 thousand tons by 2008. The Project will also reduce
the local emissions of gasses generated from the treatment facilities, which currently
carry unpleasant odours to nearby residential areas.

The project will contribute to the further development of the international carbon
market in Bolivia through the supply of Emissions Reductions under the Clean
Development Mechanism (CDM) as set forth under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol.
The key performance indicator is the creation of VERs through the contribution of
methane.

The project will also enhance the efficacy of the Bolivia Urban Infrastructure Project
in its aims of improving Santa Cruz's urban sanitation infrastructure by providing an

additional source of foreign currency to supplement the investment capital
SAGUAPAC requires to extend its urban sanitation service coverage.

C. Project Description
The proposed project will purchase a total of 500,000 metric tons of C02equivalent
(tC02e) Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs) from the capture of methane gas at
the SAGUAPAC wastewater treatment facilities in Santa Cruz.

Purchase of Carbon Emissions Reductions (Total Cost: 3,000,000)
The project would provide for all primary treatment anaerobic lagoons at
SAGUAPAC owned and operated wastewater treatment facilities in Santa Cruz.
These lagoons would be covered with 'geomembrane' sheeting, capturing all
produced methane gas. This methane would then be flared off, converting it to carbon
dioxide (with a global warming potential 21 times lower then that of methane).

The project would reduce over 500 thousand tC02e over 7 years, which The World
Bank would purchase on behalf of the Community Development Carbon Fund in the
form of Verified Emissions Reductions (VERs).

As a Community Development Carbon Fund project, this project will incorporate a
Community Benefits Plan, currently being developed by the operator SAGUAPAC.
The development and implementation of this plan is expected to be financed from a
premium over and above the market price for ERs paid by the CDCF to fund such
projects. The community benefits could include activities such as public education
and neighbourhood improvements.

D. Project location
In the municipality of Santa Cruz, the sanitation sector faces immediate challenges.
Santa Cruz has a population of about 1.3 million, growing at an annual rate of over
6%. Sanitation services in Santa Cruz are provided by 10 cooperatives of which the
largest is SAGUAPAC, serving 65% of the city's area.              Sewerage coverage in
SAGUAPAC's service area is only about 50%, giving Santa Cruz an overall level of
sewerage coverage of only 32%. In addition to the immediate public health and
environmental effects associated with low sewerage coverage, sewage infiltration into
the city's main aquifer will result, within a few years, in irreversible damage. There is
therefore an urgent need to increase the coverage of Santa Cruz's sewerage system to
avoid the much larger investments associated with developing an entirely new water
supply source for the city.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
SAGUAPAC has an Environment and Labour Security Department that will enforce
the current environmental legislation as well as implement the specific environmental
guidelines laid out by the manuals. Moreover, the project will be monitored during its
execution by the Works Supervision Unit to ensure prevention and mitigation of risks.
