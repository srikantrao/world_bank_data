  B. Project Objectives
  The overarching objective of the proposed Project is to help mitigate global climate
  change, by facilitating the use of market-based mechanisms sanctioned under the
  Kyoto Protocol through support to the urban sanitation sector in Bolivia. To this end,
  the Project is anticipated to displace over 26 thousand tons of C02equivalent per year
  of operation, rising to over 44 thousand tons by 2012. The Project will also reduce
  the local emissions of gasses generated from the treatment facilities, which currently
  carry unpleasant odours to nearby residential areas.

  The project will contribute to the further development of the international carbon
  market in Bolivia through the supply of Emissions Reductions under the Clean
  Development Mechanism (CDM) as set forth under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol.
  The key performance indicator is the creation of VERs through the contribution of
  methane.

The project will also enhance the efficacy of the Bolivia Urban Infrastructure Project
in its aims of improving Santa Cruz's urban sanitation infrastructure by providing an
additional source of foreign currency to supplement the investment capital
SAGUAPAC requires to extend its urban sanitation service coverage.

C. Project Description
The proposed project will purchase C02 equivalent (tC02e) Certified and Verified
Emissions Reductions (CERs and VERs) from the capture of methane gas at the
SAGUAPAC wastewater treatment facilities in Santa Cruz.

Purchase of Carbon Emissions Reductions
The project would provide for all primary treatment anaerobic lagoons at
SAGUAPAC owned and operated wastewater treatment facilities in Santa Cruz.
These lagoons would be covered with 'geomembrane' sheeting, capturing all
produced methane gas. This methane would then be flared off, converting it to carbon
dioxide (with a global warming potential 21 times lower then that of methane).

The project would reduce over 527 thousand tC02e over 12 years. The World Bank
would purchase, on behalf of the Community Development Carbon Fund, a
proportion of these emissions reductions in the form of Certified, and Verified
Emissions Reductions (CERs and VERs), and the Bio Carbon Fund, in the form of
VERs.

As a Community Development Carbon Fund project, this project will incorporate a
Community Benefits Plan, developed by the operator SAGUAPAC to improve
sanitation services in the poor neighbourhoods surrounding the wastewater treatment
facilities. The development and implementation of this plan will be financed from a
premium over and above the market price for ERs paid by the CDCF to fund such
projects.   The community benefits include activities such as neighbourhood
improvement, increasing sanitation coverage in the area, providing more adequate
street drainage to remove a common foci of infection, and improving the sanitation
conditions in local hospitals and schools.

D. Project location
In the municipality of Santa Cruz, the sanitation sector faces immediate challenges.
Santa Cruz has a population of about 1.3 million, growing at an annual rate of over
6%. Sanitation services in Santa Cruz are provided by 10 cooperatives of which the
largest is SAGUAPAC, serving 65% of the city's area.              Sewerage coverage in
SAGUAPAC's service area is only about 50%, giving Santa Cruz an overall level of
sewerage coverage of only 32%. In addition to the immediate public health and
environmental effects associated with low sewerage coverage, sewage infiltration into
the city's main aquifer will result, within a few years, in irreversible damage. There is
therefore an urgent need to increase the coverage of Santa Cruz's sewerage system to
avoid the much larger investments associated with developing an entirely new water
supply source for the city.

E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for SafeguardPolicies
SAGUAPAC has an Environment and Labour Security Department that will enforce
the current environmental legislation as well as implement the specific environmental

guidelines laid out by the manuals. Moreover, the project will be monitored during its
execution by the Works Supervision Unit to ensure prevention and mitigation of risks.
