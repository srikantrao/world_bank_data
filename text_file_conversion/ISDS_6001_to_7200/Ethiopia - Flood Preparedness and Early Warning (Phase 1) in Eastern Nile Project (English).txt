3, Project Description:
FPEW I is planned for 3 years of implementation and will overlap with the first two y e 9 of
FPEW 11. FPEW I comprises three key components, namely, regional c~otdination(USSt.69
M), pilot flood preparedness and emergencyresponse ($1.26 M), and flood forecasting
                                                                                                  ,

The immediate objective of this component is to put in place an institutional mechanism.for
enhancing regional coordination for the flood project. The regional coordination is aimed at' (i)
managing and implementing day to day current and future prq,aration/imp!ementation phase$of
PEW;(ii) coordination of data collection and analysis from the EN countries, together with
other IDEN projects; (iii) functioningas a platform forexperiencesharing and capacitybuilding;
(iv) liaising betweendonors, consultants and EN countries;(v) coordinatingcommon activities
between the flood and other projects planned under integrated development of Eastern Nile
(IDEN);and managingFPEW 11projectpreparationand implementation.                              ,:a.

6   Establish a Regional Flood brdiantion Unit (RFCU}located in Khartoum (Sudan) as a
    sub-office of ENTRO.This requires an establishment agreement between mjTRO and'the
    Government of Sudan similar to the one EMXO has with the Government of Ethiopia &id
    the privileges it enjoys as in Ethiopia. It isexpectedthat for such agreementsto be in plait. it
    may take around a year. Hence the RFCU kill hction from Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) bs' a
    transitional institution to be shifted to Sudan as soon as this agreement and other readirless
    arrangementsare concluded. ENTRO has prepared a draR check list to assess the readiness
    of moving its sub-office to Sudan. ENTRO will finalize the check list and review the check
    list periodically and decide the date of movement to Sudan and will infom
    ENSAPf/ENCOM accordingly, Adequate budget provision for this additionality has been
    provided for in the project cost under ENTRO administrative support cost. The RFCU will
    also assist in the strengthening of national flood warning centers through facilitationof the
    cxchange anddisseminationof vital flood-relatedinformation foruseat national level as well
-   as throughthe provision of a mechanism for sharingof knowledgeand technical skills across
    regions.

qt&tation,          value addition and disseminated to those who need to take action,            %
