2. Project Objectives 
The proposed project provides strong synergies in energy and sustainable development, 
and the energy diversification thrust underlying the project addresses these goals.  The 
Country Assistance Strategy  (Report No. 28141-ME, April 15, 2004) notes 
environmental sustainability as included in basic objectives for Bank activity in Mexico, 
i.e. to ìpromote development in harmony with nature and the environmentî (p. 9).  In this 
context, consolidating infrastructure development to provide reliable and important 
public utilities services within a framework of fiscal restraint is also seen as critical for 
sustaining development. (p. 14).The CAS notes the importance of improving the business 
climate through further unbundling, strengthening regulatory frameworks, increasing 
private investment, and enhancing corporate governance:  In the energy sector, ìunder a 
businessñasñusual scenario, Mexico will need to import 25 percent of its natural gas 
needs in the next decade.î  
 
Page  2
The development objective of the proposed project is to assist Mexico in stimulating 
and accelerating the commercialization of grid-connected renewable energy applications 
and markets in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and other emissions while 
responding to increasing energy demand and energy diversification imperatives necessary 
for sustainable economic growth.  The global objective, per Global Environment Facility 
Operational Policy #6 on Climate Change, is to address and reduce the barriers to 
development of grid-connected renewable energy technologies and markets in Mexico.   
 
3. Project Description 
To achieve these objectives, the project proposes a two-phase approach to address key 
policy and tariff issues currently hindering renewable energy development, and facilitate 
initial investments in grid connected wind energy with use of GEF support in a 
competitive Financial Mechanism to overcome initial investment barriers.  Based on an 
adequate framework and market entry in the 3-year, $25 Million Phase I, the project 
would continue project replication and cost reduction with additional renewable energy 
technologies in an anticipated $45 million Phase II.  At their May, 2003 meeting, the 
GEF Council authorized US$25 million for Phase I of the project, and indicated its 
commitment to review a subsequent request for a US$45 million Phase II on the basis of 
Phase I success.  The first phase is expected to be 7-1/2 years. 
 
In its first phase, the GEF project supports two main components to remove policy, 
financial and transactional cost barriers in order to open IPP markets in renewable 
energy: 
 
ï
A
Financial Mechanism to stimulate organizational learning and cost reduction, 
that will provide approximately US $20 million in energy production incentives offered 
in response to a CFE competitive solicitation for IPP wind power; and  
 
ï
Technical Assistance activities of approximately US$3.9 million to address 
analytical and policy barriers, and provide business development assistance to stimulate 
and facilitate project investment 
 
Component #1 - Financial Mechanism:  
 
Incorporating lessons from British, Irish and California experiences promoting 
renewable energy, tariff price support for renewable projects will be delivered from a 
Financial Mechanism on a per kWh production basis through competitive bidding for 
increments of capacity for the first five years of operation for winning projects.  This 
mechanism, initially created through the project, will be replenished by Phase II of the 
project, and will also provide a basis for potential expansion by the Mexican Government 
through the Renewable Energy Law draft now reviewed by Congress.   
 
This approach would couple CFE competitive procurement for renewable energy IPPs 
with additional tariff support.  CFEís willingness to pay would be indicated by a 
reference price derived from their true system avoided cost of energy and capacity 
contributions from the project.  An additional payment from the Financial Mechanism as 
part of the same competitive tender, would be provided to bridge the difference between 
the reservation price and the generation cost bid by the developer.  Capital for projects 
would be provided by the private sector through commercial markets, with the tariff 
support and power purchase contract providing a key ingredient in obtaining project 
financing.   
Page  3
Component #2:  Electricity Sector Technical Assistance  
 
Within the Technical Assistance component are six main categories: 
 
1.
System based least cost determination 
ñ
Analytical and methodological activities 
designed to enhance value recognition of renewable resources within the CFE system and 
determine reference prices. 
 
2.
Integration of renewables in system operations ñ Modeling capabilities and 
associated training within CFE and dispatch operations for improved technical integration 
of renewables.  
 
3.
Project and business development ñ Development of protocols and capabilitiesto 
strengthen SENERís Unidad de Promoci√≥n de Inversiones (UPI) capacity to serve as a 
ìone stop shopî for renewable energy project developers. 
 
4.
Green power/Export market ñ Development of a premium value power market 
based on clean energy attributes, plus an associated renewable energy tradable credits 
market. 
 
5.
Wind potential assessment ñ Development of a national wind resource map and 
measuring/monitoring equipment. 
 
6.
Regional plan for La Ventosa region ñ Development of a regional long-term wind 
development plan for La Ventosa area, including a strategic environmental assessment, 
and other studies on issues such as existing land use regulations, social impacts, 
transmission constraints, and industrial development. 
 
In its proposed second phase, the GEF project intends to scale up wind energy 
development, but will also begin support for other technologies having high potential in 
Mexico, including mini-hydro and biomass cogeneration schemes.  The bulk of the mini-
hydro developments are anticipated to be run-of-river, often as an add-on to existing 
irrigation canal schemes. The biomass projects are expected to be based primarily on 
waste biomass associated with agricultural production and processing.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
In Phase I, the Project will only support La Venta III, a 101 MW wind based power 
generation plant to be connected to the grid.  It is expected that La Venta III will be 
located within the municipality of Juchitan de Zaragoza, State of Oaxaca, within the 
Ejido La Venta. The specific site for La Venta III will be decided by the winning bidder ñ 
selecting either from CFEís preferred site, or another site of the bidderís choice ñ and 
will be confirmed soon after the bidding process is completed (around February 2007).

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
(i) Environmental: 
 
The expected environmental impacts for La Venta III are similar to those identified for 
La Venta II (an 85 MW grid connected wind farm) as described below:  
 
General Description of Environmental Impacts La Venta II 
 
AIR QUALITY 
 
Site preparation, construction operation and decommissioning  
 
Vehicle use and machinery increase the concentration of CO, HC, NOx  
 
Increase of dust due to vehicle traffic, transport of materials, civil works for ground 
leveling, 
 
NOISE 
 
Site preparation, construction operation and decommissioning 
 
Vehicle use, machinery and operation of wind turbines will increase the noise level 
 
SOIL 
ñ
GROUND 
 
Site preparation, construction operation and decommissioning 
 
Civil works for site preparation, in particular ground leveling, could result in loss of 
soil.  Movement of heavy equipment could result in compacting and loss of soil quality.  
Discharges of oils during construction works from vehicles and wind turbines could 
contaminate the soil. 
 
WATER 
 
The opening of access roads could affect water drainage 
 
VEGETATION 
 
Civil works for the construction of the power plant and access roads will result in loss of 
vegetation coverage 
Page  5
FAUNA 
 
Site preparation, construction operation and decommissioning 
 
Civil works, the use of machinery and vehicles and the presence of personnel could 
affect the mortality of fauna inhabiting or passing through the project site.  This could 
take place primarily during the phases of preparation and construction when the number 
of workers will be higher.  During operation and commissioning such impacts will be 
negligible. 
 
During operation there is a high risk of birds (resident and migratory) colliding with the 
wind turbines. 
 
LANDSCAPE 
 
The presence of wind turbines will have a visual impact on the landscape. 
 
Source: Environmental Impact Assessment, Eolic Plant La Venta II, CFE, INE A.C. 
(December 2003) 
 
The Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for La Venta II includes the following 
general measures: 
 
ï
Improving visibility of wind turbines and blades: illumination, colored blades 
 
ï
Ensuring a maximum height of 150m 
 
ï
Preventing the use of structure and blades for nesting or rest: use of tubular 
structures 
 
ï
Monitoring and registering of bird migratory paths and number of dead birds 
 
ï
Quick removal of any dead birds to avoid ravens 
 
In addition, the EMP for La Venta III will specify a long-term avian mortality 
monitoring program to assess, and develop improved mitigation for avian collisions. 
 
Key Environmental Safeguards Issues for La Venta III 
 
The key environmental impact expected for La Venta III concerns the potential collision 
of birds (native and migratory) with the wind turbines.  There is however a number of 
international best practice measures that can be implemented to prevent and mitigate 
impacts on bird population, including: 
 
ï
Appropriate sitting 
 
ï
Improve visibility of wind turbines and blades: night lighting, colored blades and 
other modifications to the design or arrangement of turbines 
 
ï
Prevent collision by ensuring a maximum or appropriate turbine height (e.g. 
150m) 
 
ï
An appropriate wind farm layout to facilitate bird migration 
 
ï
Prevent the use of structure and blades for nesting or rest (e.g. use of tubular 
structures) 
 
ï
Monitoring and registering of bird migratory paths and number of dead birds 
Page  6
ï
Quick removal of any dead birds to avoid attracting scavenging birds 
 
ï
Decision rules for turbine shutdowns during migratory bird seasons 
 
According to the EIA for La Venta II, since 2004 CFE has been implementing a 
monitoring program to gather information on the types of birds which are native to the 
zone of influence of the project (Tehuantepec).  In addition, CFE is planning to 
implement a radar system to detect the frequency passage and paths of migratory birds, 
(i.e. so that it can temporary suspend the rotation of wind turbines and avoid bird 
collisions).  CFE will make the information it has gathered available to those bidding to 
sponsor the project in order to allow the optimal siting decisions, environmental 
assessments, and environmental management plan formulations. 
 
SEMARNAT will use the experience of operations with La Venta II to evaluate impacts 
on migratory birds in the zone of influence and issue appropriate guidelines and/or 
regulations for future similar projects in the country. 
 
Since la Venta III will operate under the scheme of independent power production (IPP), 
the CFE (in the case that the CFE pre-identified site is chosen) or the private company in 
charge of construction and operation (in the case another site within an economic power 
transmission radius is chosen) will be responsible for conducting the environmental 
impact assessment; the winning bidder will be responsible for implementing an 
environmental management plan (EMP) that includes appropriate prevention and 
mitigation measures ñ following the instructions laidout in the projectís social and 
environmental manual.  Without question, the experience of La Venta II will facilitate 
and strengthen the design of the EMP for La Venta III. 
 
It is expected that La Venta III will trigger the Operational Policies for Environmental 
Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04),Cultural Property (OPN 
11.03, being revised as OP 4.11), and Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20, being revised as OP 
4.10) 
 
(ii) Social 
 
La Venta III will be located in an area were the system of ejidos (communal land) is in 
place.  The ejido land was established in 1951 with 5,815 hectares where each ejidatario 
was granted a maximum of 10 Ha. According to the National Institute of Geography and 
Statistics (INEGI), the La Venta has a population of 1,814 people. The inhabitants of the 
ejido la Venta belong to the ethnic group Zapoteco, one of the largest ethnic groups of the 
State of Oaxaca. Although the ejidoís population does not speak Zapoteco any more, they 
maintain the regional festive traditions and identify themselves as Zapotecos and 
Mexicans.  
 
More than half of ejidatarios (55%) in La Venta are employed in primary sector of the 
economy (agriculture, livestock, fishing), 12% in the secondary sector (manufacturing, 
construction), and about 30% in the tertiary sector (services, commercial activities). In 
Ejido La Venta, zapoteco peasants have been traditionally been dedicated to agriculture, 
Page  7
mainly sugar cane crop and other products for family consumption such as corn, beans 
and pumpkin. With the fall of sugar prices, sugar cane based agricultural activities are no 
longer the main economic activity; and has been replaced for cattle raising and 
agriculture of sorghum crop , watermelons, peanuts, melons, cucumbers and sesame 
which are sold in regional markets. Because of the strong winds, land is being cultivated 
only during the spring/summer cycle, and even in irrigated land the crop output is below 
the national performance average. The land where the air generators are to be installed is 
being used for extensive cattle-raising, although in the past it has also been used for 
agricultural purposes (INEGI 2001).  
 
The introduction of La Venta III in Ejido La Venta will trigger the indigenous people 
operational policy (OP 4.10) and possibly, depending on the specific project site, the 
cultural property policy (OP 11). It is expected that La Venta III will have a positive 
impact on the ejidos as their current farming activities will not be affected and the 
installation of the generators in their land is seen as a good opportunity to obtain 
additional income or compensation.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
No negative indirect or long term impacts are foreseen   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues: 
 
The GEF grant will support La Venta III, a 101 MW grid connected, wind based, power 
generation plant that will operate under the scheme of independent power production.  An 
environmental assessment will be conducted during project implementation to identify 
potential environmental impacts, to develop appropriate mitigation measures for negative 
impacts, and to recommend enhancement measures for positive impacts.  This assessment 
will specifically deal with the mitigation measures, operation procedures and design 
specifications to minimize the risk posed to bird populations.  In addition, CFE will 
prepare a regional impact assessment before launching the bidding process, which will 
identify those areas within the Oaxaca region that are environmentally suitable for wind 
development.  The project will also finance, under the technical assistance component, a 
strategic environmental assessment of the region to assess the environmental ëcarrying 
capacityí for wind development in the region.   
 
In sum, the Project has established a number of measures to avoid and/or minimize 
impacts on bird and bat populations including: i) public consultation with relevant 
stakeholders and bird specialists to discuss prevention and mitigation measures, ii) the 
development of a Regional Environmental Assessment (RIA) before the bidding process 
starts to ensure appropriate sitting and avoid most sensitive areas, iii) the development of 
Page  8
an Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) to avoid and/or minimize potential 
cumulative impacts in the area, iv) the implementation of guidelines and specifications to 
ensure appropriate turbine design and arrangements as well as implementation of rules 
for turbine shutdown during migration season, and v) the structuring of a scientific 
review and committee for oversight and technical advise. 
 
From the social front, the project sponsor and operator will follow the guidelines and 
specifications prepared to ensure compliance with social safeguard policies: appropriate 
social assessment and consultation activities, as well as the development of indigenous 
people and social action plans. These guidelines and specifications will be included as an 
annex in the bidding documents. 
 
Monitoring and Complia
nce with Bankís Safeguard Policies 
 
In order to qualify for the green incentive, the project sponsor and operator will submit 
to the financial agent (NAFIN) an independent verification from accredited senior social 
and environmental specialists confirming that the conditions and recommendations 
included in the guidelines and specifications have been implemented and that the project 
complies with both Mexican and Bankís policies andregulations.  
 
On an annual basis, the project sponsor and operator will prepare a report describing the 
evolution of activities as indicated in the program of activities. An independent 
accredited specialist will have to produce a letter confirming that the project sponsor and 
operator is complying with all pre-established social and environmental conditions as 
well as Bank and national policies, laws and regulations. 
 
For La Venta III (Phase I) and also for the introduction of subsequent projects (Phase 
II), a manual including a set of guidelines has been created to ensure compliance with 
Bankís social and environmental safeguard policies: ìGuias y Especificaciones para la 
Evaluacion Socio-Ambiental Proyecto PERGEî (included in theProject Files). 
 
For independent power production, the guidelines and specifications will be added as an 
annex to the bidding documents. To qualify for the green incentive, the winner to the bid 
will have to agree and comply with both the Mexican and Bankís social and 
environmental safeguard policies. 
 
The Secretar√° de Energ√≠a (SENER) will be in charge of verifying compliance, 
satisfactory to the Bank, with local and Bankís social and environmental safeguards. 
 
As specified in the guidelines and specifications, the beneficiary - either CFE or the 
independent power producer - will conduct the necessary assessments and consultations 
including a verification that confirms compliance with Bankís social and environmental 
safeguards. SENER will request the confirmation by an independent party or consultant 
that the specific project complies with these policies. 
 
Institutional Capacity Assessment for Safeguard Compliance 
 
Independent Power Production: For IPP projects, as explained before, the private 
company (winner of the bid) will have to comply with local and Bankís policiesas 
established in the manual and guidelines included in the bidding package. As explained 
Page  9
before, an independent party will have to confirm compliance with national and Bankís 
safeguard policies. 
 
Nacional Financiera (NAFIN): It has been assessed that the financial intermediary has 
the capacity to manage the Financial Mechanism incentive and to disburse it against pre-
defined conditions. One of such conditions, as indicated before, is to comply with 
national, local and Bankís social and environmental policies. Although NAFIN will not 
be in charge of reviewing environmental or social impact assessments, it will have the 
responsibility of ensuring that a qualified independent party engaged by SENER confirms 
projectís compliance with social and environmental safeguards. NAFIN is qualified to 
undertake this duty. 
 
The Mexican environmental and social legal and regulatory frameworks are 
sophisticated and solid.  Mexico is also a signatory of all major international treaties and 
convention including the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention 169 (1989) of the 
International Labor Organization. 
 
In addition, SEMARNAT, SEDESOL and CDI are strong institutions with a good track 
record of consistent oversight and solid performance. Yet, national monitoring and 
evaluation activities at the State and local levels may need strengthening. The Project will 
therefore ensure that both social and environmental management plans are well 
implemented and compensation schemes honored. This will require a periodic 
independent verification (as established in the Manual, available in the Project files).   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are: 
 
ï
Municipalities and their associations  
 
ï
Community based organizations (ejidos) and local civil society organizations 
 
The social assessment and consultation for La Venta II demonstrated the capacity of 
CFE to conduct and resolve in a participatory manner a formal process to reach the Ejido 
agreement and a compensation scheme. Yet, CFE has to develop, report and disclose a 
formal indigenous people plan or planning framework in accordance with the 
recommendations established in OP 4.10. 
 
No social consultation has taken place in relation to the construction and operation of La 
Venta III, as the specific project site within La Venta is yet to be determined. However, 
CFE has already conducted participatory consultation activities in Ejido La Venta for the 
wind based power generating facility La Venta II. The consultation process for La Venta 
III is expected to follow the process followed for La Venta II. Below is a description of 
the process followed for La Venta II: 
 
ï
The majority of ejidatarios participated in early meetings with the CFE.  At the 
beginning of the dialogue, the ejidatarios had little interest in the project, due to the 
existence of private sponsors in the region that promoted wind energy installation in 
communal lands and promised very attractive (and potentially speculative) rents for land 
use. During the initial negotiations with CFE the ejidatarios were requesting free 
Page  10
electricity service, cleaning of a nearby river, schools rehabilitation, water drainage 
works, and paved streets.   
 
ï
In 2002, in response to the concerns of community leaders and members 
regarding the lack of information on wind energy project developments, the State 
Government of Oaxaca, through the Secretariat of Industrial and Commercial 
Development (SEDIC) requested support from USAID to conduct a study on wind 
energy.  The study would provide ejidos and others communities in the Isthmus of 
Tehuantepec region with information on the typical magnitude of payments, structure of 
agreements, and means of verifying actual generation or power sales revenues, and types 
of contracts typically used in the US and elsewhere between wind power projects 
developers and landowners.  The study has been prepared for USAID Mexico and the 
State Government of Oaxaca and SEDIC by Winrock International, Global Energy 
Concepts, the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), and the Mexican Rural 
Development Foundation (FMDR) ñ see Annex 17. 
 
ï
CFE continued negotiations with land owners and ejidatarios, for the rights to 
construct the plant on the basis of international practices.  As a result of these 
negotiations, ejidatarios will receive payments for the energy generated and invoiced by 
the wind plant --in line with international practices. It should be noted that ejidatarios will 
receive the compensation from the energy plant and will also be able to continue with the 
farming activities in their land. 
 
ï
The project will benefit directly the ejidatarios that own land in the projectís zone 
of influence and indirectly all the ejidatarios of La Venta II according to a plan of social 
works negotiated between CFE and the local authorities of the ejido.  The plan includes: 
(i) the creation of a trust fund (created in December 2005 and capitalized with 7 million 
Mexican Pesos) to provide public lighting, paving of the principal streets of the ejido and 
computers for the secondary school; and (ii) the creation of an employment agency that 
would give priority to the ejidatarios in the works during the installation of the wind 
turbines.  The plan will be executed by the authorities of the ejido with the support of 
CFE, the Ministry of Social Development (Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social, SEDESOL) 
and the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development, Fishing and Food (Secretar√≠ade 
Agricultura, Ganader√≠a, Desarrrollo Rural, Pesca y Alimentaci√≥n). 
 
On environmental issues, on April 20th 2006, the Federal Commission of Electricity 
conducted a one day public consultation with relevant stakeholders, bird specialists, 
NGOs and the academia to discuss the characteristics of La Venta III and its potential 
impacts on bird and bat populations. More than 40 people attended the consultation and 
in general terms it has been reported that the event resulted in a constructive dialogue and 
positive conclusions regarding the quality and usefulness of CFEís bird monitoring 
program. CFE had left an open e-mail address for further questions and answers about the 
project.
