2. Project Objectives 
The GEF Projectís overall development objective is to promote rational management of 
Guineaís coastal biodiversity for both conservation and sustainable development ends in 
selected priority areas, with a particular emphasis on assisting communities in and around 
these priority areas to plan, implement and maintain environmentally sustainable and 
socially inclusive alternative livelihoods options.  
 
The GEF Projectís global environmental objective is to promote the conservationof 
globally and nationally significant habitats and species in Guineaís coastalzone in 
selected priority areas encompassing coastal RAMSAR sites.  The GEF Project will work 
with local, national, regional and international partners to promote and implement an 
integrated approach to the conservation and sustainable use of globally important 
biological resources in Guineaís coastal zone.

3. Project Description 
The GEF Project will be associated with the first and second phase of the Village 
Communities Support Program (Programme d'Appui aux Communaut√©s Villageois, 
PACV) and be implemented from 2006-2010.  Start-up of the GEF Project will coincide 
with the last year of the first phase of the PACV, while full implementation (four years) 
would coincide with the second phase (2007-2010).  Selection of initial intervention areas 
has kept into account existing coastal zone coverage of the PACV.  The GEF Project is 
intended to be a catalyst for sustainable natural resource use.  Its results will be fully 
integrated, and scaled up along the entire coastal zone, as part of the third phase of the 
PACV (2011-2014).  
 
The first phase of the PACV has three specific objectives: (i) establish an effective and 
efficient mechanism for transferring public funds to local communities for the financing 
of prioritized rural community infrastructure; (ii) improve the regulatory, institutional, 
and fiscal environment and develop local capacity for decentralized rural development; 
and (iii) rehabilitate and promote regular maintenance of infrastructure and rural roads.  
 
The GEF Project has five closely inter-linked components. Three of these will provide 
incremental support to the PACV.  Two components do not have an equivalent in the 
PACV and go beyond the objectives of the PACV.  In support of its Global 
Environmental Objective, the GEF Project seeks to address identified threats in and 
around the targeted sites in collaboration with other partners and ongoing initiatives 
(Ministry of Planning, Ministry of Fisheries through the National Fisheries Research 
Center (Centre National des Sciences Halieutiques ñ Boussoura;CNSH-B), Ministry of 
Environment, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, and PRCM).  Below follows a 
summary of the five components.  
 
Component 1:  Protection and conservation of coastal RAMSAR sites  
 
This is the first of the two additional components, which does not have an equivalent in 
PACV.  It will have three sub-components:  
 
1.1 
Integrated Coastal Conservation Zone.  This sub-component aims to establish at 
least one integrated coastal conservation zone and develop management plans through 
participatory mechanisms.  Two intervention areas, incorporating wetlands recognized 
under the RAMSAR Convention, will be included (i) Iles Tristao and Ile Alcatraz (two 
separate sites under the RAMSAR convention) and (ii) Rio Pongo.  
 
1.2 
Conservation Zone Management.  This sub-component aims to support the 
implementation of the management plans.  It will also provide the CRDs and local 
communities with the core technical tools and financial support for the establishment and 
management of the coastal conservation zone around Tristao/Alcatraz, including 
restoration.  The scope of this sub-component will depend mostly on the management 
scheme adopted and activities will be site specific.  
 
Page  3
1.3. 
Impact Monitoring and Evaluation.  This sub-component aims to build impact 
monitoring and evaluation capacity for the two identified sites.  Site management 
effectiveness will be measured annually through the adapted WWF-World Bank tracking 
tool for protected areas.  
 
The lead agency for implementing this component will be the CNSH-B for the Iles 
Tristao/Alcatraz site and DNEF for the Rio Pongo site.  Targeted support will be 
provided under this component (operating costs, minimal equipment and transportation).  
 
Component 2:  Enabling environment for integrated coastal zone management  
 
This is the second additional component, which does not have an equivalent in PACV.  
It will have 2 sub-components:  
 
2.1. Institutional strengthening.  Under this sub-component, four sets of activities would 
be supported:  
 
(i) a study to identify options for financial sustainability of the establishment and 
management of coastal conservation zones.  
 
(ii) targeted capacity building of the Office for the Coordination of Strategies and 
Planning (Bureau de Coordination des Strat√©gies, de la Planification et dela 
Prospective, BCSPP) in the area of environmental impact assessment that would enable 
this structure to evaluate the impact of proposed upstream mining and large infrastructure 
activities and be a partner in the development of eventual mitigation activities.  
 
(iii) review of the adequacy of the legal framework related to ICCZ management on the 
basis of existing recommendations.  
 
(iv) basic training and participation in workshops to deepen national understanding of 
different management approaches to integrated coastal zone management.  Targeted 
beneficiaries would be from the various ministries involved in the GEF Project.  
 
The lead agency for implementing this sub-component will be ME.  Targeted support 
will be provided (training, consulting services, minimal equipment and operating costs).  
 
2.2. Coastal Zone Knowledge and Communication.  This sub-component is concerned 
with the existing knowledge, communication and coordination gaps at international, 
national, and local levels identified in the GEF Project's communications strategy.  
 
The lead agency for implementing this sub-component will be MP.  Targeted support 
will be provided (consulting services, study tours, minimal equipment, and operating 
costs).  
 
Component 3:  Local Investment Fund.  
Page  4
Additional resources will be provided as matching grants to communities for activities 
that have an incremental impact on biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource 
use, thereby contributing to local and global benefits.  These activities are presently not 
eligible under the PACV.  Only those activities will be funded that are identified in the 
Local Development Plans (see Component 4).  
 
This component will be managed by the Regional Coordination Unit (Unit√© 
R√©gionale de Coordination, URC) of the PACV in Bok√©. This URC was planned to 
be createdunder the second phase of the PACV.  The GEF Project will finance its first 
year of operation.  
 
Component 4:  Support for Local Capacity Building.  
 
The Local Development Plan (Plan de D√©veloppement Local, PDL) is the agreed 
basis for all development activities at the CRD level and is a key element of 
Government's decentralization policy.  The PDL is developed using participatory 
processes tested by the PACV.  Current PDLs focus primarily on community-based 
infrastructures as this was the limitation of the PACV LIF.  The GEF Project will provide 
additional funding to assist populations of targeted CRDs adapt existing PDLs using a 
more holistic development approach emphasizing sustainable use activities.  The 
specificities of micro and sub-watersheds inside the CRD would serve as geographic 
basis for the planning process.  The PDL for Kanfarand√© was adaptedas part of GEF 
Project preparation.  
 
This component will be managed by the National Directorate for Decentralization 
(Direction Nationale de D√©centralisation, DND) of MATD.  The GEF Project will 
provide incremental support (consulting services, training and study tours, minimal 
equipment, and operating costs).  
 
Component 5:  Program Management, Monitoring and Evaluation  
 
The objective of this component is to ensure cost-effective, efficient and streamlined 
project implementation of the four other components.  The GEF Project would provide 
incremental funding to the operational structures of PACV.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The GEF Project will intervene in up to 17 CRDs in the coastal zone.  Special emphasis 
will be placed on CRDs around selected Ramsar sites and shared watersheds.  In addition, 
geographic contiguity of watershed coverage will be sought with the planned 
Community-Based Land Management Project (PGIE).  As part of project preparation 
three priority RAMSAR sites were identified, Isles Tristao and Alcatraz, and Rio Pongo.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The second phase of the base-
program has a category ëBí rating.  The GEF Project is 
likewise classified as a category B project, and was assigned a safeguard screening factor 
S2.  An environmental assessment was carried out in compliance with OP 4.01 and an 
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Process 
Framework (RPF) were prepared and made publicly available in-country.  The 
environmental assessment and the ESMF were disclosed in-country on December 8, 
2005, and submitted to the Infoshop on the same day.  The RPF was disclosed in-country 
on December 1, 2005 and submitted to the Infoshop on the the same date.  An updated 
RPF was prepared as part of the pre-appraisal mission and disclosed in-country on 
February 17, 2006 and submitted to the Infoshop on March 7, 2006.  An RPF was 
required because some of the protective measures proposed by the project may lead to 
restrictions in accessing part of the natural resources by the local communities.  The RPF 
spells out the participatory tools and procedures that will be used to associate the local 
communities in the process of decision making and in the management of the natural 
resources in the protected areas.  The project will not acquire land or any other land 
related assets, neither through its natural resources protection component nor through the 
micro-projects that it intends to finance to help the communities generate additional 
sources of income.  Hence no Resettlement Policy Framework was deemed necessary to 
prepare.    
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The main issues would be related to social inclusiveness, access to resources, and the 
cumulative effect of micro-projects, that may individually have manageable impacts, but 
cumulatively have significant impacts.  These issues are addressed in the ESMF and the 
RPF.   
 
Page  6
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The design option retained with its explicit link to PACV and international partners has 
the best potential for mainstreaming sustainable natural resource use in local 
development and builds upon the strengths of the different agencies involved and 
addresses weaknesses by incorporating numerous, competent partners/stakeholders.  By 
maximizing stakeholder participation in project management, ownership will be 
expanded and increases the probability that its goals will be achieved within the proposed 
time frame.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The procedures laid out in the environmental management plan will apply to micro-
projects funded through the GEF Project.  In addition, capacity building was carried out 
as part of project implementation to ensure that procedures will be consistently applied.  
 
The National Coordination Unit (NCU), established at the Ministry of Planning is 
responsible for ensuring that micro-projects are demand-driven, socially inclusive and 
environmentally sustainable, and can be properly operated and maintained.  The NCU has 
prepared an annual work program of approved local development plans.  Micro-projects 
that are likely to have negative environmental and/or social impact are identified and go 
through an evaluation based on procedures detailed in the Project Implementation 
Manual. These assessments are carried out by national consultants. The NCU is 
satisfactorily staffed and will have an environmental specialist before start-up of micro-
project financing.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Local community involvement is critical for the success of the project and the 
establishment and management of an integrated coastal conservation zone.  Activities 
during preparation included local diagnostic and stakeholder mapping, surveys, broad-
based information workshops and communication sessions.  Project start-up activities 
would include training, field visits, village/community meetings and workshops at the 
project target sites.  Project impact studies will retain social indicators, which have been 
developed with participation of local communities and were already used for the baseline 
study, which was carried out as part of GEF Project preparation.  
 
A
broader and site-specific (Tristao) stakeholder assessment was carried out as part of 
preparation.  In addition to the communication and environmental and social assessment 
studies it provides a detailed roadmap to include the various community groups and in 
particular the most vulnerable ones.  The recommendations of the assessment were used 
to define the consultation and disclosure requirements of the RPF.
