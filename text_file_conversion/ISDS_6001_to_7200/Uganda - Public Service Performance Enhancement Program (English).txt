government's public service reform program (PSRP) through a sector-wide approach 
program (SWAp).  The second component fosters performance enhancement initiatives 
on a demand-driven basis supported by a performance enhancement fund (PEF).Key 
areas to be supported by the latter would include but not be limited to procurement, 
financial sector and statistics.

National Records and Archives Centre. The site for this National Records and Archives 
Centre has been identified, and a site specific Environmental Impact Assessment(EIA) 
has been prepared and disclosed both to Government and the World Bank. The World 
Bank through ASPEN and the Government through the National Environmental 
Management Authority(NEMA) have approved the site specific EIA. This will be 
implemented by the construction firm under the supervision of NEMA and the World 
Bank. In addition a total of 7 house holds at the site will have to be re-located.  To 
support this process an abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared and 
submitted to the Government and the World Bank for comments. This will be reviewed, 
approved and disclosed in the country and at the Info shop. Recommendations there in 
will be implemented prior to commencement of construction.

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The construction of a National Records and Archives Centre will lead to minor road 
diversions, noise and dust polution and this is be mitigated by measures described in the 
site specific EIA which has been specifically prepared by Government and reviewed and 
approved by the World Bank's Safeguard Unit and Government's National Environmental 
Managament Authority. This has been disclosed in the country and at the World Bank 's 
Infoshop in Washington.

Page  3
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
To support the construction of a National Record and Archives centre under the project 
the Government has through the Ministry of Public Service developed the site specific 
Environmental Impact Assesment(EIA)with very clear recomendations on how exactly to 
mitigate these impacts. The site specific EIA has been reviewed,commented on and 
approved by the Bank and the Borrower and disclosed in country and at the Bank's Info 
shop.  
 
Some seven households will be affected by the development activity,the Bank's 
safeguard policy on Involuntary Ressettlement OP 4.12 has been triggered and as such an 
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared by the Borrower, and submitted 
to the Bank and Government. The accepted first draft of the abbreviated RAP was 
disclosed in country before appraisal, and the final accepted RAP has been reviewed and 
approved by the Bank. This will be disclosed both in the infoshop and the Government.  
 
The borrower has taken the initiative to further disseminate the EIA to all regulatory 
agencies in the City of Kampala where construction is to take place to ensure 
appreciation  and monitoring of mitigation factors proposed. In addition the EIA notice of 
availability of the EIA has been placed in the key news papers and location of access 
highlighted.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key stakehoders include Ministry of Public Service and the memebers of the seven 
households.  
 
The affected families under the 7 households have been consulted prior to the 
preparation of the RAP and duly informed of proposed activities as well as the measures 
to be taken to minimize the potential negative impacts. A joint Mission by the Bank's 
project team  and the Borrower carried out the consultation in accordance with the policy 
requirements. A provision has been made within the abbreviated RAP to allow for the 
affected 7 households to seek redress to the Uganda law where grievances arise.Other key 
stakeholders include the Government of Uganda, which through the NEMA has approved 
the site specific EIA and the abbreviated RAP.
