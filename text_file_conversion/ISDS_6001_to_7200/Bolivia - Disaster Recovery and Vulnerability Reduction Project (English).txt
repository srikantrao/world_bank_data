2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is to assist implementation of the current emergency recovery 
program under the Sustainable Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Plan (PRRES) and 
assist with advancing the institutionalization of risk management and recovery activities 
in preparation for and prevention of future disaster events.  
 
This objective will be achieved through: a) strategic planning for sustainable 
reconstruction and vulnerability reduction, including incorporation of risk management 
into public investment; b) construction of the works identified and validated in the 
PRRES; and c) institutional strengthening of the National System for Risk Management.  
 
At project completion, the following will have been achieved: a) implementation of the 
small works projects prioritized in the PRRES; b) development of a long-term strategy 
for the implementation of rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in future disasters; 
c) increased capacity for disaster response, reconstruction, and prevention at the national, 
local, and sector levels.

3. Project Description 
The project is divided into 3 components:  
 
ï
Component 1: Strategic Planning for Sustainable Reconstruction  US$830,000  
 
ï
Component 2: PRRES Implementation  US$8,000,000  
 
ï
Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (at National, Regional, Local, Sectoral 
levels  US$1,173,200  
 
These components are designed to provide assistance with the current emergency 
recovery program under Sustainable Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Plan (PRRES) 
and assist with advancing the institutionalization of risk management and recovery 
activities in preparation for future disaster events.  Components were prepared based on 
the needs for the current situation and are complementary to the current UNDP program 
for institutional strengthening in disaster risk reduction.A detailed description of the 
project components is presented in Annex 1.  
 
Component 1: 
Strategic Planning for Sustainable Reconstruction - US$830,000  
 
Under this component, activities will be focused on the development of plans, strategies 
and institutional norms relating to reconstruction/rehabilitation and risk mitigation for 
works executed in response to adverse natural events.  These efforts will initially focus 
on those activities required to implement the present reconstruction activities to be 
executed under PRRES and develop a long-term strategy for the implementation of 
reconstruction activities in future disasters.  Efforts will include the development of 
norms, legislation, and information systems required to support disaster recovery 
operations and will support the development of a risk management fund (FORADE).  
This component is divided into 5 sub-components.  
 
1.1 
Institutional Implementation Support for disaster reconstruction and rehabilitation 
under PRRES.  VPEP ( Vice minister of Multi-Annual Strategic Planning)  
 
1.2
Incorporation of Risk Management in the Territorial Planning Processes  
 
1.3
(VIPFE) Incorporation of Risk Management in Public Investments  
 
1.4
VPEP  Development support for (SNID- National Information System)  
 
1.5
(VPEP) Design of a National Financial Protection Strategy and Risk Management 
Fund (FORADE)  
 
Component 2: 
PRRES Implementation - Plan for Sustainable Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction (Plan de Rehabilitacion y Reconctruccion Sustenible) Rehabilitation and 
Reconstruction works for the 2006-2007 El Nino  US$8,000,000  
 
A
series of rehabilitation/reconstruction works will be undertaken in an effort to restore 
damaged infrastructure.  Such reconstruction works will only be financed in specific 
areas determined to have been particularly affected by El Ni√±o.The average cost of the 
small works is estimated to be less than US$100,000 with numerous works identified 
costing less than US$20,000.  
Page  3
Activities to be financed include rehabilitation of flood damaged infrastructure and 
restoration of productive capacity. Rehabilitation of damaged flood infrastructure would 
involve investments, inter alia, in the following: potable water systems; sewage systems 
and ground wells, bridge and road repairs Restoration of productive capacity would 
involve investments, inter alia, in the following; risk reduction systems, water intakes, 
small earthen dams, riverbanks, filtration galleries and the related activities.  
 
Physical works under this component have been identified by local communities and 
submitted by Municipalities, Perfecturas and related sectoral agencies. There are 3 sub-
components including:  
 
2.1  
Execution of Rehabilitation Works  
 
2.2
Execution of Reconstruction Works  
 
2.3
Accompanying Technical Supervision for the Execution of the Works  
 
Component 3: Institutional Strengthening (at National, Regional, Local, Sectoral levels  
US$1,173,200  
 
As an initial approach to the long-term integration of improved procedures and 
mechanisms for disaster reconstruction/rehabilitation, this component will build on the 
experiences of the current reconstruction program to improve recovery operations.  
Divided into 4 sub-components these activities are designed to formalize the recovery 
operation model and integrate associated sectors in a structured recovery framework for 
use in future disaster situations.  Sub-components include:  
 
3.1    Strengthening of National Risk Management System through Implementation of 
Component 1 Recommendations  
 
3.2
Strengthening of Risk Management in Sectors  
 
3.3
Strengthening of the System at a Decentralized/Territorial Level  
 
3.4
(VPEP) Project Administration and Management Support   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Disaster recovery and vulnerability reduction works will be implemented throughout 
Bolivia, with particular emphasis on those areas most affected by events caused by the 
recent El Ni√±o phenomenon.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Involuntary resettlement  
 
No involuntary resettlement is planned under this project and no such plan exists within 
any of the competent ministry of the Government of Bolivia.  During the execution of the 
project, the theme will be explored in concept as a risk reduction strategy.  
 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)  
 
Numerous small works will be carried out under the project.  Individual works will be 
implemented in locations throughout the country.   During the preparation of the project, 
individual works will be identified, scoped and evaluated for potential environmental 
impacts.  It is expected that most if not all small works activities will likely be classified 
as category C for environmental purposes as they will entail the repair or reconstruction 
of existing infrastructure damaged or rendered useless as a result of the disaster events.  
In this case an environmental compliance program will be developed and included in the 
project operations manual including the use and enforcement of environmental protection 
contract clauses to be executed during the construction of the works.  As the project is 
evaluated, an environmental assessment and environmental management plan will be 
developed and submitted in accordance with Bank policies in conjunction with the 
project preparation process.  Should additional environmental requirements be identified, 
these will be addressed in the EA and included in the EMP.  
 
Anticipated Environmental Impacts  
 
Physical works under this component have been identified by local communities and 
submitted by Municipalities, Perfecturas and related sectoral agencies. A preliminary list 
of pre-identified works has been provided by the FPS from the PRRES execution plan. 
On initial review, all projects proposed appear to be category C under Environmental 
Assessment (OP/BP 4.01).  
 
The works contemplated under this project are of small scale or fall under the category 
of technical assistance.  Specifically:  
Page  5
ï
Works will not occur in protected areas.  
 
ï
Works will not include any new constructions or amplification of infrastructure 
such as treatment plants, water intakes or transportation facilities.  
 
ï
Works are designed to rehabilitate and strengthen damaged infrastructure or 
agricultural production facilities.  
 
ï
Works will occur only in existing areas of production.  
 
ï
Works are small scale in nature.  
 
ï
No relocations will occur as a result of the project and none are planned in the 
project areas by any competent Bolivian Government Ministry.  
 
Environmental assessment process for small works  
 
Under this project, environmental assessment will be conducted jointly between the 
Bank and FPD and Ministry of Planning.  Each works project will be reviewed as final 
works descriptions are prepared and as necessary site visits will be conducted to verify 
conditions.  Given the emergency nature of the project, Bank supervision will be more 
intensive than typical Bank projects and the project team will participate jointly with 
Ministry of Planning in insuring Bank requirements are met.  
 
Screening  
 
An initial screening has been conducted for the projects currently identified and all 
appear to well within the threshold of Category C.  As more detailed works descriptions 
are completed, the supervision team will conduct a mission to verify the scope and 
impact of works.  Site visits will be conducted as necessary to verify local conditions and 
scope of works.  As there are three basic categories of works, the team will prepare an 
environmental review of the works proposed, by category and determine environmental 
contract requirements as presented in the operations manual.  
 
In the highly unlikely event that exceptions are identified which might promote an 
activity to category B, a separate environmental assessment will be prepared for the 
works identified.  Environmental Assessment will be conducted to comply with Bank 
policy and Bolivian national law to determine the type and nature of impacts anticipated.  
This will include an environmental management plan for the specific activity together 
with required public consultation processes.  Given the requirements of the EA process 
and the urgent nature of the works, the decision will be left to the Bolivian government as 
to whether to pursue the process or remove works from further consideration.  
 
If during the life of the project, works meeting Category A criteria are proposed, they 
will be rejected and not included in the program.  
 
Bolivian Law  
 
Under Ley Ambiental 1333, a ficha ambiental may be required for the works included in 
the program.  In addition to Bank screening and oversite, the Ministry of Planning will be 
responsible for processing works under this process and obtaining the Ficha Ambiental (if 
required).  Apart from fulfilling the requirements of national law, this process adds an 
Page  6
additional layer of oversight to the environmental compliance process.  No works will 
proceed without compliance with this process.  
 
Environmental Supervision and Vigilance  
 
Environmental supervision will be conducted by both the Bank project management 
team and the Bolivian Government.  The Bank supervision team will works closely with 
Ministry of Planning and Ministry during the works identification, engineering and 
design phases of the work cycle.  During these phases, environmental classifications will 
be determined and contract requirements will be identified.  The Bank team will ensure 
that appropriate environmental control measures are applied to the specific works prior to 
the issuing of contracts.  
 
During the Execution of works, the environmental officer of the Perfectura together 
with Ministry of Planning will conduct environmental inspections and oversight to ensure 
contract compliance.  The bank supervision team will make spot inspections as needed to 
ensure the process is being enforced.  Acceptance of completed works will be managed 
by the Ministry of Planning with the municipalities.This will be forwarded to the bank in 
the form of an acceptance report together with a certification of environmental 
compliance for Bank review.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10)  
 
Socially the projects impacts are wholly positive and while 67% of the general 
population can be classified as indigenous, those persons living within the project area 
will benefit equally from the project.  As the works program is focused on rehabilitation 
and reconstruction, no new infrastructure or significant expansion of existing 
infrastructure will be undertaken.  As part of the screening process for individual 
projects, specific construction activities will be reviewed to assure that apart from 
restoration of service and risk reduction design, no other changes from the original 
function will be included in specific works.   Where works are to occur on lands 
designated as indigenous, meetings will be held with the competent indigenous 
authorities to assure that specific works proposed comply with the desires of the affected 
community.  
 
In the unlikely event that works are identified which result in a significant change in 
function or may result in significant social impacts, a social assessment will be prepared 
in accordance with Bank requirements.  
 
Physical Cultural Resources  
 
The project is not expected to have any negative impact on movable or immovable 
objects, sites, structures, groups of structures, natural features or landscapes with 
archeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, religious, aesthetic, or other 
cultural significance.  It would be very unlikely that any project activity will have any 
negative impact on physical cultural resources.  Nevertheless, if during the execution of 
the activities, any material is discovered onsite which may be considered of historical or 
cultural interest, such as evidence of prior settlements, native or historical activities, 
evidence of any existence on a site which may be of cultural significance, all work shall 
Page  7
stop and the supervising contracting officer shall be notified immediately, in addition to 
the National Anthropology Directorate in the Vice-
ministry for Culture (Direcci√≥n 
Nacional de Antropolog√≠a, Viceministerio de Cultura).  The area in which the material 
was discovered shall be marked and the evidence preserved for examination.  No work 
shall resume after evaluation by these entities.  
 
SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN  
 
During the appraisal mission, an Environmental Management Plan was developed in 
collaboration with the Government.  While the environmental impacts are expected to be 
limited to the site and duration of the small works contemplated under component 2, the 
final set of works has yet to be agreed upon.   Once the environmental assessment is 
completed, a set of contract clauses will be selected for inclusion in the operational 
manual to be attached to small works contracts where environmental impacts are 
identified as category C.  In the unlikely event that works include activities with 
environmental classifications of category B, an individual environmental assessment for 
that project element will be conducted and an environmental management plan will be 
prepared.  Other provisions relating to appropriate safeguards will be included as needed.  
 
The social assessment will be carried out in two phases.  The first stage was completed 
during the pre-appraisal mission prior to Board approval in order to develop a benefit-
sharing strategy reflecting stakeholder interests and participation, risk analysis and 
communication strategy - though without primary or secondary data collection.  Given 
that no substantial negative social impacts are expected to result from the small works, 
the second phase will be undertaken by the Government as an activity under Component 
3
of
the project.  As part of a long-term risk reduction strategy, an institutional analysis 
will be conducted to identify where linkages exist between risk reduction and national 
planning.  During the institutional analysis, the concept of population relocation will be 
explored as a risk reduction strategy with the various entities identified and assistance 
will given toward the development of this concept.  A social assessment involving data 
collection and analysis and consultations with key stakeholders will provide the Vice-
Ministry of Territorial planning with the tools necessary to begin to study long term land-
use policy, including the resettlement of communities highly vulnerable to adverse 
natural events.  
 
The policy for emergency response, OP 8.00, provides that emergency operations are 
subject to accelerated, consolidated, and simplified procedures and streamlined ex-ante 
requirements.  As such, the supervision process regarding procedures such as safeguards 
is strengthened.  The social and environmental specialists currently working with the 
team will be closely monitoring these procedures and evaluating these processes during 
supervision.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The works program is focused on rehabilitation and reconstruction; no new infrastructure 
or significant expansion of existing infrastructure will be undertaken.   
 
Page  8
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
n/a   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Given the identified deficiencies of the central and local governments in operationalizing 
their recently installed legal framework governing disaster response and mitigation, a 
critical goal of the project will be to strengthen the implementation capacity of the 
agencies involved.  Government capacity to supervise and implement the necessary 
safeguard policies will be evaluated during the supervision process and will be 
strengthened if required in order to meet Bank standards.  FPS, the implementing agency 
for the small mitigation works, has been implementing Bank projects for over 5 years and 
has substantial experience with the Ban
kís procedures.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
As described above, communities and social organizations submitted their project 
proposals to their respective municipalities and local governments, which in turn 
submitted them to FPS.  In its evaluation, FPS is screening the proposals to ensure that 
they have undergone proper consultation process.
