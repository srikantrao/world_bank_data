                                                                                                  Public    into two phases by necessity, rather than by design. It is not an Adaptable Program
                                                                                                            Credit. Due to less than expected financing under IDA 13, the Bank in 2005 could
                                                                                                            finance only a part of its intended contribution to the overall emergency program. It was
                                                                                                            therefore decided to split the operation into two phases, with the second phase to be

financed under IDA 14. In response to feedback from the Bank's Board during
discussions of EMRP 1, the second phase has been simplified and the size of the credit
reduced. Unlike phase 1, phase 2 will support only reconstruction or rehabilitation of
critical infrastructure and of feeder roads. It will not support health, education, or
agriculture (except for feeder roads), areas that were supported in EMRP 1. Measures to
strengthen governance of both project management and of general government operations
have been added to EMRP 2.

 EMRP 1 is supporting activities that address the most urgent needs and can be
implemented quickly. These include (a) activities to restart agriculture (particularly
production and multiplication of seeds and planting material); (b) provision of essential
drugs, logistical support, and refresher courses for nurses and auxiliary nurses to improve
health services; (c) provision of teaching and learning materials and assistance to initiate
teachers'training; and (d) support to restore water services in Luanda and in three
provincial capitals. It is also supporting (a) technical assistance and capacity building for
sector ministries and agencies involved in implementing the project to build local
capacity for decentralization, (b) initial training programs, and (c) preparation of the
environmental and social impact assessment for the overall project, and the social and
environmental management plan for phase 1 activities. Finally, it is financing the
management, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of phase 1 and
engineering studies (detailed design, tender documents) and preparatory activities for
phase 2 investments.

 EMRP 2 will build on the activities of EMRP 1 and focus on upgrading infrastructure,
supporting rehabilitation or construction of feeder roads, trunk roads (including bridges),
electricity services, rural water supply, water supply in a provincial capital, and urban
infrastructure. It will also support the preparation of the medium-term sector strategies,
capacity building, decentralization and local development, and continue support for
program and project management.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will support operations primarily in six of Angola's most war-affected
provinces, as agreed between the Bank and the government. These are Bie, Moxico,
Kuanza Norte, Luanda, Uige and Malange. In addition to being among those most
affected by the war, these provinces have also received much less public resources than
others. They are home to about 58 percent of Angola's population and are expected to
receive some 30 percent of the internally displaced people returning home.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
EMRP phase 1, which was processed under OP 8.50, was approved by the Board on
February 17, 2005 and became effective on May 12, 2005. All individual environmental
and social impact assessments, environmental management plans, pest management
plans, and resettlement action plans for the major construction activities of EMRP 1 and
2 were expected to be completed within one year following effectiveness of EMRP 1.
However, given uncertainties regarding activities to be supported under EMRP 2, the
environmental and social impact assessments were put on hold by the government. The
government did not want to proceed with this activity until activities to be covered under
phase 2 were assured, since most of the major investments that the environmental and
social assessment must address will take place under phase 2 financing.

 The vast majority of environmental and social issues will arise only in the context of
EMRP 2, as EMRP 1 has focused largely on improving delivery of education, health, and
agriculture services, rehabilitation of water services in Luanda and three provincial
capitals, and on preparations for the infrastructure investments yet to be implemented
under EMRP 2. Two out of the three urban water rehabilitation contracts were awarded
within the last year, and the third will only be awarded once phase 2 is approved.

 As an emergency recovery operation, the proposed Emergency Multi-sectoral Recovery
Project (EMRP) is processed under World Bank Operation Policy (OP) 8.50. As such, it
is not required to have project safeguard instruments approved and disclosed in-country
and at the InfoShop prior to appraisal. Due to the multisector nature of the project, and
because all the environmental and social impact characteristics of subprojects are not yet
known in sufficient detail, a programmatic process or a strategic approach for
environmental and social assessment (including screening and categorization,
preparation, public consultation, disclosure, review, approval and monitoring) will be put
into place and implemented over the three year life of the project. In addition, a
resettlement policy framework will be prepared, addressing the policy, principles,
institutional arrangements and procedures that the Borrower will follow in each

subproject involving resettlement or loss of economic activities, and disclosed separately.
Given uncertainties regarding the location of some of the activities, and the complexity of
Angola's environmental and social situation, this approach is designed to ensure that the
selection, design and implementation of all activities comply with World Bank safeguard
policies. All individual environmental and social impact assessments, environmental
management plans, pest management plans, and resettlement action plans for the various
subprojects are expected to be completed within one year of Phase 2 effectiveness.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
None

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The project is an emergency operation, processed under OP 8.50, as a Bank's contribution
to the country's reconstruction effort after nearly three decades of civil war.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Capacity in Angola for environmental and social management is currently weak.
Therefore, it is anticipated that an environmental consulting firm will be engaged for a
period of three years to manage and oversee the environmental and social management
process, while providing institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services
throughout the project period. This firm will work closely with the Ministry of Planning
and its PMIU, the ministries and agencies concerned, and the Bank to develop procedures
that will improve quality and sustainability of activities through compliance with World
Bank Safeguard Policies.

 The environmental consulting firm will be engaged for an initial period of three years to
manage and oversee the environmental and social aspects of the overall EMRP (1 and 2).
The firm will also provide institutional strengthening and on-the-job training services to
the various ministries and national entities involved. The firm will help to build the
capacity of the Secretary of Environment Estate, of the line ministries, and of the other
entities participating in the project to manage environmental issues relating to project
activities. The firm will also work with the government to screen all infrastructure
investments of both phases of EMRP for environmental and social impacts and ensure
that measures are identified to prevent or mitigate potential adverse affects.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The environmental consulting firm that would carry out the preparation ESIA/EMP and
assist in implementing the EMPs has already been selected under Phase 1 and the Bank
issued a no-objection in April 2007 to negotiate its contract. The delays in recruiting the
firm were mainly due to uncertainty in presentation of Phase 2 to the Bank's Board. Now
that these uncertainties have been removed, we expect the contract to be signed very
soon. The work of the firm will cover Phase 1 and Phase 2 activities. All safeguards

instruments are expected to be completed within 12 months after effectiveness of Phase 2
including stakeholder consultations. No activities already carried out under Phase 1 have
any environmental or social impacts.
