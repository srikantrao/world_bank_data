B. Project Objectives
The proposed GPOHrl project aims to assist the New Referral I lospital Public Private Partnership
(PPP) to: (i) increase the access, range and quality of healthcare scnrices; (ii) increase the value of
spending for these scn~ices;:md, (iii) levcragc private sector expertise in the management and
operation of medical faches to introduce more up-to-date management, clinical procedures and
equipment in Lesotho's healthcare sector. 'I'he GPOHA subsidy will allow: (i) more patients to be
seen at a higher level of service at the filter clinics;and, (ii) more patients to be seen at the new
            -
hospital, also at a higher level of servlce.


C. Project Description
The project will assist in the design and implementation of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) for
the replacement of Queen I'lizabeth 11 hospital by a greenfield public hospital operated by a private
partner. The new hospital is estimated to provide a significant increase in the quality,volume and
scope of services for a cost roughly approximating that of the existing hospital. The project dalso
provide assistance to improve and operate two filter clinics associated to the hospital. The project
proposes that the Global Partnership on Output--Based;lid (C;I-'OHX) contribute part of the
funding for the Hospital PPP. 'The payments anticipated under the proposed performance based

grant, would be tled to dehr-en of sctl-~ccsand would pro\-~dca 1-olumeand sen-lce quahty based
