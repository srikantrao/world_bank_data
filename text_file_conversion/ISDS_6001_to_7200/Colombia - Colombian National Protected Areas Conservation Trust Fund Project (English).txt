2. Project Objectives 
The Project Development Objective is to support the consolidation of the Colombian 
National Protected Areas System (NPAS) by launching a Conservation Trust Fund 
(Fundacion Fondo de Apoyo a la Biodiversidad y las Areas Protegidas, or FUNBAP).  
The Global Environmental Objective of this Project is to arrest and reverse trends in 
biodiversity loss in Colombia's globally important ecosystems.   
 
3. Project Description 
FUNBAP is being designed to contain a mixed composition of endowment and sinking 
accounts.  While the endowment will seek long-term financial sustainability for the 
National Protected Areas System, the sinking account will channel direct investments in 
the consolidation of selected Protected Areas (PA) and rural productive landscapes as 
part of enlarged Conservation Mosaics (CM). The endowment account will finance the 
recurrent costs of at least three core areas within selected Conservation Mosaics.  
 
Page  2
Total Project cost is US$42.4 million. The Project will have three components: (i) 
Capitalization and Consolidation of CTF; (ii) Conservation Mosaics Program, and (iii) 
Project Management and Institutional Coordination.  
 
The objectives of this component are to capitalize the CTF, design and implement a 
financial capitalization strategy, implement fund raising campaigns and economic 
incentive programs (i.e. payments for environmental services, tax exemptions and bio-
commerce), and effectively channel resources to the NPAS by EOP. The Project would 
represent FUNBAP’s start-up phase, and as such would be open to evaluation and 
adjustments in order to seek optimal administrative and execution arrangements. The 
Fund’s design will allow the constitution of additional Sub-Accounts and Steering 
Committees to be managed according to the various donor’s interests and requirements. 
Additionally, this first phase would consolidate administrative and institutional 
mechanisms according to best practices, develop and implement a fundraising strategy, 
and strengthen links within the NPAS.  
 
The objective of Component 2 is to support the consolidation of 14 CMs, to include 
NPs, other PAs, buffer zones and surrounding landscapes. Project areas were selected 
using biological criteria (i.e., global biodiversity importance and increased ecosystem 
representation) and socio-institutional criteria.  Key activities in support of this 
component will include: design and implementation of conservation programs, 
management strategies and sustainable production systems within Conservation Mosaics, 
and provision of support to potential Beneficiaries (including technical assistance and 
training) to assist in the design and identification of Subproject proposals.  
 
The main objectives of Component 3 are improved institutional capacity to support 
NPAS consolidation, Project Management and Dissemination.  This component will 
support the operation of FUNBAP and its various functional units, which will hire and 
train sufficient staff to undertake key project functions, including: (a) activity 
coordination; (b) procurement, disbursement and financial execution; (c) financial reports 
and Project POAs, (d) annual execution reports; (e) design and implement a public 
dissemination campaign; (f) establish regional committees to discuss and apply lessons 
learned during CM application and link to the NPAS consolidation process; (g) 
strengthen the inter-institutional coordination between FUNBAP and UAESPNN in 
support of Project execution, and (h) implement the Project’s M&E system. Long-term 
sustainability of this organizational structure will be supported by charging competitive 
management fees and/or through self-generated returns.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The project will be executed in 14 Conservation Mosaics, to include 19 National Parks 
located in various regions of Colombia and surrounding landscapes and other PA 
categories. The delimitation of Conservation Mosaics and relevant sub-projects will be 
determined by a participatory process with local communities and organizations in each 
project area and the formation of local execution committees, which will define 
Page  3
conservation and sustainable use strategies and submit annual work plans to FUNBAP for 
approval.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
This Project is expected to have a highly positive environmental impact. If implemented 
as planned, the Project would have no significant adverse environmental effects. It would 
also comply with all applicable World Bank safeguard policies, as explained below. 
Detailed procedures and mitigation measures for all Safeguard policies presented below 
are detailed in the Project Operational Manual.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Environmental: application of inadequate agricultural production mechanisms, potential 
introduction of exotic species, ecotourism exceeding ecosystem's carrying capacity, and 
people may be attracted to the area.  
 
Forests: inadequate activities in Protected Areas, indirect impacts on Protected Areas 
from contiguous sustainable production systems, anthropogenic impact from ecotourism, 
and the inadequate use of endangered or otherwise restricted species.  
 
Pest Management: irrational or inadequate use of pesticides in productive landscapes 
within Conservation Mosaics.  
 
Page  4
Cultural Property: traditional agricultural practices could potentially be lost due to the 
adoption of westernized practices, and contact with ecotourists may lead to the loss of 
traditional practices and or cultural relics.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement: restraints on use may be imposed as a result of the 
consolidation of conservation areas and/or sustainable production practices.  
 
Indigenous Peoples: some indigenous peoples may not feel adequately consulted or 
represented by their leaders in the execution of project activities and/or agreements with 
indigenous communities.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Environmental: a screening process will be undertaken by local committees formed in 
Conservation Mosaics in order to identify potential environmental impacts in 
Conservation Mosaics, under the responsibility of FUNBAP. Land tenure systems in 
place and registers of residents in Project as part of the social assessment will prevent any 
influx of population.  
 
Forests: All activities in National Parks will be undertaken under the guidance of 
Management Plans, which develop a set of initiatives aimed at reversing natural resource 
degradation and effectively conserving legally declared Protected Areas.  
 
Pest Management: Development of IPM PLans for any Project investments in 
agriculture requiring pesticides in compliance with Bank policy will ensure that:(a) no 
pesticides on the UN prohibited list will be used; (b) the project would promote 
integrated pest management, and (c) special care will be taken to avoid contamination of 
protected areas by prohibiting aerial spraying, proper disposal of receptacles, and careful 
management to avoid contamination of watersheds. Training in pest management for 
agricultural producers in project areas and FUNBAP supervision will ensure compliance.  
 
Cultural property: detailed procedures for chance finds and other issues relating to 
cultural property are included in the Project Operational Manual.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement: Local execution committees will define project execution 
mechanisms and will design process frameworks, if such practices involve the restraint of 
resource use. FUNBAP will be responsible for coordinating and assisting this process.  
 
Indigenous Peoples: 3 National parks adjoin indigenous resguardos, in such cases 
consultations will be held and agreements sought to consolidate Conservation mosaics, 
only performing project activities if indigenous communities so request and approve of 
these activities.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
UAESPNN, which presides the FUNBAP management board, has supported the Project 
design process and will participate in all Project activities, has ample experience in the 
preparation and implementation of procedures to ensure compliance with Bank Safeguard 
measures. UAESPNN has well developed environmental management procedures and is 
considered to have sufficient capacity to ensure compliance with Bank Safeguard 
Policies. Appropriate support will be provided by safeguard specialists as necessary.  In 
an effort to address the root causes of biodiversity deterioration, UAESPNN adopted a 
Policy of Social Participation in Conservation, 'Parks with the People' in 1999.  The 
policy seeks to develop short, medium andlong-term strategies generating sustainable 
economic and social alternatives and improving the quality of life of inhabitants in 
National Park buffer zones. This strategy has increased communities' commitment to 
protecting PAs and helped curb illicit crop cultivation, inadequate land use, poverty and 
the lack of sustainable economic alternatives. This effort has been undertaken in 
coordination with Regional Autonomous Corporations (CARs), mayor offices, UMATAS 
(agricultural technical training centers), NGOs and over 50 grassroots organizations, with 
support from the Dutch cooperation program, the United Nations World Food Program, 
the USAID and the GEF 'Andes' and 'Colombian Massif' projects.  
 
The principal instrument to implement the 'Parks with the People' policy is the National 
Park Management Plan (MP).  For the first time in 2004, the existing 49 National Parks 
concluded the formulation of their MPs using a standardized template . While the 
template provides a unified framework for the National Parks' System, the format is 
flexible, allowing each National Park to define itsmanagement strategies while taking 
into account its specific biological, social and economic conditions. Likewise, the 
Management Plan for each area is conceived within a broader regional analysis and 
provides elements for implementing conservation and management strategies in each 
Park's surrounding Conservation Mosaic. The MP template contains the following 
outline: i) an assessment of the National Park and its regional context, ii) a zoning 
proposal to support territorial ordering processes, and iii) a strategic action plan for the 
management of the PA and its outlying buffer zone.  
 
The UAESPNN also developed a modified version of the Management Plan template 
for Parks overlapping with traditional ethnic territories and indigenous communities.  In 
such cases, the Management Plan generated by the Park constitutes a working proposal to 
be negotiated with ethnic groups, according to specific procedures outlined in Colombian 
Law.  
 
The consolidation of the National Protected Areas System builds upon the National Park 
Unit's Policy of Social Participation in Conservation (PSPC). While the PSPC has mainly 
worked with National Parks and surrounding territories, the UAESPNN is promoting the 
application of PSPC's principles and participatory methodologies to create a National 
System that integrates, together to the National Parks, other PA categories and 
conservation strategies in productive landscapes, recognizing the crucial role of other 
Page  6
stakeholders for biodiversity conservation (such as CARs, private reserve owners, 
municipalities, as well as ethnic groups and agricultural producers).   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
A
comprehensive participatory process has been undertaken as part of the project 
preparation involving key stakeholders, including: the National Parks System, other PA 
categories and relevant entities, NGOs, grassroots organizations,ethnic communities 
(indigenous and afro-colombian)and agricultural producers.  
 
The Participation Strategy included diverse phases in formulating the Project:  
 
Project Formulation Phase  
 
The activities carried out were directed at building a basic consensus among the key 
social actors and institutions on the national and regional levels, as well as obtaining 
contributions from previous experiences in different areas related with Project objectives.  
To do this, the team, which included four regional facilitators, developed a socialization, 
participation, and discussion process through meetings and workshops with four groups:  
(1) public institutions related with PA management and conservation, (2) national NGOs 
and social organizations, (3) experts on the environment and from the public sector, (4) 
directors and teams from selected National Parks.  
 
The activities these sectors and groups carried out were as follows:  
 
1.
Identification of key stakeholders and institutions on the regional and national 
levels.  
 
2.
Consultations with key stakeholders to discuss the Fund for support of 
Biodiversity and Protected Areas and incorporate their comments and viewpoints within 
the Project.  This included the legal and institutional design of the Fund, priorities for 
financing, and mechanisms for participation and coordination.  In synthesis, the following 
events were carried out:  
 
i. MAVDT and the National Natural Parks Unit:  periodical meetings to draw up 
policies and establish coordination with the National Environmental System (SINA).  
 
ii. Association of Autonomous Regional Corporations (ASOCARS):  Socialization 
anddiscussion meetings to consider relationships, duties, and responsibilities on the local, 
regional, and national levels affected by the Project.  
 
iii. Autonomous Regional Corporations (CAR) and Sustainable Development 
Corporations (CDS):  With the support of the SINA group, four regional workshops were 
held for 34 CDS and CAR:  (1) Amazonia Orinoquia Workshop with 24 participants, 
BogotÃƒÂ¡, 23 and 29 July 2005; (2) Andino Oriental and Magdalena Medio Workshop 
with 20 participants, Bucaramanga, 1 and 2 August 2005; (3) Andino Centro Occidental 
and PaciÂ­fico Workshop with 33 participants, Medellin, 11 and 12 August 2005;(4) 
Mesa SIRAP Caribe and Insular Workshop with 33 participants, Cartagena, 22 August 
2005.  These events allowed identification of perspectives for joint efforts and provided 
preliminary identification of roles on the local and regional levels in order to initiate pilot 
projects for selected conservation sites.  The workshops included the participation of 
Page  7
some territorial entities involved in local and regional conservation and sustainable 
development processes.  
 
iv. Alexander von Humboldt Research Institute:  Socialization meetings for the Project, 
coordination with activities and proposals developed by the Institute (especially as related 
with the GEF Andes Project and the strategy for biocommerce and conservation of rural 
landscapes), and discussion of the Institute's participation in the creation of the Fund.  
 
v.
Directive Committee for the Memorandum of Understanding -MOU (signed by 
MAVDT,UPNN, research institutes, and NGOs): Socialization and discussion meetings 
dealing with relationships with and potential support from the Fund and the Project in the 
development of a Work Plan for Protected Areas and the international responsibilities 
contracted with the COP7.  
 
vi. National Facilitation Committee of the SINAP:  Socialization and discussion 
meetings on the initiative to create the Fund and its role in consolidating the SINAP as 
well as the channels and relationships required by a public environmental policy.  
 
vii. Association of the Colombian Network of Civil Society Reserves:  Socialization, 
discussion, and exchange meetings with the Amplified National Board of Directors 
during the Annual National Assembly regarding relationships between the public and 
private sectors included within the Project, possible contributions from organized social 
groups regarding the conservation of biodiversity, and the eventual benefits derived from 
its implementation.  
 
viii. International NGOs (WWF, TNC, and CI):  Active association beginning with the 
formulation phase of the PDF-B as a result of their participation in a debt exchange 
agreement with the U.S. government (2004).  Their contributions are based on national 
experience and knowledge acquired in projects with different National Parks and with 
social groups, as well as more recent direct participation in support of the construction of 
the Work Plan for Protected Areas stimulated by the Memorandum of Understanding.  
 
ix. Experts in national environmental policy and in the public sector:  Included former 
Cabinet Ministers and Vice Ministers for the Environment, ex-Directors of the Institute 
for Natural Resources (INDERENA) and the National Natural Parks Unit, representatives 
from the private sector with experience in conservation of biodiversity and business 
administration, representatives of the private and public financial sectors, lawyers, and 
biologists.  
 
3.
