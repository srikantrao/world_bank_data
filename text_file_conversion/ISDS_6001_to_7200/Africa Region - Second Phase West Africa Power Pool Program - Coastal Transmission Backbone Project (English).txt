2. Project Objectives 
1. 
The developmental objective of the Coastal Transmission Backbone Project of the 
WAPP APL (WAPP APL 1) is to increase access of national power systems of CÃ´te 
d’Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, Benin and Nigeria (collectively, the WAPP “Zone A” coastal 
states) to more stable and reliable electricity as a means to alleviate power supply deficits 
and/or to reduce their collective vulnerability to drought-induced power supply 
disruptions.  This developmental objective is to be achieved, inter alia, by: (a) 
establishing a robust 330 kV transmission link from the Prestea, Aboadze and Volta 
substations (Ghana) through the Mome Hagou sub-station (Togo) and SakÃ©tÃ© sub-
station (Benin) to the Ikeja West substation near Lagos, Nigeria; and (b) assisting 
transmission system operators of WAPP “Zone A” Coastal States to collectively put in 
place and fully deploy a WAPP Cooperation Agreement (Figure 2), incorporating a 
“Operational Security and Mitigation Plan” for the CTB, by the year 2009.  
 
2.
When fully operational, the CTB Project of the WAPP APL program will 
facilitate reliable cross-border electricity exchanges between WAPP “Zone A” Coastal 
States until at least the year 2020. Furthermore, the major benefits to be derived by the 
WAPP “Zone A” Coastal States from the CTB are reduced transmission losses and 
Page  2
operating costs, reduced dependence on inefficient aging generation and transmission 
facilities, deferred investment in generation capacity expansion due to greater sharing of 
existing generation reserves and increased overall system reliability.   
 
3. Project Description 
3. 
The Coastal Transmission Backbone (CTB) of WAPP involves a multi-year 
commitment of the four TSOs of the WAPP “Zone A” Coastal States to develop the 330 
kV transmission corridor in phases, as follows: Phase 1 comprises CTB segments linking 
(i) the Ikeja West Substation (Nigeria) to the SakÃ©tÃ© sub-station in Benin, and (ii) 
the Aboadze and Volta sub-stations within Ghana. Phase 2 covers the joint CEB/VRA 
development of a critical transmission link between the Volta sub-station (Ghana) and the 
Mome Hagou sub-station (Togo); and (iii) Phase 3 will link the SakÃ©tÃ© sub-station 
(Benin) to the Mome Hagou sub-station (Togo) in order tofacilitate electricity exchanges 
on a much large scale (300-500 MW) between Ghana and Nigeria via the CEB network.  
 
4.
The CTB Project of WAPP also involves coordinated implementation of 
complementary investments and technical assistance. The investments include the 
upgrade/ modernization of the system control centers of CEB and VRA plus 
SCADA/EMS communication capabilities of associated sub-stations in the existing 
transmission networks of CEB and VRA, rehabilitation of key coastal transmission 
facilities of CEB and replacement of obsolete relays and circuit breakers at the 
switchyards of the three hydropower generation stations (Akosombo, Kpong, Nangbeto) 
that interface with the CTB.  The principal technical assistance component is required by 
the TSOs and the WAPP Secretariat to put in place and fully deploy the proposed WAPP 
“Operational Security and Mitigation Plan” for the CTB.  
 
5.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The investment components of WAPP APL 1 (Phase 2) are located in Ghana, Togo and 
Benin and will be implemented by VRA and CEB.  
 
The CEB components of the WAPP APL 1 Phase 2 project consists primarily of 
replacement/refurbishment of equipment and transmission facilities that link the Mome 
Hagou sub-station to the major load centers of Lome (Togo) and Cotonou (Benin) and on 
to Sakete (Benin) to link up with the line into Nigeria, plus the upgrade of the CEB 
System Control Center.  
 
The VRA components of the WAPP APL 1 Phase 2 project consist of the construction 
of 3rd Bulk Supply Point for the Accra/Tema load centers, the replacement/addition of 
existing equipment in the existing network of transmission sub-stations in southern 
Ghana, the upgrade (replacement of obsolete circuit breakers and relays) at existing 
switchyard of the Kpong Generation Station, and the rehabilitation of cranes at the 
Akosombo Generation Station.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Environmental concerns are limited to measures required to avoid adverse impacts of 
construction activities during transmission line upgrading and at existing substations, and 
to attend to any site remediation issues at those sub-stations.  
 
CEB has indicated an intention to settle land-based compensation claims outstanding 
since the construction of the existing 161 kV transmission line some 30 years ago.  Doing 
so is not necessitated by the project, and the project will not fund the settlement of these 
claims.  CEB would also like to clear the right-of-way of current land uses but, since this 
would violate OP 4.12, has undertaken to implement the project without doing so.  The 
construction clauses in the EMP should be sufficient to ensure public health and safety 
during construction.  If it should be determined that there are structures, valuable trees, 
etc. that have to be removed, or land uses terminated, CEB has undertaken to bring these 
situations to IDA’s attention for a determination of what response is needed under 
OP4.12 before any action is taken.  These undertakings by CEB will be documented in 
the Development Credit Agreement.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
None.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Not applicable.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
VRA and CEB have prepared Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) to ensure these 
matters are attended to during project implementation through environmental 
specifications in construction contracts, and technical audits of and remediation work at, 
Page  5
substation sites. Installation of the 3rd Bulk Supply Point for the Accra/Tema load centers 
will not require any land acqui
sition by VRA. VRA’s latest reviews of the Akosombo 
and Kpong dams by an international panel confirm satisfactory performance.  As part of 
the project, VRA will prepare an updated dam safety assessment, including an emergency 
preparedness plan.  CEB may do the same for the Nangbeto dam (to be confirmed at 
appraisal).  Both VRA and CEB have sufficient capacity to implement these EMPs and 
adequately supervise construction activities.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Implementation of the EMPs, especially the construction contract provisions, will ensure 
the health and safety of people living or using land near construction sites, especially 
along the transmission line in Togo and Benin.
