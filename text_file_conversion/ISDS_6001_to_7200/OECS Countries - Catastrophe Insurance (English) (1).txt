B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed project aims to provide the Borrowers with liquidity coverage against natural 
disasters.  
 
It will do so in two ways:  First, it will provide the participating countries with coverage against 
adverse natural events during the project implementation period.  Second, by allowing the four 
OECS countries to participate in the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) it 
will increase the probability of the Facility becoming a viable and sustainable venture. Greater 
participation as a result of the project will lower the overall cost for each participating country, 
thereby benefiting the region as a whole and increasing the sustainability of the instrument.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project will finance the entry fee and three years of insurance premium for 
Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  Annual payments will be 
made directly to the CRIIF.  The credit proceeds will be transferred on an annual basis from the 
Association to the CRIIF at the request of each country?s Ministry of Finance.
