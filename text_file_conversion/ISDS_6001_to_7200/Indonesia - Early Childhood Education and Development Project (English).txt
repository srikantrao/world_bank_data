2. Project Objectives
The development objective of the project is to improve poor children's overall
development and readiness for further education, within a sustainable quality ECED
system.

 To achieve this objective, the project will:

 --     Increase poor communities'capacity to engage in participatory planning that will
result in new or improved ECED services for their children and families (Component 1).
 --     Prepare the foundation for a sustainable ECED system through budgetary
commitments from participating districts, establishment of a national quality assurance
and professional development system, and district capacity building (Component 2)
 --     Ensure continuous improvement of service delivery and system building
throughestablishing effective project management, and monitoring and evaluation
(Component 3).

3. Project Description
COMPONENT 1: Increasing Integrated ECED Service Delivery Through Community-
Driven (non-public) Mechanisms In Targeted Poor Communities. This component will:i)
establish the training program and provide staff development; ii) finance the
preconditioning phase and launching of the competitive grant process; iii)provide block
grants to communities; and iv) recognize model ECED services and using them for
demonstration purposes.

 COMPONENT 2: Developing a Sustainable System for ECED Quality.
 This component will support the Government?s efforts to develop a system to assure
quality of ECED services at the district and village/community levels, both for the
programs supported in this project and more widely.

 COMPONENT 3: Establishing Effective Program Management, Monitoring, and
Evaluation.
 The project management sub component will finance the cost of consultants hired by the
CPICU, transportation, equipment, and other administrative expenses that are incurred
during the implementation period of the project. The monitoring and evaluation
subcomponent will finance the development of a monitoring and supervision system for
ECED programs at village/community and district levels, including those ECED
programs not supported by the project.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will target about 738,000 children ages 0 to 6 and their parents/caretakers
living in approximately 6,000 poor communities located in 3,000 villages within 50 poor
districts. Through CDD mechanisms, each poor community will be eligible to receive a

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
N.A.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
N.A.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N.A.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Indigenous and Vulnerable Peoples: The highly participatory nature of the project and the
selection process of sub-project proposals will ensure that poor and vulnerable groups
(including indigenous peoples) have the same or higher chances of inclusion in project
benefits as others who are better off. An Indigenous Peoples framework has been
developed in accordance with OP4.10 to ensure application of the appropriate safeguard
policies (see PAD Annex 10a)).

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The Indigenous Peoples framework will be detailed in the project manuals and be made
available to the community organizations/district education offices (dinas pendidikan)
preparing proposals. Kecamatan facilitators and other project staff will be trained in the
application of these guidelines. Village Implementation Units and the district-level
selection Committee will be trained in how to apply the safeguards in their selection
process.
