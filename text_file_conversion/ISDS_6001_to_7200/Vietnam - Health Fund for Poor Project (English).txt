B.  Project Objective 
ƒ
Poor individuals and households reduce out-of-pocket spending on health services while 
at least maintaining current use of basic health services by obtaining financial support 
under Decision 139. 
ƒ
Near-poor individuals obtain protection from impoverishing health-care costs by 
obtaining financial support under Decision 139. 
ƒ
MOH/VSS use Decision 139 to create incentives for efficient and equitable service 
delivery by providers, 
e.g.
 by adopting reimbursement criteria that discourage long 
hospital stays. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
1. 
Assistance to the Center
.
This first component would contribute to central funding of 
HCFP, currently estimated at VND 492 billion ($US 32 million). Transfers will rely on updated 
software that would monitor and evaluate the flow of funds.  Some funds would be used to meet 
central government expenses in implementing and making adjustments to enhance the 
sustainability of Decision 139.  For instance, the project would explore allowing poorer 
provinces to receive more than VND 52,500 per beneficiary, and that would require richer 
Page  2
provinces to pay into a national solidarity health fund.  Most provinces would receive some 
central support for their HCFP, and all provinces would be expected to make some payment into 
their fund. The project will also support efforts, including income-related co-payments and 
income-related own contributions, to target limited resources on the poor, and to reach people 
not classified as poor by MOLISA but otherwise eligible.  Project-funded assistance to MOH in 
this regard is proposed at $US 13 million in year 1 of the project, $US 10 million in year 2, and 
$US 7 million in year 3. 
 
2.  
Support for the Provinces
.
This component would assist a limited number of provinces 
facing one or more challenges to the successful implementation of Decision 139, including: 
 
·
Helping poorer provinces finance their VND 17,500 contribution
.
Funding for this is 
projected at US$ 6.1 million per annum in each of the three years of the project.  The 
project would also allocate US$ 3 million to partially subsidize impoverishing health 
expenses for the near-poor. 
 
·
Subsidizing impoverishing health expenses.
 In other provinces, the near-poor could be 
issued VSS coverage, with individual-deductibles set to prevent expenses from pushing 
the insured’s household into poverty.  The project would help agencies in these provinces 
to develop analytical tools, expertise, computer software and policy analyses that will 
allow the opportunities created by a financing-delivery split to be fully exploited and 
risks minimized.   
 
·
Helping provinces in which a separation between financing and delivery will emerge. 
The project would help these provinces find coping mechanisms, including better use of 
hospital capacity.   
 
·
Smoothing the impact of Decision 139 in the hospital sector.
 There are synergies between 
this project and the Mekong project, which would support selective hospital expansion.   
 
3.  
Monitoring and Evaluation
.
Project success depends not only on health spending impacts 
and service utilization by the poor and near-poor, but on changes in the quality and mix of 
services provided in the new incentive environment.  This component would support population-
based surveys, policy-related studies (statistical modeling, qualitative research), specialized and 
mid-term reviews and technical audits; and activities to disseminate and promote utilization of 
results.  The focus would be on using information to refine the implementation of Decision 139. 
 
4.  
Advocacy and Training
.
This component would support efforts to address decision-
makers at different levels and poor households.  It would include efforts to inform eligible 
individuals of their right to a health insurance card, where they can be treated, what benefits are 
included, and, critically, what they can do if they feel these services and benefits are not being 
provided.  Support would also be provided for training, study tours abroad 
etc.
 as necessary.  
 
5.  
Project Management
.
A
PMU will be established within MOH.  Significant involvement 
by VSS and provincial representatives in project consultations and monitoring is also envisaged.  
Page  3
Given the mixed nature of the project, with both investment- and adjustment-type elements (see 
below), a strong PMU will be critical.
