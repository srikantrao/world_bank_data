B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
The proposed project development objective would be to empower individuals, households and
communities in rural areas to plan, implement and manage priority social and economic
investments, through a transparent and participatory approach. To achieve this objective the
project would seek to:
 ? build capacity of beneficiaries and local institutions to effectively identify and implement
their development priorities
 ? finance beneficiary-identified priority investments such as basic social services (e.g.: primary
schools and community health posts) and small-scale infrastructures (e.g.: wells, latrines and
secondary rural roads);
 ? create economic and employment opportunities in targeted communities; and
 ? establish a participatory and effective monitoring and evaluation system

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The project would have both ?soft? and ?hard? outcomes. The ?soft? would include: (i)
improved capacity of - and increase in the number of ? individuals, households and communities
in rural areas empowered to identify their most pressing development needs, make relevant
social and economic investment choices and become responsible and accountable for the
implementation and management of these investments; (ii) greater involvement of local
institutions, such as Government officials, local public administration civil servants and
NGOs/CBOs to work with rural communities in supporting the implementation of community-
identified social and economic investments. In the absence of a functioning local Government
and a legal framework for decentralization, the project will seek to work through existing local
institutions and support rural communities in order to create a demand for greater transparency,
better balance of power, and greater effectiveness of local government, thus planting the seeds
for what could be a launching pad for a decentralization process. Though the specific ?hard?
outcomes will depend on the priorities identified by communities, it is expected that they will
include: (i) increased access of poor rural communities to basic services (e.g, health care and
education) and small infrastructure; and (iii) increased rural economic opportunities and job
creation.

D. Project location (if known)
It is proposed that the project will intervene primarily in rural areas (which account for
essentially all of the country outside of the capital city of Bissau), because of the higher
prevalence of poverty incidence. The project would begin by targeting full coverage of
communities in at least the three regions (out of eight including Bissau) with the highest
percentage of people living with less than 2 dollars per day , namely: Oio, Bafata and
Quinara/Tombali. Depending on identified needs and potential costs during preparation, the
project will likely aim to extend coverage to all communities within six of the country?s eight
regions, excepting only Bissau and the region of Gabu where UNDP is preparing to fund a
similar initiative.

E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
Borrower's capacity will have to be strengthened with technical assistance and support for
operating costs in order to adequately monitor compliance with safeguard policies.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY
Safeguard Policies Triggered                                      Yes         No          TBD
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01)                               X
    The project will finance community determined sub-projects that will not be known until
implementation. Based on a broad environmental assessment during preparation, an
environmental and social management framwork (ESMF) will be prepared during
implementation as per modeles with other CDD projects.
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)                                       X
    The sub-projects are expected to have benign impact on natural habitats. Sub-projects will
have to be approved according to an environmental safeguard check list (positive list). This
check list will be prepared as part of the ESMF during preparation.
