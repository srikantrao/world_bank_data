B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The primary objective of the technical assistance operation is to support the Government of 
Grenada in improving the environment for private sector-led growth. This will be achieved, first, 
through supporting the modernization of key public sector institutions and second, through 
supporting the implementation of an export strategy.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The technical assistance operation from the Bank is also expected to leverage and complement 
significant budget support from the European Union. The Bank TA operation would be in the 
amount of US$3.3 million. In parallel, the EU is proposing to provide approximately 10 million 
euros (US$12 million) of budgetary support. The budgetary support will be disbursed in three 
tranches in part based on the results agreement agreed under the Bank?s operation.  
 
The proposed operation is a multi-dimensional program to support the medium-term strategic 
priorities of the Government. The program will be sequenced over a three year period to reflect 
the country?s limited implementation capacity.
