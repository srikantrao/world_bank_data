II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The proposed project falls under the World Bank environmental category A classification
due to its size, magnitude, and irreversibility of potential environmental impacts. Of the
World Bank ten safeguard policies, only Operation Policy 4.01 on Environmental
Assessment and Operation Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) are
triggered. As such, a full Integrated Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
(IESIA) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were carried out. By virtue of
good practice, an independent Social Assessment (SA) was also carried out. The IESIA,
RPF and SA reports were prepared by an Egyptian Independent Consulting Firm (North
South Consultant Exchange) in collaboration with an international firm (Royal
Haskoning, Netherland BV) according to the Terms of Reference approved by the World
Bank.

 The IESIA addresses the potential environmental and social impacts of the various
project components, and means of mitigating the negative impacts. The IESIA document
presents those impacts in terms of project components, and component phases
(construction/operation). The integration of the various project components, along with
the integration of the environmental and social aspects is also presented. Project
alternatives are evaluated, both at the aggregate and at the component levels. The IESIA
also lays out the necessary institutional arrangements necessary to implement the
mitigation measures set forth in the environmental and social management plan (EMP). A
monitoring plan is also presented to ensure the efficacy of the environmental and social
management plan.

 During the IESIA preparation, the borrower consulted with stakeholders twice. The first
round of consultation took place during the scoping stage of the IESIA and was held on
May 29, 2006. This meeting helped the consultant to define the scope of work, and focus
on the most relevant environmental and social issues, through feedback of the
participating stakeholders. A widely publicized second consultation took place on
August 1, 2006, after the draft IESIA was completed, which was attended by NGOs, local
population, Academics, media, EEAA, and government officials from central and local
government levels.

 In view of OP 4.01's focus on social/environmental integration, and in order to give
explicit attention to social issues, a separate Social Assessment was carried out and the
key findings were integrated into the IESIA. The main purpose of the social assessment is
to provide a participatory framework for gathering, analyzing and incorporating socio-
economic information in planning, implementing and monitoring the ADP. This includes
an analysis of context and social issues with (ii) a participatory process of stakeholder
consultation and involvement to provide (iii) operational guidance on developing project
design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). This has been carried out
through (i) a participation and consultation strategy; (ii) baseline information and a

monitoring strategy (iii) identification of potential adverse impacts and where needed an
action plan to mitigate such impacts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
- Solid Waste generated from different construction activities will be handled according
to the contractor waste management plan. Solid wastes will be disposed of in the official
land fill operated by Onyx. Hazardous waste, if any, will be clearly marked and disposed
of at the Nassereya hazardous waste disposal site located in the Amreya area.

 - Construction Impacts: (for all components including works) could be significant,
however they are only temporary. Typical impacts are those of dust, noise, traffic
congestion, and disturbance to the residents of the area. Good construction practices
would mitigate most of these temporary impacts to acceptable levels. Dangerous
activities in public areas will be controlled to reduce risk to the public, traffic and
warning signs will be placed at construction sites, trenches will be provided by fences, or
railings. The construction contract document will incorporate all requirements to
minimize disturbance from construction activities as stated in Annex 5 of the IESIA
report. It will be monitored by the Environmental Specialist at the PMU to ensure
compliance and implementation of the required provisions by the Contractor.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
An analysis of alternatives was carried out during the IESIA preparation. The no project
alternative would result in the following negative situations:

 - Uncontrolled urban development around the Lake, resulting in increasing the adverse
environmental impacts due to the rising number of squatter settlements in the area with
limited basic services and infrastructure.

 - Squatter settlements will remain without adequate basic infrastructure including water
supply, sewerage and access roads. Severe adverse environmental and health conditions
would increase and impact negatively the public health and economic opportunity for
residents in these areas.

 - Air quality will deteriorate due to the congested critical access roads, and productivity
of the most competitive manufacturing sectors in Alexandria will decline due to increased
trip time from factories to the main transport hubs (Alexandria and El Dekhila ports).

 - Persistence of the 3 major barriers to investment as identified by investors themselves-
namely, i) lengthy business start-up licensing procedures; ii) lack of land and property
registration in industrial areas; and iii) weak management of industrial zones, including a
system of maintenance and operation. Such unfavorable business climate will impact
negatively the overall economic development in Alexandria, reduce new investments
potentially established in Alexandria, including subsequent job creation opportunities,
and further deteriorate the environment conditions in the industrial areas.

 The second alterative assessed the implementation of each project component
separately, and as such has been evaluated on its own merits. It was concluded that this
will not yield the same benefits as the integrated approach suggested under this Project.
For instance, the improvement of the wastewater disposal system will not improve the
water quality in Lake Marriout unless squatter settlements around the Lake are developed
in a sustainable manner to ensure continuous improvement of the Lake environment.
Similarly, the area surrounding the Lake cannot attract private developers unless the land
is serviced and the ambient is improved. In the same token, the overall sustainable
development of Alexandria requires improving the business climate to attract investors
together with providing basic services and infrastructure. Finally, improving the
environment conditions in squatter settlements through provision/rehabilitation of basic
infrastructure would not ensure sustainable development in these areas without
socioeconomic and community development activities. The integrated approach
suggested under the Project was therefore assessed as the most appropriate for Alexandria
given the existing situations and envisaged aggregate impact.

 In addition to such an aggregate level analysis, proposed alternatives for components
involving major works content have also been analyzed, i.e. component 1.1 land
development surrounding Lake Marriout and component 1.2 roads rehabilitation.
Evaluation of alternatives considered investment costs, land requirements, environmental
impacts, social impacts, community needs and local conditions.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Mitigation measures have been identified to ensure that the defined objectives of the
project are achieved whilst preventing and reducing any adverse environmental and
social impacts.

 In addition, pre-tender conferences will be held to brief pre-qualified contractors on the
effective implementation of mitigation measures. All pre-qualified contractors will be
called to a pre-tender conference at which environmental, health and safety issues will be
outlined. The contractors will be briefed on: (i) chance find procedures, (ii) special
procedures to be adopted in the vicinity of sites defined as requiring protection, (iii)
penalties for non-compliance, and (iv) coordination with concerned authorities.

 Liaison arrangements will be established between the public, contractors, and the
Project Management Unit. A procedure will be established to allow the general public to
lodge complaints at the Project Management Unit about excessive disturbance.

 The contractors will provide suitable and reliable equipment for construction, with a
formal maintenance program to ensure efficient operations. All employees of the
contractors and supervising institutions will get suitable training in health, safety and
environment.

 The monitoring of construction activities will have to ensure that mitigation measures of
construction impacts are being implemented properly, while monitoring of operation
activities is to ensure that no unforeseen negative impacts are arising. Monitoring will
comprise supervision of the civil work contractors as well as physical monitoring.

 The EEAA Regional Branch Office (RBO) and the Environmental Management Unit
(EMU) in Alexandria will have the overall responsibility to oversee that adverse impacts
are maintained to acceptable levels and corrective actions are taken when required. A
project monitoring report will be prepared on the effectiveness of the ESMP once every 6
months and will be sent to the World Bank after review and approval of the RBO.

 Since some of the project's physical components are likely to result in land acquisition
and/or resettlement, OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is triggered. A Resettlement
Policy Framework (RPF) is the instrument used, because the nature and extent of land
acquisition/resettlement of the various sub-components are not expected to be known
until final engineering design is made. The policy framework establishes resettlement
objectives and principles, organizational arrangements and funding mechanisms for any
resettlement operation and/or land acquisition that may be necessary during
implementation.

 The institutional arrangement and capacities of the organizations in-charge with the
implementation and management of the proposed project were reviewed with the
intention of providing technical assistance and proposing reinforcement of these
organizations as required.

 Training programs as summarized in the ESMP, will be designed and implemented
with the assistance of local and international experts and will include Supervising
Institutions.

 Technical assistance will be provided to EEAA regional branch office and Alexandria
EMU to set up baseline data on existing environmental conditions and to develop a
quality assurance and a quality monitoring program. These activities will be implemented
in close coordination with the on-going World Bank Egyptian Second Pollution
Abatement Project (EPAP II).

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
During the IESIA preparation, the borrower consulted with stakeholders twice. The first
round of consultation took place during the scoping stage of the IESIA and was held on
May 29, 2006. This meeting helped the consultant to define the scope of work, and focus
on the most relevant environmental and social issues, through feedback of the
participating stakeholders. A widely publicized second consultation took place on August
1, 2006, after the draft IESIA was completed, which was attended by NGOs, local
population, Academics, media, EEAA, and government officials from central and local
government levels.

 In view of OP 4.01's focus on social/environmental integration, and in order to give
explicit attention to social issues, a separate Social Assessment was carried out and the
key findings were integrated into the IESIA. The main purpose of the social assessment is
to provide a participatory framework for gathering, analyzing and incorporating socio-
economic information in planning, implementing and monitoring the ADP. This includes
an analysis of context and social issues with (ii) a participatory process of stakeholder
consultation and involvement to provide (iii) operational guidance on developing project
design, implementation and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). This has been carried out
through (i) a participation and consultation strategy; (ii) baseline information and a
monitoring strategy (iii) identification of potential adverse impacts and where needed an
action plan to mitigate such impacts.
