B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The main development objective of the proposed project (WAGP 
–
Phase II) is to strengthen the 
regional West African Gas Pipeline Authority (WAGPA) and the environmental and other 
technical agencies in each of the countries to ensure that existing and potential end-users of gas 
in Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo and also other West African countries take full advantage 
from availability of relative cheap   and environmentally clean natural gas at prices that are 
justified. End-users would include not only the electric power utilities in the countries (defined in 
the WAGP Agreements as the ‘’Foundation Customers’’), but also the industrial, commercial 
and transportation sectors, particularly public transportation users in urban areas.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project would include the following three main components:  
 
•
A
capacity building/institutional building component for WAGPA (the regional gas 
Authority), for the environmental agencies of Ghana, Benin and Togo, and for the technical 
institutions of Ghana, Benin and Togo responsible for the development and operations of the gas 
Page  2
markets. These institutions include the ministries responsible for energy, commerce, the 
regulatory commissions, relevant technical agencies and companies;  
 
•
A
technical assistance component allowing WAGPA and the member countries access to 
expertise in technical, financial, fiscal, investment incentives, contract and legal matters; and  
 
•
An Information/Communication component to inform the stakeholders and in particular 
potential gas off-takers of the government’s plans and proposals and to obtain feedbacks.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The project is primarily a capacity-building and technical assistance project benefiting primarily 
agencies in Ghana, Benin and Togo, as well the regional body, West African Gas Pipeline 
Authority (WAGPA) located in Abuja, Nigeria.
