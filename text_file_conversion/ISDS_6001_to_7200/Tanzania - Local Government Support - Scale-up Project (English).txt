improve their operations and maintenance.

D.  Project location (if known) 
Component 1:  
 
The project will support the government's LGCDG system nationwide.  
 
The particular sub-projects the qualifying local government authorities will invest in will be 
identified through a demand-driven planning process at the local level.  It is therefore not 
possible to indicate the location of the sub-projects in which they will invest.  
 
Component 2:  This component is not being scaled up at this time, it supports upgrading of 
community infrastructure in 16 communities in unplanned areas of Dar es Salaam.
