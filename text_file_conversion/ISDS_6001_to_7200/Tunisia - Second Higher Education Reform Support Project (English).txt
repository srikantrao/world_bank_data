2. Project Objectives 
The objective of the Government's long-term program to develop higher education and 
support quality is to improve the skills of graduates so that they can contribute to a more 
knowledge based and diversified economy.  The Bank project will support the first phase 
of the Government’s program specifically to develop thehigher education system by 
improving the institutional performance and the quality of education through systematic 
support.  The project aims to:(i) improve access to higher education; (ii) to reinforce the 
capacity of the system move towards increased autonomy and financial sustainability of 
the sector in an equitable manner; (iii) improve the quality of programs and the level of 
autonomy of universities through a competitive innovation fund for the higher education 
system by improving institutional performance and the quality of education through 
systematic support.    
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed project would finance three major components: (i) expand access to the 
public higher education system; (ii) modernize the higher education system by 
strengthening quality assurance mechanisms, institutional autonomy and financial 
sustainability; and (iii) provide grants to improve academic quality and institutional 
performance.  
Page  2
Component 1: Expand access to the public higher education system (US$136.7 million 
total, Bank financing US$112.7 million, including contingencies)  
 
The objective of this component is to accommodate the anticipated growth in higher 
education enrollment. The project would finance related technical assistance, equipment 
and materials and construction for 13 new higher education institutions, and 1 university 
restaurant and 1 student residence. The type of institutions to be constructed would 
tentatively be: arts and sciences (1), applied science and technology (ISSAT) (3), 
biotechnology (1), energy (1), information technology (1), applied languages and 
humanities (1), engineering (2), music (1), sport sciences (1), higher institute of 
technology (ISET) (1), including 1 restaurant and 1 student residence.  
 
Component 2: Modernize the higher education system by strengthening quality 
assurance mechanisms, institutional autonomy and financial sustainability (US$5.8 
million total, Bank financing US$5.3 million, including contingencies)  
 
The objective of this component is to build capacity for the central elements o
f
Tunisia’s 
higher education system by: (i) assisting the National Evaluation Committee (NEC) in 
transforming itself into an effective quality assurance system (soon to be known as 
Instance Nationale d’Evaluation et de Promotion de la QualitÃ© (INEPQ)); (ii) revising 
the higher education curricula to match internationalnorms and become more relevant to 
labor market needs, and (iii) developing the technical and managerial capacity of the 
MoHE to lead the reforms needed to move towards greater autonomy for universities.  
The project would finance related technical assistance, study tours, training activities 
equipment and materials of the following five sub-components.  
 
Sub-component 2.1: Development and strengthening of the present higher education 
National Evaluation Committee (NEC) to transform it into an effective quality assurance 
system (INEPQ).  
 
Sub component 2.2: Revising the higher education curricula to match international 
norms and become more relevant to labor market needs.  
 
Sub-component 2.3: Strengthening reform implementation capacity of the MoHE.  
 
Sub-component 2.4: Strengthening the technical and management capacity of higher 
education institutions (HEIs).  
 
Subcomponent 2.5: Strengthening project management capacities:  Moving to a more 
decentralized system will require the MoHE to develop new decision-making tools to 
reinforce its capacity to oversee the sector.  
 
Component 3: Provide grants to improve academic quality and institutional performance 
(US$32.2 million total, Bank financing US$22. 0 million, including contingencies)  
 
The objective of this component is to establish a new resource transfer mechanism 
(Quality Promotion Fund (Programme d’Appui Ã  la QualitÃ© (PAQ)) through the use 
of competitive block grants awarded directly to the investment budgets of universities.  
The fund (PAQ) will provide: (i) competitive block grants directly to universities on a 
Page  3
competitive basis aiming to improve the quality of programs and teaching in the longer 
run; and (ii) institutional grants to strengthen institutional management.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:  
 
The Environmental Assessment report indicates that the project will not raise major 
health or environmental concerns and that it will not have any irreversible or large-scale 
impact. The perceived negative impacts of the project on the environment are minor and 
temporary including those that might occur during the construction of institutions (such 
as pollution in public spaces, land and water pollution, traffic, etc.), and/or during the 
usage of buildings (water sewage, solid waste management, traffic, change in landscape, 
etc.).  These impacts can be managed by development and implementation of good 
environmental management and mitigation plans as well as adopting good engineering 
practices.  Thus, based on the information available at appraisal, the Environmental 
Category of the project is confirmed as B.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There are no indirect and/or potential long-term impacts due to the project.   
 
Page  4
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
None.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Environmental Assessment: In accordance with the Bank’s Operational Safeguards 
Policy relative to Environmental Assessment (OP 4. 01), the MoHE prepared an 
environmental assessment of the project. This assessment consists of: (i) an analysis of 
potential impacts, (ii) an identification of mitigation measures, (iii) the application of 
Bank’s safeguard policies to the project, and (iv) an environmental management plan.  
 
The EE report specifies also that a detailed environmental analysis will be undertaken 
for each of the 15 new constructions in parallel with the conceptual design studies. The 
results of this environmental analysis will be taken into account at the final design stage, 
and the preparation of bidding documents for civil works.  
 
The MoHE will be responsible for preparing environmental impact assessment (EIA) 
for each specific site, prior to bid launching. This EIA would also include a public 
consultation.  The EIA reports will be submitted to the Bank for approval prior to bid 
launching. The Bank will only finance construction projects that have undergone 
adequate environmental assessment. During the construction phase, the main architect is 
primarily responsible for ensuring the application of the mitigation measures 
recommended in the EIA. The main architect will be supervised by a regional 
representative from the MinistÃ¨re de l’Equipement et de l’Habitat (MEH).  
 
Cultural heritage (OPN 11-03): According to the Environmental Assessment report, it is 
not considered that the project would affect culturally important sites. However, most of 
the planned construction activities will involve excavation work,  thus this issue will be 
evaluated under the specific - site EIA studies (due during project implementation cycle), 
and if found warranted, adequate mitigation measures such as “chance finding” 
procedures for construction, will be incorporated in relevant construction Bidding 
documents and contracts.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/PB 4-12): The planned sites for the construction of 15 
new institutions have already been acquired within the university campus. These sites 
belong to the MoHE, and have been in service or will be in service soon. No land 
acquisition is necessary, and therefore, there is no risk of involuntary resettlement. This 
policy is not triggered.  
 
The Environmental Assessment undertaken by MoHE has confirmed that other 
safeguard policies are not to be triggered by the Project.   
 
Borrower Capacity : The Ministry of Higher Education and particularly its Direction des 
Batiments et d’Equipement (DBE), which is responsible for implementation of the 
proposed project has only modest experience and expertise in managing and 
Page  5
incorporating environmental considerations. Thus capacities of this unit as well as 
national and regional directorates from the Ministere de l’Equipement that will deal with 
the implementation and supervision the proposed Environmental Management Plan 
(EMP) need to be reinforced.  To this end, training and capacity development for 
safeguard policies will be part of the institutional strengthening component of the 
proposed project.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The EA report has been disclosed on the MoHE’s website as well as in the World Bank 
Infoshop. Environmental impact studies specific to a particular site will include public 
consultation and relevant reports will be disclosed nationally.
