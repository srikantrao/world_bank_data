2. Project Objectives 
The overall objective of the APL-Program remains the same as that which was approved 
in 2001. As originally envisaged, the development objective of the APL II is to 
implement the institutional and policy framework, developed during APL I, to increase 
quality and efficiency in primary and general secondary education.  The key performance 
indicators of the project are, therefore, focused on the relevant measures of quality and 
efficiency.   
 
3. Project Description 
Component One:  Improving the Pedagogical Environment.  The objective of this 
component is to improve the pedagogical environment through changes in content, 
teaching methodology, student assessment, initial teacher education and teacher 
continued professional development, building on the institutional and policy frameworks 
supported by APL I.  This will be achieved through two main directions:  (i) the 
development and implementation of a national curriculum and student assessment 
system, including assisting initial teacher education (ITE) programs adapt to new 
standards and supporting the development of the responsible institution; and (ii) 
development and implementation of a teacher certification process, teacher standards and 
Page  2
accreditation system for ITE and continuing professional development (CPD) programs, 
including the development of the responsible institution.  The first phase of the APL 
supported the development of the curriculum framework, initial piloting and 
implementation of the curriculum in three grades, a system of student examination, and 
in-service teacher development.  During APL I, the Ministry of Education and Science 
(MoES) established a National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) and a 
Teacher Professional Development Center (TPDC).  APL II will build on these successes, 
but is necessary to further build the capacity of these nascent institutions and all of the 
people involved in developing or implementing the reforms.  The specific objectives and 
activities of the two related subcomponents are discussed below.  
 
Subcomponent 1A:  National Curriculum and Student Assessment System 
Development.  The objective of this subcomponent is to improve the teaching content and 
methodologies in line with the national curriculum framework; to establish a system of 
student assessment so as to identify difficulties in student learning and develop targeted 
programs accordingly; and to assist ITE institutions adapt their programs to take into 
account the changes in teaching standards, the national curriculum, and student 
assessment methodologies.  The National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) 
that is responsible for implementing these policies was established in spring 2006.  This 
subcomponent would develop the capacity of the NCAC in terms of the managerial and 
technical capacity of the staff; support the development, piloting and implementation of 
the national curriculum in almost all grades and subjects which will include the training 
of teacher trainers, the training of teachers, and other dissemination activities; support the 
development of a system of student formative assessment; and conduct sample based 4th 
grade student assessments in Georgian Language and Literature and in Mathematics.  The 
NCAC will also be responsible to support the reform of the ITE system and institutions.  
The Center will strengthen the technical capacity of higher education institutions 
involved in ITE through the provision of technical and materials to reform the ITE 
programs to meet the new standards for teacher certification and reflect the curriculum 
and student assessment reforms.  
 
For these purposes, the Project (including financing from the Government, Credit and 
Grant) would finance technical assistance; training; publication and dissemination; 
workshops and conferences; the acquisition of copyrights and translation, editing and 
printing of materials for a library in education science; a limited amount of goods and 
works for establishing the Center; and the operations of the Curriculum and Assessment 
Center.  
 
The MoES would be responsible for the policy decisions and overall monitoring and 
evaluation of the sector; and the NCAC would be responsible for the implementation of 
the program. It would finance the MoES policy unit to elaborate a strategy to address the 
challenges of the tertiary education system in a financially sustainable manner as part of 
the policy dialogue with the government on improving the efficiency and equity of the 
overall system and provide resources to improve governance structures and move to a 
credit course system A radical new higher education law has recently been passed, and 
reforms are starting but could benefit from analysis and broader consultation.

Subcomponent 1B:  Professional Development of Teachers.  The objective of this 
subcomponent is to improve the qualifications of teachers through the development and 
implementation of a teacher professional development system.  The educational 
institution responsible for building the professional development system of teachers was 
also established in 2006.  This subcomponent would develop the capacity of the Teachers 
Professional Development Center (TPDC) in terms of the managerial and technical 
capacity of the staff; develop standards for teachers including the dissemination of 
materials and holding of workshops and conferences; develop and conduct certification 
of both the existing and new teaching force; develop accreditation mechanisms for both 
ITE and CPD programs; and establish a registration system of teacher, teacher-candidate, 
and training programs.  For these purposes, the Project (including financing from the 
Government, Credit and Grant) would finance technical assistance; training; publication 
and dissemination of materials; a limited amount of goods and works; and the operations 
of the TPDC.  The MoES would be responsible for the policy decisions and overall 
monitoring and evaluation of the sector; and the TPDC would be responsible for the 
implementation of the program.  
 
Component Two: Improving the Physical Learning Environment. The main objective of 
this component is to improve the school physical learning environment in targeted 
schools to complement the investments on improving the quality of the pedagogical 
learning environment and to demonstrate how the efficiency of the school network could 
be improved through the adoption of more efficient school building standards and 
through school consolidations.  The main outcome of this component would be that 100% 
of children currently studying in schools in emergency condition are in safe and 
comfortable schools.  
 
The Bank credit will be used to finance the construction, furnishing and equipping of 
about eight schools in different parts of the country  that will, on average, be a 
consolidation of two existing schools (target:  8 schools with 4,750 number of student 
beneficiaries)  
 
The Bank-financed program is designed with the understanding that the Government 
will at the same time be implementing a major capital investment program that will 
rehabilitate part of the existing school infrastructure to an adequate level (repair of 
roofing, windows, doors, and ensuring that all heating, electricity, water and sewage 
systems are operational. To ensure that newly upgraded school infrastructure is 
maintained, the component will also support the development and adoption of a school 
maintenance strategy, including the necessary amendment of the General Education Law 
and adoption of regulations and the development of a school maintenance manual and 
training in the use of that manual to upgrade the capacity of school boards and managers 
in this area.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The Bank credit will be used to finance the construction, furnishing and equipping of 
about eight schools in different parts of the country that will, on average, be a 
consolidation of two existing schools.  The environmental safeguard was addressed due 
to the possible environmental impact of the school construction.The land upon which the 
schools will be built already are or will be properties of the schools and do not raise any 
resettlement issues.  Because the new schools will be a consolidation of existing schools, 
the concerns of the community/parents will be carefully assessed and addressed as part of 
the project design.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The Credit will be used to finance the construction of 8 schools, all of them will replace 
schools in emergency status or schools operating in non-educationally appropriate 
circumstances.  The construction of the schools will trigger the environmental safeguard, 
because of the noise and other inconveniences associated with the construction, need to 
appropriately dispose of construction waste, use appropriate construction material and 
arrange for proper water and sanitation in the school. The school land already is the 
property of the school or will be provided by the local authorities.  There are no land 
acquisition issues. There are no settlements on the land and, therefore, the involuntary 
resettlement safeguard is not triggered.  
 
No large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are anticipated.   
 
Page  5
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The future activities in the project areas will be the use of the school for education of 
children.  The long-term impacts of this use will be taken into consideration in the design 
of the school and particularly in the appropriate water and sanitation measures.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
The only relevant project alternative which was considered was a school rehabilitation 
rather than school construction project (as discussed at the Safeguards meeting following 
the Project concept review meeting).  This alternative project design had much of the 
same environmental concerns as the current project design.  As part of the 'feasibility 
studies' planned for each school construction site, we will ensure that no additional issues 
arise, (i.e. no need for land acquisition and no resettlement issues). Because the Project 
design now includes school consolidation, the feasibility study will also include a 
particular social component to assess and address any community/parents concern 
regarding the planned consolidation.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower is undertaking a feasibility study of each school proposal, which includes 
an assessment of potential environmental impact in order to develop an appropriate plan 
for mitigation measures.  The borrower, supported by the Municipal Development Fund 
(MDF) (which has recently absorbed the Georgian Social Investment Fund (GSIF)), has 
completed an  assessment and planning for mitigation measures.  The environmental 
management framework (including draft environmental management plan) has been 
published in Georgia and the framework was discussed with key stakeholders.  The MDF 
and GSIF have experience in complying with the Bank's environmental safeguard policy.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural 
Resources, civil society organizations and communities in which the schools will be built.  
They were informed that the Environmental Management Framework was made  
available on the MDF website.  The meeting with the key stakeholders has been held and 
its minutes submitted to the Association. The School Boards will have an important role 
in supervising the construction of the schools, which will include compliance with the 
EMP.
