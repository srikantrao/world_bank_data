  2. Project Objectives:

  The carbon offset operation corresponds to the investments under IDA project P069996.

  Kakira Sugar Works has purchased and is installing two identical John Thompson 45 bar boilers.
  The high-pressure steam from both will be fed into and combined in a common header which
  will then deliver the steam to the new 16MW Turbo-Generator [TG] set. The 16MWTG will
  produce 12MW of electricity that will be ramped up to 15MWby 2010 of excess electricity that
  will be exported to the Ugandan grid to displace current and future thermal generation.

  3. Project Description:

  In this context KSW a private sugar manufacturing corporation with the support of the
  Government decided to expand their existing cogeneration capacity. This included the following
  parameters:

           The factory expansion in phases from an existing crushing capacity of 3,500 tonnes of
           cane a day (TCD) to 6,000 TCD. The cane will be supplied by over 4000 small farmers in

      its vicinity (will not result in processing capacity of raw input) in addition to cane from
      its own nucleus estate. This factory expansion is not part of the CDM project.

      Two new John Thompson bagasse boilers of 45 bar: KSW currently uses 1970low
      pressure boilers 20 bar Breda boilers.

      A new double extraction condensing Turbo Generator (TG) set with an installed capacity
      of 16MW:The new 16MWwill be operated in parallel with the existing TG sets to
      produce 4 MW of power from bagasse for internal consumption of the sugar factory
       using the Franco-Tossi 3.0 MW and Blohrn & Voss TG set of 1.5MW. As an interim
       measure to meet increased in-house demand, KSW has procured and has installed an
       additional Bellis TG of 3.OMW. Therefore, KSW is self sufficient in meeting it's in-
       house electricity needs. The new 16MW TG will produce 12MW that will ramped up to
       15MWby 2010 of excess electricity that will be exported to the Ugandan grid during the
       crop season (305 days a year). The power plant will use bagasse (a renewable biomass
       material produced from the milling of cane) to generate electricity.

       The surplus electricity will be supplied to the grid via a 33 kV new distribution line from
       Kakira to Mailo-Mbili and KSW is constructing a new sub station with a potential
       capacity of at least 20MW. The export of power will displace equivalent power from the
       grid where the Government's recent expansion has come largely from fossil fuel based
       power stations.

The project boundary includes the equipment installed for the operation of the new plant, the
main elements of which are the boiler, turbine, generator, new Kakira sub-station and the start of
the new distribution line to the Ugandan national gird.



4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:

Kakira Sugar Works is located in Kakira village in Butembe County, about 106krn east of
Kampala, the capital city of the Republic of Uganda. Located in the district of Jinja, Kakira lies
on the northern shores of Lake Victoria.
