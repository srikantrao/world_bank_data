B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The projectís objectives are to assist the GOH in developing the basic structures and practices 
essential to good economic governance management and thus to its ability to program and 
expend public resources transparently and effectively.The objectives must be understood as part 
of a sequence pursued in an entire support package that began with the EGRO and LICUS Grant 
and which will extend beyond the EGTAG II.  By the end of the EGTAG I, the goal is  that Haiti  
will have a budgetary system that captures all proposed and effected operating and investment 
expenditures, its procurement office in operation, an operational system for conducting financial 
and legal audits and for investigating alleged corruption, met minimal personnel needs for 
financial management, developed a plan to meet broader personnel requirements, and engaged 
civil society in monitoring the results of these efforts and overall government performance.  
EGTAG II will support any additional activities required to meet these basic goals, but will move 
beyond them to:  ensure the fluid and effective operation of the budgetary, control, and 
procurement systems; build a central human resources unit and introduce basic tools to expand 
its reach through a significant portion of executive branch agencies, and advance implementation 
of other elements of the plan (developed under EGTAG I) to begin rationalizing the distribution, 
Page  2
upgrading the quality, and improving the incentives for public sector employees; create within 
key sector ministries a basic capacity for monitoring and evaluating the quality of service 
delivery; and ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of the government
ís anti-corruption, 
transparency, and public participation programs. Future operations will continue this work, with 
each increment attempting to refine the structures and tools introduced in the earlier ones, and so 
help the GOH gradually evolve its abilities to program and implement the use of public 
resources.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The proposed project builds on results anticipated from EGTAG I and thus works in the same 
general areas.  What follows is a tentative description of contents.  The more precise details and 
areas of emphasis will be negotiated with the new government during the course of project 
preparation.  Coordination with other major donors, and especially the IDB, will also be 
continued.  
 
1. 
Financial Resource Management: this is the key area for economic governance, the 
development of a capacity to produce and execute a budget, track its implementation, and reduce 
irregular uses and expenditures.  Given that a considerable part of EGTAG Iís funds was devoted 
to establishing basic structures, funding requirements under EGTAG II should be considerably 
less.  The goal here is to provide additional support to improve or possibly fine-tune the initial 
design in the three basic elements.  
 
a) Budgeting:  Under the EGTAG I and the IDBís companion operations, the emphasis is on 
designing basic budgetary procedures (as established in the new Organic Law) and ensuring the 
Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning,  and key sector ministries (via the IDB program) have 
sufficient numbers of adequately prepared personnel to implement them.  Further development 
of the GOHís Information Financial Management System (IFMS) will be financed by the IDB 
and USAID.  The EGTAG II will finance an evaluation of the initial results of the new budgetary 
procedures, identify areas for strengthening or modification, and support technical assistance, 
training, and some equipment purchases to effect these further developments.  
 
b) Control:  The LICUS grant and EGTAG I are supporting the CSCCA (Cour Sup√®rieure des 
Comptes e du Contentieux Administratif) staff preparation in ex-post control, evaluating initial 
performance, and financing further equipment, training, and related needs as well as the 
elaboration of a medium term plan for development of the external and internal control function.  
The EGTAG II will finance implementation of that plan (largely technical assistance and 
training) in coordination with the IDB which intends some work on internal control.  
 
c) Procurement:  With the creation of the CNIMP (Commission Nationale Int√©rimaire des 
March√©s Publics); development of procedures, standardized documents, and a network of 
sector procurement officials (supported by the IDB); and initiation of a website and publication 
of information on bids and contracts, the basic outlines of the procurement system will be 
established in the course of EGTAG I implementation.  EGTAG II will build on this base, 
evaluating the new procedures and organizations, identifying necessary modifications or 
additions, and providing technical assistance to address them.

2. 
Human Resource Development:  This area was not covered significantly under EGTAG I 
because of funding limitations and the determination that the Transition Government would lack 
both time and political resources to address it.  The emphasis was instead on preparing facilities 
for training funded by World Bank or other donor projects, some initial planning for the creation 
of a human resource system, and inventorying resources for its use (e.g. how existing data bases 
might be used to create an employee registry). EGTAG II will move ahead with the creation of 
the organizational structures the development of basic human resource management tools (the 
registry, a personnel inventory and job classification scheme, regulations and procedures for 
competitive, merit-based selection; rationalization of salaries, and a centralized system for 
coordinating and managing training), and the training of central and sector staff in their use.  It 
will also finance studies related to an improved civil service law, although as experience 
suggests, it is wiser to enact a law following, rather than prior to, certain improvements in the 
system.  
 
3. 
Development of Sector Capacity to Monitor Service Delivery and Encourage Employee 
Performance:  This is a new area, not contemplated under the prior operations.  It has emerged as 
a
concern of Government and donor staff working in other sectors.  Work will focus in one or 
two ministries (selecting those with other Bank operations) and will focus  on he development of 
basic tools and protocols for supervising and monitoring performance, the training of staff in 
their use, and experimental efforts (based on experience in other countries) in tying budgets or 
staff remuneration to service delivery and quality.  
 
4. 
Anti-corruption and Civil Society Engagement:  Both activities, implemented through the 
MEF, were supported by the LICUS and EGTAG I.  EGTAG II will continue support to ensure 
their survival and future development while also exploring the potential for their graduation to 
more autonomous status.  Support will take the form of technical assistance, evaluations, and in 
the case of the civil society mechanism, funding for training, seminars, and NGO monitoring 
activities.  
 
5.  
Project Management and Communication:  The primary counterpart agency will again be 
the MEF, but implementation will be done through the relevant agencies.  A single PCU in the 
MEF will coordinate activities an
d
handle financial management. EGTAG Iís sharing of a PCU 
with the IDB is an ongoing experiment and will be continued under EGTAG II. Whether deemed 
successful or not, EGTAG II will also provide technical support to project management, and 
continue with a component for  communicating the content of reform proposals and their 
advances to ensure greater understanding and wider ownership of the efforts among all Haitian 
citizens.

E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most disadvantaged in the 
world.  For the past twenty years, the country has struggled to emerge from a cycle of internal 
conflicts that devastated its economy, augmented levels of poverty, further weakened an already 
inadequate administrative structure, and provoked the withdrawal of external assistance to the 
Page  4
government.   In March 2004, following the resignation of President Jean Bertrand Aristide a 
Transition Government was put in place and initiated a program aimed at increasing political and 
social stability and jump starting the economy.  In spring 2004, the Transition Government led 
the donor community in putting together an Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) to guide 
future efforts. Because of its broad experience in the area, the World Bank, along with the IDB, 
accepted the Government of Haiti's (GOH) invitation to collaborate in the design and 
implementation of the sections on economic governance.  The present grant is part of a 
sequenced package of technical assistance aimed at progressively building the GOHís capacity to 
plan, direct, and track resource use, and to identify and control deviations.As the most recent 
element in this package it will move beyond the basics to fine tune financial management, 
control and procurement systems, create mechanisms for rationalizing and improving human 
resource management, and develop capabilities within key sector ministries to plan and supervise 
service delivery.  It will also continue support to mechanisms augmenting transparency and civil 
society participation in the overall reforms. The proposal outlined here and the underlying 
assessment are the result of on-going dialogue with the government and experience derived from 
the design and implementation of the EGRO, LICUS, and EGTAG I, as well as prior diagnostic 
work by the Bank and others focusing specifically on weaknesses in financial management, 
procurement, and overall public administration.
