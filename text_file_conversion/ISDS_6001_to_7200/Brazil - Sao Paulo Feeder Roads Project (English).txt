B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The project’s ultimate development objective is to contribute to regional development in the 
state, by improving efficiency in the use of the paved municipal road networks.  
 
The objective is to be achieved through: (i) support to the state feeder roads program; and (ii) 
the undertaking of a comprehensive set of technical assistance activities aimed at improving state 
interventions’ efficiency in the transport sector.  The project’s technical assistance component 
could also support government initiatives under other development themes: the state Secretariat 
of Planning (in charge of coordination with multilateral agencies) signaled that, as part of the 
package of Bank projects, the preparation of which has recently been approved by the federal 
Government, it would seek to include in one of the Bank projects, a US$10-12 million technical 
assistance component under the Secretariat’s leadership.  However, to the project team’s 
knowledge, such component has not yet been defined, nor has the Government identified the 
Bank project in which such component should be included.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project would comprise:  
 
Page  2
•
a
feeder roads rehabilitation component, to finance a 2,000 km phase of the Programa 
Pro-vicinais. The component will be implemented by the DER.  The civil works would include: 
(i) rehabilitation of existing pavement; (ii) surfacing of connecting segments on essentially paved 
itineraries, surfacing of shoulders, and localized realignments on up to 80 km of road extension; 
(iii) rehabilitation of shoulders; (v) rehabilitation and possibly widening of bridges, and 
punctually, critical points elimination; (vi) upgrade of drainage systems; and (vii) signalization. 
The works will be realized within the existing roads right of ways, under the Municipal 
authority, through a partnership agreement between the DER and the beneficiary.  The 
component would finance civil works and related services, including project design and 
supervision.  
 
•
a
technical assistance component to finance consulting services, training andgoods, 
tentatively in support of:  
 
(a)  
through the DER, the municipalities benefiting from the project on improving network 
management to ensure the sustainability of the works;  
 
(b)  
the DER on improving M&E under the Programa Pro-Vicinais through traffic surveys, 
geo-referencing and extension of the pavement management system of the DER to key segments 
of paved municipal networks;  
 
(c)  
the DER on improving efficiency in the management of other transport programs 
(including road management, dangerous goods transport and weight control) and of its human 
resources;  
 
(d)  
the Transport Secretariat in strengthening its planning and policy definition capacity (drill 
down on the State Transportation Plan); and  
 
(e) 
possibly (depending on Government decision and Bank evaluation on the definitive scope 
of the project’s technical assistance component), of Government efforts in structuring and 
implementing complex infrastructure projects (PPPs/Concessions), in streamlining 
environmental licensing procedures for large civil works, and in undertaking economic 
evaluation of projects and programs.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Project would support the rehabilitation of 2.000 km of selected paved municipal roads 
within the State of Sao Paulo. More specifically, project works would take place in municipal 
roads rights-of-way (ROW) and in the sites associated with road projects. The ROW consists of 
the paved strip and the entire area reserved for the construction, operation, and maintenance of 
the roadside. The sites associated with road projects include deposits; borrow sites, materials 
treatment areas, quarries, access roads, and facilities provided for project workers. As such, it is 
not expected that the implementation of civil works would require involuntary resettlements.  
However, small land acquisitions might be necessary in order to proceed with localized road 
realignment, elimination of accident-prone points, and widening of bridges.  
 
The location of the municipal road sections likely to be included under the Project is known, 
and the Borrower is presently undertaking an evaluation of the socio-environmental impacts that 
works on such roads could have.  Based on a sample of roads evaluated during the last Bank 
mission, and on the fact that paved municipal roads serve areas already developed economically, 
it is unlikely that works to be financed under the project would have negative impacts on existing 
environmental protected areas or areas with indigenous or traditional population.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The state of Sao Paulo has a good institutional capacity for handling safeguardissues. 
Environmental institutions are well structured and social controls, through civil society and the 
State General Attorney are quite active in the defense of diffuse rights 
–be it of environmental or 
social nature.  
 
The project’s implementing agency, DER, has a well defined body of norms and procedures to 
deal with environmental and social issues. These norms and procedures were agreed upon with 
the state’s environmental agencies responsible for overseeing DER’s compliance with 
environmental laws and standards: CETESB, DAEE, and DPRN.   The implementation of those 
norms and procedures, from the engineering project to the civil works phases, is under the 
responsibility of DER environmental advisory (Assessoria Ambiental).  
 
DER’s environmental advisory has developed, with support from the Inter-American 
Development Bank, an environmental management system (EMS) having as a reference 
framework the ISO 14001/2004 standard.  The current EMS comprises policies, procedures, 
manuals and technical solutions catalog for handling environmental issues. The different types of 
road civil works are categorized according to the level of necessary scrutiny and care. 
Environmental licensing and monitoring procedures are streamlined and well established. 
Mitigation measures are well known and do not represent an implementation challenge, 
especially with respect to more simple works, such as rehabilitation works.  
 
It should be noted that the works will be realized within the existing roads right of ways, under 
the municipal authority, through a partnership agreement (convenio) between the DER and the 
municipality. These convÃªnios have a standard text that establishes mutual obligations between 
DER and the municipality. In particular, the municipalities are in charge of land acquisition 
along the roads’ ROW, using the 2 traditional procedures: (i) donation of the land by the owner; 
and (ii) negotiations with the owner based on the replacement value of the land.  
 
Under the convenios, an appropriate implementation of social and environmental measures is 
under the responsibility of the municipality and a sine-qua-non condition for the civil works to 
take place. The civil works contracts foresee the social and environmental supervision of the 
works by DER and non-compliance with agreed-upon mitigation measures on behalf of the 
municipality can be subject to legal remedies.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
Environmental impacts resulting from civil works on existing road sections are expected to 
be relatively minor, and mostly related to civil works’ execution. The Borrower has 
demonstrated to have adequate capacity and procedures for handling environmental mitigation 
measures (as demonstrated during the implementation of the IADB Sao Paulo road transport 
project). For the proposed project the Borrower will prepare an Environmental Management Plan 
Page  4
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
(EMP) that will detail, inter alia, the measures to be taken during the implementation of the 
project to mitigate adverse environmental impacts; and the procedures to implement these 
measures. In addition to the EMP it is proposed for the Borrower to prepare, and for the Bank to 
review, an assessment of its current environmental management capacity as well as an 
institutional strengthening plan.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 X  
Forests (OP/BP 4.36) 
 X  
Pest Management (OP 4.09) 
 X  
Physical Cultural Resources (OP/BP 4.11) 
X
It is not expected that project implementation will have any negative impact on physical 
cultural resources, as the project civil works will be normally located within the existing right-of-
ways of road sections.  However, "chance findings" during paving works are possible, and to 
handle such findings, Brazil has a well-developed legislative and normative framework, which is 
under the oversight of the National Institute for Protection of Historical and Archeological Sites 
(IPHAN). Additionally, DER has proven experience and appropriate procedures to recover 
“chance findings” in line with these procedures and rules. These procedureswould be described 
in the assessment mentioned above.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
It is not expected that involuntary resettlement will occur as a result of project 
implementation.  However, few, localized land acquisitions might become necessary in order to 
proceed with localized road realignment, elimination of accident-prone points, and widening of 
bridges.  An Involuntary Resettlement Framework will be prepared prior to appraisal, in line 
with the requirements of OP/BP 4.12.
