B. Project Objectives:
The objective of ths project is to increase access to quality basic health care by
implementing a health insurance scheme in Nigeria. The project wdl subsidize a pilot pre-
paid health system in an area where sustainabdtty is hkely once the benefits of the scheme are
demonstrated. The aim is to demonstrate the benefits of such a scheme to Nigerians and
encourage its implementation on a sustainable basis.

C. Project Description:
During the past decade, the country's health indicators stagnated or worsened. Life
expectancy stands at only 44 years, lower than the African average of 49 and the developing
country average of 65 years. Infant mortality, measured per 1,000 live births, is very high at
111, compared to the developing country average of 62. Other health statistics, hke beds per
1,000 population and maternal mortality, rank Nigeria below many other African countries,
includmg those with much lower per capita GDP. Moreover, with a national HIV prevalence
rate of 5.4'10 an estimated 3.5 million Nigerians are HIV-infected. Access to HIVIAIDS
prevention, treatment and care is low. Around 520,000 persons are estimated to require anti-

 retroviral therapy today, of whom only 17,000 (3'0)        are currently receiving treatment. The
 need for hlgh quality medcal services is acute in Nigeria, given the poor health status of the
 population and the inabiltty of the public health system to adequately meet the country's
 needs.


 The project consists of the establishment of a community health program that encourage
 low-income Nigerian families to enroll in pre-paid health insurance plans as a way to access
 affordable primary and maternal care, as well as treatment for the diseases most prevalent in
 their communities. The project wdl provide affordable pre-paid health insurance plans to
 low-income employees of small businesses and their families in Lagos, Nigeria. The project
 is to provide increased access to quality health service for an anticipated target group of
 24,000.


 The GPOBA Nigeria Pre-Paid Health Scheme project dbe executed by providing fundmg
 to an existing program and system to implement the project. The Dutch non-for-profit
 organization Health Insurance Fund ("HIF") is currently piloting an insurance scheme in
 Nigeria, developed by its implementing partner PharrnAccess and is executed by its local
 partner Hygeia Health Maintenance Organization ("HHMO").

 D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
 analysis (if known):
 The project activitieswdl be located in Lagos, Nigeria. The exact target location depends on
 the availabiltty of suitable service providers and is to be determined during project appraisal.


 E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies:
 Adequate measures are in place to manage environmental issues specific to the project.

 Category C with no safeguards being triggered.

 111. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at whlch time the PAD-stage
     ISDS would be prepared: N/A

B. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-
     stage ISDS: June/July, 2007


     Time frame for launchmg and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be
     needed. The specific studies and their timing1should be specified in the PAD-stage
     ISDS:
     The project does not trigger the World Bank social safeguard policies (OP 4.10 and OP
     4.12), as it does neither involve resettlement nor affects IP. The project is categorized as
     a 'Category C'. As the project focuses on establishmg a pre-paid health insurance
     scheme, and will not be directly financing health care treatment, delivery, nor
     construction of clmics, no safeguards are triggered. However, as a way to support best
     practice, the project recogmzes the importance of addressing health care waste
     management. To ths end, practitioners participating in the health insurance scheme wdl
     be encouraged to follow international best practice with regards to medcal waste
     disposal.




IReminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at

the Infoshop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to
potentially affected persons.
