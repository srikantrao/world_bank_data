3. Project Description 
The project will support the development of a regional Air Transport Program within the 
context of the Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) implementation. It will complement the 
work that will be undertaken by regional institutions (with donors’ support) in the area of 
Air Transport Economic Regulation harmonization, while primarily focusing on airport 
and aviation safety and security. Although the project will be implemented at a national 
level in four countries (i.e., Burkina Faso, Mali, Guinea and Cameroon), its components 
are designed to complement ongoing regional Cooperative Development of Operational 
Safety and Continued Airworthiness (COSCAP) projects in the Economic Community of 
Western African States (ECOWAS) and Economic and Monetary Community of Central 
Africa (CEMAC) countries which are financed through grants by bi and multilateral 
donors.  
 
This division of roles was agreed upon with these donors during project preparation 
after it was confirmed that the Bank’s charter precludes it from financing regional 
initiatives (i.e. COSCAPs) involving direct lending to regional organizations (i.e. 
ECOWAS, WAEMU and CEMAC). Accordingly, while the project will focus on: i) 
strengthening national CAAs safety and security oversight capacities and ii) enhancing 
national airport security and safety standards, the COSCAP projects will seek to develop 
regional safety oversight capacities that will complement those of local CAAs.  
 
The two Secretariat Units located within ECOWAS and CEMAC will have overall (i.e. 
regional and national) project management responsibilities in order to promote effective 
coordination and harmonization at the regional level. However, national project 
component will effectively be implemented independently by existing local project 
implementation units (PIUs), whenever these already exist so as to ensure economical 
effectiveness or national CAAs.  
 
The project has three main components:  
 
a) 
Strengthening of CAAs’ safety and security oversight capacities: this component 
will finance each country’s CAA technical assistance necessary mainly for: a) the 
adoption and utilization of harmonized aviation code and regulations and the creation of 
Page  3
autonomous civil aviation agencies through the provision of consulting services; b) the 
training of civil aviation staff in the areas of civil aviation security and safety oversights; 
c) the acquisition of basic communications and inspections equipments (e.g. , two-ways 
radios, inspection vehicle, computers, etc.), and  d) the procurement of library equipment 
(e.g., relevant ICAO’s manuals, directives, online library, training materials, etc.).  
 
b)
Improvements in airport security and safety standards: This activity will involve 
establishing appropriate aviation security legislation, development of security programs 
(national, airports and airlines programs), provision of security equipment at the main 
international airports, replacement of navigational aids at the primary airports and 
capacity building. The main areas of focus of this program will be: a) the implementation 
of measures to reinforce security at the various airport accesses (identification equipment, 
security cameras, patrol vehicles, communications systems and reorganization of 
passenger flows); b) the rehabilitation of existing airport fences and security patrol 
routes; c) the rehabilitation and/or construction within existing airport building premises 
of crisis centers, including acquisition of necessary communication and surveillance tools 
to equip these centers; d) the training of airport security personnel; e) the development of 
airport security through the acquisition of passengers and cargo X-ray machines; f) the 
acquisition and rehabilitation of navigational aids and communications systems; and g) 
the development of financial means to finance airport security improvements (i.e., airport 
security fees).  
 
c) 
Others: This activity, entitled “others”, is meant to encompass: a) the 
implementation of Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) in conjunction with the 
rehabilitation of security fences at these facilities; b) the financing of project operating 
costs covering inter alia annual financing audits and day-to-day management; and c) 
money set-aside as non-allocated to cover any uncertainties regarding planned project 
activities.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Project location will be the CAAs headquarter in Guinea and Cameroon and the PIUs in 
Burkina Faso and Mali.  
 
Safeguard policies triggered by this project include OP/BP 4.01 (environmental 
assessment), OP/BP 4.11 (cultural property) and OP/BP 4.12 (involuntary resettlement).  
 
OP/BP 4.01, the environmental impacts are not expected to be “significant” and a full 
EA is therefore not required.  
 
OP/BP 4.12, involuntary resettlement, is triggered at the airports of Conakry, Douala 
and YaoundÃ©, because agricultural activities have to be displaced outsidethese airports 
fenced perimeters.  
 
OP/BP 4.11, cultural property, is triggered at the airport of YaoundÃ©, where a 
religious shrine will be displaced by 1 Km to more suitable location of worship.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
During project preparation possible social impacts were identified in relation with the 
implementation of more stringent airport premises access rules. These impacts concern 
mainly the re-location of some agricultural activities outside the airport security 
perimeter, the removal of illegal constructions as well as the obligation for nearby 
residents to use passageways circumventing the airport. These problems were found to 
potentially affect Conakry, Douala and YaoundÃ© international airports in Guinea and 
Cameroon, respectively. Consequently, social impact studies were carried out and 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) drafted for all three airports.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
Potentially adverse social impacts to be induced by the implementation of more stringent 
airport premises access rules were identified in social assessments. These impacts are 
contained within the fenced security perimeter of the airport property and limited to: a) 
impacts on illicit income generating activities (vegetable gardening), b) impacts on 
prohibited access to tarmac (trespassing of tarmac), and c) impacts on a couple of 
housing structures. These impacts were identified at Conakry, Douala and YaoundÃ© 
international airports in Guinea and Cameroon, respectively.  
 
Actions taken to mitigate these impacts include: social impact assessments and 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAP) for all three airports. At this time, the expected cost of 
the all three RAPs is US$ 1.16 million with US$ 365,000 for the airport of Conakry, US$ 
30,000 for the airport of Douala and US$ 765,000 for the airport of YaoundÃ©. These 
costs will be borne by the respective Governments and constitute, in addition to taxes, the 
Page  5
counterpart funding prov
ided by each state. The YaoundÃ©’s RAP includes measures to 
address the relocation of the religious shrine per OP/BP 4.11.  
 
Social impact of the project in Douala, YaoundÃ© and Conakry airports was minimized 
by defining the smallest possible airport operations security perimeters.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
No project alternatives were considered to minimize adverse impact as the security 
perimeter defined for each airport encompasses the minimal land area necessary to ensure 
safety and security of air operations.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Borrowers (Guinea and Cameroon) have implemented social impact studies and are ready 
to implement RAPs. Borrowers are knowledgeable and have implemented RAPs in the 
past (e.g., Camrail project in Cameroon).  
 
For each airport a designated structure will be put in place by Governments to 
implement resettlement activities and award compensation to displaced individuals.  
 
The YaoundÃ© RAP proposes as one of its medium term improvement measures the 
construction of an 8-km unpaved road to maintain access to the city center for population 
living near the airport fence once the current access route is closed by the rehabilitation 
of the airport fence. An assessment of the potential scale of the environmental impacts 
that will be generated by this new road will be carried out before notice to proceed for the 
road construction is issued. The intial survey carried out by the Government of Cameroon 
as part of the follow up of the RAP has not led to the identification of any wildlife and 
sensitive natural habitat issues in this peri-urban area, nor to that of resettlement.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Public consultations with key stakeholders (community leaders, church officials, local 
government officials, project affected persons and airport officials) were carried out prior 
as well as during the social assessment.  
 
The three RAPs approved by the Bank have been disclosed and are available for local 
and Infoshop consultation as required by II.C. BP 17.0 - Public Disclosure.
