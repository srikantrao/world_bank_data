B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed project aims at improving the reliability of the Province’s road sector assets and 
the efficiency of their management as a means to support the country’s competitiveness and 
economic growth. Thus, by building upon the achievements of the on-going Provincial Roads 
Project II, the proposed project will further the agenda to meet the following specific objectives:  
 
(i) 
Buttress growth and competitiveness in the province of Cordoba, particularly in the 
tourism and agriculture sectors, by addressing the maintenance, rehabilitation and paving needs 
of key segments of the Provincial road network, while ensuring the implementation of a 
sustainable and cost-effective long-term road management strategy;  
 
(ii) 
Improve transparency, accountability and efficiency of government expenditure planning 
and management systems and procedures and strengthen the capacity of government agencies, 
such as the Ministry of Finance and ACIF, to support related initiatives while safeguarding the 
Province’s fiscal framework.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Page  2
To meet the proposed Development Objectives, three main components were preliminarily 
identified based on a proposed Loan amount of US$75 million and a maximum financing 
percentage of 75%  
 
Component 1 
–
Road Rehabilitation (Estimated cost US$32 million of which US$24 million 
would be financed by the Bank Loan). This component will focus on overcoming a backlog of 
deferred maintenance on prioritized sections of the provincial primary network, especially in the 
South-East part of the Province. The project would aim to cover a significant portion of high-
priority roads that have not received adequate routine maintenance and/or the structure of which 
has reached the end of its useful life and needs to be fully reconstructed.  
 
Component 2 – Road Paving (Estimated cost US$64 million of which US$48million would be 
financed by the Bank Loan). Through this component, the Bank would continue supporting 
paving investments on selected segments of the Province’ roadnetwork that are crucial for 
provincial productivity.  In such cases, the province would be required to design adequate 
maintenance strategies to ensure the sustainability of the proposed interventions.  
 
Component 3 – Institutional Strengthening (Estimated cost US$3 million, allBank-financed). 
This component will consist of four subcomponents:  
 
•
Institutional strengthening for management of contingent judicial liabilities: The required 
institutional strengthening involves only activities related to coordination structures, information 
systems, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building. The strategy will involve, inter alia, 
government procurement systems, the missing training and tracking systems, criteria for in-
house defense or outsourcing it, actuarial evaluation of this sort of contingent liabilities and 
adequate and timely provisioning.  
 
•
Performance-based government management: The project will finance design and 
implementation activities geared to developing the system in both regards. This component will 
focus on (i) defining the role of sector ministries and the SecretarÃ­a General regarding 
collection and provision of adequate indicators, (ii)  developing project and program evaluation 
before moving up the scale to policies and government goals and (iii) connect the M&E system 
with provincial or sector planning and budget decisions.  
 
•
Institutional strengthening of ACIF: the loan will help strengthening ACIF inareas such 
as financial and debt management, project programming and monitoring, information reporting, 
etc.  
 
•
Road network management: the Provincial Road Agency will be strengthened in the 
following areas: road safety, environmental and social management, supervision of works. In 
addition, a subset of low-performing “Consorcios Camineros”, located mostly on the 
economically disadvantaged northern parts of the Province, will receive training to improve their 
management and technical capacity, drawing lessons from the highly-rated “Consorcios”, most 
of which are located in the booming agricultural areas.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Province favorable location in the Central Region (comprised by Cordoba, Entre Rios and 
Santa Fe) puts it in the heart of a land corridor that connects the south of Brazil with ports in the 
north of Chile. Most of the road links to be rehabilitated or paved under this project are located 
on prioritized sections of the provincial primary network, especially in the South-East part of the 
Page  3
Province, and connect with the most important road corridors of the bi-oceanic corridors: Ruta 7 
(Buenos Aires 
–
border with Chile), Ruta 8 (Buenos Aires-Cordoba), Ruta 9 (Rosario-Cordoba), 
Ruta 158.

rower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
As a result of the ongoing World Bank-funded PCP1 and PCP2 projects, the road agency has 
gradually strenghtened its capacity to assess and manage social and environmental issues 
adequately. Currently there are two full-time staff in the environmental department of this 
agency and a third one is being hired.  
 
The department and its staff have the technical capacity and resources to perform the initial 
environmental screening for this project, which is not expected to have major environmental and 
social impacts. The environmental and social management framework will include a manual that 
is intended to provide guidelines to address environmental and social issues and include standard 
forms and procedures that the agency and contractors have to fill and follow during and after the 
construction phase. The environmental staff of the Road Agency will collect monthly 
information and data from the different contractors and regularly monitor compliance to agreed 
procedures and measures to prevent, mitigate and minimize environmental and social impacts.

II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
Safeguard Policies Triggered
 
Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
During the identification mission, the team visited around 80% of total road lengths that will 
be rehabilitated or paved. None of the proposed road improvements will require opening of new 
rights-of-way. Therefore, it is highly likely that most environmental and social impacts will be 
temporary during the construction phase construction and will cause only some minor and 
localized negative environmental impacts. Such impacts are expected to consist essentially of 
noise, vibration, dust, and traffic disruption. Additional negative impacts during construction will 
occur due to haulage and final disposal of materials from the construction sites.  
 
Environmental screening of 100% of the sites prior to appraisal will provide detailed 
assessment of short-term and cumulative indirect environmental impacts of proposed the 
different road improvement projects.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04) 
 
X
The environmental screening will assess short-term construction impacts as well as potential 
cumulative and indirect impacts on natural habitats. The project is not expected to have impacts 
since roads already exist and are located in developed areas.   
Forests (OP/BP 4.36)

finding procedures for archaeological or paleontological artifacts.   
Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
 X  
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
As already mentioned above, none of the proposed road improvements will require opening 
of new rights-of-way. No case of resettlement has been identified during the visits, but road 
widening and land acquisition is required in some select agricultural areas (stripes no more than 
5-meters wide). The team will closely monitor the land acquisition process, usually based on 
individual agreements with the land-owners. If the resettlement policy is triggered due to 
physical displacement (such as households located along the right-of-way) or economic 
displacement (such as street vendors within the right-of-way), an adequate resettlement plan 
according to the Bank's OP 4.12 will be prepared by the borrower and disclosed in accordance 
with the Bank’s policies: the PRPII’s Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) will be adapted to this specific project and updated, including a resettlement framework 
and public participation framework.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared:  03/22/2006 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS:  N/A 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
The team already agreed that:  
 
-
An Environmental and Social Management Framework (EMSF), based on the PCP2 
EMSF, will be prepared, and include manuals, procedures, roles for assessing impacts and 
monitoring and evaluating prevention and mitigation measures prior to appraisal.  
 
-
A
standardized environmental and social screening form will be prepared for 
environmental assessment of sub-project sites.  
 
-
Environmental screening of 100% of proposed road sites will be completed prior to 
appraisal  
 
-
An "Environmental and Social Manual for Provincial Roads" or some equivalent will be 
prepared and include measures and procedures to mitigate, prevent and manage

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.

environmental and social impacts associated with road projects that have moderate or low 
impacts. An abridged resettlement plan and public participation framework will be included 
as well. The manual will include procedures for project monitoring and roles and 
responsibilities of contractor and Road Agency.  
 
-
The EMSF will also include Terms of Reference for a possible Environmental Impact 
Assessment for high impact projects. As mentioned, it is very unlikely that this project will 
require an EIA since the assessment of 80% of the roads has shown low to moderate impacts.  
 
-
If necessary, complementary training will be offered to Road Agency environmental staff 
in the use of the manual and monitoring and reporting of sub-projects. The ongoing PCP2 
already includes environmental capacity analysis and building of the Road Agency. Special 
attention will be given to preparing a plan to strengthen the provincial capacity for public 
participation in road planning and implementation.  
 
-
A
Public Participation Framework will be prepared that would provide criteria to decide 
when and where a public consultation is needed and define mechanisms for said consultation 
during the design and implementation of the project. A first pilot focus group discussion will 
be designed for “La Cumbrecita”, a small touristic village, the access to which will be paved, 
to identify local needs and concerns, and discuss possible remediation and mitigation options.
