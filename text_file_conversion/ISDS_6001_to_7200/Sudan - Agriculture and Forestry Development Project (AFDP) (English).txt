  B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
  The two main objectives being proposed include: (a) capacity building and institutional
  development; and (b) extension, research and other support services for farmers and
  foresters. Key indicators to measure outcomes include: (a) policy reforms in agriculture
  and forestry (b) core staff in place both at the center and in five states; (d) increase in
  generationldissemination of extension recommendations by 25%; (e) increase in seed
  distribution by 20% ;(f)indicators for forestry (to be identified during project
  preparation).

  C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCNl
  Component A: Institutional Development: This component would improve and equip
  MAF facilities at central level and in the five States which are not covered by Sudan
  Productive Capacity Recovery Program (SPCRP). At central level, the project would also
  support legislative, policy analysis and the policy framework formulation functions of the
  MAF. The F A 0 preparation team identified the need to address the policy framework at
  State level and ways for translating these into Laws and Acts for parliamentary
  endorsement. A Management Information and Monitoring Evaluation System (MIS/M&E)

 would be specifically designed and established within the Directorate of Planning and
 Programming (DoPP) including Geographical Information System (GIs) facilities. The
 function within DoPP would also cover project M&E requirements.

 Component B: Establishment of Support Services: This component would focus on
 development of extension and research services in agricultural and forestry. Agricultural
 extension is supported under SPCRP, but only in the other five States of Southern Sudan
 (and not in all counties). The FA0 preparation mission identified three subcomponents.

            Agriculture extensiort subcortzponent would include capacity building of State
            MAARI and County Agriculture and forestry officials.
            The Forestry subcomporrer~twould address the training needs of around 120
            State level Forestry directors, conservators, extension agents and rangers.
            The Research subconzponerrt would support a collaborative research program
            and competitive grants open to regional and international institutions.

 D. Project location (if known)
 The program will be implemented in South Sudan in five states: Lakes, Leich, Northern
 Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Western Equatoria.

 E. Borrower's Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN]
 The project is not going to involve construction; it will limit its support to refurbishing and
 equiping existing facilities. Thus, EA category C is proposed. Should the scope of the
 project change during next phase of project preparation, the ISDS will be revised as
 necessary.
