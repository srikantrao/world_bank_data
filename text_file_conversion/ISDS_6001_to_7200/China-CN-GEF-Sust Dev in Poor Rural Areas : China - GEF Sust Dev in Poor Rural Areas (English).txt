B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The proposed project's development objective is to explore and pilot more effective and 
innovative ways of providing poverty reduction assistance to the poorest communities and 
households in the forms they themselves most desire and with greater positive impact.  By 
bringing project funding down to the community level and enabling the communities and 
households to determine the use of those funds, the project would help resolve the problems of 
(a) only a limited portion of available poverty reduction funding reaching the local level, and (b) 
institutional priorities and administrative constraints predetermining what poverty reduction 
activities actually take place at the local level.  By (a) improving access to housing, vocational 
and other training, and health and other social services, and (b) increasing the absorptive capacity 
of small towns on a pilot basis, the project would help to overcome the dangerous working and 
living conditions and other difficulties confronting rural migrants living in urban areas and help 
expand the rural poor's access to off-farm employment.

The specific objective of the GEF component would be to improve sustainable land resource 
management in marginal areas of extreme poverty by providing support to the poor to improve 
their techniques and means for better land management as part of the project's community-driven 
participator approach and by demonstrating ways to integrate policies and practices for 
integrated land use planning and sustainable land management into the Government's national 
poverty reduction programs and thus assisting the Government in effectively linking the rural 
poverty reduction programs and environmental sustainability at national and local levels.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
LGPR would coordinate at the central level, and provincial project management offices would 
lead the design and implementation of the project at the provincial level.  The project would 
comprise the following six components:  
 
Component 1: Community Infrastructure and Public Services.  The community infrastructure 
and public services component would reach out to designated poor and remote villages and 
address the lack of basic rural infrastructure and the persistently poor enabling environment for 
participation in economic development.  This component would include investment support for 
village access roads construction and improvements, drinking water supply systems, basic 
housing repair, electrification, communications, and small-scale agriculture production 
infrastructure (such as cisterns and water storage systems, irrigation and drainage, and land 
terracing and other land improvements).  Implementation would build on a demand-driven 
approach to ensure that infrastructure investments will meet the needs that have been identified 
by the villagers themselves as most urgent preconditions for improved well-being.  
 
Component 2:  Household Income Generation and Capacity Building.  The household income 
generation and capacity building component would address the current lack of basic income 
sources in remote villages and provide small block grants to communities, through a Community 
Development Fund (CDF), to support household-level productive activities such as improved 
and diversified crop production, animal husbandry, and other income generating activities.  The 
CDF approach would draw on the experiences of a number of CDD and CDF pilots currently 
being implemented and tested in China.  It would promote the full devolvement of all 
implementation, management and supervision responsibilities to participating villages, with 
informed and self-determined choices for productive activities.  CDF implementation would be 
accompanied by carefully sequenced capacity building at the village level, including farmer 
training in technical and vocational skills, infrastructure operation and management, community 
development, skills training for women, and training in fund operation and management.  
Capacity building would also include support to the extension services of key line bureaus, 
access to market information, and awareness campaigns about off-farm labor opportunities for 
farmers.  
 
Component 3:  Rural Migrants Support. The rural migrant support component would address 
the challenges associated with China's on-going large scale rural-to-urban migration, a defining 
factor of China's urbanization process, with the objective of exploring a replicable model which 
could be scaled-up nationwide.  The identified challenges include unsafe housing conditions and 
harsh living environments, lack of vocational training for better and more stable job 
opportunities, and very limited access to basic social services such as legal assistance and health 
Page  3
care.  The component will support activities to improve migrant workers dormitories, mainly 
through renovation instead of constructing new buildings; providing vocational training; 
establishing migrant community service centers to provide social services such as legal aid, 
AIDS and STD prevention; and care for migrant women and migrant's children including 
protection of women's rights and children's schooling.  The component will only be implemented 
in Wanzhou District and Fuling District (of Chongqing Municipality) where there are large 
concentrations of migrant workers.  
 
Component 4:  Small Town Development.  The small town development component will 
explore an effective way of promoting small town development in poor areas as an intermediate 
step to facilitate the outflow of rural migrants from their home villages.  The component will 
have two major activities.  First, the component will conduct a small town planning pilot which 
will focus on both detailed space planning as well as planning of public service provisioning.  
Second, based on the results of the small town planning pilot, the component will focus on the 
construction of public infrastructure which has been identified as priority investments. Subject to 
the availability of the project funds, possible public infrastructure investments include water 
supply, wastewater treatment, solid waste collection and treatment, farm markets, and migrant 
labor dormitories.  Given the limited project resources, the component will be implemented on a 
very selective basis.  In each project province, the component will be implemented in no more 
than two counties with one small town in each county.  Criteria for selecting the small town 
include whether it is a sub-regional center, the potential for absorbing rural laborers, the spillover 
impact on surrounding villages, and the optimal population size for public facility provision.  It 
has already been agreed in principle that the small towns selected for the component will also be 
included in NDRC's national program of small town reform pilot.  
 
Component 5:  Sustainable Land Management (GEF-co-financing).  The sustainable land 
management component would address land degradation issues that are closely linked with rural 
poverty in marginal areas and caused by unsustainable agricultural and other land use practices, 
lack of alternative income sources, and the limited carrying capacities of the naturally vulnerable 
dryland and mountain ecosystems of the project area.  The component would provide support to 
mitigate land degradation and avoid long-term losses in land resource potential through a mix of: 
(a) land rehabilitation and protection investments, including silt arresting structures, flood bank 
protection, erosion control measures, and restoration of native forest, steppe and grassland 
vegetation, (b) activities to ameliorate current land management, such as improved cropping and 
grazing practices, and community land use planning and zonation to reduce use intensity, (c) 
support for institutional and community-level capacity building, and (d) scaling up proven 
approaches for sustainable and conservation land management in different socio-economic 
environments.  These practices will bring direct and tangible economic and environmental 
benefits to the communities involved in the project but also have national and global 
environmental benefits.  
 
Funding for this component would be sought from the GEF under its Focal Strategy for Land 
Degradation and Operational Program OP15 on Sustainable Land Management.   The component 
would be coordinated under the multi-donor Land Degradation Partnership Framework in China 
and demonstrate sustainable land management practices that are adapted to ecosystem-specific 
conditions that fully complement the project's poverty reduction interventions.  
Page  4
Component 6:  Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.  The project management and 
M&E component would facilitate the efficient implementation of the project and the 
coordination between the various government agencies at national, provincial and local levels.  
Specifically, the component would include support for (a) overall project management and 
implementation, including government staff training, office equipment, vehicles, and (b) design 
and implementation of a comprehensive project management information system (MIS), 
including progress, financial and impact monitoring and evaluation.  In addition, it will support 
the design of the project's overall participatory approach that is envisaged to cover all project 
components.  This would include the development of guidelines for participatory planning of 
community development and productive activities, provision of community facilitators to 
support the set up and operation of CDFs, participatory planning and implementation guidelines 
for the rural migrant workers and small town development components, participatory monitoring 
and evaluation of project activities, and implementation support for the participatory approach.  
 
Lending Instrument and Alternatives Considered.  The project is proposed as a Specific 
Investment Loan.  The previous Bank-supported poverty reduction projects undertaken in 
collaboration with LGPR have also been SILs, and this instrument has proven extremely 
effective in assisting the design of new poverty reduction strategies.  A variety of alternative 
project designs have been considered, including a heavy emphasis on vocational training, 
providing substantial support for basic education and health or for a rural welfare ("dibao") 
system, and subcontracting poverty reduction activities to NGOs and civil society.  It was 
determined that these alternatives were already being heavily supported through other 
government programs and Bank-supported activities and have been dropped from consideration 
for the proposed project.  The current project design best responds to the challenges now facing 
LGPR and the government's efforts to overcome remaining rural poverty.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The proposed project would be implemented in 24 counties and districts in Chongqing, Henan 
and Shaanxi.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The proposed project will be coordinated by FCPMC (affiliated to LGPR at national level), 
which has rich experience in Bank financed projects. At the provincial level, the local FCPMCs 
(affiliated to the provincial poverty leading group offices) will take the lead in project 
management. This arrangement helps assure the proper preparation and implementation of 
safeguard policies. The Shaanxi provincial FCPMC has previously executed a similar village-
based Bank poverty reduction project, and is therefore experienced in safeguard requirements.  
Henan province and Chongqing municipality will need guidance from FCPMC at the central 
level.  Most county level authorities are new to Bank-supported project procedures and will need 
guidance from provincial PMOs (even though they are committed to the project).  In addition, 
the Bank will provide training to provincial and county level PMOs staff on safeguards policies 
and experienced safeguards consultants will be hired in helping with preparation and 
implementation in safeguards instruments.  
 
Page  5
During the Identification Mission, it was noted that no firm actions have been taken for the EA 
preparation, including baseline data collection. Currently each provincial PMO is recruiting the 
EA practitioner for the preparation of the provincial EA/EMPs, and the Identification Mission 
stressed that prior experience with the Bank's project should be listed as one of the key criteria 
for the selection of EA consultants. A training workshop on the Bank's Safeguard Policies will 
be provided to the PMOs/ EA consultants during June 18-22, and the Task Team will work 
closely with the PMOs/ EA consultants to provide technical guidance and to strengthen their 
capacity in document preparation as well as implementation management.

Yes No TBD 
Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) 
X
The project will include rural infrastructure and public services (village roads and paths, 
village water supply, village power supply, small scale production infrastructure), and selected 
small towns infrastructure, which will fall into Category B classification according to OP4.01. A 
consolidated project-wide EA Report and EMP will be prepared to address relevant 
environmental issues.   
Natural Habitats (OP/BP 4.04)

Indigenous Peoples (OP/BP 4.10) 
X
Among the project?s 24 counties/districts, two counties/districts are designated minority 
autonomous areas which comprise concentrated populations of ethnic minority peoples including 
Tujia and Miao. A social assessment will therefore need to be conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of the Bank policy to assess the project?s potential impacts -- both positive and 
adverse -- on these minority communities.   
Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
X
It is expected that limited and scattered land acquisition will be required for a variety of small 
infrastructure activities proposed in the community infrastructure and public service component. 
In addition, resettlement impacts might be involved in migrant support and small town 
development components, but the land acquisition and resettlement impact would be quite 
limited.
