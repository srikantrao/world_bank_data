B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
Continued expansion of access to under-served communities:  Particular attention will be paid to 
the under-served populations, including girls, special needs students, and rural populations.  The 
project aims to:  
 
*
Provide additional school places in lower- and upper-basic schools to maintain the 
enrollment rates in upper basic and to reach universal primary completion by 2015.  [number of 
places to be determined during preparation]  
 
*
Expand access to literacy courses, with particular attention to including illiterate women 
[number of learners and percent of female participants TBD].  
 
Improvements in education quality:  If quality is to improve, the ability of the system to 
effectively measure education quality has to be addressed, and once the problem areas are 
Page  2
identified, pedagogic support to schools has to be aggressively implemented. Therefore project 
aims to:  
 
*
Improve by X% [TBD] the achievement in reading and mathematics of the lowest 
performing students and improve by X% [TBD] overall achievements in primary  
 
*
Improve literacy rates by X% per year [TBD], with particular focus on female literacy  
 
*
Increase the number of instructional hours per year from 674 in 2001 to X [TBD] in 2010  
 
*
Increase the share of qualified teachers in the teaching corps from 60% to X% [TBD]  
 
*
Increase the number of schools benefiting from pedagogic interventions, including 
support from school cluster monitors, from trained school directors and from seasoned teachers  
 
Capacity building and revision of incentive structures:  In the absence of a far-reaching civil 
service reform with a revision of the Government salary scales, the education system has to 
strengthen the capacities of its personnel, and find an effective incentive system that will enable 
it to both reward and sanction them as necessary.  Therefore the project aims to:  
 
*
Increase by X% [TBD] number of positions in the education system with clearly 
identified roles and responsibilities and with qualified personnel assigned to them  
 
*
Execution of personnel incentive system in at least X [TBD] regional and central 
directorates  
 
Monitoring and evaluation system will be in place:  Building on recent improvements in data 
collection and analysis, support would be provided for capacity building at central and regional 
levels in monitoring and evaluation, as well as in the use of data for policy formulation and 
implementation progress tracking.  More specifically, the project would:  
 
*
Ensure availability of validated data for each year, starting with 2005 and available by 
June of the following year   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Expansion of effective access:  The project would support:  
 
*
Creation of school places in under-served areas, with a focus on poor outlying regions (5 
and 6).  Conclusion of school mapping/geo-referencing process.  [The number of classrooms at 
both lower- and upper-basic levels will be determined during preparation]  
 
*
Identification of demand-side measures to expand access to hard-to-reach populations, 
including the provision of English teachers for religious schools (madrassas) that are willing to 
teach the official curriculum [Studies currently underway under PHRD grant]  
 
*
Expansion of the teacher training places within Gambia College, and of in-service 
training opportunities, to ensure the availability of well-trained and qualified teachers in lower- 
and upper-basic schools.  [Numbers of teachers to be determined during preparation]  
 
Improvements in quality:  The project would support:  
 
*
Elaboration of rigorous assessment instruments [work has been started during 
identification] and establishment of a baseline in Year 1 of implementation  
 
*
Design of, and support to, mechanism for providing pedagogic support at the school 
level.  This will provide some support for regional education directorates, but the bulk of the 
support will be for school-level support through the training of school heads, and of senior and 
mentor teachers  
Page  3
*
Provision of qualitative inputs, including textbooks, supplementary readers, school 
libraries, and remedial support for students with poor academic performance  
 
*
Specific attention to instructional time, which is poorly measured now, and uneven if 
anecdotal evidence is to be believed  
 
*
Support to Gambia College to improve both pre- and in-service training of teachers, 
including revision of the teaching program and of student teaching experiences  
 
Capacity building and monitoring/evaluation:  The project would support:  
 
*
Implementation of a training program for all levels of the system.  As a first step, a full 
institutional analysis will be done as well as an audit of the existing capacities within the system 
[the analysis and audit will be conducted during the preparation period].  A training plan will be 
developed, and its implementation will be supported by the credit.  
 
*
Elaboration and implementation of a performance evaluation system with both positive 
and negative incentives built in for results-based team contracts.  The DOSE is currently 
discussing under the IDA and DFID projects a simple performance evaluation system that will 
identify team-level results directly linked to the attainment of the objectives set for the entire 
education system.  Once each team has identified its goals for the year, each team will be 
rewarded on the basis of its performance with regard to the attainment of those goals.  
 
*
Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation system:  The current system has sound 
processes in place, but lacks qualified, long-term personnel to ensure its continued wellbeing.  
Training as well as logistical support will be provided to support the work of the team.
