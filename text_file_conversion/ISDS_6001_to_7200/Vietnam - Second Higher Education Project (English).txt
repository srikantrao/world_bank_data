                                                                                                            components will be implemented by the MOET department responsible for the relevant
                                                                                                            policy area: Higher Education Department, Planning and Finance Department, and

Testing and Education Quality Department. Coordination across these sub-components
will be assured through the establishment of an Advisory Group bringing together on a
regular basis the heads of each of the three implementing units with the Project Manager
and Deputy Manager.

 Under this component, the MOET will (A) establish a credit-based degree delivery
system, adopt a policy/legal framework for private investment in the higher education
sector, and build a Higher Education Management Information System to monitor the
performance of the higher education sector; (B) adopt a rational and transparent
mechanism for State and user funding of HEIs, with means-tested financing policies to
support students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and (C) adopt a fairer and more
efficient HEI admissions system, adopt a set of minimum quality standards against which
each HEI will be required to assess itself, and establish an independent HEI accreditation
mechanism to reinforce these minimum standards.

 Component 2 ("Development of HEI Teaching and Research Capacity") will build
research capacity, improve the quality and relevance of university teaching and research,
improve institutional management and quality assurance, and support integration between
university teaching and research. To do this, the MOET will (A) allocate "Teaching and
Research Improvement Grants" (TRIGs) to HEIs on a competitive basis against detailed
proposals; and (B) deliver training to HEIs in strategy development and institutional
management, as well as in the preparation, management and monitoring/evaluation of
TRIG programs.

 Component 3 ("Project Management") supports a smooth and effective implementation
of the project. This component covers both project coordination ? management and
implementation structure and lines of responsibilities, technical planning, procurement,
financial management and communications and project monitoring and evaluation.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Components 1 & 3: Central Ministry of Education & Training.
 Component 2: Selected universities (in urban centers).
 Under Component 2, the Project may fund the refurbishment of existing teaching,
research or administrative spaces within the university for the purposes of implementing
the university's grant, but may fund neither (i) new construction, whether whole new
buildings or additions to existing buildings, nor (ii) conversion of existing buildings for
new functions (e.g. residential to administrative). Component 2 Guidelines,drafted for
the university grants scheme, will make this clear so that university grants proposals are
within the scope of the scheme.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Under the university grant scheme (Sub-Component 2.2), a HEI may fund the
refurbishment of existing teaching, research or administrative spaces within its existing
campus site for the purposes of implementing its grant, but may fund neither (i) new
construction, whether whole new buildings or additions to existing buildings, nor (ii)
conversion of existing buildings for new functions (e.g. residential to administrative).
The scheme guidelines will indicate what environmental risks, if any, are present in the
each of the study programs that the proposed sub-project would support, and where
environmental risks are present (e.g. treatment and disposal of hazardous waste from
science laboratories), describe the measures that are currently being taken (or that will be
taken during sub-project implementation) to mitigate the environmental risks in these
study programs, and indicate separately what investment costs entailed in mitigating
these risks are included in the proposed sub-project.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
None

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The university grant application form will require HEIs, in setting out their sub-project
proposals, to:
 ?       indicate the percentages of female and male students currently enrolled in each of
the study programs that the proposed sub-project would support, and where a percentage
is less than 40 percent, describe the measures that are currently being taken (or that will

be taken during sub-project implementation) to increase the number of students from the
underrepresented gender in each of these study programs.
 ?       indicate the percentage of ethnic minority students currently enrolled in each of
the study programs that the proposed sub-project would support, and where a percentage
is less than 10 percent, describe the measures that are currently being taken (or that will
be taken during sub-project implementation) to increase the number of ethnic minority
students, female and male, in these study programs.
 A separate Ethnic Minority Development Plan is not required.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
