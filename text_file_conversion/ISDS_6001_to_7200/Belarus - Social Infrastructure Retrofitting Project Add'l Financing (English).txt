 Additional energy efficiency retrofitting will include the same activities as the original
project: (i) replacement of windows, (ii) replacement of lighting systems, and (iii)
replacement of boilers in about 125 buildings (schools and hospitals) will be
implemented under an additional US$ 9 million, including required consultants and
support to PMU. The PMU has been involved in the project to provide technical and
monitoring services with the help of consultants financed under the loan. The PMU?s role
would continue under the additional financing scope. The PMU has been funded from
the government energy efficiency budget.

 The implementation of the SIRP project has been in full compliance with national and
international standards. In the project design and during development technical part of
bidding documents the requirements of local standards are typically used. In case there is
a contradiction between local and international standards, the standards which have
stronger requirements have been used. The project team has supervised the project
regularity and the compliance with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

 During the project implementation asbestos has not been found in the retrofitted
buildings but the revised EMP shall include actions needed if asbestos will be found in
some of the object sites.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project will take place in different regions of Belarus. The project sites have been
preliminary selected based on selection criteria developed for the original project. The
final selection of sites will be done once the tendering process shall start.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The environmental assessment will be triggered to the extent that normal civil works
including replacement of windows, installing additional insulation and installing lighting
will take place during construction. This impact is expected to be moderate and routine,
and Belarus would have the capacity to address any environmental issues that might
arise, including safety, noise and disposal of debris.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
We do not see any potential harmful impact.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Since there is no potential adverse impact, project alternatives have not been considered.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower and its PMU has implemented the original project (P044748) over four
years and has addressed all safeguard issues satisfactorilly and in accordance with the
local legislation. The PMU has adequate capacity to continue meeting safeguards
requirements.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are: the PMU and design and supervision consultant, Department on
Energy Efficiency of the State Standards Committee, oblast and rayon administrations,
social sector facilities (schools, hospitals, kindergartens and orphanages). For disclosure
of safeguard policies the PMU has disclosed using project website, met with primary and
secondary beneficiaries, publications in local mass media, TV interviews and thematic
videoclips.
