The IDA grant which supported the implementation of the initial phase of the reform 
program has the following project components: (i) restructuring of pilot ministries to 
improve service delivery and rationalize procedures (US$14.2 million of which US$9.6m 
Bank financing); (ii) improvement of the motivation of public servants by reforming 
human resources management including the public sector pay and incentive schemes 
(US$6.3m of which US$1.1 Bank financing); (iii) governance reforms aimed at 
improving efficient allocation and use of public resources (US$20.8 of which US$11.7m 
Bank financing), (iv) program coordination (US$3.7m of which US$3.  2m Bank 
financing). The new Government which took office in early 2005 has reiterated its 
commitment to transform the public sector and has requested to restructure the IDA 
project based on the results of the various reviews of the activities that have been carried 
out by program and revised policy priorities.  Under these priorities more emphasis will

be given to make operational the sub-national tiers of the administration in view of 
improving decentralized delivery of public services. In addition, the Government intends 
to focus on improving access to and quality of legal and judicial services. Finally, the 
Government intends to consolidate and further deepen exiting statistical data which is 
vital for public and private sector needs based on a new population census which is 
scheduled for 2007.
