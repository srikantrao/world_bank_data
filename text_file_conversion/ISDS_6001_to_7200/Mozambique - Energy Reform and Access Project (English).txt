  3. Project Description
  Phase 1
  Planned Restructuring. The major modifications proposed for the project, discussed
  further below, are (i) changing two of the four triggers for APL I1in line with the
  Government's revised approach to sector reform and the resulting reallocation of credit
  funds, (ii) changing the project description of the Power Sector Reform Component based
  on the Government's new approach, (iii) reallocating about 30% of the credit proceeds to
  provide additional support for the state-owned electric power utility, Electricidade de
  Mozambique (EdM) and for operationalization of the sector regulatory agency,
  CNELEC. The proposed project restructuring is designed to align support with the new
  direction for sector reform as well as to address implementationproblems in the high
  risk, private sector-driven component and other areas. All elements of the proposed
