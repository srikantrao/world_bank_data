II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
With determined selection criteria, the project will provide funds for micro and small
enterprise which include no land-related issues and result in minor environmental
impacts. So there is no potentially large scale, significant impacts.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
No.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
The project is Category FI project, which consists of a great number of micro and small
subprojects. These subprojects will be chosen also according to an agreed environmental
framework, so that adverse of environmental and social impacts will be avoided or
minimized.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
A sound environmental framework for the selection, preparation and implementation of
all subprojects under the project has been developed and accepted by both the TT and the
CDB. The Framework includes such components as i) Applicable Laws, Policies on
Environment; ii) Environmental Screening of Subprojects; iii) Environmental Assessment
Institutions and Responsibilities; iv) Procedures of Environmental Screening; v)
Environmental Management: Training, Supervision and Monitoring, as well as
Reporting.

 Based on assessment of the CDB capacity, the Framework proposed an environmental
management system within the project: i) Environmental Management Group (EMG) of
CDB, consisting of 3 personnel, one director assigned by the CDB and 2 environmental
consultants (to be selected out of a short list with no objection from the Bank); and ii) an
EMG in the PFI, consisting of 2-3 personnel, one head assigned by the PFI and 1-2
environmental consultants (ratified by EMG/CDB). However, it is agreed that an EMG
at the PFI level will not be mandatory. A PFI can choose between setting up an EMG
with participation from outside, independent EA experts, and designating a senior
manager in charge of EA issues. In the latter case, the designated environmental manager
will have unfettered access to the expert advice of a qualified EA expert, to be engaged
by the PFI.
 CDB will assume overall responsibility for the environmental soundness of the MSE
finance project and take all necessary measures to ensure that PFIs put in place adequate
policies, procedures, organizations, and staffing, to comply with Chinese laws and
regulations on environmental protection. The environmental due diligence measures will
be incorporated in cooperation agreement with PFIs and integrated in the entire credit
process.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The stakeholders of the project mainly include the PFIs and urban and peri-urban MSEs.
The MSEs cannot be identified at this stage nor can the sub-projects to be financed. The
Framework will be distributed among the PFIs, MSEs and be available on the Website of
the CDB.

 Other stakeholders include the SEPA at the national level and EPBs at the local level.
CDB and PFIs are required to communicate closely with these environmental authorities
to seek their guidance and cooperation in enforcing the environmental laws and
regulations, while making every effort to ensure the sustainability of the MSE finance
project.
