2. Project Objectives 
The broad objectives of the Bono de Desarrollo Humano program (BDH) are to reduce 
poverty and promote human capital investments among poor families through the 
provision of direct monetary transfers and incentives for households to invest in human 
capital. World Bank assistance under the proposed APL would aim to contribute to these 
ultimate objectives of poverty reduction and human capital development among poor 
families.  
 
Within that broader context, the development objective of the proposed APL is to 
consolidate the role of the BDH as a conditional cash transfer program and of SelBen as a 
targeting tool for social programs, while supporting the development of an effective 
country social protection strategy to reduce poverty and to foster investments in human 
capital among poor households.  The program will help sustain and strengthen the well-
established and reasonably successful BDH program and will help ensure protection of 
the fiscal space for the monetary transfers made under the BDH to poor families.  
 
Phase 1 of the APL would support the transformation of the BDH into an effective cash 
transfer program that protects the vulnerable and fosters investment by poor families in 
human capital.  “Effectiveness” would be assessed in terms of:  (i) the targeting and 
coverage of benefits; (ii) efficacy of the transfer and co-responsibilities to foster 
Page  2
investment by beneficiary families in human capital; and (iii) the capacities of involved 
institutions (including PPS staff, sectoral ministries, service providers, and beneficiary 
groups) to manage the program efficiently, to monitor results, and to evaluate impacts.   
 
3. Project Description 
The proposed APL will have two phases. The first phase for US$80 million in Bank 
financing will extend over three years.  During this phase US$5 million will finance 
technical assistance and other institutional strengthening activities in component 1, while 
the remaining resources will be disbursed under component 2. Phase 2 of the APL would 
consolidate and deepen the reforms initiated during phase 1, and if possible would further 
improve the design of the BDH program based on knowledge and experience gathered 
under Phase 1.  
 
The project would support two components:  
 
Component 1: Institutional strengthening, consolidation of BDH reform and improved 
articulation of BDH within a comprehensive social protection strategy (US$5 million). 
This component seeks:  (i) to strengthen the core institutional structure of the BDH; (ii) to 
support the consolidation of reforms in several of the program’s key activities and 
processes; and (iii) to explore and pilot linkages with complementary programs to protect 
and provide opportunities for poor and vulnerable households in Ecuador.  For this 
purpose the project will support activities in the following priority areas:  
 
a. 
Institutional strengthening: The objective of this subcomponent is to ensure that 
the technical, institutional and legal conditions necessary to guarantee a successful 
implementation of the BDH reform program are in place.  
 
b.
Consolidation of BDH reforms. The objective of this subcomponent is to 
accompany and support the implementation of ongoing BDH reforms, while promoting 
access to program information and knowledge among BDH beneficiaries, administrators 
and others.  
 
c. 
Mechanisms for BDH beneficiary self-sufficiency and sustainable graduation and 
articulation of BDH within a social protection strategy. The objective of this 
subcomponent is to support the identification and evaluation of initiatives to improve 
program effectiveness and to help BDH beneficiaries gain access to complementary 
programs and services with the goal of promoting sustainable BDH graduation strategies. 
The subcomponent also contemplates actions to integrate the BDH and other programs 
within a broader social protection strategy whose implementation could be supported 
under the second phase APL.  
 
Component 2: Protection of cash transfers to the poor to foster investments in health, 
nutrition, and education.  (US$75 million).  
 
Component 2 would support and protect the transfers themselves, while at the same time 
providing a performance-based incentive for achievement of results from the institutional 
strengthening activities.  It also creates a strategic alliance between the two main agencies 
Page  3
involved in the project, the PPS and the MoF, so that the latter has strong incentives to 
support the former in achieving or even exceeding program implementation goals.  
 
Specifically, this component would finance “per transfer incentive payments”, 
disbursing against BDH transfers to households with children ages 0-16 and subject to 
education and/or health co-responsibilities.  The value of these disbursements would be 
tied to overall project performance:  as key “Performance Milestones” (supported by 
activities under component 1) are achieved, the amount of the per transfer incentive 
payments would increase.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The project triggers the Bank’s indigenous Peoples’ Policy OP/BP4.10 , which requires 
an IPP to ensure that indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorians peoples participate in and benefit 
in a culturally appropriate way.  As part of project preparation, an IPP was prepared by 
the Government of Ecuador in collaboration with a Social Specialist from the World 
Bank.  The proposed project will make efforts to (a) ensure the registrations of 
indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples to be benefit from the project; and (b) monitor 
the participation receipt of benefits of such population, supporting culturally appropriated 
social control by such beneficiaries (See Annex 10 of PAD).   
 
Page  4
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The project is design to avoid adverse impacts. It is expected that with the co-
responsibilities, school attendance (and, possibly, attainment) and nutritional status of 
young indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian children would further improve.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N.A.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The full IPP was prepared and discussed with the government with technical assistance 
from the World Bank, to incorporate the participation of indigenous peoples during 
project design and particularly during implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The 
borrower’s capacity to address social issues appears to be adequate in terms of the Social 
Assessment. The project operational manual includes necessary arrangements for 
staffing, and training the PPS in accordance with the social criteria and procedures 
established.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Target beneficiaries include the bulk of the Indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, and mestizo 
population, living in extreme and high poverty conditions in rural and urban areas of the 
country.  The proposed project will support the Government's own program, and as such 
builds on prior consultations carried out with key stakeholders. In addition, as part of 
preparation of the proposed project, joint consultations have been carried out by the 
Social Protection Program of the MBS, and representatives of the Consejo de Desarrollo 
de las Nacionalidades y Pueblos Indigenas del Ecuador (CODENPE), the CorporaciÃ³n 
de Desarrollo Afroecuatoriana (CODAE), the National Directorate of Indigenous Health 
(D.N.S.P.I.) of the Ministry of Health and the National Directorate of the Intercultural 
Bilingual Education (DINEIB) at the Ministry of Education, and with technical assistance 
from the World Bank.  
 
The objectives of the consultations were threefold: (a) to assess the perceptions and 
expectations of beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the BDH; (b) to address  lessons 
learned, particularly for the Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian beneficiaries, and those 
excluded due to geographic, linguistic isolation; and (c) to make suggestions to improve 
the operational procedures and manner of delivery of the BDH.  
 
The social assessment shows that the program is well received by the majority of the 
population. Specific suggestions to eliminate the inefficiencies in the mechanisms of 
registration and delivery of cash transfers in rural areas, particularly in isolated areas, 
have been taken into consideration and included in the project implementation plan. The 
Project will support the program reforms to ensure that the implementation of the co-
responsibility is based on consultative and participatory methods, and in this context, 
Page  5
periodic consultations have been designed into the project with emphasis on Indigenous 
Afro-Ecuadorian people.  The outcomes of these consultations have been used as key 
inputs for the preparation of the Indigenous Peoples Plan.  
 
Drawing from the lessons learned from these consultations, as well as from the results 
of the program's impact evaluation, the minister of Social Welfare has proposed a social 
outreach strategy to ensure the inclusion of the vulnerable groups of the population, and 
that ethnic and racial characteristics are taken into consideration.  Specific actions have 
been included in the project design to ensure that: (i) the screening of beneficiaries 
incorporates ethnic variables; (ii) access to birth certificates and IDs (cÃ©dulas) by 
beneficiaries in isolated areas is facilitated; (iii) training and capacity building of the most 
vulnerable beneficiaries considers language and cultural characteristics; (iv) a 
participatory social accountability system is put in place, including the implementation of 
social controls mechanisms with emphasis on inclusion of indigenous and Afro-
Ecuadorian communities; and (v) that the procedures for filing claims and grievances are 
widely communicated in a culturally appropriate manner.  
 
Finally, the Monitoring and Evaluation sub-component of the project will help the 
program monitor that indigenous peoples practices, their organizations, and their 
language are taken into consideration during project implementation and that corrective 
actions are put in place as needed.  In addition, to the extent possible, evaluations will 
strive to assess variations in results among people of different ethnicities.  
 
The IPP was finalized and will be made public in Ecuador and through the 
Bank’sInfoshop prior to appraisal
