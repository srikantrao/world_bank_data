B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
To assist the Municipality of Cubat√£o in addressing key local bottlenecks constraining 
sustainable growth and development within the Baixada Santista, through targeted investments 
coupled with policies and planning capacity improvements.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
The Carta Consulta, approved in March 2005, defines execution of the Guar√° Vermelho Project 
in two stages, each of three yearsí duration. The first phase wouldrequire funding of US$14.6 
million and the second US$12.3 million. The decision by the Federal Foreign Secretariat 
(SEAIN) to split the project into two stages was taken to ensure the municipal capacity to 
develop the project and is not related to fiscal constraints. The Carta Consulta has identified the 
following key activities.  
 
1. Addressing development bottlenecks, focusing on key thematic areas: (a) Improve municipal 
policies and management tools to maximize development opportunities; (b) Develop 
Page  2
mechanisms to address key local bottlenecks hindering regional interests; and, (c) Develop a 
comprehensive plan to address territorial land-use conflicts associated with illegal occupation of 
the Atlantic Forest protected area and the Santos Estuaryís mangrove.  
 
2. Addressing economic, institutional, social and environmental conflicts in Vila dos 
Pescadores:  
 
(a) Through investments: eliminate bottlenecks hampering the effective operation of 
infrastructure, including the railroad and oil pipeline; address acute conflicts with the 
Minist√©rio P√∫blico and environmental agencies; address the areaíscritical social risks 
associated with the extremely hazardous living conditions through the provision of appropriate 
urban services and governmental presence in the area; resettle about 60% (~2,000) of the 
families currently inhabiting wetted mangrove areas, the railroad and the Petrobr√°s pipeline 
right-of-way. Provideappropriate solutions for harmonizing the Vila dos Pescadores settlement 
with the railroad duplication and operational safety requirements as well as protection of the oil 
pipeline; address acute conflicts with the Minist√©rio P√∫blico and environmental agencies by 
reducing occupation of mangrove habitats and implementing restoration measures; address the 
areaís critical social risks through the provision of appropriate urban services and governmental 
presence in the area; resettle about 60% (~2,000) of the families currently inhabiting wetted 
mangrove areas, the railroad and the oil pipeline.  
 
Preliminary resettlement alternatives include:  
 
i) New housing in four floor apartment buildings immediately contiguous to Vila dos 
Pescadores, financed by the State Housing Company (CDHU). Highly subsidized financing 
mechanisms adopted (monthly payment around US$25.00 for 25 years, corresponding to 
US$7,500 compared to construction costs estimated at US$13,000). Due to the land scarcity, 
municipal regulation does not allow construction of one floor low income housing.  
 
ii) Assisted cash compensation with each family receiving cash compensation for loss of 
housing. This process is facilitated by social workers to ensure cash is used to buy a house and 
that the house is of an appropriate condition. This approach enables: a reduction in the number of 
families living in the Vila dos Pescadores; reduces social stress by offering tailored resettlement 
alternatives; reduces investments costs; accelerates resettlement implementation; facilitates a 
dialogue with the Minist√©rio P√∫blico and licensing. Cash amounts are based on costs of 
appropriate low-income housing alternatives in the market, which are less than the cost of 
constructing new apartments on land that typically requires costly solutions to the unsuitable 
foundations. Formal letter of credit alternatives are not appropriate since it requires buying 
through the formal market, in which prices are much higher. This approach would require the use 
government counter part funds. No cost for the resettled family. Mechanism already used by the 
Municipality of Cubat√£o, although the use of funds from the State, through CDHU is the 
municipalityís first option. This approach is used by municipal governments throughout Brazil.  
 
(b) Through technical assistance: adopt appropriate participatory methodology to facilitate 
implementation of the planning phase and civil works in view of conflicting territorial land-uses; 
Page  3
enhance social corporate activities in partnership with IFC, which is already engaged with 
Cubat√£oís industrial complex.  
 
3. Addressing institutional capacity requirements: facilitate supporting mechanisms to ensure 
efficient project implementation and controls (fiduciary, technical, safeguard and M&E) through 
the existing municipal management systems. A semi-integrated Project Implementation Unit will 
be created using Municipal staff who will be supported, as required, by Consultants on specific 
technical issues.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
Activities will be undertaken within the Municipality of Cubatao, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil.   
 
E.  Borrowerís Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
The proposed project will include all appropriate mechanisms and technical capacity measures to 
ensure full compliance with the Banks safeguard policies. The Client has successfully 
undertaken several similar resettlement programs involving families living in areas such as those 
of the project beneficiaries. The State Environmental Secretariat has stringent licensing 
requirements at the feasibility, technical design and implementation stages that comply with the 
Banks safeguard policies. Where necessary, the Client will be assisted by safeguard experts in 
order to improve institutional capacity during project preparation and implementation.

full EA will be prepared prior to Project Appraisal in compliance with Bank safeguard 
requirements. The EA will be based on the feasibility studies and will address issues covered by 
the Natural Habitats and Forests policies. The State Environmental Secretariat requires a more 
detailed EA/EMP at the technical design and implementation stages that will compliment 
compliance of Bank safeguard policies.
