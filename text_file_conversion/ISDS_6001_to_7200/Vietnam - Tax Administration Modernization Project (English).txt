                                                                                                  Public    further expand and roll out the reforms required to modernize tax administration and
                                                                                                            enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection. Tax collection will be based on
                                                                                                            voluntary compliance facilitated by an appropriate combination of taxpayer service and
                                                                                                            assistance programs, with strengthened audit and enforcement capacity. The introduction

of self-assessment, the organization of tax administration along functional lines, re-
engineering and computerization of business processes, and the introduction of best
practice human resource management policies are key elements of the reform. The
Project would entail an investment over a period of five years needed to achieve the
stated objectives. The project would have four main components:

 i.     An institutional development component that would deal with the reorganization
of tax administration to match new operational requirements; strengthen the legal and
regulatory framework; improve human resource management, and develop a strong focus
on integrity.

 ii.    An operational development component that would improve the operational
processes and strengthen the operational functions in all phases of work, from
registration, declaration and payment processing, to the downstream activities of audit,
enforcement, arrears collection, taxpayer services and dispute resolution .

 iii.   An IT Development component that would procure and tailor an Integrated tax
Administration Information System (ITAIS) and procure an IT infrastructure to support
the modernized tax operations.

 iv.    A project management component that will lay special emphasis on change
management in tax administration, ensure timely and efficient application of resources,
carry out procurement and financial management activities of the project, and interact
with all local and international entities involved in project execution.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
The project location would be the head office of the General Department of the Taxation
(GDT) in Hanoi, and most of the tax offices in all the provinces and districts.
