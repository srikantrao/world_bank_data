The project components include the following components:  
 
I.  Institutional Development.  There will be three sub-components within this 
component:  (i) Fiscal Management and Adjustment; (ii) Environmental and Urban 
Management; and (iii) Scaling-Up Capacity.  
 
IA.  Fiscal Management and Adjustment:  This sub-component aims to place the 
municipality on a long-term sustainable fiscal path. The objective is to improve 
institutional and technical capacity of the Municipal Finance and Planning Secretariats in 
the design and implementation of a medium-term fiscal adjustment framework.  This will 
include five primary actions:  (i) establishment of a fiscal studies department within the 
Finance Secretariat; (ii) institution of a program to control personnel expenditures; (iii) 
installation of a permanent working group that will analyze costs and propose cost 
containment measures for the most important municipal activities (notably health and 
education); (iv) strengthening of budgetary and financial execution capacity; and (v) 
improved management of contracts and agreements of direct and indirect municipal 
administration.  
 
IB.  Environmental and Urban Management:  This component will support federal 
efforts to, on the one hand, further decentralize environmental planning, management and 
licensing responsibilities and on the other hand, promote greater flexibility in the use of 
urban planning and development instruments and the promotion of public-private 
partnerships for urban development.  This sub-component will include actions to support 
the Environmental Secretariat with a primary focus on the development of the municipal 
environmental licensing procedures in order to lessen this regulatory burden  Urban 
development activities will assess the feasibility of instruments to induce greater private 
sector participation in urban land development, particularly for projects benefiting the 
poor and reducing regulatory barriers that often make land development excessively 
costly (reducing benefits for the poor) and often economically unviable (it currently takes 
an average of 3-5 years to secure development approvals in Recife). Providing greater 
synergy between development and environmental approval processes are essential to 
reducing barriers to land development and reducing the costs of such development.  
 
IC.  Scaling-Up Capacity:  This component will include Project Management assistance, 
supervision of works, monitoring and evaluation and project communication with the 
public.  It supports those activities that are essential to effective implementation and the 
reduction of operational risk.  Further, it will focus on increasing the capacity of the 
municipality to manage multi-sector, large-scale projects, focusing on improving project 
design and appraisal capacity, coordinating multi-sector activities and improving 
monitoring and evaluation capacity.  
 
II.  Integrated Urban Territorial Development:  This component will include investments 
that are aimed at improving the quality of urban spaces along the margins of the river 
through the development of new, or the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, with the 
aim of improving
 the quality of life of the areaís poor population.  These physical 
improvements will focus on four macro areas of intervention:  Slum Regularization and 
Page  3
Water Supply and Sanitation; Parks and Green Spaces; Macro Drainage Systems; and 
Increasing Accessibility and Urban Mobility.  
 
IIA.  Slum Regularization and Water Supply and Sanitation Systems will include 
macro-infrastructure investments to ensure adequate service levels in the region and the 
integrated development of poor communities through the mu
nicipalityís system of 
ëintegrated WSSí development (i.e., water supply, sewerage, drainage, paving, urban 
upgrading, housing resettlement/improvements, tenure regularization and related 
activities).  The integrated WSS investments to be supported under this component 
include:  the implantation of integrated urban upgrading and WSS in UEs 39 and 40 
(wastewater drainage sub-basins into which RMR was divided in the 2000 wastewater 
management master plan) including the integrated development of 17 extremely poor 
ZEIS communities  The vast majority of the 200,000 plus direct beneficiaries are poor.  
These 17 communities represent extreme pockets of poverty and have been designated as 
ZEIS areas giving them special treatment as regards reduced urban standards and fast-
track status for land tenure regularization.  
 
IIB.  Parks and Green Space will focus on the provision of leisure spaces that 
incorporate and consolidate the goals of environmental protection, cultural development 
and facilitate access to organized community activities.  The aim is to foster sustainable 
development, through the provision of public goods, reducing the pressures to occupy 
these spaces for private use and thus facilitate the ability of the public authorities to 
control the unlawful occupation of these areas.  The sub-component includes the creation 
of the Apipucos Park and the expansion and recuperation of the Parks Caiara, Santana 
and the recovery of degraded areas that were formerly occupied by squatter settlements.  
 
IIC.  Macro Drainage investments are required to improve water flow and reduce 
flooding incidence in the project area.  The existing drainage system has been severely 
compromised by poor maintenance and the encroachment of informal housing along the 
margins of the existing canals.  Resettlement will therefore be a key element of this sub-
component, as will the treatment of the margins of the canals with investments in tree 
planting, mini-parks, etc. to prevent the re-occupation of these areas.  Investments will 
include the recovery of the ABC, Buriti/Macaxeira, Caiara, Jenipapo, Parnamirim, Prado, 
Santa Rosa, S√£o Mateus, Serpro, Sport and Valen√ßa canals.  
 
IID.  Increasing Accessibility and Urban Mobility focuses on improving access to and 
mobility (including roads and bikeways) within the projectís geographic boundaries.  It 
will serve to facilitate the physical integration of the two sides of the river and provide 
greater access to both the local communities and the city as a whole to public transport, 
the parks that will be built and recuperated, and other physical assets in the area.  It will 
also include bike paths along the margins of the river, connecting the parks and serving as 
both a barrier to re-occupation of the river banks, and to promote environmental 
protection and sustainable economic development of the territory.  
 
III.  Social, Environmental and Economic Development:  As has been learned with 
projects that focus on improving the built environment in low-income communities, 
Page  4
physical investments can be used as an entry point for targeting social activities for low-
income residents.  This component will focus on activities designed to provide incentives 
for the participatory social and economic development of these communities and at the 
same time raise awareness of the natural environment of the region.  To that end, this 
component will include two sub-components:(i); Job and Income Generation Assistance 
(ii) Environmental and Sanitary Education  
 
IIIA. Job and Income Generation Assistance will focus on micro-business owners, both 
individuals and collectives and assist them in their capacity to generate income and 
employment.  The sub-component will include the installation of a Public Employment 
and Income Generation Center in the project area as a business incubator and will serve 
to identify local barriers to employment and income generation.  The sub-component will 
also promote several areas considered priority including the installation of a solid waste 
triage center to support the 700 people in the project area that survive on the collection of 
recyclable materials, support small water transportation businesses that could serve to 
stimulate tourism in the area, and support to youth at risk given Recifeís current status as 
themost violent city in Brazil and the particular high levels of crime and violence in the 
Project area (e.g. in Vila Detran).  
 
IIIB.  Environmental and Sanitary Education will focus on raising environmental 
consciousness.  The Projeto √?
guas do Capibaribe will be expanded under this sub-
component.  This will include the Escola Ambiental do Capibaribe which links with the 
formal municipal primary school education curriculum, by taking school groups on 
educational boat trips along the Capibaribe River to inform them on the natural 
environment of the river and the cultural and economic significance of the region.  It will 
also include environmental and sanitary education aimed at building capacity of 
institutions and teachers to build environmental and sanitation education, generally, into 
their curricula.  In addition, it will also focus on raising environmental and sanitation 
awareness in the beneficiary community, working through existing municipal program 
such as Family Health.  Community Participation is embedded into these activities will 
focus on meetings, assemblies and community consultations in the process of project 
implementation and ex-post project supervision.  It will also include the development of 
Civil Defense Units to highlight to the community the prevalence of natural risks in the 
project area, and how to minimize these.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
The municipality of Recife, capital of the state of Pernambuco, is situated in the centre-
east of the Northeast region of Brazil, covering an area of 220 square kilometers, with a 
population of 1.422.905 inhabitants - according to the IBGE Census for year 2000. The 
entire population of the Recife municipality is located in the urban area.  The 
municipality is the hub of the respective Metropolitan Region and suffers accordingly 
from a number of demographic, social and economic problems resulting from the 
uncontrolled process of urbanization.  This is reflected in growing deterioration of the 
housing and working conditions of the population and the consequent lowering of 
people's quality of life. Rapid urban growth is also highlighted by the accompanying 
Page  5
environmental degradation and in the increasing social and economic vulnerability of the 
lower income groups within the population.   
 
The Project embraces an area within the basin of the Capibaribe River.  The eastern 
boundary of the area is formed by the Agamenon Magalh√£es Avenue, to the west by 
BR-101, to the north by Avenida Norte and to the south by Avenida Caxag√°.  
 
Figure 1: Boundaries of the area covered by the Capibaribe Melhor Project  
 
Approximately 56,349 families live in this area, forming a total population of around 
225,396 inhabitants.  The population is distributed in 36 neighborhoods with 116,244 
people living on the ìright bankî of the Capibaribe River, while 109,152 have made their 
homes on the ìleft bankî.  
 
Recife possesses a high deficit of green area per inhabitant (ie: green space containing 
leisure installations/equipments).  At present this ratio amounts to 0.70m2 per inhabitant, 
which is contrary to a number of rulings, including State Law 9.990 which recommends 
an area of 6m2 /inhab.  The United Nations recommends 12m2 /inhab.  
 
The area covered by the Project suffers from a lack of sewage and wastewater disposal 
facilities.  This has been responsible for polluting the Capibaribe River, its tributaries and 
the A√ßude de Apipucos.  The direct result has been seriousdegradation of the water 
quality of the above and deterioration of the environmental quality of the entire region. In 
the area of the Project located on the right bank of the Capibaribe River there is no 
conventional sewage system.  Its 8 ënon-conventionalí sewage systems (SES) serve 12% 
of the dwelling units in the area while the rest of the region has no sewage collection at 
all.  Most of the left bank area of the Capibaribe River falls within the ëPeixinhos 
Systemí and  two non-conventional sewage systems are still in working order.  Almost all 
of the above-mentioned existing systems have fallen into disrepair, do not work properly 
and need repair .  
 
The A√ßude de Apipucos is seriously polluted as a result of sewage and garbage 
entering its hydrographic basin.  These effluents reach the a√ßude through the drainage 
system of the basin.  Cleaning activities are frequently required on account of the huge 
proliferation of aquatic plants of the Eichhornia crassipes variety, also known in 
Portuguese as baronesa or aguap√©.  Due to their fast growth rate  in nutrient-rich 
waters, this community of plants has taken over large areas of the water surface 
effectively undermining the A√ßude.  
 
The water supply system in the Project area also presents a number of serious problems, 
mainly because of the intermittent and unmetered supply system.  The situation is made 
even worse on account of the high leakage rate.  
 
The area covered by the Project is crisscrossed by 19 drainage canals.  This canal 
system runs across low gradient sedimentary surfaces (planicies). The following 
Page  6
situations have been observed with respect to these canals: (i) a lowering of the river 
channel and the canal beds; (ii) increasing occupation of natural flood plains/meadows 
(v√°rzeas); (iii) silting up; (iv) accumulation of garbage andvegetable matter as well as a 
variety of other obstructions.  These factors make it difficult for the water to run normally 
through the canals and flooding is obviously a high risk as a result.  Since rainwater is 
frequently mixed with sewage, health risks certainly exist for the communities affected 
by flooding.  
 
The Capibaribe River cuts across the Project area from west to east, forming a 
geographical boundary which divides the north from the south region  - mainly along the 
stretch between the II and IV Perimetral Metropolitana: respectively the R√∫a Jos√© 
Bonif√°cio and the BR-101. Thus the road system in this region is essentially regulated 
by the Capibaribe River and the bridges on the Perimetral Metropolitana II and the BR-
101. This is where the main traffic flows converge, causing frequent traffic congestion .

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
During the preparatory stage of the Capibaribe Melhor Project, the present Environmental 
Assessment Report was prepared in accordance with the terms of reference approved by 
the World Bank team, in order to comply with the environmental policies of the Bank 
applicable to category ìAî Projects.  
 
The EIA examined the potential positive and negative environmental impacts of the 
proposed Project, comparing them with viable alternatives and possible different 
scenarios (including under-performance of the Project) and recommended a series of 
necessary measures designed to avoid, minimize, mitigate or compensate for adverse 
Page  7
impacts while (i) maximizing the positive impacts and (ii) improving performance with 
respect to environmental management initiatives under the aegis of the Project.  
 
The mitigating measures of the negative impacts were included in an Environmental 
Management Plan (EMP) involving incorporation of an environmental management 
system during the implementation of the undertaking.  Eleven environmental programs 
were in fact proposed.  Costings were drawn up for each programme, together with 
schedules.  Reference was made to the bodies that would be responsible for program 
implementation.  
 
Given that environmental degradation in the Basin of the Capibaribe has reached 
appalling levels, particularly in the area planned for Project intervention, and the obvious 
need to improve living conditions for the population involved, the Project clearly presents 
a
positive environmental externality.  It is important to emphasize that this Project 
comprises a group of interventions of an urbanistic, environmental and social nature.  As 
such, the Project is intended to improve the environmental situation in the Capibaribe 
basin and help reduce the urban and social vulnerability of the population.  The Project in 
this respect plans investments with a view to improving the dwelling conditions of a total 
of 19,725 people living in 25 poor areas within the Project area .  
 
Together with the above interventions, a number of environmental protection initiatives 
were conceived. The key initiatives covered activities focused on (i) the implementation 
and recovery of three urban parks; (ii) the regulation of four ZEPAs located in and 
around the Project area; and (iii) the structuring and installation of the Subcommittee of 
the Basin of the Capibaribe River of the RMR (Recife Metropolitan Region).  As a 
complement to the above, activities to reinforce municipal environmental management, 
principally with respect to the municipalization of the environmental licensing procedures 
and up-scaling environmental enforcement, are of great importance for the sustainability 
of the Project given that the municipal environmental management structure was set up 
recently (2001) and is still in the formative stage.  
 
During project preparation several public consultation were conducted during meetings 
with CPRH, Ministerio Publico, and micro-regional forums of participatory budget 
program.  Public consultations of this EIA took place on January 9, 2006.  
 
PO/PB 4.04 - NATURAL HABITAT  
 
The Natural Habitat Safeguards Policy was activated by the Capibaribe Melhor Project 
in view of the proposals for interventions in permanent conservation areas  (APPs), 
according to Municipal Law 16.930/2003 and on the area of land protected under the 
Parque Apipucos ZEPA, which will be the site of the aforementioned park.  In 
accordance with Law 16.609 of 2000, the Parque Apipucos Conservation Unit was set up 
within the Parque Apipucos ZEPA to afford special protection for the existing 
ecosystems within the area.  However, the ZEPAs and the Conservation Unit have not yet 
been regulated.  
 
Page  8
The APPs of the Capibaribe Melhor Project comprise the following: (i) a 120 metre long 
strip along the banks of the Capibaribe River (width varying between 60 to 130 metres); 
(ii) a 40 metre long strip along the other watercourses of up to 10 metres wide; (iii) of 15 
metre strip around the wet perimeter of the A√ßude de Apipucos; (iv) the manguezal 
(mangrove swamp) area.  
 
According to Municipal Law 16.930/2003, which is compatible with the National Forest 
Code, the total or partial removal of permanent conservation vegetation will be allowed 
only for executing works, plans, activities or projects that are considered to be of public 
or social interest and providing prior agreement has been given by the Municipal 
Environmental and Urban Development Councils and express authorization has been 
handed down by the Municipal Executive Power.  The APPs of the Capibaride Melhor 
Project relate in effect to the urbanized areas in accordance with the Forestry Code. They 
aim to comply with the ëminimum strips specificationsí as defined in the Forestry Code 
in line with the urban reality of the locality and with the objective of minimizing social 
impacts.  The municipality of Recife, in conformity with the requirements of the Code 
covering permits for urbanized areas, possesses an Environmental Council (COMAM) 
with deliberative power and a ëMaster Planí.  This latter body is responsible for assessing 
requests for removal of vegetation or the maintenance of areas occupied within the APPs.  
 
In order to verify any changes that had been caused by the implementation of the 
Capibaribe Project in the Permanent Conservation Areas alongside the Capibaribe River, 
an aerial photography survey was carried out. This survey produced the following results:

Since various interventions have been planned under the aegis of the Project (parks, 
ETE, roads etc) in the area bordering the Capibaribe River, it was obvious that increased 
occupation would take place along the APP strip.  Before the Project, 70.5% of the APP 
was occupied whereas after the Project had been implemented 80.5% of the area will be 
Page  9
occupied.  The additional occupations is due to the substantial expansion of the park 
areas in accordance with the table below.

The Project will have a highly positive impact on natural habitats since it will finance 
investments in the three parks and green areas described above.  In this sense, the Project 
will mitigate the impact that will be caused to the APPs. Moreover, the Project will 
provide funding for regulating the four ZEPAs located in the area covered by the Project.  
 
PO/PB 4.12 -INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT  
 
It is estimated at 1,453 families will be re-settled as a result of the implementation of the 
interventions proposed under the aegis of the Project. In order to comply with the 
requirements of World Bank resettlement policy and to plan correctly the resettlement of 
the families that will be affected by the interventions of the Capibaribe Melhor Project, a 
Conceptual Resettlement Framework was drawn up, pending elaboration of the PDRI 
during the first year of the Project. The choice of a Conceptual Framework is justified by 
the fact that the physical interventions remain to be detailed at basic Project level.  For 
identification of potential land where families could be re-settled, a series of field visits 
was carried out and plots identified near to the areas from which families are to removed- 
which should help minimize the negative impacts of resettlement.  
 
PO/PB 4.09-PEST MANAGEMENT  
 
Since the Project takes into account activities for creating and improving the three urban 
parks of Recife, it is necessary to activate the Pest Management Safeguard in order to 
minimize the environmental dangers and impacts on public health due to the use of 
pesticides in green areas.  
 
The urban parks of Recife are maintained and conserved by the Urban Cleansing and 
Maintenance Company EMLURB.  In the area of plant health, the Prefecture needs to 
control two principal pests at present: termites and ants.  The places where treatment is 
going to be applied is previously visited by agronomist who determines the quantity and 
type of procedures necessary.  In the case of termites, the material that is required for 
spraying consists of an insecticide - piretrine and piretroid of low toxicity (deltramine). 
For ants, a granulated substance  (sulframide) is used as bait, of toxicity class IV (low 
toxicity).  In compliance with the requirements under Federal Law number 9.974/00 , the 
Page  10
empty pesticide receptacles are rinsed three times and together with the material 
employed in the procedures described above are stored in suitable places registered by 
ANDEF and ANDAV.  
 
PO 4.11  CULTURAL HERITAGE  
 
The Cultural Heritage Safeguard was activated by the Capibaribe Melhor Project given 
that the area covered by the Project is of great historical and cultural importance, 
comprising 13 Special Historical and Cultural Heritage Preservation Zones of the total of 
33 such a zones existing in the entire municipality.  Some of the proposed interventions 
are located around or nearby the ZEPH, but none has direct impact on the ZEPH.  
 
During the implementation of the works, activities requiring the use of heavy equipment 
could interfere with the ZEPH located near to the interventions.  The following are the 
main sites at risk: ZEPH 15 
ñ
Casa Grande do Engenho Barbalho (near to the 
Comunidade Airton  Senna and Santa Marta); ZEPH 02 - Apipucos and ZEPH 05 - 
Po√ßo da Panela.  Damage could be caused by activity close to any of these sites.  The 
Prefecture of Recife needs to require contractors to adopt specific steps to avoid damage 
during the execution of works near to the ZEPAs.  Detailed procedures can be found in 
the Environmental Construction Plan (PAC).  In order to comply with the Protection of 
Cultural Heritage Policy, strict procedures will be included in building contracts when 
significant historical and cultural assets are at stake.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
There are no indirect and/or long-term impacts associated from the activities in the 
project area.  The package of investments will have a net positive impact on the 
environment in that they include improvements in water supply and sanitation this 
reducing water losses, improving coverage and collection of sewage and primary 
treatment; parks and open space to improve environmental conditions in the project area 
Page  11
and the recovery of degraded areas; improvements in traffic circulation reducing 
congestion and air quality impacts; and improving macro-drainage through the 
recuperation of drainage canals.   
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Alternatives for reducing impacts were analyzed in -going Environmental Impact 
Assessment.  Most of the negative impacts associated with the proposed project are the 
those typically associated with the construction phase.  As a result, an Environmental 
Plan for Construction (PAC) was prepared and will be included in all construction 
bidding documents.  This is more fully described below. This will largely include action 
to be taken during construction to minimize negative impacts.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The Borrower is preparing an Environmental Assessment, including impact on natural 
habitats and development of an environmental management plan.  The Borrower has also 
prepared a Resettlement Framework that will guide the development of the Resettlement 
Action Plans that will be prepared prior to the bidding of any works projects requiring 
resettlement of families.  
 
The Environmental Management Plan outlines many of the actions to be taken by the 
Borrower during Project implementation.  This is summarized below.  
 
The Environmental Assessment includes various measures of mitigation, compensation 
and reinforcement to ensure reduction of the negative impacts and to highlight the 
positive impacts.  These measures, together with their costs, schedules and organs/bodies 
responsible for their implementation, are set out in the Environmental Management Plan.  
The activities described in the Environmental Management Plan were included as Project 
components.  
 
System of environmental management: a System of Socio-Environmental Management 
(SGA) will be set up in the Recife Urbanization Company (URB/Recife) - linked to the 
Secretariat for Participative Planning, Works and Urban/Environmental Development and 
forming part of the Project Management System with the following responsibilities: (i) to 
coordinate the socio-environmental aspects of the Project; (ii) to inspect, follow up and 
provide  guidance for the execution of the mitigating measures called for by the various 
environmental permits and the recommendations laid down in the Environmental 
Construction Plan; (iii) to supervise implementation of the sub components 
ëenvironmental educationí and ëinstitutional strengtheningí.  URB/Recife is responsible 
overall for Environmental Management butwill call for assistance from contractor firms.  
The costs of this activity are included in the administration and management of the 
Project.  
 
Programme of Social Communication: this programme is already an integral part of the 
Capibaribe Melhor Project (component 3 ñ ëInstitutional Developmentí/Subcomponent: 
ëManagement, Monitoring and Assessment of the Projectí) and as a resultthe cost, 
amounting to R$81.000,00, is already incorporated in the overall cost of the Project.  This 
Page  12
programme aims to facilitate implementation of the Project through the involvement of 
the population directly and indirectly affected by the interventions and, in due course, the 
whole population of the municipality concerned.  This programme is under the 
responsibility of URB/Recife which will be in a position to contract specialist firms or to 
establish partnerships with local institutions for the direct execution of the services 
required.  
 
Health and Environmental Education Programme: this programme is already an integral 
part of the Capibaribe Melhor Project (Component 2-
 ëSocial and Economic 
Development of the Territoryí/Subcomponent ëDevelopment of Environmental and 
Health Educationí) and its cost (R$255,000,00) has already been incorporated in the 
overall costs of the Project.  It is estimated that implementation of a programme of health 
and environmental education will have far-reaching local impacts.  This programme 
should be ongoing during the entire period of implementation of the Project and will be 
the responsibility of URB/Recife.  The establishment of a Management Committee is 
planned.  This committee will comprise representatives of URB/Recife, UGP/Capibaribe 
Melhor Project; the Environmental Directorate/SEPLAM, the Social Communication 
Advisory Unit and, finally, the Secretariat for Education.  
 
Programme to Eliminate Crossed Connections (R$150.000,00): this programme will be 
implemented in Sewage Units UEs 39 and 40 in order to prevent sewage from continuing 
to infect the watercourses and rainwater and compromising the capacity of sewage 
collection facilities and sewage transport and treatment systems in the region.  The 
programme will be implemented by URB/Recife supported by SANEAR ñ the Sanitation 
Agency of Recife and COMPESA- and the Pernambuco Sanitation Company.  The 
programme to eliminate crossed connections should be initiated simultaneously with the 
works dealing with sewerage and should be concluded six months following the 
conclusion of these sewage improvement works.  
 
Management Plan for the Apipucos, Santana and Caiara Parks (R$ 100.000,00): The 
Parks Management Plan is indispensable for the physical and environmental 
sustainability of the Parks, since public use of green areas is closely linked to the 
maintenance, conservation and security of  these areas.  The principal aim of the plan is 
to ensure that the urban parks and green areas under the aegis of the Project can continue 
adequately to serve the population.  For this a management system capable of capable of 
maintaining the facilities on a  permanent basis is needed.  Another aim is to secure 
information that would help to improve the initial phase of installation of the facilities.  It 
is recommended that the municipality should seek other alternatives for managing the 
parks and green areas.One method might be for civil societies and entities to ëadoptí the 
parks and manage them. For the moment, the installation of the parks is the responsibility 
of the URB/Recife which can contract specialist firms or establish partnerships with local 
institutions to carry out direct management.  
 
Monitoring and Operation Programme for the Cordeiro ETE: (the cost to be 
incorporated into the amounts reserved for the Cordeiro ETE Project): this programme 
consists of two sub-programmes: (i) a monitoring plan for the Cordeiro ETE and (ii) a 
plan for installing green belt in the Cordeiro ETE.  The Cordeiro ETE Monitoring Plan 
aims mainly to verify the efficiency and efficacy of the measures adopted at the 
implementation and operational stages of the Cordeiro ETE together with the activities 
related to minimizing the negative impacts of the undertaking.  The Green Belt 
Page  13
Implementation Plan contains a suggestion that the edges of the Cordeiro ETE land 
should be planted so as to form a  green belt to act as a windbreak and  minimize the 
effects of possible emissions of malodorous gases which may originate at the anaerobic 
phase of the sewage treatment process.  The services to the implemented by this 
programme are the responsibility of URB/Recife.  
 
Programme to Monitor the Quality of the Water of the Capibaribe River 
(R$120.000,00): This programme aims to provide data about the quality of the waters 
circulating in the stretch of the Capibaribe River within the area of influence of the 
Project.  Monitoring 
and diagnosis will also be a ëpreventive activityí insofar as changes 
in the quality of the waters are concerned. Such diagnoses will permit the timely adoption 
of control measures to avoid future problems. The responsibility for implementing this 
programme belongs to URB/Recife in collaboration with CPRH - the State Agency for 
the Environment and Water Resources.  Other institutions (COMPESA and SANEAR) 
will be called upon to participate in the production of information, diagnoses and 
monitoring of the waters within the context of this programme.  
 
Programme of Studies and Research for Defining Alternatives for Recovery of the 
A√ßude De Apipucos (R$500.000,00): This programme aims to monitor the quality 
ofthe water in the A√ßude de Apipucos during the first two years of the developmentof 
the Capibaribe Melhor Project. The programme will comprise limnological, batimetric, 
hydrological, hydraulic (measurements of the outflow from the tributaries) as well as 
efforts to determine the following: (i) the existing and affluent organic load in the 
A√ßude; (ii) the catchment area; (iii) interception of all the tributaries flowing into the 
A√ßude. The programme will help to instill a better understanding of the internal 
dynamics of the lacustrine ecosystem and provide information for designing a new model 
for gauging the water quality of this A√ßude and adoption of measures for its 
rehabilitation and management.  Responsibility for implementing the programme falls to 
URB/Recife jointly with SANEAR.  COMPESA and SANEAR can be called upon to 
participate in the production of data, diagnosis and monitoring of water within the ambit 
of the Project.  
 
Environmental Plan for Construction (PAC): (the costs will be included in the overall 
cost of the works and therefore the PAC must be included in the technical specifications 
of the works): this plan was elaborated for adoption as a guide to cover appropriate 
environmental practices to be complied with by the firms contracted to execute the 
works.  Therefore, it must be incorporated into the bidding processes so that the 
construction firms can have prior knowledge of the requirements and understand that 
compliance with the plan will be reflected in the contractual arrangement. 
Implementation of the plan is the responsibility of URB/Recife and of the construction 
companies.  
 
Expropriations and Involuntary Resettlement Plan (R$32.287.569,56): the Project will 
relocate 1,453 families.  A Conceptual Framework for Resettlement has been developed 
based upon the resettlement policies of the Prefecture of Recife and according to the 
resettlement guidelines of the World Bank.  The PDRI will be developed during the first 
year of implementation of the Capibaribe Melhor Project.  The Conceptual Framework 
Page  14
offers two compensatory alternatives for the relevant families or property owners: (i) 
resettlement on a property possessing basic services and near to the present locality 
occupied by the above and (ii) financial compensation. Implementation of the 
Expropriations and Involuntary Resettlement Plan will be the responsibility of 
URB/Recife, which will act in partnership with the Secretariat for Housing.  Both official 
organs would be free choose to contract specialist firms to carry out the works if 
necessary.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The Environmental Assessment Terms of Reference were discussed with the State 
Environmental Agency (CPRH), the Municipal Environmental Agency and the Federal 
Public Ministry, prior to initiation of the assessment.  In addition, public consultations 
were held as part of the disclosure process of the EIA.  This was held on January 9, 2006.  
There were 121 participants, representing the Federal Government, State Government of 
Pernambuco, the Municipal Government of Recife, and various Non-Governmental 
Entities.  Prior to the meeting, the EIA was made available on the Municipal Web-Site 
and available for downloading in PDF format.  
 
A
social assessment was alos carried-out for the project in order to assess the impacts, 
positive and negative, on the targeted population in the Capibabiribe river basin area.  
The social assessment included both a Social Impact study of the proposed project, and a 
survey of families to be impacted by the project, to determine the socio-economic profile 
of these families.  The study recommended actions to be taken to maximize the positive 
impacts of the project and minimize the negative impacts.  These are included in both the 
Resettlement Framework and the Environmental Management Plan.
