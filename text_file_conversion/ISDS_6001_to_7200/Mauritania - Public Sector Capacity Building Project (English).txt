2. Project Objectives 
The development objectives of the project are to assist the Government of Mauritania in 
implementing key reforms and especially contribute to: (i) the improvement of 
performance, efficiency and transparency of public finance management in Mauritania, in 
preparation of the future GDP increase linked to oil production; and (ii) the 
modernization of the management of the public administration service, which is likely to 
play a key role in the future.  The Government will reach these objectives by improving 
the revenue collection, financial management and expenditure services; building capacity 
of key functions of the public administration; and improving the relations between central 
government and the decentralized institutions at the local level.  An improvement of the 
civil service management system is seen necessary to ensure a positive impact of the 
selected action plans targeting public finance, environment management and 
decentralization.   
 
3. Project Description 
The Project will support the implementation of selected elements of the Government’s 
reform programs, especially focused on: (i) support to public sector management, 
including modernization of public administration and improvement of public resources 
and expenditure management; (ii) support to the decentralization program; (iii) 
mainstreaming of the environment into development management, through support to the 
Page  2
implementation of the NEAP recommendations and capacity building; and (iv) 
strengthening civil service management.  The implementation of these components will 
rely on the five ministries involved in the selected supported actions (Finances, Civil 
Service, Interior, Economic Affairs and Development, and Environment).  Each of these 
ministries have already prepared a specific reform program which provided the 
framework for the Project.
