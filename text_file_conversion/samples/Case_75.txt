A.2. Project Objectives
The project development objective is to improve productivity of water for the enhancement of socially and
environmentally-sustainable growth and poverty reduction in selected focus basins (Chambal, Sindh,
Betwa, Ken and Tons) of Madhya Pradesh.



A.3. Project Description
The proposed project components provide support for institutional reforms in water resources
management as well as for irrigation service delivery and complementary investments in
improving and modernizing physical assets as described below:
Component A: Water Resources Management - Institutions and Instruments (US$ 11.73 Million)
This component would support the establishment and operationalization of the proposed planning,
allocation and regulatory institutions and instruments at the State and basin-levels. This would be done
through the proposed State Water Resources Agency, the associated State Water Resources Data and
Analysis Center, a State Water Tariff/Rights Regulatory Commission, and Basin Development and
Management Boards for the Sindh and Tons.
Component B: Service Delivery - Irrigation and Drainage Institutions (US$ 41.17 Million)
This component would support measures related to delivering reliable irrigation services at reasonable
cost by financially-self sustaining entities. This includes irrigation line agency strengthening through
technical and management assistance, including the development of a comprehensive information
management system, training, and equipment. Options for promoting decentralized management of
irrigation and drainage schemes through strengthening of WUAs and increased public-private
partnerships.
Component C: Improving productivity of selected existing irrigation and drainage assets in five
basins (US$ 313.11 Million)
This component would operationalize the concepts and provide the necessary investments in five
basins (Chambal, Sindh, Betwa, Ken and Tons) to modernize existing irrigation schemes through
rehabilitation, provision of appropriate extension for agriculture, horticulture, livestock management
and fisheries and WUA strengthening.
Component D. Project Management Support (US$ 8.23 Million)
The project activities would be coordinated by a multi-disciplinary Project Activities Coordination
Unit (PICU). Support would be provided to assist the PICU with its role in facilitating and guiding the
implementation and monitoring of all project activities, ensuring synergy and coordination amongst
activities and agencies implementing these activities, preparing consolidated reports and facilitating
training. PICU would be responsible for baseline surveys and environmental, social and other
assessments starting from project preparation period and update of such information throughout project
implementation and be responsible for project monitoring and evaluation in addition to direct
implementing agencies for technical, social, institutional and economic issues.



A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The project is in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India which has a geographical area of 308,245 sq
km with 45 administrative districts. The original state of MP was the geographically largest state of the
country M.P., but was bifurcated in November 2000 and a new state of Chhattisgarh was created in the
east. Despite this bifurcation the new state of Madhya Pradesh is still the second largest Indian state.
The Vindhya and Satpura ranges in the state mark the dividing line between a broad division of Northern
and southern region of the country. It has both the westward flowing rivers of the country Narmada and
Tapi, which fall in to the Arabian Sea. The Chambal, Sindh, Betwa, Tons, Ken and Sone rivers of Madhya
Pradesh come under Ganga basin. Similarly Wein Ganga river is a part of Mahanadi Basin flowing toward
east and Mahi river is a part of Mahi basin flowing toward south and then fall in west.
The population of Madhya Pradesh (MP) is 60,385,118 as per Census of 2001. The figure recorded in the
1991 census was 48,566,242, representing an interim growth of 24.34%. The overall population density is
about 196 persons/km2. The literacy rate of M.P. is 64.1% against 65.4% of all India average as per 2001
census. The male literacy rate is 76.5% against 75.8% for all India and it is 50.5% for women against all
India figures of 54.2%. These figures for rural and urban population are 58.1% against all India figures of
59.4% and for urban areas it is 79.7% for M.P. and 80.3% for all India.
The net area under irrigation was 5.66 million hectare in the year 1999-00. Of this, 0.24 m.ha. was under
paddy, .3.40 m.ha. under wheat, 1.08 m.ha. under pulses, .0.32 m.ha. under oilseeds, 0.19 m.ha. under
cotton, 0.23 m.ha. under spices, 18 m.ha. under fruits and vegetables and .55 m.ha. under other crops.
Government canals irrigate one million ha., non-government canals 1600 ha., tanks, 0.132 m.ha, wells 3.71
m.ha, and other sources irrigate 0.81 m.ha
The project would involve a few institutional development components that would be State-wide in
Madhya Pradesh - these include computerization, MIS/GIS development, training, capacity-building and
access to expertise for institutional reform. Physical investments in the irrigation schemes would only be of
a rehabilitation/modernization nature for older schemes (completed before 1985) and be concentrated on
five northern river basins (Chambal, Betwa, Sindh, Ken and Tons) and would be primarily in the form of
rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems and demonstration of integrated water resources management.
B. Check Environmental Category A [X], B[], C [F],FI []
Comments. Although the physical investments will only be rehabilitation type and are not expected to
result in any major adverse environmental or social impacts, an Environmental Category A classification
has been adopted given the spatial scale of investment, the possibility of cumulative impacts due to
multiple sub - projects, the new nature of some of the activities, and the number of Bank safeguard
policies triggered.

WB Safeguard        Triggered                                       Comments
Policy          (Yes/No)
Environmental           Yes        > This is a Category A project and triggers this OP. As the physical works are of a
Assessment (OP                        rehabilitation nature, they are not anticipated to cause significant adverse environmental or
4.01, BP 4.01, GP                     social impacts. The integrated Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA) has also
4.01)                                 developed a Social and Environment Management Framework (SEMF) along with
associated strategies and action plans to be applied to all sub-projects.
Natural habitats         No        > Given the rehabilitation nature of physical investments and the findings of the ESA/ detailed
(OP 4.04, BP 4.04,                    scheme studies, it was not expected that the project activities would have adverse impacts on
GP 4.04)                              natural habitats. During implementation and supervision, this will be periodically reassessed.
Forestry (OP 4.36,       No        > None of the project activities will trigger this OP as no forestry activities or activities on
GP 4.36)                              forest land are envisaged.
Pest Management         Yes        > Although the project does not plan to directly finance any pesticides, there is a possibility
(OP 4.09)                             of induced impact of greater pesticide use due to increased agricultural intensification and
diversification. . A pest management plan has been developed in this regard with the
objective of promoting and enhancing integrated pest management activities.
Cultural Property       Yes        > No archaeological or other cultural sites of significance are expected to be impacted by the
(OPN 11.03)                           proposed project. However, many tanks, including the centuries-old Chandela tanks which
generally have associated cultural property (e.g. in the form of small temples on the tank
bund) may be impacted during rehabilitation. Appropriate mitigation measures have been
built into a Cultural Property Strategy/Action Plan which include screening, mitigating and
enhancing affected sites, as well as specifies procedures in civil works contracts for chance
finds .
Indigenous Peoples      Yes        > Although in MP, tribals are concentrated in the non-project southem basins, there are still
(OD 4.20)                             many tribal populations in the villages of the project targeted areas. Since the project
physical interventions are of a rehabilitation/modemizaton type, it is not expected that the
project would have any significant adverse impact on tribals. However, the project would
provide better opportunites for tribals to share in project benefits facilitated by better
consultation, capacity-building and income-enhancement support. A detailed GIS of social
and other indicators at village, block and district level has been developed as part of the
ESA for the project basins and the distribution of tribal villages will be examined with
respect to the proposed scheme modemizaton. A tribal development strategy has been
prepared for the project that include measures to enhance informed participation, develop
culturally relevant solutions for tribal groups and develop synergies with other programs and
projects.
Involuntary             Yes        > Although no involuntary resettlement and rehabilitation is anticipated under the project, an
Resettlement (OD                      R&R framework has been prepared in case involuntary resettlement is required during
4.30)                                 scheme modemization.
Safety of Dams          Yes        > Dam safety is an issue, both for large dams that are associated with many major and
(OP 4.37, BP 4.37)                    medium imgation projects, as well as small structures associated with some minor projects.
The recently-closed Bank-financed Dam Safety Project has built significant capacity and
knowledge base on these aspects and set up systematic procedures and mechanisms for dam
safety in MP that has sustained beyond the project closing. Under a Dam Safety Action
Plan for this project, this capacity will be further strengthened and complemented with
actions for small dams also and will include capacity building, awareness, information
management, access to technical expertise, intemal and third-party (review panel) checking
of designs/redesigns foe each dam and analytical and communication support.
Projects in             Yes        > Although all of the project "focus basins" are in an intematonal river basin (Ganges), there
International                         is not anticipated to be any significant impact upstream or downstream on water quality or
Waters (OP 7.50,                      quantity given the nature of interventions. However, the OP is triggered and, according to
BP 7.50, GP 7.50)                     BP 7.50, an exemption to notification has been sought given the rehabilitation nature of the
physical investments.
Projects in              No        > The project is not in a disputed area and the OP is not triggered.

potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible im pacts.
Although many safeguards are triggered for the project activities, the project is not expected to have significant,
adverse, large-scale, irreversible environmental or social impacts. Key environment and social issues (including
safeguard issues) identified during screening and scoping of the Environment and Social Assessment include:
>    Limited understanding within the implementing agency and amongst the farmers and expertise on
environmental and social issues related to basin planning, modernization of irrigation projects,
>    Lack of database on environmental and social parameters both at the head office and the field levels,
>    Lack of planning and methodological water allocation among the various sub sector water users at the basin
and sub basin levels as well as in the irrigation schemes,
>    Limited consultations with stakeholders like farmer communities, NGOs and line departments,
>    Lack of incorporation of environmental and social safeguard measures in the Irrigation Manual of the State
and other contract clauses,
>    Lack of evaluation and monitoring of environmental and social impacts of completed projects,
>    Degraded Irrigation and Drainage assets leading to environmental problems and social tensions,
>    Degraded social system at places due to lack of security, caste rifts, exclusion of women from the decision-
making process, adverse role of liquor & gambling, high-level unemployment and lack of access to
training, etc.
>    Weak consultation framework for sub-project preparation.
>    Weak linkages between WRD, WUA, Gram Panchayat and villages.
>    Limited participation of vulnerable groups like tribals and women in irrigation / irrigation management,
agriculture and allied occupations.
>    Low awareness and participation of IPM and INM techniques in agriculture.
>    Weak consultation, WUA problem's, Women Tribal, IPM, Integrated management.
A number of these issues not only influence present productivity of water in the basin but are also likely to influence
the outcome of the proposed interventions for various projects.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
It is expected that there would be a change in paradigm of WRM and irrigated agriculture through strengthened
participatory approaches and introduction of new and appropriate technology. Few adverse long term or irreversible
impacts are anticipated. This is also supported by the findings of the integrated environmental and social
assessment. It is also expected that the State would make other investments to improve critical infrastructure,
including road connectivity and power supply in the entire State.
The project may also have adverse indirect impacts due to increased fertilizer and pesticide use associated with
agricultural intensification and diversification.



D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
Key alternatives that have been looked at for the project are described in the PAD.
In addition, the following alternatives are being examined during project preparation:
*   Mechanism to build environmental and social expertise in the WRD (choices including re-deployment of
existing WRD staff, introduction of specialists, etc. are already being carried out , but a combination of these have
finally been selected with key WRD or other deputation staff are placed in PICU strengthened with capacity-
building international and national consultancies and training)
*   Relative role of the Water User Associations (it is expected that the WUAs and their federations will be given
increasing responsibility as the project progresses)
* Role of NGOs (the role of NGOs in the proposed project has turned out to be critical - in interfacing between
the Scheme Productivity Improvement Group and the WUAs and providing mobilization/training/awareness
building in the WUAs to improve the scheme productivity)
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The borrower has undertaken an Environment and Social Assessment and has developed a Social and Environmental
Management Framework for the project activities. The GoMP has also appointed experienced staff as environment
and social officers in the Project Preparation Core Team which has evolved into the Project Implementation
Coordination Unit (PICU). The borrower has held consultations with various stakeholders before, during, and after
the development of the ESA and SEMF.
Madhya Pradesh was one of the first states in India to embrace Participatory Irrigation Management completely -
and has instituted WUAs in all major, medium and minor schemes after having held elections. The State of Madhya
Pradesh has passed an enabling Act for Participatory Irrigation Management and implemented it. The performance
of the WUAs vary widely by region and scheme and results are very mixed. There is a general need to better
mobilize farmers, undertake relevant technical, environmental and social awareness campaigns, build capacity and
activate the WUAs by enhancing participation, responsibility, and accountability.
The capacity of the MP WRD, particularly at lower levels, in addressing environmental and many social issues is
extremely limited as is the mainstreaming of such issues in their regular business processes. Recognizing this, the
ESA has recommended a massive awareness campaign on relevant social and environmental issues in the WRD.
A strong participatory and appraisal process has been built into the project. Joint walkthroughs and development of
agreed MOUs for shared understanding of the problems and options relating to the systems have been made
mandatory. An appraisal process has been developed (centralized at the PICU level initially till capacities are
developed at lower levels) to review technical, social &environmental and economic &financial aspects. A strong
monitoring and learning framework has also been proposed to ensure timely course-correction, collate and use
learning quickly and recognize potential problems and opportunities on environmental and social issues.



D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The primary stakeholders in the project include individual farmers, the Water User Associations, NGOs, various
GOMP departments (such as the WRD, Agriculture, Horticulture, Animal Husbandry, Fisheries Departments), and
the private sector. The project has been designed to enhance community capacity to undertake integrated water
resource management with a holistic perspective in close collaboration with a range of stakeholders (including the
key project stakeholders above, Panchayati Raj institutions, civil society organizations, academic institutions,
consultants/experts, private sector agencies etc.). Roles and responsibilities of key institutional partners have been
outlined and will be periodically re-evaluated and fine-tuned during implementation.
The consultations held in association with the development of the ESA have helped shape the SEMF. The project
has also built in a strong consultation processes at the various stages of a scheme cycle (pre-planning, planning,
implementation, and post-implementation). Particular effort would be made (through the NGOs proposed) to
increase participation from women and other vulnerable groups. Participatory Rural Appraisal, structured
consultations, joint walkthroughs, development of MOUs, conflict resolution mechanisms, and various capacity-
building activities should help reflect the concerns and suggestions both of people who could be potentially
negatively impacted by project activities as well as those that could better benefit from such activities.
