B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The objectives of the Project under the APL 1 are to improve the sector’s legal and regulatory framework, provide 
technical support for KPLC’s corporate recovery, capacity building in sector regulation as well as formulate a 
framework for geothermal resource development.  The APL will also provide support for the efficient expansion of 
power generation and distribution and to increase access to urban and peri-urban areas, particularly in Mombasa and 
Nairobi.

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project under APL 1 would comprise four components as follows: 
 
(a) 
Distribution Component (US$ 115 million)
.
  The distribution system in Nairobi 
and Coastal area will be upgraded and reinforced through construction of 
66/33/11 kV lines and installation substation and distribution transformers; 
provision of miscellaneous facilities metering,  control and load dispatch 
equipment.  The expected output would be reduction of non-technical losses by 
about 4% and technical losses by 1%, and increase in customer connections by 
about 300,000.  In addition quality of power supply (voltage levels) will improve, 
and interruptions will be reduced. 
 
(b) 
Generation Component (US$40 million)
.
  This will include provision and 
installation of equipment for the conversion of 2x30MW gas turbines at Kipevu 
(Mombasa) to combined cycle operation. The investment component is likely to 
be financed by the EIB.  The expected output of this generation component would 
be 36MW of thermal capacity, sufficient to replace the Westpont IPP in Mombasa 
whose contract expires this year. 
 
(c) 
Feasibility Studies and Engineering Services Component. (US$8.70 million)
.
  
This will include feasibility, environmental and social impact assessment and 
engineering services for components (a) and (b) above; feasibility and 
environmental and social impact assessment studies for the LPG import handling 
and storage facilities component to be undertaken under APL2; a geothermal 
reservoir optimization study for the Olkaria I, II and IV sites; feasibility and 
preliminary design work for the proposed Olkaria IV site [Olkaria, Suswa and 
Longonot prospects for a potential output of 60-70MW]; and consultants services 
for establishment of a cost center in KenGen for geothermal resource 
development and preparation of a comprehensive business plan and private-public 
business models. The geothermal business plan will identify the required drilling 
activities and related costs and options for financing.  Possible sources for 
financing the investment requirements to be identified under the business plan 
would be the Bank, GEF, and KfW and the Government. 
 
(d) 
Institutional and capacity Building Component (US$3.0 million)
. 
The 
technical assistance and training requirements will be required to support:  (i)  
implementation of KPLC’s corporate recovery plan (US$3,000,000); (ii) capacity 
building for the Energy Regulatory Commission (EC) (US$500,000); KenGen 
(US$100,000), MoE (US$500,000); and (iii) policy and regulatory studies 
(US$500,000).  The project will include building capacity to help the Government 
to monitor and regulate health and safety issues in the petroleum downstream 
sector, to implement the standardization of LPG valves and ancillary equipment, 
determine the measures required to effectively address social and environmental 
issues that may arise should the decision on the fate of the KPRL entail its 
closure.

D.  Project location (if known) 
 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations under consideration 
or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
 
Power Components under APL1: the generation component involves conversion of existing gas turbines in 
Mombassa to combined cycle operation while the distribution component comprises: (i) upgrading and 
reinforcement of existing substations mainly in Nairobi and Mombassa; (ii) installation of a few substations; and 
(iii) construction of high/medium and low voltage distribution lines. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
[Guideline: Refer to Section 5 of PCN]
 
 
KPLC and KenGen have the institutional structures for managing environmental and social issues and a track record 
for doing so under several Bank-financed projects, including the ongoing Energy Sector Reform and Power 
Development Project.  The Kenya Pipeline Company’s structures and track record has to be assessed as it is the 
proposed implementing agency for the LPG component.  Kenya’s Environmental Management and Coordination 
Act of 1999 requires such a project to be subjected to environmental and social impact assessments.
