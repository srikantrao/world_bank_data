A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objectives are to improve urban living conditions in regard to 
sanitation, drainage, vehicular access, and solid waste management in a sustainable 
fashion, with special emphasis on the poor. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1 - Storm Drainage  
Lining of secondary drains, tertiary drains and erosion control.  
The lining of urban storm drains with concrete or stone pitching that had been carried out in previous 
projects has resulted in a reduced frequency, severity, and duration of flooding. More high-priority 
secondary drains in the project towns will be lined, or their lining rehabilitated, mostly in low-lying, 
poor areas, complemented where necessary with tertiary drains and erosion control measures. This 
may involve dredging, realigning, widening, or narrowing of the existing drains in some sections. 
 
Component 2 – Sanitation 
 
Subcomponents: (a) construction of household latrines, (b) rehabilitation and 
construction of 
p
ublic latrines, 
(
c
)
 rehabilitation and construction of school 
Page  3
 
 
latrines, and (d) liquid waste management in Tema.  
The program for the construction of household latrines on a cost-sharing basis with 
the beneficiaries, as well as the rehabilitation and construction of school and public 
latrines, which was carried out under the Urban Environmental Sanitation Project 
(UESP), will be started up again in all project towns. When no more funds for this 
component could be allocated under UESP, a large number of applications for 
latrines was still pending with the Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies (MAs). The 
school latrine program will be accompanied by hygiene education and the provision 
of water supply. The public latrines will be mostly limited to public places, such as 
markets and transport terminals, and will be privately managed through a 
competitive selection process. A septage treatment facility for Tema was 
constructed under UESP, but not completed. It will be finished under UESP-2. A 
study of sustainable improvements to the Tema sewerage system will be done and, 
on the basis of the results, minor improvement works carried out. 
 
Component 3 - Solid Waste Management 
  
Subcomponents:  (a) construction of sanitary landfills, (b) equipment for 
sanitary landfills, (c) improved use, closure and rehabilitation of existing dumps, 
(d) operational support for existing sanitary landfills, (d) pilot private solid 
waste collection, (e) household bins, skips, and skip pads. 
New sanitary landfills will be constructed in Accra
 (located at Kwabenya) and 
Tema
 and the necessary operating equipment supplied. The preliminary design 
capacity is 500,000 tons/year for Accra and 100,000 tons/year for Tema. An access 
road and a conduit for storm drainage were built at Kwabenya in 2000 as Phase I of 
construction, financed by another donor. No further financing for construction is 
available. The construction of the sanitary landfill at Sekondi-Takoradi
 could not be 
completed under UESP because of the failure of the contractor to perform, and will 
be finished under UESP-2. Improvements will be made to the operation of the 
dumps
 in the project towns which still have to be used until the new sanitary 
landfills have been constructed, to prolong their life and to mitigate their negative 
environmental impact. These dumps, and others that have already been closed, will 
be rehabilitated in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. An increase 
in the percent of refuse collected
 in the project towns has been achieved through 
UESP, partly due to more PSP in solid waste collection, increasingly in the form of 
a franchise, and the extension of the collection of user fees to middle and low-
income areas. The component will include recurrent cost support for (i) the 
operation and monitoring of the sanitary landfills in Kumasi and Tamale, and later 
in Sekondi-Takoradi, and (ii) for additional private refuse collection contracts in 
poor and middle-income areas.  
 
Component 4 – Community Infrastructure Upgrading
   
Infrastructure upgrading in low-income communities (mainly access roads, 
roadside drains, street lighting, water supply, and sanitation).  
This component was very successful in UESP, and several additional communities 
will be upgraded in the project towns under UESP-2. Many of the roads in these 
neighborhoods are now barely motorable because of gullies created by erosion. The 
Page  4
 
 
roads will be leveled and in some cases realigned, a surface dressing applied, and 
provided with roadside drains. In the process, water pipes that now run haphazardly 
through the neighborhood will be replaced with supply lines along the drains and 
service connections to  the existing users. Street lighting will be provided where it is 
a community priority, and some public latrines will be rehabilitated  
 
Component 5 - Institutional Strengthening (financed by NDF) 
 
Subcomponents:  (a) technical assistance and training, (b) capacity building in 
MLGRD and other central agencies,  (c) capacity building in MAs, (d) Malaria 
vector control, (e) HIV/AIDS prevention, and (f) house numbering. 
The Waste Management Departments, which were created in 4 additional towns 
under UESP, need further support and strengthening to play their lead role in urban 
waste management and to sustain the reforms that have been introduced in recent 
years. The transformation of their role from 
clean-up
 to 
environmental management
 
will be supported technically and financially. Training and institutional strengthening 
will also be provided for the Environmental Health Departments and other 
departments of the Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies, as well as the Submetros. 
Also included are the preparation of an integrated solid waste management strategy, 
impact evaluations, studies, and preparation of standard designs and operational 
manuals. The malaria
 vector control will consist of the removal of stagnant water 
accumulations near habitation in which the malaria-carrying mosquitoes breed, such 
as pools, puddles, unregulated drains, and old car tires, and other measures that are 
part of the motional malaria-eradication program, except for spraying. Financial 
assistance will be provided to ongoing programs on HIV/AIDS
 prevention, 
coordinated by the Ghana AIDS Commission. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will be carried out in the five largest towns of Ghana, namely Accra, 
Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale and Tema, with a total population of about 4.2 
million, which includes the urban part of Ga District adjacent to Accra. Present 
environmental conditions in the project towns are characterized by a lack of adequate 
sanitation coverage (with a residue of pan latrines that are gradually being phased 
out), uncollected accumulations of solid waste, lack of all-year vehicular access to 
some poor neighborhoods, flooding, and inadequate water supply. The sanitary 
landfills
 are located on the fringe of the urban conglomerate of the three towns that 
they are to serve. Their area of influence is therefore partly urban and partly rural. 
They have a buffer zone of 200 – 250 m. Communities along the route that will be 
taken by dump trucks and those living near the landfills will be negatively affected 
(see II.D.1a). Surface and ground water pollution could extend 5 to 10 km 
downstream. The drain lining
 and community upgrading
 works will primarily be 
located in high-density, low-lying areas, most of which are inhabited by low-income 
people. In some of these neighborhoods casual workers and small traders commute 
daily between the city and rural areas.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
 Unless appropriate mitigating measures are taken during the design and operation 
stage, the new sanitary landfills at Accra and Tema are likely to have a negative 
impact on the environment through leachate pollution of surface and ground water, 
bad odors, the spread of plastic bags through wind, noise, spread of diseases, 
accidents caused by vehicles, unsightly scenery, coverage of a larger surface area 
than necessary, and danger of refuse slides at unstable banks. The may require 
involuntary resettlement and land compensation to a variety of users and claimants. 
The Kwabenya
 site is located in Ga District, and its planning involves the Accra 
Metropolitan Assembly, the Ga District Assembly, and the Regional Coordinating 
Council of Greater Accra Region. The landfill would serve part of Ga District as 
well. The main risk for the completion of the half-finished sanitary landfill in 
Sekondi-Takoradi
, for which an approved EA and RAP exists, is soil erosion, which 
could effect the nearby stream. Until the new sanitary landfills in Sekondi-Takoradi, 
Accra and Tema have been completed, the municipalities will continue to use the 
existing dumps
.. Unless the two completed sanitary landfills at Kumasi and Takoradi 
are operated according to the operating guidelines that have been prepared, some or 
all of these hazard could also apply there. 
 
The other project subcomponents are expected to have limited environmental or 
social impacts. They are: 
 
Lining of storm drains
.  The lining of additional drains to those that were done 
under UESP will reduce the frequency, severity and duration of floods, especially 
in low-lying, low-income areas. There is a risk that the lining of more secondary 
drains may cause flooding downstream. Some moving or destruction of 
compound walls, rooms, toilets, or other structures that have encroached on the 
drains may be necessary, but will be minimized. 
Latrine construction.
  Liquid wastes could pose a health hazard and an 
environmental nuisance if not properly disposed of, either through an 
appropriately located soakaway pit or through emptying with a vacuum truck for 
disposal at an approved location for treatment. Guidelines for the location and 
design of latrines exist and will be followed during construction. Nearby 
residents could be temporarily inconvenienced by dust, odor, and noise. 
Liquid waste management in Tema.
 None of the sewered wastewater in Tema is 
being treated as of the end of 2003, mainly due to objections from residents who 
live next to the treatment ponds to noxious odors and the inability of the Tema 
municipality to pay the high cost of electricity for pumping. Studies will be 
carried out about alternative treatment or pumping, and minor works rehabilitated 
and/or constructed, which may involve some restoration works of the lagoons. 
Page  7
 
 
The septage treatment facility for Tema, for which an EA was prepared under 
UESP, will be completed. 
Community infrastructure upgrading.
  These activities could cause localized 
flooding and soil erosion if not properly constructed. Some inconvenience to local 
residents could be created, such as the construction of retaining walls without 
stairs to allow pedestrian movement and the accumulation of wastewater in new 
areas. Some moving of kiosks, rooms, or other structures for small businesses or 
residences that project into the streets may be necessary, but would be minimized. 
The population living or working next to the construction site will be temporarily 
inconvenienced by restricted mobility, noise, dust, and the cutting off and 
reconnection of water supply. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Potential cumulative impacts may include soil erosion and air, soil and water pollution.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
This project is a repeater and will build on the activities that were carried out under 
UESP. Additional priority activities have been identified. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
National legislation, policies, and strategies exist for environmental protection, 
involuntary settlement which also supports and guides the activities of the Ghana 
EPA. These provisions are  described in detail in the project-wide EA and RPF. 
Policies and strategies also exist on the national and local government level for 
environmental sanitation, notably the 
National Environmental Sanitation Strategy
 
issued by the Ministry of Local Government and Rural development in 1999 and the 
EPA Best Practice Environmental Guidelines Series: No. 1 
Ghana Landfill 
Guidelines
, No. 2 
Guidelines for the Management of Health Care and Veterinary 
Waste in Ghana
, and No. 3 
Manual for the Preparation of District Waste 
Management Plans in Ghana
, all July 2002. Institutional strengthening for urban 
environmental sanitation was carried out in the period of 1997 to 2002 and various 
guidelines and models were prepared through the NDF-financed Project-Wide 
Capacity Building and Training Component of UESP.  
 
A project-wide EA report and an RPF report were prepared and approved by the Ministry of Local 
Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) on November 28, 2003. The reports identify the 
applicable safeguards policies, the nature and extent of the anticipated environmental and social 
impacts of the various project subcomponents, and the measures that should be taken to minimize the 
negative environmental and social impacts during construction and operation. An Environmental 
Impact Statement for a new sanitary landfill at Kwabenya, Accra, was prepared in 1999 with 
financing from another donor. The project EA contains an update of the findings of this report. A 
RAP for the Kwaben

 MLGRD and the Bank, and 
Page  8
 
 
disclosed before the start of construction. The construction of a sanitary landfill in Tema
 will not be 
part of the first-year subprojects. An EA and RAP for the Tema landfill will be prepared and approved 
by MLGRD and the Bank, and disclosed before the start of construction. EAs and RAPs for the 
sanitary landfills at Kumasi
 (construction completed), Tamale
 (construction completed) and Sekondi-
Takoradi
 (about half-way completed) were prepared under UESP around 1997 and approved by the 
Bank. Operating and monitoring plans for these landfills were prepared in 2001 and training in their 
operation was provided in 2003.  
 
EAs were prepared for the proposed drainage
 works in Accra around 1997 and have been and 
improved in the project-wide EA. The requirements for environmental and social protection for the 
other subcomponents of the project are presented in the project-wide EA. The RAPs that remain to be 
done for some of the components will be approved by MLGRD and the Bank, and disclosed before 
the start of construction. 
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
In the course of the preparation of the Environmental Assessment and the Resettlement 
Policy Framework for the project, consultations were carried out with the populations 
that are likely to be affected by the project especially those near sanitary landfill sites and 
dumps. Other stakeholders in the project will be identified, and consulted in greater depth 
during the preparation of the remaining RAPs for subcomponents.  
An EA and an RPF for the project were disclosed
 on January 16, 2004, in (i) the Public 
Information Unit of the World Bank Ghana Office, Accra, (ii) in the office of the 
Coordinating Director of the Assemblies or in the public libraries where the subprojects 
will be constructed (i.e. Accra, Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tamale, Tema and Ga) and 
(iii) in the Infoshop of the World Bank, Washington.
