2. Project Objectives
To strengthen institutional capacity of targeted institutions to manage risk of flooding and
land degradation in targeted rural and urban areas.

3. Project Description
Component 1: Institutional Strengthening and Awareness Raising

 Institutional Strengthening: Capacity of key national, regional, local, and community
organizations engaged in disaster risk and sustainable land management (DRM and SLM)
will be strengthened through the provision of equipment and training.

 Awareness Raising: Awareness about the risks of flooding and land degradation will be
enhanced through targeted information campaigns at national and local levels.

 Component 2: Community-Based Activities for Adaptation and Sustainable Land
Management
  Community-Based activities in Watershed and Flood-Prone Areas: Resilience to
flooding will be strengthened through targeted pilot activities at the local level that will
enable communities to better manage disaster risk and land degradation.

 Community-Based activities in Cropland and Grazing Land: Resilience of agriculture to
climate change, promotion of land productivity and water-use efficiency and SLM best
practices will be piloted and promoted in targeted areas.

 Community-Based Sustainable Forest and Wetland Management: Communities will be
assisted in preparing sustainable financing plans and in developing small income
generation activities in and around select protected areas and forests to reduce pressure
on forest resources and restore ecosystem services.

 Component 3: Early Warning, Monitoring, and Knowledge Systems

 Early Warning System (EWS): A nation-wide EWS will be developed to alert
communities of upcoming possible flood events and allow them to take appropriate
actions to protect lives and property, through enhanced collaboration and
communications between the national hydro meteorological services and the Togolese
Red Cross. Specific technical equipment and training will also be provided to the key
players.

 Environmental Monitoring: A country-owned climate and land monitoring system,
including geo-spatial data, will be developed to monitor vegetation cover and land use
(crop, pasture/range, forest, wetland, protected area, and other relevant categories), and to
provide carbon sequestration estimates in select project areas.

 Knowledge: An update of the national cartography and targeted risk assessments will be
conducted to identify appropriate disaster mitigation investments and/or risk transfer
mechanisms, including hazard, asset, and vulnerability analyses. A guide of select SLM
best practices which incorporates climate change impacts will also be developed.



 Component 4: Project Management

  For the project to be effectively implemented, project management functions including
fiduciary management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), technical supervision,
reporting and audits, will be covered under this component.

4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis
Targeted rural and urban areas in Togo.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
The Project is classified as environmental category B because no activity funded under
the Project is expected to have a significant negative environmental or social impact. The
Project triggers five safeguards policies: OP/BP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment, OP
4.09 on Pest Management, OP/BP 4.36 on Forests, OP/BP 4.04 on Natural Habitats and
OP/BP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement. This is because the project will broad
environmental and social impacts, albeit minimal to moderate, pest management may be
undertaken for some of the agricultural activities, and some of the community projects
will involve management and protection of forests and critical habitats. Activities under
the project are not expected to generate any adverse environmental or social effects, as a
large part of the project is geared towards reducing the risk of flooding and land
degradation in targeted rural and urban areas in Togo. Three safeguards instruments
associated with the proposed project are the Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF), Pest Management Plan (PMP) and the Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF). These have been prepared, reviewed, approved and disclosed in-
country and the Bank#s Infoshop on June 28, 2011.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
The potential environmental and social impacts are likely to be small-scale and site
specific, thus easily remediable. No long term or cumulative impacts are foreseen during
project implementation.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
N/A.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources (MERF) has an environment
department that handles environmental assessments so MERF has reasonable capacity to
manage environment and social safeguards. This unit will be responsible for following up
safeguards issues with the designated PIU#s environmental and social specialist during
project implementation. Part time consultants will also be hired as and when necessary to
work with this unit. The Bank will provide guidance on the elaboration of the TORs and
the Environment Department of MERF will be responsible for providing overall quality
control through the review and clearance of the Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs), Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAPs) and Resettlement Action Plans
(RAPs) as and when necessary. The environment department will also assist in enforcing
compliance with Bank safeguards policies and monitor the implementation of the EMPs.
Specific capacity building on environmental management and environmental assessment
will be provided to the technical services departments of the participating ministries. In
accordance with Bank guidelines, all EA studies and ARAPs/RAPs will need to be
reviewed and cleared by the Bank prior to the commencement of the civil works.

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The Key stakeholders include:
 -      Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources
 -      Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries
 -      Ministry of Water and Sanitation
 -      National Hydrological Services
 -      Department of National Meteorology
 -      Togo Red Cross
 There were consultations with the population and key institutions during preparation of
the safeguards instruments and this will continue during implementation of the
instruments. Public comments were solicited during the disclosure process of the
safeguards instruments through announcements made in two local newspapers. No
comments were received. Consultations and public meetings will continue during project
implementation
