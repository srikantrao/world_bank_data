","The MINIS focuses on technical assistance activities for general infrastructure that willsupport the mining sector and local communities within an investment’s area of influence.
While many of the projects are expected to be in the Southern Mongolia Region, projectsin other locations throughout the country will also be eligible for financing under the
MINIS. The project consists of the following four components:
  i.   Component 1 - Support for Infrastructure Investments (US$19.69 million).
       This component will provide financing to prepare regional infrastructure
       investment plans, conduct feasibility studies to assess technical options and
       determine economic and financial implications of proposed projects, and address
       emerging priority issues as a result of the country’s nascent enabling environment
       governing private participation in infrastructure.       The types of feasibility studies that are eligible for financing under the MINIS
       include technical assessments, such as engineering designs, geotechnical surveys,
       economic and financial analyses, environmental and social impact evaluations,
       and reviews of specific aspects of the country’s legal, regulatory and institutional
       frameworks. Funds could be used to prepare mining-related infrastructure
       projects whether financed from the government budget or the private sector.       Projects in the energy (power plants, transmission and distribution networks),
       transport (railways and roads), IT and communications, water (water supply and
       waste water systems), housing and social sectors (schools, hospitals and clinics)
       would be eligible, as would logistics and border crossing facilities. In addition,
       the evaluation and structuring (for private investment) of downstream, value-
       added activities, such as copper smelters, coal processing facilities and iron
       pellets plants, would also be eligible for funding. If funding is used to prepare a
       power plant, then the March 2010 Operation Guidelines on Criteria for Screening
       Coal Projects under the Strategic Framework for Development and Climate
       Change would be followed.       It is possible that one or two (at most) infrastructure projects will be prepared as
       PPPs with some support from the MINIS. ii.    Component 2 - Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer (US$1.45
       million). This component is devoted towards the development of local skills. The
       emphasis would be on learning by doing but with sufficient support from
       qualified consultants. This support will be extended to line ministries and
       agencies charged with preparing government-funded projects, as well as
       transactions with investors iii.   Component 3 - Strengthening Groundwater Management (US$7.43 million).
       This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to
       manage groundwater resources in the Southern Mongolia. The government has
       established a framework of 29 water basins for the entire country. For Southern
       Mongolia, these basins are centered on groundwater, as surface water is of minor
       importance in the southern part of the country.       In 2011, AusAID approved a proposal to provide additional financing of US$4.2
       million to this component to strengthen groundwater management in Mongolia
       after two years discussion with the Bank. This additional financing increased the
       budget of Component 3 from original US$3.23 million to US$7.43 million. With
       additional financing, this component will mainly support: a) Establishment of                                                                                         2

       preparing and implement groundwater management plans and conduction
       groundwater investigation; e) Capacity building activities for established RBC
       and RBAs; f) groundwater assessment and management studies. iv.   Component 4 - Project Management (US$0.63 million). This component will
       finance the staffing, operation and support of the Project Management Unit
       (PMU) at the Ministry of Finance. The PMU oversees the implementation of
       MINIS and will reports to the State Secretary for Finance. The PMU Director has
       the overall responsibility for managing the MINIS, including: (i) implementing
       project activities per the Project Implementation Manual, within budget and
       according to schedule; (ii) all procurement activities, including contracting
       consultants, and purchasing goods and equipment; (iii) maintaining financial
       records, making disbursements, managing the Designated Account, and financial
       reporting; (iv) monitoring the performance of consultants to ensure that
       contractual obligations are fulfilled; (v) reviewing and approving all reports and
       outputs issued by consultants; (vi) evaluating project activities and reporting on
       implementation progress; and (vii) ensuring that the environmental and social
       safeguards framework is effectively implemented. A Procurement Specialist and
       Financial Management Specialist will be hired to manage the fiduciary
       requirements of the project. Proceeds under the project will be used to hire a
       PMU Director and technical staff, as needed.       This component would also finance the services of domestic and international
       consultants to help monitor progress and assist in implementation, including
       financial audits for the project, and to acquire office equipment, pay PMU
       operating costs, and purchase one vehicle for the PMU. Incremental operating
       costs will also be financed through the Credit and include, inter alia, office rent,
       office consumables, communications, vehicle operating and repairs, and salaries
       of contractual staff (other than consultants)

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is providing transaction advice to the
Government to identify, develop, market and competitively select privatedevelopers/investors for up to three pilot projects. This support is expected tocomplement some of the activities of the MINIS. It has been agreed with the IFC that the
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that was prepared for the
MINIS will be considered to apply to both World Bank and IFC in line with the
Environmental and Social Policy and Procedural Guidelines for Projects in IDA
Countries that are financed jointly by the World Bank, IFC and Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

8,P090723,"The project development objectives (PDO) are to increase the production efficiency of household-based livestock producers, to reduce the environmental impact of livestock production, processing and marketing, and to improve food safety in livestock product supply chains (mainly meat) in selected provinces.  The project would contribute to the achievement of the higher-level objective of improving the overall competitiveness of the domestic livestock production.   
","The project will operate at both national and provincial levels and consists of three components:  
Component A: Upgrading Household-Based Livestock Production and Market 
Integration (US$68.21 million).  This component would support the improvement of competitiveness of household-based livestock production, food safety and hygiene along the meat supply-chain linking household producers, slaughterhouses and local meat markets, and environmental management of livestock waste. This would be achieved through three sub-components implemented by the Departments of Agriculture and Rural 
Development (DARDs) in each of the project provinces.  
Component B: Strengthening Central-Level Livestock and Veterinary Services (US 
$4.19 million).  This component would support strengthening capacity of the Department of Livestock Production (DLP) and Department of Animal Health (DAH) under MARD in developing and monitoring the implementation of animal health including livestock disease, bio-security, animal production technology, food safety, and livestock waste management policies and technical standards.  The component would finance: (a) consultant services to review and update the GAHP standards and guidelines and to carry out strategic studies; (b) the training of trainers in GAHP (e.g., production efficiency, disease control and prevention, regulatory enforcement for DLP, and, integrated risk management and meat inspection for DAH); (c) piloting of innovative approaches (e.g., breed quality certification, true-labeling feed quality certification); (d) equipment and incremental costs for DLP to monitor livestock breed and feed quality and for DONRE to monitor livestock waste management and environmental compliance; and (e) equipment and incremental costs for DAH to support disease surveillance and prevention and meat inspection at the provincial level, as well as upgrading of collection and monitoring of zoo-sanitary and food safety data.  
Component C: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (US$6.66 million). 
This component would support project implementation through the strengthening of coordination of the various government agencies at central, provincial and district levels, and the monitoring and evaluation of project activities and impact.  This component would be implemented by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) appointed by MARD at national level and Provincial Project Management Units (PPMUs) at the provincial level. 
The component would finance: (a) an international Chief Technical Assistant (CTA) and national consultants to strengthen the project management capacity of the PCU and 
PPMUs; (b) equipment and incremental staff and operating costs for PCU and PPMUs; and (c) project monitoring and evaluation (M&E) through consultant services, training, workshops and studies.

","The MINIS focuses on technical assistance activities for general infrastructure that willsupport the mining sector and local communities within an investment’s area of influence.
While many of the projects are expected to be in the Southern Mongolia Region, projectsin other locations throughout the country will also be eligible for financing under the
MINIS. The project consists of the following four components:
  i.   Component 1 - Support for Infrastructure Investments (US$19.69 million).
       This component will provide financing to prepare regional infrastructure
       investment plans, conduct feasibility studies to assess technical options and
       determine economic and financial implications of proposed projects, and address
       emerging priority issues as a result of the country’s nascent enabling environment
       governing private participation in infrastructure.       The types of feasibility studies that are eligible for financing under the MINIS
       include technical assessments, such as engineering designs, geotechnical surveys,
       economic and financial analyses, environmental and social impact evaluations,
       and reviews of specific aspects of the country’s legal, regulatory and institutional
       frameworks. Funds could be used to prepare mining-related infrastructure
       projects whether financed from the government budget or the private sector.       Projects in the energy (power plants, transmission and distribution networks),
       transport (railways and roads), IT and communications, water (water supply and
       waste water systems), housing and social sectors (schools, hospitals and clinics)
       would be eligible, as would logistics and border crossing facilities. In addition,
       the evaluation and structuring (for private investment) of downstream, value-
       added activities, such as copper smelters, coal processing facilities and iron
       pellets plants, would also be eligible for funding. If funding is used to prepare a
       power plant, then the March 2010 Operation Guidelines on Criteria for Screening
       Coal Projects under the Strategic Framework for Development and Climate
       Change would be followed.       It is possible that one or two (at most) infrastructure projects will be prepared as
       PPPs with some support from the MINIS. ii.    Component 2 - Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer (US$1.45
       million). This component is devoted towards the development of local skills. The
       emphasis would be on learning by doing but with sufficient support from
       qualified consultants. This support will be extended to line ministries and
       agencies charged with preparing government-funded projects, as well as
       transactions with investors iii.   Component 3 - Strengthening Groundwater Management (US$7.43 million).
       This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to
       manage groundwater resources in the Southern Mongolia. The government has
       established a framework of 29 water basins for the entire country. For Southern
       Mongolia, these basins are centered on groundwater, as surface water is of minor
       importance in the southern part of the country.       In 2011, AusAID approved a proposal to provide additional financing of US$4.2
       million to this component to strengthen groundwater management in Mongolia
       after two years discussion with the Bank. This additional financing increased the
       budget of Component 3 from original US$3.23 million to US$7.43 million. With
       additional financing, this component will mainly support: a) Establishment of                                                                                         2
       Ground Water Management and Information Unit (GWMIU); b) Establishment of
       River Basin Council (RBC); c) Establishment of 3 River Basin Administrations
       (RBA); d) Consultancy service such as assessing legal/institutional framework;
       preparing and implement groundwater management plans and conduction
       groundwater investigation; e) Capacity building activities for established RBC
       and RBAs; f) groundwater assessment and management studies. iv.   Component 4 - Project Management (US$0.63 million). This component will
       finance the staffing, operation and support of the Project Management Unit
       (PMU) at the Ministry of Finance. The PMU oversees the implementation of
       MINIS and will reports to the State Secretary for Finance. The PMU Director has

10,P095050,"The project development objective, as provided in the original (PAD 2006), was ""toenhance the institutional capacity to manage water and forest resources, reduce theincidence and severity of water shocks, such as drought, floods and water shortage inriver catchments and improve the livelihoods of communities in the co-management ofwater and forest resources"" Since the project will not finance activities to actively reducewater shocks in river catchments, and to simplify the objectives and outcome, the revisedproject development objective (PDO) is ""to improve management of water and forestresources in selected districts."" Consequently, the Results Framework has been adjustedto better measure the revised PDO, as follows: (i) replacing indicators for which baselinescould not be established within the first two years of implementation (e.g. reduction ofsediment load); and (ii) changing some indicators to improve their alignment to therevised PDO. As per the request of the GoK, the restructured project agreements willcover: (i) the revision and simplification of the PDO; (ii) a revision of the resultsframework (which includes changes to outcome indicators); (iii) reallocation of about
21% of project funds to allow coverage of financing gaps in irrigation investments andunderestimated costs in technical consultancies, and to carry out sedimentation controland water flow regulation infrastructure investments; and (iv) deletion of two datedcovenants.
","The proposed restructured project will retain four components: (i) Water Resource
Management and Irrigation; (ii) Management of Forest Resources; (iii) Livelihood
Investments in the Upper Tana Catchment; and (iv) Management and Monitoring and
Evaluation. The first two components support the legal and institutional reformscontained in recent legislation, as well as investments in catchment areas. The thirdcomponent provides assistance to communities participating in management of naturalresources. The fourth component provides managerial oversight and monitoring andevaluation for the project. Changes in components or sub-components are intended toaddress implementation delays while retaining the general project design. Theadjustments focus on: (i) modifying expenditure categories within components/sub-components, either by reducing scope or enabling Implementing Agencies to implementactivities directly rather than through community driven development (CDD) approachesonly, thereby speeding up project implementation on the ground; and (ii) shiftingresources to better align the project to institutional priorities (e.g. water allocation/qualitymonitoring and control, climate change). In addition, and in acknowledgment of the needto engage with indigenous peoples (IPs) in the Cherangany Hills, changes in projectintervention will cover this area. The following section describes the project activities by component. Component 1 - Water Resource Management and Irrigation (USD44.5 m). Water is oneof Kenya’s key natural resources upon which it depends for development and growth.
Over the past several years the Government of Kenya (GOK) undertook a far-reachingprogram of reform in the water sector which resulted in the promulgation of the 2002
Water Act. This has substantially improved the country#s potential to manage its waterresources but the effectiveness of the reform program depends on the ability toimplement the principles of the new Act. The key areas of implementation which thisproject supports are the following: (i) Strengthening the capacity of the Water Resource
Management Authority (WRMA), with direct investments in the Upper Tana Catchment,such as erosion control and terracing, small to medium water storage investments as wellas improvement of on-farm agronomic practices; and (ii) Consolidation of irrigationreforms and investments, including the development of a new irrigation infrastructure inthe Lower Nzoia and rehabilitation of existing structures in the Mwea irrigation scheme. Component 2 - Management of Forest Resources (USD22.4 m). With the passage of the
Forest Act in 2005, Kenya is advocating a major shift away from exclusive governmentconservation and management of forest resources towards greater joint management withlocal communities and the private sector for the protection and sustainable use of forests.
This would require improved forest governance and participation and investment byprivate sector stakeholders. This approach is consistent with the wider and ongoing reforms in related sectors such as water resources. To assist the Ministry of Forestry and
Widlife (MoFW), and the newly established Kenya Forest Service (KFS), in carrying outthese reforms, the project will provide: (i) assistance in creating a transparent andaccountable regulatory and institutional framework; and (ii) targeted support toimplement the Forest Act. Investments are expected to complement activities alreadyundertaken in the sector and in critical watersheds that have involved partnerships by the
Bank with FAO, USAID and the Government of Finland. Foremost among the needscovered in these activities are: (i) Supporting Forest Sector institutional reforms to assistthe GOK with the reforms necessary to transform the Forest Department into a semi-autonomous KFS at national level; (ii) Enabling community participation and benefitsharing, providing assistance to identify and prioritize an array of partnership models toimplement the legislative framework and improve benefit sharing; and (iii) Communityand private sector investment in commercial forestry to strengthen institutional supportservices for the creation of an enabling environment for community and private sectorinvolvement in development and management of production forests.  Component 3 - Livelihood Investments in the Upper Tana Catchment (USD6.2 m).
Using a CDD approach, proposals are sought from communities in the catchment toinvest in livelihood enhancing micro-projects which support the natural resource base.
For example, opportunities to establish afforestation schemes in the watersheds,development of private sector/community partnerships for timber, fuelwood and pulpproduction, production and sale of seedlings, introduction of productivity-enhancingtechniques of agro-forestry or conservation farming, and other investments in farmagriculture development are considered. Component 4 - Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (USD4.9 m). Thecomponent provides the resources necessary for effective management and monitoring ofthe project. Management of the tasks undertaken by the two line ministries and theirrespective organizations is mainstreamed.

11,P107314,"The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen urban services andinfrastructure in the Nairobi metropolitan area. This will be achieved by investing inlocal infrastructure (roads, markets, street lighting, bicycle and pedestrian pathways,drainage, and the like). It will also be assisted by supporting improvements in integratedsolid waste management and in sewerage collection and disposal. Finally, the projectwill help to improve service delivery by strengthening the current and future entitiesresponsible for service delivery, including the central ministry, current local authoritiesand future county governments, utilities and other service providers, and possible futuremetropolitan authorities responsible for planning, transport, and other services.
","The proposed project comprises four components. These are: (1) institutional reform andplanning, (2) local government infrastructure and services, (3) metropolitan infrastructureand services, and (4) project management, and monitoring and evaluation. The details ofthe four components and the proposed activities are presented below.
 Component 1: Institutional reform and planning (IDA US$15 million). This componentwill assist existing local authorities within the Nairobi metropolitan area, as well as newentities and authorities that will be created once the devolved government aspect of thenew constitution takes effect. These new entities possibly include county governments,metropolitan authorities, and agencies, and other units of administration. This componentwill support the capacity enhancement and planning activities of these entities. Inaddition, the component will strengthen the Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan
Development (MoNMD) or its functional successor, if applicable, after the constitutionalchanges come into place.  Component 2: Local government infrastructure and services (IDA US$60 million).Thiscomponent will finance on a grant basis priority urban infrastructure in 13 selected urbanareas in the Nairobi metropolitan area. The infrastructure to be financed will be theresponsibility of the current local authorities and under the mandate of the future countygovernments. The investments to be financed under this component are relatively small-scale local projects; the large projects that cross local administrative boundaries will besupported under component 3. The investments to be selected by the local authorities caninclude drainage systems, local streets, bicycle and foot paths, street and security lighting,public parks, public markets, solid waste management and street cleaning, andfirefighting equipment and facilities. All subprojects will be selected on the basis of theexisting participatory process for prioritizing local investments, called the Local
Authority Service Development Action Plan, which provide the basis for local authoritystrategic plans. A number of priority investments have already been selected throughcitizen participation in the project’s selected urban areas. The specific activities NaMSIPwill finance out of these lists will be limited by the project’s financial allocation for eachurban area and will be defined by the municipal councils, which are democraticallyelected bodies representing citizens of urban areas.   The urban areas to benefit from the project have been selected out of the total 24within the Nairobi metropolitan area. The selection criteria for these areas include: (a)population size (current and projected), (b) population density, and (c) high populationgrowth since 1999. Additionally, these urban areas have been identified as critical for thegrowth of the metropolitan area as per Nairobi Metropolitan Spatial Plan. Most of thecurrent local authorities, including those within the 13 selected urban areas willfunctionally cease to exist as administrative units following the elections (expected in
December 2012, or latest in March 2013) and they will be succeeded by countygovernments. Thus, the approach of the project to focus on urban areas, rather than onspecific local authorities will allow the project to adapt to the changing governancearrangements and support the emerging institutional structures, once the new constitutionis implemented.  Component 3: Metropolitan infrastructure and services (IDA US$250 million). Thiscomponent will assist in providing large-scale metropolitan infrastructure in the areas ofsolid waste, transport, and sewerage services. In contrast to those financed undercomponent 2, these investments will be large-scale which is crucial for the development and integration of the metropolitan area as a whole. Regarding solid waste, thecomponent will support the preparation and implementation of an integratedmetropolitan-wide solid waste management (ISWM) strategy. The ISWM strategy willidentify the policy, institutional, legal, and regulatory changes required to create a well-functioning solid waste system. The project will support design and implementation ofsuch reforms. Regarding transport, the component will strengthen the connectivitybetween centers of growth in the metropolitan area by (a) preparing land use plans andconstructing or upgrading public infrastructure surrounding commuter rail stations andother nodes of transport; (b) constructing and rehabilitating strategic roads as identified inthe Mass Rapid Transit Study undertaken by Ministry of Transport; and (c) improvingtraffic management and flow. The general location of the commuter rail stations hasbeen agreed with the KRC, and the exact locations will be identified in a study to befinanced under NaMSIP. Support for transport-related activities will be undertaken inclose coordination with the Bank-supported National Urban Transport Improvement
Project (NUTIP), currently under preparation. Support for sewerage services will includethe construction and rehabilitation of wastewater collection systems to enable urbangrowth in strategic areas, as well as wastewater treatment and disposal facilities.
Specifically, the component will support the construction of the Ruiru-Juja-Thikasewerage system.

12,P118287,"The objective of any prospective World Bank financial support to the proposed Kosovo Power
Project would be to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation and strengthensecurity of supply in Kosovo in an economically efficient, environmentally sustainable, and acarbon-neutral manner.
","The proposed Kosovo Power Project is envisaged to replace the Kosovo A Power Station with arehabilitated existing power plant (Kosovo B) and a new power plant as well as the development of a mine to meet the fuel needs. As noted above, the determination of any World Bank financialsupport for the proposed Kosovo Power Project is linked to the forthcoming SFDCC External
Expert Panel review. It is envisaged that the new power plant be developed as an extension of the
Kosovo B power plant site and have some common facilities. Subject to a clearer definition ofscope, the associated infrastructure that might prospectively be needed would include anelectrical interconnection upgrade, a water buffer reservoir, a suitable disposal site for ash, aswell as other potentially associated infrastructure such as any necessary upgrades to the Iber-
Lepenc water canal.

The World Bank supports Kosovo’s energy sector through the Lignite Power Technical
Assistance Project (LPTAP) (P097635), which is helping the Government strengthen policy,legal, and regulatory frameworks to attract private investment in the energy sector. LPTAP hassupported several key activities related to the possible preparation of the proposed project:
    x Preparation of a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment of proposed mining and
        power generation activities in the Obiliq area
    x Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan for Hade Village
    x Purchase of air monitoring equipment

Depending on the scope of any prospective engagement by the World Bank based on theoutcome of the SFDCC External Expert Panel review, the World Bank might considersupporting the following additional items:
    x soil and water sampling
    x the preparation of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
    x engagement of an independent panel of experts to advise on the Social and
       Environmental Impact Assessment
    x preparation of a low-carbon growth strategy for Kosovo energy sector
    x preparation of an energy efficiency database (in collaboration with the Rochester Institute
       of Technology and the American University of Kosovo)
    x preparation of a wind power feasibility study (in cooperation with REPIC (Swiss) /AUK
    x a carbon capture and storage (CCS) assessment and capacity building, funded by the CCS
       Trust Fund
    x capacity building relating to environmental and social safeguards implementation

The main environmental issues of the proposed project would relate to:
(i)     direct and local impacts of construction, rehabilitation and operation of the thermal powerplants and the lignite coalmine, including land conversion and habitat loss; hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal; emissions to air, soil and water; and
(ii)    global climate change impacts from use of lignite coal as a source of energy for powergeneration.

A Resettlement Policy Framework that is consistent with World Bank resettlement policyguidelines has been prepared and approved by the Government. The Government is currentlypreparing a Resettlement Action Plan for the Shala neighborhood of Hade Village for whichurgent access is needed to ensure that the Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) has continuity of coal supply to the power plants. The Government has engaged the services of a specializedmining resettlement firm, which is providing technical assistance and capacity-building. Inaddition to the households from Hade, the Government has made provision to resettle householdspreviously displaced by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)for safety reasons from mine subsidence areas in 2005. Most of these people, some 102households, have been living in temporary accommodations since then.
","The Ministry of Environmental and Spatial Development (MESP) was initially established as adepartment within the UN caretaker structure and subsequently became a ministry in 2002-2003.
Environmental Impact Assessments are reviewed by the Environment Department at MESP, and
MESP forms expert groups when needed for the review of EIA reports. In 2007, the Kosovo
Environmental Protection Agency became operational under MESP and one of its tasks isissuing opinions on environmental impact assessment and on environmental consents forconstruction permits. The institutional structure for the review of EIAs and issuance ofenvironmental permits exists. The Cleanup and Land Reclamation Project (P096181) includedactivities to support the Environmental Department of MESP to gain practical experience withenvironmental cleanup projects as well as the EIA review and environmental permitting process.

","The identification of the Projects interventions, while based on the objectives and description provided in PMTs federal government approved Carta Consulta, were refined as a result of the detailed discussion between PMT and the Bank during Project preparation. As a result of this process the Project was divided into the following three components: (i) Municipal Management Modernization, City Development, and Project 
Management; (ii) Integrated Urban-Environmental Development in Lagoas do Norte; and (iii) Social and Economic Development in Lagoas do Norte.  
Component 1 groups the Project activities that are directly related to the first part of the 
PDO, namely modernization of municipal administration, while Components 2 and 3 encompass activities directly related to the second sub-objective of the PDO, improving the quality of life in the Lagoas do Norte region of the city. Nevertheless, the ambitious, integrated investment program that the Project will support under Components 2 and 3 in the Lagoas do Norte region, with the overarching objective of transforming the quality of life in this area, will also bring much valuable experience to the municipal government on how to work in an integrated manner  with numerous entities within PMT as well as with civil society and the private sector  in the improvement of municipal service provision and outreach to disadvantaged communities, the lessons learned from which will themselves make important contributions to the process of municipal modernization and management improvement.  
Component 1: Municipal Management Modernization, City Development, and Project 
Management (US$ 4.37 M)  
This component includes activities to consolidate PMTs recent efforts to improve its financial and budget management processes and capacity, to improve service delivery (in water supply and sanitation and in education, amongst others); to improve urban and environmental management capacity and processes, and to lead the process and dialogue of the citys local economic and social development vision and strategy. Details of the sub-components and their activities are given in Annex 4. Component 1 is divided into the following sub-components.  
Financial and budget management modernization This sub-component will provide the technical assistance and capacity building necessary to consolidate and improve PMTs financial and budget management processes.  
Water supply and sanitation service delivery modernization This sub-component will assist PMT as it advances to comply with the new federal WSS law, including the preparation of a municipal WSS plan, the creation and strengthening of a municipal WSS regulating body, and the formalization of a service delivery mechanism consistent with federal law.

PMT in its planning and control of the urban and environmental sectors in Teresina. 
Under urban management the Project will provide support to the preparation of the citys municipal urban master plan, municipal transport master plan, municipal drainage master plan, and municipal solid waste management master plan. It will also assist PMT in elaborating the new/updated laws to accompany the finalization of these different urban planning instruments. It will provide analytical and TA support to PMT to assist in developing consolidated strategies for enforcing existing legal and administrative mechanisms required to regularize slums, and for facilitating access to land. With regard to environmental management, the sub-component will seek to increase the PMTs institutional capacity in this field with a view to introducing an environmental licensing and enforcement/inspection control system, thus improving PMT efficiency.  
LED Strategy development and implementation This sub-component will assist PMT in the development and implementation of local economic development (LED) strategy for 
Greater Teresina, using as a starting point the economic and social development recommendations that were established in PMTs Teresina  Agenda 2015.  
Project management This sub-component will support PMT in the structuring and the operationalization of the project management unit (PMU). It will finance the costs of selected individual consultants to support implementation in areas of Bank specialization such as procurement, financial management, safeguards, etc. It will also finance key consultancies for assisting in the Projects monitoring and evaluation, as well as financing Project audits.

Component 1: Rehabilitation of Priority National Roads in the East-West corridor providing connectivity to the Northern Province. This component will consist of re-surfacing and improvement of approximately 134 km of #A# class road providing connectivity to Northern and Eastern provinces. It will also include the design review and supervision of selected sections - Ambepussa #Dambulla (92 km #from 0 to 91.9th km)and Kanthale-Trincomalee ( 42km # from 157th to 199th km.  9. 
Component 2: Institutional Strengthening and improvements in Asset 
Management Practices:  This component will provide funding for maintenance, technical assistance and strengthening of the systems within the RMTF and RDA relating to road maintenance, Institutional strengthening of the RDA, addressing of issues identified through the capacity assessment relating to Road safety, incremental operating cost, etc.  10. 
A 3-year periodic maintenance program of prioritized roads will be funded (US$ 10 million) under the proposed second additional financing. The principle behind the 
IDA funding of maintenance will also be to fund a higher share of maintenance when the maintenance funding by GOSL is less and progressively reduce as the GOSL funding for maintenance increase. It is however recognized that there will be a capacity constraint in using the IDA funding in the first year due to the timing of procurement of contracts. It is therefore agreed that the amount of funding from IDA over the 3 year period from 2011 to 2014 will be US$ 3, 4 and 3 million respectively. The identified program of roads will be co- financed by IDA (50%) and GoSL (50%).  11. 
The RDA has applied for a grant from the Global Road Safety Fund for a 
Capacity Assessment. The Assessment is currently under preparation and it was agreed that the institutional strengthening component will aim to address the main issues identified through the Road Safety capacity assessment. It is envisaged that US$1 million will be allocated on road safety.

The APL will also provide support for the efficient expansion of power generation and distribution and to increase access to urban and peri-urban areas, particularly in Mombasa and 
Nairobi. ","[from section 3 of PCN] 
The project under APL 1 would comprise four components as follows: (a) 
Distribution Component (US$ 115 million)
.
  The distribution system in Nairobi and Coastal area will be upgraded and reinforced through construction of 66/33/11 kV lines and installation substation and distribution transformers; provision of miscellaneous facilities metering,  control and load dispatch equipment.  The expected output would be reduction of non-technical losses by about 4% and technical losses by 1%, and increase in customer connections by about 300,000.  In addition quality of power supply (voltage levels) will improve, and interruptions will be reduced. (b) 
Generation Component (US$40 million)
.
  This will include provision and installation of equipment for the conversion of 2x30MW gas turbines at Kipevu (Mombasa) to combined cycle operation. The investment component is likely to be financed by the EIB.  The expected output of this generation component would be 36MW of thermal capacity, sufficient to replace the Westpont IPP in Mombasa whose contract expires this year. (c) 
Feasibility Studies and Engineering Services Component. (US$8.70 million)
.
  
This will include feasibility, environmental and social impact assessment and engineering services for components (a) and (b) above; feasibility and environmental and social impact assessment studies for the LPG import handling and storage facilities component to be undertaken under APL2; a geothermal reservoir optimization study for the Olkaria I, II and IV sites; feasibility and preliminary design work for the proposed Olkaria IV site [Olkaria, Suswa and 
Longonot prospects for a potential output of 60-70MW]; and consultants services for establishment of a cost center in KenGen for geothermal resource development and preparation of a comprehensive business plan and private-public business models. The geothermal business plan will identify the required drilling activities and related costs and options for financing.  Possible sources for financing the investment requirements to be identified under the business plan would be the Bank, GEF, and KfW and the Government. (d) 
Institutional and capacity Building Component (US$3.0 million) The technical assistance and training requirements will be required to support:  (i)  implementation of KPLCs corporate recovery plan (US$3,000,000); (ii) capacity building for the Energy Regulatory Commission (EC) (US$500,000); KenGen (US$100,000), MoE (US$500,000); and (iii) policy and regulatory studies (US$500,000).  The project will include building capacity to help the Government to monitor and regulate health and safety issues in the petroleum downstream sector, to implement the standardization of LPG valves and ancillary equipment, determine the measures required to effectively address social and environmental issues that may arise should the decision on the fate of the KPRL entail its closure. ","[Guideline: Refer to Section 5 of PCN]
 
KPLC and KenGen have the institutional structures for managing environmental and social issues and a track record for doing so under several Bank-financed projects, including the ongoing Energy Sector Reform and Power 
Development Project.  The Kenya Pipeline Companys structures and track record has to be assessed as it is the proposed implementing agency for the LPG component.  Kenyas Environmental Management and Coordination

17,P078550,"The proposed additional financing from GEF aims at scaling-up and mainstreaming the outcome of the activities under Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Management 
Project (UDWDP). The additional GEF activities will ultimately support enhancing the sustainability of watershed management activities by restoring and sustaining ecosystem functions and biodiversity while simultaneously enhancing income and livelihood functions, and generating lessons learned in these respects that can be scaled up and mainstreamed at state and national levels.  
This objective is fully consistent with the original objective of the UDWDP. The GEF project is linked to the World Bank supported Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed 
Development Project (UDWDP) that in turn draws on the positive experiences from the 
Integrated Watershed Development Hills-II project that was completed in 2005. The added global development objective is an important element for deriving global benefits of the project.   
","The additional financing will target 20 micro watersheds that have high erosion indices, which are left behind in terms of socio-economic and other criteria and are predominantly situated close to the agricultural frontier. With this targeted approach on the most vulnerable areas, the impact of the project will be positive both in socio-economic and environmental terms. The outcome of the additional financing project will be measured against the following performance indicators: (i) Sustainable Watershed Management mainstreamed into 20 local government plans including parts of watersheds for which two or more Gram Panchayats have shared governance responsibility; (ii) 
Implementation of alternative technologies and approaches for enhancing water availability for agriculture and other domestic use; (iii) reduction in community dependency of forest for fuel wood and entering markets with medicinal and aromatic plants; (iv) improved knowledge of the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems translated into coping strategies; (v) new and innovative techniques and approaches for sustainable land an ecosystem management up-scaled within the 
Uttarakhand state. Performance will be monitored periodically through well defined indicators by external specialists.  
Project Activities  a) 
Watershed planning through community participation- This component will involve Integration of Gram Panchayat level watershed plans at the micro-watershed level.  At the end of the process, 20 number of Micro Watershed Management (MWS) plans will be finalized for implementation.  b)
Controlling land degradation through the SLEM (Sustainable Land and 
Ecosystem Management) approach at watershed level- The component will involve implementation of 20 MWS plans.  Activities  prioritized by the community including soil conservation works on arable non arable land, forest regeneration, pasture development, silvi-pasture development, soil erosion bunds, vegetative barriers, fire management, and water augmentation activities  would be taken up.  c) 
Reduce pressure and dependence on the natural resource base through fostering markets for NTFPs- Under this component, up scaling of the pilot introduction of chir pine briquette making undertaken in UDWDP project will be done. The utilization and conversion of chir pine needles biomass into briquette can be used as fuel for meeting household and other energy requirements of community. The possible fuel switch from a traditional wood based fuel to a non wood based one will go a long way towards reduction of fuel wood consumption from the adjoining forest areas. In addition to above, pine briquette making can also be taken up as a viable income generating activity by 
Vulnerable Groups or SHGs functional in the project area.  d)
Enhance biodiversity conservation and management through watershed planning and community participation- Under this component, domestication and cultivation of at least 5 local medicinal and aromatic plants by communities in 20 micro watersheds would be undertaken.  A cluster approach will be adopted so as to be able to produce marketable quantum  with viable linkages e) 
Improve adaptation to climate change in natural resource based production systems - Under this component, a study for enhancing understanding of the impacts of climate change on natural resource based mountain economies and preparation of adaptation strategy will be carried out.  f) 
Documentation of best (worst) practices to share them within the state as well as through the SLEM Partnership - Documentation of innovative practices will be carried out. These will be disseminated through a number of different media (Print as well as audio-visual).  g) 
Project Management- Project management will include operating cost and the monitoring and evaluation for the project.

Global Outcome indicator:  
Strengthening of the protected areas management capacities for the long-term protection of Butrint National Park and the surrounding Ramsar wetlands complex.  
The following outcome indicator of the original Project under Component A has already been met, namely the completion and approval of the Southern Coastal Development 
Plan by the National Land Use Planning Council. This indicator was met in July 2008.   
","The proposed changes are a result of changes in the original economic, financial, and technical environment specific to the original design of the Project. The restructured 
Project also addresses design and implementation issues raised in the Inspection Panel 
Investigation Report for the Project and serves to align the project with the recommendations of the Management Report and Recommendation in Response. Respectively, the Project Development Objective (PDO) has been changed to focus on support for provision of critical infrastructure to improve environmental and sanitary conditions essential for coastal development. The proposed changes will not have major effect on the original implementation arrangements, financial management, procurement arrangements, nor on the safeguards category of the Project.  
Though the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Clean-up Project was originally foreseen as an Adaptable Program Lending Credit (APL) consisting of two phases, no second phase will take place.  
Under the original Project, Component A focused on enhancing the capacity of 
Albanian authorities to manage coastal resources through development of an adequate policy, legal and regulatory and monitoring framework, including effective management functions at the central, regional and local levels. The findings of the Inspection Panel 
Investigation Report, follow-up described in the Management Report in response to the 
Inspection Panel report, and subsequent discussions with the Government of Albania have led to a decision to drop certain Project activities and restructure the Project. 
Subsequently, financing for land use planning activities is not included in the restructured 
Project.  
The activities under Component A related to Strategic Policy Support and Coastal 
Management Strengthening that will not be incorporated in the restructured Project include (i) Sub-component A.1 Strategic Policy Support; (ii) Sub-component A.2 Coastal 
Management Strengthening, consisting of the following activities: (a) regulatory capacity strengthening; (b) capacity building for the resolution of disputes; (c) strengthening of integrated coastal zone management capacity; (d) environmental management strengthening; and (f) land-use and spatial planning strengthening.  
Project Components which will remain under the restructured Project include:  
Sub-component A.2.e): Protected Area Management Strengthening piloting and implementating sustainable management activities in and around of Butrint National Park (BNP), Albania's most important protected area. This component includes (i) finalizing the protected areas Management Plan, (ii) provision of environmental infrastructure in the 
Park, and (iii) preparing a Social Assessment (SA) to complement the Social Survey already completed.  
Component B: Southern Coastal Environmental Infrastructure and Rehabilitation. This subcomponent will remain largely unchanged.  
Sub-component B.1: Southern Coastal Solid Waste Management, for which the Project will finance construction of one municipal landfill near Saranda and one transfer station near Himare.  Originally, the Project was to support construction of a landfill near 
Himare. However, due to the small quantities of waste generated by local communities, the difficulty of locating the suitable landfill site near Himare, and construction and upgrade of the coastal road (financed by the Government of Albania), this has been changed to a transfer station from where waste will be transported to the constructed landfill near Saranda.  In addition to the construction of the landfill and transfer station, the restructured Project will support a review of issues related to the unsanitary dumpsite near Saranda. Finally, the restructured Project will support review of regulatory issues related to construction and demolition waste. The key success factor to reduce the effects of Construction Demolition Waste (CDW) is strict enforcement of the laws prohibiting quarry operators and construction firms from dumping CDW dispersed throughout the terrain and coastal slopes. Regulatory measures, if implemented properly, would be more effective rather than bringing waste to a designated collection point.  
Sub-component B.2: Saranda Gateway. No changes are foreseen under this sub-component which will support investment for rehabilitation of the Saranda port infrastructure to facilitate passenger access to the Southern Coast.  
Sub-component B.3: Sewer and Water Supply in Saranda Tourist Area will be included in the restructured Project as originally planned.  
Sub-component B.4: Coastal Village Conservation and Development Program (CVCD) program will support the following (i) Infrastructure Improvements, including (a) local public investments related to rehabilitation of water supply and roads, cultural heritage enhancement and waste water treatment; and (b) private infrastructure improvements through rehabilitation of roof and facades (R&F) in traditional villages; and (ii) Capacity 
Building and Technical Assistance.  Local land use plans will not be financed anymore under this sub-component as originally envisaged. Likewise, to simplify Project implementation, small-scale environmental protection and sustainable economic activities have been removed from this component.  
Component C: Porto Romano Hot Spot Clean-up will support investment for remediation and containment of hazardous pollution on the site of the former chemical plant at Porto Romano, near Durres. No changes in the design of this component are envisaged.  The obsolete chemicals stored in the warehouses have been repackaged and incinerated abroad, which was financed and implemented separately by the Government of the Netherlands.  The demolition of the remaining structures and the remediation and rehabilitation of the area will be financed under the restructured project.  No land-use planning will be financed under the restructured Project. Technical assistance to prepare a monitoring and implementation of site after-care program and a covenant in the Finance 
Agreement towards the institutional responsibility to implement the after-care program will be included to protect the long-term integrity of the encapsulated site.  
Component D: Project Management and Monitoring will remain to provide support for project management, coordination, public awareness and outreach, monitoring & evaluation and the preparation of the Social and Vulnerability Assessment. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposed Project Development Objectives are to: (i) expand the supply of skilled and employable labor through policy reforms and strengthening of technical and vocational education, and (ii) improve access to Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) services for labor force participants and potential entrants.   
","[from section 3 of PCN] 
The development of a high quality TEVT sector is a long-term agenda that involves the creation of an effective policy/regulatory environment and the strengthening of the nation#s capacity to deliver high quality, market-relevant training.The proposed project aims to support long term development of the TEVT sector by supporting policies of the GON as expressed in several national TEVT policy documents and the proposed amendments to the CTEVT Act.  
Simultaneously, the project will support the strengthening of select institutions providing technical and vocational education, and delivering short-term market-relevant vocational training in key sectors through institutions chosen in a competitive manner. The project will comprise of the following four components:  
Component 1: Implementation Support for the Nepal TEVT Plan:  This component will support the development of the necessary institutional structures to create an effective policy and regulatory environment for the long term.  The GON has established a set of policy objectives it wishes to implement under the new National TEVT policy and the amendments to the CTEVT 
Act which include inter alia:  i. 
Establishment of a high level multi-party Committee on Education and Skills which will also include private sector and civil society stake-holders as members.  ii. 
Support for the development of a comprehensive National Strategy for TEVT.  iii. 
Preparation of a white paper for the restructuring of CTEVT, establishment of a 
Qualifications Authority for Education and Skills, and adoption of a National Qualifications 
Framework.  iv. 
The development of a draft plan for establishment and operation of an Employment Fund.  v.
Development of a framework for the delivery of vocational educational and training services by the private sector.  
Disbursements under this project will be linked to reform targets being met by GON and implementing agencies. The targets will be developed to be measurable and verifiable and under the jurisdiction of the implementing agencies.  
Component 2: Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education: This component will focus on improving the quality and relevance of training imparted at the technical education and 
Diploma levels, these are typically longer term programs. Eligible public and private institutions will be competitively selected on the basis of well-defined criteria to be provided with support under this component. Disbursements under this component will be made on the basis of measurable and verifiable performance of the selected institutions.  
Component 3:  Ensuring Employment through Short-term Vocational Training Programs in 
Domestic and Overseas Markets:  The component will support two types of short-term training programs to increase employability of Nepalese youth in domestic and overseas markets.  i. 
Vouchers for Jobs: This sub-component will support a voucher program for those who wish to obtain short-term training in select number of trades and areas. The specific trades to be supported will be decided during project preparation. Voucher payments will be in two parts # unit cost to the training provider and stipend to the prospective trainee. Payment to the training provider will be staggered and made conditional upon meeting key requirements such as attendance rates, academic performance, maintenance of program and fiduciary records and placement performance. Beneficiary trainees will be given a stipend. Unit cost of training, selection criteria for the beneficiary trainees and the stipend amount will be determined during project preparation.  ii. 
Pilot of Recognition of Prior Learning: This sub-component will pilot the development of asystem to recognize and certify prior learning. It aims to not only increase the market value of valuable, but informally learnt, skills but also enable workers with such training to upgrade their skills through formal TEVT programs. Such certification will provide skilled workers a portable certificate that can increase their marketability.  
Component 4: Project Management and Institutional Capacity Development (Total=IDA=USD 4million): This component will focus on (a) establishing a sound structure for project management and implementation, including monitoring and evaluation, and providing it with appropriate technical assistance, staffing and logistical support; and (b) build capacity for policy development, planning and delivery of improved quality vocational training. In addition, this component will also support the Government in improving its ability to develop labor demand trends by sector so that at the policy level training resources can be increasingly channeled to support these growth areas.

Consequently, the Results Framework has been adjustedto better measure the revised PDO, as follows: (i) replacing indicators for which baselinescould not be established within the first two years of implementation (e.g. reduction ofsediment load); and (ii) changing some indicators to improve their alignment to therevised PDO. As per the request of the GoK, the restructured project agreements willcover: (i) the revision and simplification of the PDO; (ii) a revision of the resultsframework (which includes changes to outcome indicators); (iii) reallocation of about
21% of project funds to allow coverage of financing gaps in irrigation investments andunderestimated costs in technical consultancies, and to carry out sedimentation controland water flow regulation infrastructure investments; and (iv) deletion of two datedcovenants.
","The proposed restructured project will retain four components: (i) Water Resource
Management and Irrigation; (ii) Management of Forest Resources; (iii) Livelihood
Investments in the Upper Tana Catchment; and (iv) Management and Monitoring and
Evaluation. The first two components support the legal and institutional reformscontained in recent legislation, as well as investments in catchment areas. The thirdcomponent provides assistance to communities participating in management of naturalresources. The fourth component provides managerial oversight and monitoring andevaluation for the project. Changes in components or sub-components are intended toaddress implementation delays while retaining the general project design. Theadjustments focus on: (i) modifying expenditure categories within components/sub-components, either by reducing scope or enabling Implementing Agencies to implementactivities directly rather than through community driven development (CDD) approachesonly, thereby speeding up project implementation on the ground; and (ii) shiftingresources to better align the project to institutional priorities (e.g. water allocation/qualitymonitoring and control, climate change). In addition, and in acknowledgment of the needto engage with indigenous peoples (IPs) in the Cherangany Hills, changes in projectintervention will cover this area. The following section describes the project activities by component. Component 1 - Water Resource Management and Irrigation (USD44.5 m). Water is oneof Kenya’s key natural resources upon which it depends for development and growth.
Over the past several years the Government of Kenya (GOK) undertook a far-reachingprogram of reform in the water sector which resulted in the promulgation of the 2002
Water Act. This has substantially improved the country#s potential to manage its waterresources but the effectiveness of the reform program depends on the ability toimplement the principles of the new Act. The key areas of implementation which thisproject supports are the following: (i) Strengthening the capacity of the Water Resource
Management Authority (WRMA), with direct investments in the Upper Tana Catchment,such as erosion control and terracing, small to medium water storage investments as wellas improvement of on-farm agronomic practices; and (ii) Consolidation of irrigationreforms and investments, including the development of a new irrigation infrastructure inthe Lower Nzoia and rehabilitation of existing structures in the Mwea irrigation scheme. Component 2 - Management of Forest Resources (USD22.4 m). With the passage of the
Forest Act in 2005, Kenya is advocating a major shift away from exclusive governmentconservation and management of forest resources towards greater joint management withlocal communities and the private sector for the protection and sustainable use of forests.
This would require improved forest governance and participation and investment byprivate sector stakeholders. This approach is consistent with the wider and ongoing reforms in related sectors such as water resources. To assist the Ministry of Forestry and
Widlife (MoFW), and the newly established Kenya Forest Service (KFS), in carrying outthese reforms, the project will provide: (i) assistance in creating a transparent andaccountable regulatory and institutional framework; and (ii) targeted support toimplement the Forest Act. Investments are expected to complement activities alreadyundertaken in the sector and in critical watersheds that have involved partnerships by the
Bank with FAO, USAID and the Government of Finland. Foremost among the needscovered in these activities are: (i) Supporting Forest Sector institutional reforms to assistthe GOK with the reforms necessary to transform the Forest Department into a semi-autonomous KFS at national level; (ii) Enabling community participation and benefitsharing, providing assistance to identify and prioritize an array of partnership models toimplement the legislative framework and improve benefit sharing; and (iii) Communityand private sector investment in commercial forestry to strengthen institutional supportservices for the creation of an enabling environment for community and private sectorinvolvement in development and management of production forests.  Component 3 - Livelihood Investments in the Upper Tana Catchment (USD6.2 m).
Using a CDD approach, proposals are sought from communities in the catchment toinvest in livelihood enhancing micro-projects which support the natural resource base.
For example, opportunities to establish afforestation schemes in the watersheds,development of private sector/community partnerships for timber, fuelwood and pulpproduction, production and sale of seedlings, introduction of productivity-enhancingtechniques of agro-forestry or conservation farming, and other investments in farmagriculture development are considered. Component 4 - Management and Monitoring and Evaluation (USD4.9 m). Thecomponent provides the resources necessary for effective management and monitoring ofthe project. Management of the tasks undertaken by the two line ministries and theirrespective organizations is mainstreamed.

25,P096124,"The primary development objective of the proposed project is to increase the supply of energy to India's national grid through the addition of renewable, low-carbon energy from the Vishnugad Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project.  A secondary development objective is to support capacity-building at the Tehri Hydro Development Corporation with respect to the preparation and implementation of economically, environmentally and socially sustainable hydropower projects.   
","The project will consist of two components: (i) construction of the 444 MW Vishnugad 
Pipalkoti Hydro Electric Project (VPHEP); and (ii) technical assistance for capacity-building and institutional strengthening at THDC.  
VPHEP has been designed as a 444 (4 x 111) MW, run-of-river hydropower generation scheme on the Alaknanda River in the north Indian state of Uttarakhand.  The scheme envisages the utilization of 228.86 cumecs discharge and design head of 237 metres.  The 
Project will generate approximately 1,800 GWh (Gigawatt-hours, or million kilowatt-hours) of design energy in a dependable year.  The gross storage of 3.63 million cubic meters (MCM) is equivalent to about 4.9 hours of average flow. The reservoir capacity, i.e. live storage, is equal to the total volume of water required for power generation for diurnal variations.  The major civil works required by VPHEP include a 65-meter diversion dam, a 13.4-km headrace tunnel and a 3-km tail race tunnel, and an underground power house.  All water diverted from the river will be returned to the river approximately 18 km after the point of diversion.

26,P095901,"The proposed AR-CDM project will mobilize and encourage resource poor farmers (especially women and marginal farmers) to raise plantations of tree species with high rates of carbon removal in their farmlands. The proposed AR-CDM project activity will also facilitate in exploring and demonstrating the technical and methodological approaches related to credible carbon removal process. This will be a pilot initiative that aims at improving rural livelihoods through Carbon Sequestration by adopting environment friendly technologies based on agro-forestry (reforestation) practices. The 
AR-CDM project has been developed through a series of consultations with different partners such as farmers, Veda-Max, JK paper mills (JK) and World Bank, where in a broad consensus on the following objectives were reached:  To remove CO2through plantation forestry in degraded areas and test and pilot how reforestation activities generate high-quality greenhouse gases emission removals that can be measured, monitored and verified. To develop plantation and agro-forestry models for providing multiple benefits to the farmers in respect of timber, pulpwood, firewood, minor forest produces, intercropping along with carbon removal. To provide additional income and promote livelihoods of the resource poor farmers through carbon revenues. To reforest degraded lands and increase soil and moisture conservation for reclaiming the waste land in the region.  To reduce the dependence of the paper industry on natural forests and increase bio-diversity. To build capacity of the various stakeholders to benefit from global mechanisms.  
","The project will promote plantations of multi purpose and multi-type species. The project partners will take into consideration criteria such as carbon removal rates, biodiversity enhancement, soil and moisture conservation and the associated minor forest produces. 
Several options for choice of species with carbon credit potential have been finalized in consultation with the farmers and other sector partners. This includes fast growing and short rotation species, timber species and various options of inter-cropping.  The percentage of inter-cropping and species density in AR-CDM project area is dependent upon the soil suitability, preferences of the farmers and availability of technologies.   
While the AR-CDM project is an independent pilot initiative, it can also be considered as an additional component of the ongoing JK paper mill supported plantation programme. 
Both projects (CDM & JK) focus on different approaches and implemented on different lands at the same time complement each other in all respects.  The JK being a community driven project focuses on enhancing pulp wood production through extensive community mobilization process and technological innovation (i.e., development of clonal technologies and local gene pool).  Whereas in AR-CDM project, the focus is only on afforestation for which the farmers will receive cash incentive (by being a potential seller of carbon credit) on two types of lands; (i) non-arable agriculture waste land, and ii) degraded common property land. The pilot initiative aims to bring 3500 Ha of degraded non-arable land under plantation in six districts of AP and Orissa (three districts in each state).  
The project plans to strengthen the farmer-industry partnerships with buy-back arrangements to purchase pulp wood and other produces expected under the project (after the stipulated carbon emission period). It will encourage farmers to go for agro-forestry practices such as inter-cropping during the first year of the plantation to meet their subsistence needs. It has also established a long-term credit network with financial institutions to support resource poor farmers to meet the cost of plantation and maintenance (if required).

","Consistent with the I-PRSP, the proposed project supports reforms to achieve macro-economic andpro-poor growth. In particular, this project will help improve the governance situation in publicenterprises and will help improve the access to the main infrastructures and utilities. The project isfocused on selected sectors of the economy, which can have the highest impact in terms of GDP growth.
Project component 1: Improving the investment climate (US$36.10 million)
Following years of war and of bad governance, the current business environment in DRC is notconducive to attracting investment, to develop the private sector or to restructure the public enterprises.
First, the legal system is no longer adequate and does not have a strong and reliable judiciary system witha well applied commercial code. Second, the tax system is obsolete and virtually impossible to apply forboth the state and the public and private enterprises. Third, the country is perceived as being at highpolitical risk, which is detrimental to attracting foreign direct investment, and to the development ofregional trade and of financial markets. Finally, key sectors of government, like the Ministry of Mines,lack the capacity to actively promote their resources and thus help develop a competitive sector.
Building capacity of the Ministry of Mines will strengthen the Government's capacity to regulate miningactivities, improve revenue management and the granting mining titles.
For the reform to be successful, a new enabling environment addressing these issues will have to be putin place before divestiture is carried out. The Government's objectives through this project are to focuson (i) the legal, judiciary and fiscal framework, (ii) increase financial intermediation, (iii) increase thecapacity at the level of the Ministry of Mines, and (iv) provide for a mechanism to promote investmentswhile reducing administrative barriers and improve policy dialogue with stakeholders.
Project component 2: Implementing the parastatal reform (US$71.69 million)
The once sustainable public enterprises in the utilities sector have all diversified into non-corecommercial activities. Poor governance associated with the sharp decline in economic activity during therecent Congolese conflict have led these enterprises to become financial drains for the Government. Thebasic utility services, they are supplying, have dramatically decreased in quality. Per capita access hasdeclined. Even former cash cows like Gecamines have turned into non-profitable companies. This, inturn, has hampered private sector development, which could not grow in a competitive and transparentenvironment. In parallel to creating the appropriate business environment to foster competitiveness, theproject would support the parastatal reform in the telecommunication, transport, energy and miningsectors, which objectives would be to improve access to, and quality, of the basic utilities, contain thehemorrhage on public finances, and finally address bad governance issues.
The project supports the Government's objectives to (i) facilitate divestiture from ailing publicenterprises (including defining, supporting the social cost and economic reinvention in the mining,banking and telecom sectors): Gecamines, SNEL, OCPT, SNCC, RVA, LAC, Citytrain, BCCE, NBK,
BCA; (ii) create the appropriate controls and institutional capacity for utilities to be provided on asustainable basis; (iii) create the appropriate structure to pilot the parastatal reform through strengtheningof COPIREP.
Project component 3: Initiatives for economic development in the Katanga region (US$7.41million)
This component supports measures aimed at increasing competitiveness of the economy of Katanga, the ﻿3
ISDSleading mining region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Katanga is expected to attract privateinvestment in mining after a brief period of restructuring of parastatal Gecamines. The component wouldcreate new economic opportunities for the workers retrenched from Gecamines and other parastatalspresent in Katanga (such as SNCC and OCPT) and would focus on local economic developmentactivities in the Province. The component consists of the following five activities, aimed at increasingmining-related private sector competitiveness, improvement of living conditions of small-scale miningoperators, empowering municipalities, and social mitigation activities in connection with Gecaminesrestructuring in the region: (i) small grants program; (ii) supply-chain approach to integration of small-and medium enterprises to improve the competitiveness in the region; (iii) transfer of social services tomunicipalities; (iv) set-up of regional development framework; and (v) coordination of activitiesassociated with Gecamines restructuring.  Specific measures will be taken at the policy andzommunity-based levels to ensure that the benefits of mineral wealth can be broadly shared by the
Congolese population.
Project component 4. Project Coordination and Implementation arrangements (US$7.13 million)
The implementation of the project will require regular follow-up from an implementation unit, which willneed to monitor financial management of the project, track disbursement, engage in procurementactivities when needed. The Government has already created BCeCo to support such activities in thecontext of the IDA Grant. It would therefore be consistent with this earlier choice to use BCeCo as the
Project Implementation Unit. However, given the current capacity load of BCECO, it is envisaged tomigrate the implementation capacity of BCECO for this project to COPIREP during the implementationphase of the project.

In particular, this project will help improve the governance situation in publicenterprises and will help improve the access to the main infrastructures and utilities. The project isfocused on selected sectors of the economy, which can have the highest impact in terms of GDP growth.
Project component 1: Improving the investment climate (US$36.10 million)
Following years of war and of bad governance, the current business environment in DRC is notconducive to attracting investment, to develop the private sector or to restructure the public enterprises.
First, the legal system is no longer adequate and does not have a strong and reliable judiciary system witha well applied commercial code. Second, the tax system is obsolete and virtually impossible to apply forboth the state and the public and private enterprises. Third, the country is perceived as being at highpolitical risk, which is detrimental to attracting foreign direct investment, and to the development ofregional trade and of financial markets. Finally, key sectors of government, like the Ministry of Mines,lack the capacity to actively promote their resources and thus help develop a competitive sector.
Building capacity of the Ministry of Mines will strengthen the Government's capacity to regulate miningactivities, improve revenue management and the granting mining titles.
For the reform to be successful, a new enabling environment addressing these issues will have to be putin place before divestiture is carried out. The Government's objectives through this project are to focuson (i) the legal, judiciary and fiscal framework, (ii) increase financial intermediation, (iii) increase thecapacity at the level of the Ministry of Mines, and (iv) provide for a mechanism to promote investmentswhile reducing administrative barriers and improve policy dialogue with stakeholders.
Project component 2: Implementing the parastatal reform (US$71.69 million)
The once sustainable public enterprises in the utilities sector have all diversified into non-corecommercial activities. Poor governance associated with the sharp decline in economic activity during therecent Congolese conflict have led these enterprises to become financial drains for the Government. Thebasic utility services, they are supplying, have dramatically decreased in quality. Per capita access hasdeclined. Even former cash cows like Gecamines have turned into non-profitable companies. This, inturn, has hampered private sector development, which could not grow in a competitive and transparentenvironment. In parallel to creating the appropriate business environment to foster competitiveness, theproject would support the parastatal reform in the telecommunication, transport, energy and miningsectors, which objectives would be to improve access to, and quality, of the basic utilities, contain thehemorrhage on public finances, and finally address bad governance issues.
The project supports the Government's objectives to (i) facilitate divestiture from ailing publicenterprises (including defining, supporting the social cost and economic reinvention in the mining,banking and telecom sectors): Gecamines, SNEL, OCPT, SNCC, RVA, LAC, Citytrain, BCCE, NBK,
BCA; (ii) create the appropriate controls and institutional capacity for utilities to be provided on asustainable basis; (iii) create the appropriate structure to pilot the parastatal reform through strengtheningof COPIREP.
Project component 3: Initiatives for economic development in the Katanga region (US$7.41million)
This component supports measures aimed at increasing competitiveness of the economy of Katanga, the ﻿3
ISDSleading mining region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Katanga is expected to attract privateinvestment in mining after a brief period of restructuring of parastatal Gecamines. The component wouldcreate new economic opportunities for the workers retrenched from Gecamines and other parastatalspresent in Katanga (such as SNCC and OCPT) and would focus on local economic developmentactivities in the Province. The component consists of the following five activities, aimed at increasingmining-related private sector competitiveness, improvement of living conditions of small-scale miningoperators, empowering municipalities, and social mitigation activities in connection with Gecaminesrestructuring in the region: (i) small grants program; (ii) supply-chain approach to integration of small-and medium enterprises to improve the competitiveness in the region; (iii) transfer of social services tomunicipalities; (iv) set-up of regional development framework; and (v) coordination of activitiesassociated with Gecamines restructuring.  Specific measures will be taken at the policy andzommunity-based levels to ensure that the benefits of mineral wealth can be broadly shared by the
Congolese population.
Project component 4. Project Coordination and Implementation arrangements (US$7.13 million)
The implementation of the project will require regular follow-up from an implementation unit, which willneed to monitor financial management of the project, track disbursement, engage in procurementactivities when needed. The Government has already created BCeCo to support such activities in thecontext of the IDA Grant. It would therefore be consistent with this earlier choice to use BCeCo as the
Project Implementation Unit. However, given the current capacity load of BCECO, it is envisaged tomigrate the implementation capacity of BCECO for this project to COPIREP during the implementationphase of the project.

The proposed West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP or the Project) will contribute to:
(a)      improving the competitiveness of the energy sectors in Ghana, Benin, and Togo by promoting theuse of cheaper and environmentally cleaner gas from Nigeria in lieu of solid and liquid fuels for powergeneration and other industrial, commercial uses, and diversifying energy supply sources; and
(b)      fostering regional economic and political integration that would support economic growth, and inparticular the development of the West Africa electricity market.

Overview of the Pipeline System

The West African Gas Pipeline is a regional energy infrastructure project for West Africa.

The Project aims to construct a new high-pressure natural gas pipeline, which will supply natural gas from
Nigeria to markets in Benin, Ghana, and Togo.

The gas to be transported in the new pipeline will be produced and processed in the western part of the
Niger Delta in Nigeria. From there, it will be transported via an existing high-pressure gas pipeline, the
Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS), to the existing terminus of that system near Lagos, Nigeria,where the new pipeline will commence.

From that point, the new pipeline will run about 56 km onshore, to the Nigerian coast, and from therestraight out to sea. From there it will run in a westerly direction roughly parallel to the coast, generallyabout 15 to 20 km offshore, in water depths ranging from about 15 to 70 meters. The initial constructionof the WAGP will terminate at Aboadze in western Ghana, the site of the Takoradi Thermal Power
Stations.

Lateral pipelines will be laid, to permit natural gas to be delivered along the way, at regulation andmetering stations to be situated at landing points at Cotonou in Benin, Lom in Togo, and Tema (near
Accra) in Ghana.
                                                                           2

The total length of the new pipeline will be approximately 678 km, including the length of lateral pipelines.

The estimated initial construction cost of the WAGP is US$ 520 million, and prior to commencingconstruction the Sponsors (see below) of the Project will have spent about US$70 million. Thisconstruction cost estimate has been determined via a competitive bidding process.

The initial installed capacity will be about 200 MMscf/day. In addition, the pipeline will be sized to caterfor expansion to meet anticipated future growth in demand, up to a maximum capacity expected to beabout 470 MMscf/day. The cost of the several stages of expansion to achieve maximum capacity will beapproximately US$ 115 million. An investment decision to construct the new pipeline is expected inlate-2004. This would lead to pipeline startup in late-2006.

From time to time, Nigerian Gas Company (NGC) is expected to incur some expenditure in upgrading
ELPS for the additional WAGP volumes of gas and interconnections for inputs and output, as well as someadditional operation and maintenance expenses associated with the additional volumes. NGC will recoverits investments and additional costs through transportation charges under its Gas Transportation
Agreements (GTAs) with N-Gas, the newly formed gas trading company for WAGP.

After about five years, the Producers (see below) are also expected to incur some costs in upgrading andinstalling gas gathering systems and possibly gas treatment facilities upstream of ELPS, in the oilproduction areas of the Niger Delta and elsewhere. The Producers will recover their investments and othercosts through gas sales under their contracts with N-Gas or any other entity that ships gas through WAGP.

The Gas Producers

The gas to be transported in WAGP will be gas produced from the western part of the Niger Delta in
Nigeria. Two existing oil-producing joint ventures will be producing and processing the gas. One is a jointventure of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (60%) and Chevron Nigeria Limited (40%). Theother is a joint venture involving NNPC (55%) and local affiliates of Shell (i.e., SPDC) (30%), TOTAL
S.A. (i.e., Elf) (10%), and Eni S.p.A. (i.e., Agip) (5%).
                                                       3
                                                                                                           ISDS Under 20-year contracts, the two joint ventures will each supply 50% of the gas to be supplied for WAGP,up to 120 MMscf/day. Hence, the total proportions of gas supply are:                  NNPC:                                            57.50%
                  CNL:                                             20.00%
                  SPDC:                                            15.00%
                  Elf:                                              5.00%
                  Agip:                                             2.50%

In addition, backup arrangements are to be implemented between the two joint ventures to provideadditional security of supply.

The contract price of gas commodity is US$ 0.50 per MMBtu, escalating with inflation and an oil index.

Ownership of the Pipeline System

To date, the Project has been sponsored and funded by a six-company consortium that in August 1999 wasmandated by the Governments of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo to develop the WAGP. Chevron
Nigeria Limited, the Nigerian affiliate of ChevronTexaco Corporation, is the managing Sponsor. Those sixcompanies or their affiliates are expected to own the Project company which in turn will own and operatethe new pipeline.

The pipeline will be owned and operated by a newly formed company, WAPCo, which is incorporated in
Bermuda. A comprehensive shareholders agreement for WAPCo has been executed, under which eachmember of that six-company consortium has ownership entitlements in WAPCo. Final ownership of
WAPCo will depend on the participants making the necessary capital contributions which are provided forin that agreement, but at this stage the following corporations or their respective affiliates (Sponsors) areexpected to be the participants in WAPCo in the following percentages:                     ChevronTexaco Corporation:                                 36.7%
                     Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation:                   25.0%
                     Royal Dutch / Shell:                                       18.0%
                     Government of Ghana:                                       16.3%
                     Societ Beninoise de Gaz SA:                                 2.0%
                     Societ Togolaise de Gaz SA:                                 2.0%

The latter two companies are two small private companies based in Benin and Togo, respectively, that areexpected to develop local distribution systems for gas transported in the WAGP.

Technical Information

The pipeline will be a 20-inch lined pipeline. Initial installed capacity will be about 200 MMscf/day, withincremental expansion of capacity planned, up to an expected ultimate design capacity of 470 MMscf/day.
The pipeline size has been chosen on the basis of overall minimum transportation cost (using the concept ofthe weighted average tariff detailed in the IPA) and other aspects including operational considerations.

The development plan envisages a compression station being constructed at Lagos Beach, the last pointwhere the pipeline is onshore in Nigeria before heading offshore. This compression station willsubsequently be expanded as the pipeline capacity is increased in future years to meet additional demand.

The compression installed initially will be 2 x 12,500 horsepower centrifugal units (one unit as 100%standby). This will be capable of being increased by adding an additional four more 12,500 horsepower

The Project will also provide technical assistance to support pipeline development and subproject preparation through its component 2. To help encourage investment in sanitation and provide capacity building in the NGR, the technical assistance would include a broader group of municipalities and provinces than those that would be ultimately funded under the investment component of the project.  
Specific subprojects approved for funding will need to comply with the technical, economic, financial, institutional, environmental and social eligibility criteria set forth in the Project's Operational Manual, as well as with consultation and disclosure requirements. Consideration for funding will be made on first-come, first-served, basis from those subprojects that are ready for implementation. Subproject proposals will be examined in the context of: (i) consistency with Project objectives, in particular their poverty reduction potential; (ii) compliance with all eligibility criteria; and (iii) level of subproject's ownership and results of stakeholder consultation at the local level.  
Works financed under the subprojects will be operated by the providers in charge of the services within the different provinces, who will commit to provide O&M funding and operate the subproject in accordance with Project rules and an Action Plan to be prepared by the Province for the sustainability of the investments. During the preparation of each specific subproject, the relevant service provider will undertake a capacity and needs assessment and will benefit from an institutional and operational strengthening program financed under the Project to help address the established targets and address identified weaknesses.  
Project components  
Component 1: Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure (US$209 million, with 
US$169.5 million of Bank funding)(These amount include price and physical contingencies): Carrying out of demand-driven Subprojects consisting of the rehabilitation, upgrading and/or reconstruction of Participating Provinces#: (i) wastewater collection, conveyance, treatment and disposal systems, such as wastewater treatment plants, pumping stations, main collectors and secondary sewerage networks; and (ii) water supply systems including, for instance, production and distribution systems that are considered category A from their environmental impact assessment perspective.  
Component 2: Institutional and Operational Development and Technical Assistance (US$15 million, all financed by the Bank): (i) Carrying out of tailored institutional and/or operational strengthening programs and provision of technical assistance for participating 
WSS Service Providers to improve their institutional organization, investment planning, management capabilities and technical, operational, commercial and financial efficiency including, for instance: (a) the development of WSS-related management and information systems; (b) the development of WSS customer databases and cadastres; (c) the provision of technical assistance related to strategic planning, energy efficiency and operational efficiency programs; (d) the carrying out of analysis of cost-recovery options and optimization of rates and subsidy structures; (e) design and implementation of macro- and micro-metering (including minor works), and non-revenue water reduction programs; (f) the provision of technical assistance for institutional reorganization; and (g) the design of training programs for operation and maintenance of systems and installations (focused on wastewater treatment plants, water treatment plants and pumping stations), and the carrying out of studies related thereto, all under terms of reference acceptable to the

40,P071144,"The project's development objective is to increase the competitiveness of selected firms in the mining,transport, energy, telecom and financial sectors, thereby contributing to the growth of these sectors.
The project is thus expected to make an important contribution towards improved living conditions ofthe Congolese population.
Increased competitiveness from changes in tax, legal and judiciary will immediately result in moreprivate investments in the productive economy, which will translate in job creation. Reform in themining, transport, energy, telecom, and financial sectors will be achieved by implementing publicenterprise reform, which should bring the following benefits: (i) increased participation in the economy
From the private sector (thus stimulating competitiveness), increased output of, access to, and quality of,utility services for the population. While leading to job losses in the short ternM the reform will, in themedium term, contribute to generating employment in a stimulating business environment. Finally, apilot around economic reinsertion of workers in the mining sector in the Katanga region will facilitatethe reintegration of Gecamines workers in the local economy and result in empowerment of localcommunities and increased competitiveness of local SMEs. It is expected that this pilot will have ademonstration effect on other sectors of the economy, and will result in substantial decrease in statesubsidies to some ailing sectors of the economy, thus freeing-up scarce resources to implement povertyreduction strategies. ﻿2
ISDS
","Consistent with the I-PRSP, the proposed project supports reforms to achieve macro-economic andpro-poor growth. In particular, this project will help improve the governance situation in publicenterprises and will help improve the access to the main infrastructures and utilities. The project isfocused on selected sectors of the economy, which can have the highest impact in terms of GDP growth.
Project component 1: Improving the investment climate (US$36.10 million)
Following years of war and of bad governance, the current business environment in DRC is notconducive to attracting investment, to develop the private sector or to restructure the public enterprises.
First, the legal system is no longer adequate and does not have a strong and reliable judiciary system witha well applied commercial code. Second, the tax system is obsolete and virtually impossible to apply forboth the state and the public and private enterprises. Third, the country is perceived as being at highpolitical risk, which is detrimental to attracting foreign direct investment, and to the development ofregional trade and of financial markets. Finally, key sectors of government, like the Ministry of Mines,lack the capacity to actively promote their resources and thus help develop a competitive sector.
Building capacity of the Ministry of Mines will strengthen the Government's capacity to regulate miningactivities, improve revenue management and the granting mining titles.
For the reform to be successful, a new enabling environment addressing these issues will have to be putin place before divestiture is carried out. The Government's objectives through this project are to focuson (i) the legal, judiciary and fiscal framework, (ii) increase financial intermediation, (iii) increase thecapacity at the level of the Ministry of Mines, and (iv) provide for a mechanism to promote investmentswhile reducing administrative barriers and improve policy dialogue with stakeholders.
Project component 2: Implementing the parastatal reform (US$71.69 million)
The once sustainable public enterprises in the utilities sector have all diversified into non-corecommercial activities. Poor governance associated with the sharp decline in economic activity during therecent Congolese conflict have led these enterprises to become financial drains for the Government. Thebasic utility services, they are supplying, have dramatically decreased in quality. Per capita access hasdeclined. Even former cash cows like Gecamines have turned into non-profitable companies. This, inturn, has hampered private sector development, which could not grow in a competitive and transparentenvironment. In parallel to creating the appropriate business environment to foster competitiveness, theproject would support the parastatal reform in the telecommunication, transport, energy and miningsectors, which objectives would be to improve access to, and quality, of the basic utilities, contain thehemorrhage on public finances, and finally address bad governance issues.
The project supports the Government's objectives to (i) facilitate divestiture from ailing publicenterprises (including defining, supporting the social cost and economic reinvention in the mining,banking and telecom sectors): Gecamines, SNEL, OCPT, SNCC, RVA, LAC, Citytrain, BCCE, NBK,
BCA; (ii) create the appropriate controls and institutional capacity for utilities to be provided on asustainable basis; (iii) create the appropriate structure to pilot the parastatal reform through strengtheningof COPIREP.
Project component 3: Initiatives for economic development in the Katanga region (US$7.41million)
This component supports measures aimed at increasing competitiveness of the economy of Katanga, the ﻿3
ISDSleading mining region in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Katanga is expected to attract privateinvestment in mining after a brief period of restructuring of parastatal Gecamines. The component wouldcreate new economic opportunities for the workers retrenched from Gecamines and other parastatalspresent in Katanga (such as SNCC and OCPT) and would focus on local economic developmentactivities in the Province. The component consists of the following five activities, aimed at increasingmining-related private sector competitiveness, improvement of living conditions of small-scale miningoperators, empowering municipalities, and social mitigation activities in connection with Gecaminesrestructuring in the region: (i) small grants program; (ii) supply-chain approach to integration of small-and medium enterprises to improve the competitiveness in the region; (iii) transfer of social services tomunicipalities; (iv) set-up of regional development framework; and (v) coordination of activitiesassociated with Gecamines restructuring.  Specific measures will be taken at the policy andzommunity-based levels to ensure that the benefits of mineral wealth can be broadly shared by the
Congolese population.
Project component 4. Project Coordination and Implementation arrangements (US$7.13 million)
The implementation of the project will require regular follow-up from an implementation unit, which willneed to monitor financial management of the project, track disbursement, engage in procurementactivities when needed. The Government has already created BCeCo to support such activities in thecontext of the IDA Grant. It would therefore be consistent with this earlier choice to use BCeCo as the
Project Implementation Unit. However, given the current capacity load of BCECO, it is envisaged tomigrate the implementation capacity of BCECO for this project to COPIREP during the implementationphase of the project.

41,P087807,"The development objective is to strengthen the Governments ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary enterprises in an environmentally sustainable manner; and (ii) providing support to the National Agency for Programs Development and Implementation for the Reconstruction of the Mining 
Regions (NAD) for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions.  
This project is the second Bank operation supporting the restructuring of the Romanian mining sector. The first project involved support for closure of 31 mines, social mitigation support for redundant mine workers through creation of 10,000 alternate jobs, and institutional development to build Government capacity to manage the mining sector through a new mining law, finalization of a Mine Closure Manual, and specialized studies on subsidy management, strategic environmental assessment, and poverty and social impact analysis. The second project builds on the lessons of the first loan by focusing attention on more complex mines (e.g. sulphur), initiating implementation of 
SEA recommendations, and job creation through ALMPs aimed at individual job seekers to improving the environment for economic growth and social regeneration in the mining regions. The Mine Closure and Environment component of the project aims to: (i) 
Complete the closure and rehabilitation of mine sites where production is terminated and thereby reduce environmental impacts and the environmental legacy of the mining sector in line with accession requirements for EU, and return former mine land to other social and economic purposes. (ii) 
Improve the mining sector environmental performance. 
The Socio-Economic Regeneration component is designed to: (i) 
Scale up the job creation measures implemented under the first loan. (ii) 
Support local development activities through community capacity building and financing of economic infrastructure and social services;  
Strengthen the Borrowers capacity to implement the socio-economic regeneration program.   
Key performance indicators are: Subsidy monitoring system shows decline in level of subsidies to meet EU target dates; Hard budget constraints on mining companies to prevent accumulation of additional arrears for state and  municipal taxes, and electricity tariffs;  Number of mines and mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound manner Area of land rehabilitated and handed over to other users or back to the community Number of jobs created by the project Number of beneficiaries from employment and training incentives scheme (ETIS); Number of additional loans, and amount disbursed by micro-credit program Repayment rate of micro-credit loans Number and value of sub-projects implemented under SDSMC Number of community groups in mining settlements mobilized through successful 
Small Grants Scheme (SGS) implementation Number of mining settlements that are able to access resources from other programs for local development activities. 
The project is contributes to the Banks CAS objective of supporting the Governments program: 
The Governments program lays the basis for a pragmatic approach to reforming the economy and raising living standards by improving the quality of Government services and creating an attractive business environment. 
Bank Group assistance will support a broad set of structural and sectoral reforms to accelerate growth and pave the way for Romanias eventual accession to the EU.
 
The project is designed to support the Mining Strategy by tackling critical bottlenecks in the reform process that have slowed down mining sector restructuring through measures that improve social and economic opportunities for the poor (i.e. those impoverished by sector restructuring) that will enable the  Government to move forward on critical and irreversible steps of the sector restructuring program. This approach was identified as one of the key recommendations of the CDF process. 
The project also contributes to the structural agenda by helping to create conditions that will enable the Government to close uneconomic mines and phase out quasi-fiscal deficits that undermine the sustainability of the energy sector. Loss-making mining companies remain a major source of arrears to the utility companies, especially electricity. However, subsidies to mining companies and arrears have continued, ostensibly to protect jobs in the mining regions. By shifting focus from social mitigation to socio-economic regeneration in mining regions, the project creates the basis for accelerating the reform program. 
","A.  
The Mine Closure and Environmental component (total cost US$72 million and loan amount of US$58 including contingencies) of the Project will: (i) 
Support the closure and environmental rehabilitation of mines and/or mine processing facilities at 20 sites as well as other sites to be identified; and (ii) 
Help start implementation of the recommendations of the Sector 
Environmental Assessment which was conducted in 2002. 
Physical Works.
 The government has proposed 20 sites from 7 regions for closure based on criteria agreed with the World Bank including size, technical complexity, cost, environmental and social impact. While production has previously been stopped at many of these sites, the sites have never been closed and properly remediated. Mine buildings, equipment and environmental liabilities will be addressed in the closure process and the land will be reclaimed to allow use for beneficial new purposes.  Nine of the 20 sites are located in the Jiu Valley where land for development and agriculture is scarce.  The project will coordinate closely with the proposed World Bank supported Jiu Valley regional development project on the timing of the closures to assist in the optimum transfer of the land for new uses.  These are also sites where subsidies have been high and closure will thus assist in reducing mining sector subsidy needs.  The sites include coal, lignite, copper, polymetalic (copper, gold, lead), and sulfur mines, as well as mine processing facilities. One site, the Caliman Sulphur mine, will be especially challenging due to its size and environmental issues, and accounts on its own for almost 20% of the mine closure component. The physical works to close the mines and environmental rehabilitation works will take from 2 to 4 years per site. The mine closure activities will also provide a short term boost to the local economy as most workers and supplies are procured locally. 
Technical Support. 
The first Mine Closure and Social Mitigation Project (MCSMP) built alegal and technical base for mine closure in Romania that will be utilized in the new project. In addition to the 20 sites to be closed under the Project the Government is closing an estimated additional 120 sites using its own procedures and sources of funds. The Governments closure procedures have been modified in line with the procedures used in the Bank project and are considered in line with good international practice. 
Technical assistance, through technical audits to ensure international best practice on physical closure and environmental works, will be continued under the Project. As in the first project, training will be provided to transfer knowledge on closure practices from the 
Project to the broader Government closure program implemented by the Consolidated 
Group for Mine Closure (CGMC). The project will also assist in the preparation of technical mine closure manuals for salt and uranium mines. An application for donor trust funds has been made  to fund preparation of these manuals. 
The environmental sub-component
 (total cost US$0.95 million and loan amount US$0.81 million) seeks to improve environmental performance in the mining sector. A Sector 
Environmental Assessment (SEA) was conducted in 2001 and was extended and updated in 2003 under the MCSMP and the new Project will implement some of the SEAs key recommendations. The sub-component will prepare (a) a manual for implementation of an environmental management system in the mining sector; (b) a manual for environmental protection procedures in the mining sector; (c) guidelines for integrated monitoring of environmental impacts generated by mining activities; and (d) and implement an environmental monitoring  pilot project in two sites, Calimani and Baia de 
Aries. 
B.  
Socio-Economic Regeneration:
The Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER) component of the Project will scale up the job creation activities piloted by the MCSMP and will add sub-components to foster local conditions for economic growth and social regeneration based on the lessons learned. The total base cost of this component will be US$68 million, excluding contingencies, of which US$57 million will be from the loan. The main objectives of the 
SER component are to: 1. 
Scale up the job creation measures implemented under the first loan. 2. 
Support local development activities through community capacity building and financing of economic infrastructure and social  services; 3. 
Strengthen the Borrowers capacity to implement the socio-economic regeneration program.  
Since the sector restructuring process started in 1997, unemployment indicators in mining regions have tended to lag behind other regions in Romania, justifying targeted support to mining communities. The following three job creation activities are being implemented under the MCSMP and will be scaled up under the proposed  project. 1. 
Employment and Training Incentives Scheme (ETIS):  The scheme provides a financial incentive to potential employers to hire unemployed workers, enabling expanding businesses to hire and retrain unskilled workers. The ETIS is expected to create employment for an estimated 8,000 people.  2. 
Micro-Credit Scheme:  After initial delays to enact a new law and regulations for micro-credit, implementation proceeded rapidly under MCSMP through two Romanian NGOs that manage $3.6 million in revolving funds for the first loan. The average cost of job creation under the first loan has been $1,720. The micro-credit scheme will support an estimated 10,000 jobs under the second project.  3. 
Workspace Centers: Ten Workspace Centers were created under the MCSMP in former mine buildings. The project will finance management contracts for three years to administer the Centers, incubate new businesses and provide enterprise supporttraining to aspiring entrepreneurs. Subsequently, the Workspace Centers will be handed over to local governments under new management arrangements to be developed during this project. The project will also finance purchase of common equipment to facilitate functioning of enterprises at the Workspace Centers. 
The Workspace Centers will incubate 180 new enterprises, while an estimated 6,000 jobs will be stimulated through this subcomponent. 
Asecond series of activities (4-7) is aimed at supporting local development activities through community capacity building and financing of economic infrastructure and social services.  4. 
Social Development Schemes for the Mining Communities (SDSMC): The MCSMP was restructured in the first quarter of 2004 and $5.5 million of savings from the mine closure activities was re-allocated to finance Social Development Schemes among mining communities. This sub-component is implemented by the Romanian Social Development Fund, which has a track record of success in implementing two previous Bank loans, under a collaboration arrangement for implementation of this sub-component. The SDSMC will be scaled up and will continue to be the responsibility of the RSDF, as a sub-component of the socio-economic regeneration program. 5. 
Municipal Infrastructure: Infrastructure facilities within and to mining communities have been in a state of decline since the mining industry collapsed. The Borrower has requested financing to enable mining municipalities to finance municipal infrastructure schemes to be identified through a process of community consultation and local development planning in mining localities that will be severely affected by sector restructuring.  6. 
Small Grants Scheme (SGS): The project will scale up the micro-projects piloted by DfID under the 
MCSMP to implement micro-projects aimed at human resource development and improving the welfare of women and youth, and building social capital among local communities. The social capital benefits of the DFID pilot have encouraged the Borrower to request this sub-component under the loan which will give priority to proposals that benefit women and youth groups.  7. 
Community Capacity Building:  The project will contract local consultants to facilitate a process of community mobilization and dialogue among local government, intended beneficiaries and other stakeholders in the local development process, and to help prepare proposals and finance technical feasibility studies for other sub-components of the loan. This process will help to identify and select priority infrastructure and social service investments that may be supported by activities 4-6 above.  
Athird series of activities (8-10) are intended to strengthen the institutional capacity of the Borrower to implement the socio-economic regeneration component. 8. 
Social Impact Monitoring: NAD will commission annual Social Impact Monitoring and additional specialized studies to inform strategic planning and project review at NAD and MEC, with the support of the Anti-Poverty Commission (CASPIS).  9. 
Public Information: Effective communication with local communities in mining regions and transparency will be crucial to successful implementation of the project. A consultant shall be recruited to help NAD develop its public information strategy, while service providers shall be contracted to develop appropriate materials for dissemination.  10. 
Institutional Development & Staff Training:  This sub-component will include capacity building for NAD, PMU-SER  and RSDF, and the cost of MIS technical services and equipment for this component. 
C. Project 
Operating 
Costs 
The third component consists of the support for the operating costs of the two project implementing agencies namely (i) the Project Management Unit (PMU) which will manage the Mine Closure and 
Environmental component will also be responsible for consolidating project accounts; and (ii) the Project 
Management Unit for Socio-Economic Regeneration (PMU-SER) which will coordinate all the sub-components related to Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER). Total base costs (excluding contingencies) for incremental operating expenses are estimated at US$6.1 million, (loan amount US$3.3 million), consisting of US$2.3 million in project costs ($1.2 million loan) for the PMU, and $3.8 million in project costs ($2.1 million from loan proceeds) for the PMU-SER and partner organizations involved in the SER program.

The proposed project would scale up the Rural Enterprise Support Project (RESP) and adhere to the original projects main objectives of increasing the productivity and sustainability of agriculture and agribusinesses in project areas. This will be achieved by directly supporting the newly independent farmers in other regions of the country, who did not benefit from the original project.   
","[from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will be mostly financed by an IDA concessional Credit. The amount of the Credit is still to be defined in the range of $25-40 million. The final project area coverage still remains to be defined on the basis of the available IDA funds. However an agreement in principle with the 
Borrower has been achieved that the Irrigation and Drainage component will concentrate on a set of administrative districts, while other project activities, including the Rural Finance component, will cover a much larger region. The project would comprise the following four components: Component A: Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage System  This component will cover investments for (i) inter-farm works ; (ii) support to Water User Associations, including equipment, material, and training for the maintenance of on-farm canals and drainage; and demonstration plots. This component will be implemented in a specifically selected number of districts which were selected according to the needs for rehabilitation of I&D works.  
Component B: Rural Finance.  This component will have the objective of facilitating access to credit to the newly independent farmers which originated from the Shirkat reform. The component will finance a credit line for Participating Financial Institutions (PFI commercial banks, leasing companies and microfinance institutions) to on-lend to farmers and rural business related to farming (including but not limited to provision of farming services such as farm mechanization, storage and distribution facilities, financing of agricultural inputs and investments in tree-crops). The component will also finance leasing transactions, to allow access to much needed financing for rural businesses with collateral constraints. A complementary training program to the PFIs will be provided, to upgrade their skills in agricultural investment project appraisal.  
Component C: Rural Advisory Services.  This component has two objectives: (i) help potential borrowers to develop business plans in order to increase their business and financial skills, thereby reducing the risks that the final borrowers will face difficulties in repaying the sub-loans (thus reducing potential defaults); (ii) provide advisory services and training to the newly independent farmers in various topics such as legal, accounting, business, technical aspects including agronomy, water management, pesticide handling, IPM, etc.  
Component D: Project Management. The component will cover the overall coordination of project activities including fiduciary aspects of project management and monitoring and evaluation. The project will be managed by the Rural Restructuring Agency, an institution which significantly developed its capacity during the Rural Enterprises Development Project.   
","The Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Water served as the implementing agency for RESP-1, and will implement the proposed project. The agency has aproven track record in carrying out project management, reporting, and procurement and financial management activities, and has developed capacity in all areas of project implementation.  RRA has recruited a local consultant firm to provide a team of environmental specialists to prepare the EA/MP, and will also recruit an environmental specialist to support implementation of the project in conformity with the EMP.  ToRs for this position satisfactory to the Bank will be prepared as part of the PIP by appraisal.

Global Outcome indicator:  
Strengthening of the protected areas management capacities for the long-term protection of Butrint National Park and the surrounding Ramsar wetlands complex.  
The following outcome indicator of the original Project under Component A has already been met, namely the completion and approval of the Southern Coastal Development 
Plan by the National Land Use Planning Council. This indicator was met in July 2008.   
","The proposed changes are a result of changes in the original economic, financial, and technical environment specific to the original design of the Project. The restructured 
Project also addresses design and implementation issues raised in the Inspection Panel 
Investigation Report for the Project and serves to align the project with the recommendations of the Management Report and Recommendation in Response. Respectively, the Project Development Objective (PDO) has been changed to focus on support for provision of critical infrastructure to improve environmental and sanitary conditions essential for coastal development. The proposed changes will not have major effect on the original implementation arrangements, financial management, procurement arrangements, nor on the safeguards category of the Project.  
Though the Integrated Coastal Zone Management and Clean-up Project was originally foreseen as an Adaptable Program Lending Credit (APL) consisting of two phases, no second phase will take place.  
Under the original Project, Component A focused on enhancing the capacity of 
Albanian authorities to manage coastal resources through development of an adequate policy, legal and regulatory and monitoring framework, including effective management functions at the central, regional and local levels. The findings of the Inspection Panel 
Investigation Report, follow-up described in the Management Report in response to the 
Inspection Panel report, and subsequent discussions with the Government of Albania have led to a decision to drop certain Project activities and restructure the Project. 
Subsequently, financing for land use planning activities is not included in the restructured 
Project.  
The activities under Component A related to Strategic Policy Support and Coastal 
Management Strengthening that will not be incorporated in the restructured Project include (i) Sub-component A.1 Strategic Policy Support; (ii) Sub-component A.2 Coastal 
Management Strengthening, consisting of the following activities: (a) regulatory capacity strengthening; (b) capacity building for the resolution of disputes; (c) strengthening of integrated coastal zone management capacity; (d) environmental management strengthening; and (f) land-use and spatial planning strengthening.  
Project Components which will remain under the restructured Project include:  
Sub-component A.2.e): Protected Area Management Strengthening piloting and implementating sustainable management activities in and around of Butrint National Park (BNP), Albania's most important protected area. This component includes (i) finalizing the protected areas Management Plan, (ii) provision of environmental infrastructure in the 
Park, and (iii) preparing a Social Assessment (SA) to complement the Social Survey already completed.  
Component B: Southern Coastal Environmental Infrastructure and Rehabilitation. This subcomponent will remain largely unchanged.  
Sub-component B.1: Southern Coastal Solid Waste Management, for which the Project will finance construction of one municipal landfill near Saranda and one transfer station near Himare.  Originally, the Project was to support construction of a landfill near 
Himare. However, due to the small quantities of waste generated by local communities, the difficulty of locating the suitable landfill site near Himare, and construction and upgrade of the coastal road (financed by the Government of Albania), this has been changed to a transfer station from where waste will be transported to the constructed landfill near Saranda.  In addition to the construction of the landfill and transfer station, the restructured Project will support a review of issues related to the unsanitary dumpsite near Saranda. Finally, the restructured Project will support review of regulatory issues related to construction and demolition waste. The key success factor to reduce the effects of Construction Demolition Waste (CDW) is strict enforcement of the laws prohibiting quarry operators and construction firms from dumping CDW dispersed throughout the terrain and coastal slopes. Regulatory measures, if implemented properly, would be more effective rather than bringing waste to a designated collection point.  
Sub-component B.2: Saranda Gateway. No changes are foreseen under this sub-component which will support investment for rehabilitation of the Saranda port infrastructure to facilitate passenger access to the Southern Coast.  
Sub-component B.3: Sewer and Water Supply in Saranda Tourist Area will be included in the restructured Project as originally planned.  
Sub-component B.4: Coastal Village Conservation and Development Program (CVCD) program will support the following (i) Infrastructure Improvements, including (a) local public investments related to rehabilitation of water supply and roads, cultural heritage enhancement and waste water treatment; and (b) private infrastructure improvements through rehabilitation of roof and facades (R&F) in traditional villages; and (ii) Capacity 
Building and Technical Assistance.  Local land use plans will not be financed anymore under this sub-component as originally envisaged. Likewise, to simplify Project implementation, small-scale environmental protection and sustainable economic activities have been removed from this component.  
Component C: Porto Romano Hot Spot Clean-up will support investment for remediation and containment of hazardous pollution on the site of the former chemical plant at Porto Romano, near Durres. No changes in the design of this component are envisaged.  The obsolete chemicals stored in the warehouses have been repackaged and incinerated abroad, which was financed and implemented separately by the Government of the Netherlands.  The demolition of the remaining structures and the remediation and rehabilitation of the area will be financed under the restructured project.  No land-use planning will be financed under the restructured Project. Technical assistance to prepare a monitoring and implementation of site after-care program and a covenant in the Finance 
Agreement towards the institutional responsibility to implement the after-care program will be included to protect the long-term integrity of the encapsulated site.

45,P035740,"The main objective of the project is to establish an efficient, reliable and safe mass rapid transit systemby implementing and operating high capacity buses in segregated bus corridors - COSAC -, which willimprove public transport of Metropolitan Lima population, especially for the low-income population ofthe peri-urban poor neighborhoods.
To achieve this, its specific objectives would be to: (i) help strengthen the Municipality of Lima'splanning, regulatory, administration, and operation capacity of public transport provision for Lima and
Callao (Metropolitan Lima) in the medium and long-term; (ii) rehabilitate and improve the existing roadinfrastructure, with emphasis on rehabilitation/construction of segregated bus corridors and feeder busroads; and (iii) enhance transport and environmental conditions by improving traffic management andsafety, reducing air pollution and improving conditions for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians,bicyclists and mobility constrained persons.
The objectives of this operation will be achieved through physical road infrastructure interventions,rationalization of road space, and through technical assistance for institutional strengtheninlg of the
Municipality of Lima to reduce the oversupply of public transport which results:  (i) in largeinefficiencies in public transport provision; (ii) urban congestion and adverse environmental and safetyimpacts; (iii) irrational and inefficient use of scarce road space; (iv) predatory and counterproductive 2
ISDScompetition; and (v) low average speeds and long travel times.
The segregated bus corridor system, with larger and cleaner vehicles, operated through well-enforcedprivate sector concessions will: (i) increase service efficiency and reduce GHG and local emissions perpassenger-km; (ii) increase the service quality and reduce travel times; (iii) rationalize public spaceconsumption by various transport modes; and (iv) prioritize public transport. It is expected that theproposed activities will yield significant benefits to the urban transport sector, including reduction oftraffic congestion and improved traffic flow for all vehicles reducing emissions per vehicle-kin; improvedroad safety by eliminating predatory driving behavior of public transport vehicles; improved finanicialsustainability of the public transport system; improved economic efficiency and competitiveness of thecity through reduced travel times; and provision of better accessibility to low-income commuters.
","1. Project Components
The Project will finance a first phase, which includes a basic network of segregated high capacity buscorridors of more than 24 km that will provide service to the low-income population segments who needan efficient, low-cost and affordable transport service. The basic high capacity network consists of buscorridors with operational and functional compatibility with follow-up phases, and will be using existingroad corridors, while bus-stops and feeder-trunk route transfer terminals will be newly constructed. Apartfrom compatibility between phases, each of the sections is expected to be functionally, economically, andoperationally self-sustainable.
The Project will also invest in the construction of access routes to terminals, focusing on accessibility forpedestrians and bicycles. Along the high capacity corridors horizontal and vertical road markings will berehabilitated, including an overhaul of the traffic lights. While road safety improvement forms a separatecomponent, implementation of road safety audit recommendations will be included under various civilworks. Monitoring of air quality will take place through the establishment of an air quality monitoriignetwork which includes operation and maintenance. The Project will also prepare the business plan forthe bus service concession; develop the fare collection system and its adjustment conditions; support thecreation and strengthening of an operations entity; and assist in the development of an efficientorganizational structure for the municipal management of urban transit and transport.  Within theframework of the latter, the project will also provide support to MML's transport agencies to developwell-defined responsibilities, coordinated management and resource utilization, as well as transportperformance monitoring and control mechanisms.
It is foreseen that the physical infrastructure to be provided under the first phase will be financed by
MML and by the project while private concessionaires will provide vehicles, bus parking facilities andmaintenance facilities for the buses on terrains acquired by MML. The terminals could be given inconcession, providing public and commercial services to the users. The fare collection system will bedeveloped and operated privately. It is also foreseen that system management will be self-sustainablethrough a percentage of the user fares (for Transmilenio S.A. this is 4%). This fare will cover theinvestment, operation and maintenance costs of the operators and of the collection system; it will alsocover the operation, monitoring and control costs of PROTRANSPORTE. An analysis will also be maderegarding the generation of a basic infrastructure maintenance fund (main corridors, bus-stops andterminals). 3
ISDS1.1. Investment in Infrastructure (US$106.5 million)
Investments in infrastructure include: (i) construction of three public transport segregated corridors witha total length of 24 km, with operational and functional compatibility; (ii) bus-stops and terminals; (iii)horizontal and vertical road markings along the selected corridors; (iv) paving and/or improvement ofselected feeder roads, with an approximate length of 95 km, which will operate as an integrated networkwith the main corridors; (v) construction of sidewalks and bicycle paths to improve access tonon-motorized means users. This will complement the GEF's non-motorized transport investments. US$ Imillion will be specifically dedicated to bikeways; (vi) works for the improvement of pedestrian andvehicle circulation in five selected sensitive areas; (vii) road safety measures along the buscorridors, itsfeeder roads, and the streets in its area of direct influence; (viii) recovery of public space, with emphasison the interface between corridors, walkers and users of the system; and (ix) supervision of the works.
The proposed physical works will be based on 'inclusive designs' that take into account the needs ofvulnerable (e.g., women, children) and mobility constrained (e.g., handicapped, visually impaired) roadusers.1.2. Institutional Strengthening (US$5.3 million)
The coverage of this component includes Project management as well as the strengtheninlg andcoordination of regulatory, monitoring, and control functions of urban public transport for the whole city.
Thus, it provides support to: (i) the development and implementation of a uniform public transport policyin the city, its regulatory and policy-setting framework, as well as its administration, operation,monitoring and control; (ii) the creation (design, formalization and establishment of policies), technicalassistance and training of the entity in charge of F'roject management-PROTRANSPORTE; (iii) trainingand technical assistance to DMTU, focusing on public transport service regulation, and its monitoringand control; (iv) training and strengthening of the new private operators; (v) implementation of an airquality monitoring system; (vi) development of a road safety strategy; (vii) a pilot project that willenhance the introduction in Peru of more environment-friendly vehicle scrapping methods (co-finencedwith the GEF) and (vii) follow-up and assessment of the system operation and the Project.1.3. Social and Political Feasibility (US$3.2 million)
This activity, which is critical for the success of the Project, will support two activity areas: (i)community participation; and (ii) participation of actual public transport operators. As for communityparticipation, this activity aims to include public consultation processes, such as: (a) a campaign forconsultation, sensibilization and social participation; and (b) public transport use and road behavioreducational measures. With regard to public transport operators it will consist of: (a) a consultation andnegotiation strategy with the people affected; (b) measures to mitigate the negative social impact of thesector rationalization in coordination with the corresponding GEF component, and (c) organizationalstrengthening of the public transport operators.1.4. Technical and Environmental Studies (US$3.9 million)
This includes economic feasibility and environmental studies as well as the final designs required toexpand the integrated public transport network in a second phase beyond the 24 kilometers funded by the
Project. 4
ISDS1.5. Administrative Expenses (US$5.5 million)
This includes the operational expenses of the institution responsible for the system implementation andoperation, most likely PROTRANSPORTE. This component also includes the cost of a comprehensivemonitoring and evaluation mechanism that will use qualitative and quantitative indicators for each of thesub-components.  Techniques to be applied include user scorecards to measure public transportperformance; beneficiary assessments using structured interviews and focus group discussions; povertyimpact assessments using household surveys and linked to qualified data from the aforementionedmethods.1.6. GEF Components (US$ 7.930 million)
The GEF-financed components will: (i) support the reduction in the public transport fleet oversupply,(ii) consolidate the bikeways pilot project developed in Lima North Cone, (iii) carry out an institutionalstrengthening program on sustainable transport, targeting municipalities and institutions dealing withenvironmental issues and/or transport planning, and (iv) assess and monitor the GEF projectperformance.
For more details on each component, see Annex ""GEF Project Detailed Description"".1. 6.1 To support public transport capacity rationalization (US$ 1. 7 million)
The activities to be developed in the framework of this first component aim at supporting the
WB-IDB-financed Limabus Project, which will rationalize public transport services and provideopportunities to reduce the size of the current fleet operating in Lima (more than 55,000 buses, most ofwhich are extremely polluting and obsolete). This component can be divided into three sub-activities:
*   Provide financial incentives through a Credit Guarantee Fund (and hence low-cost loans) tobus concessionaires to encourage them to scrap additional obsolete and pollutant publictransport vehicles
*   Support programs aiming at mitigating the social impacts of this program in terms ofemployment (training programs, access to micro-credits) in coordination with existing socialprograms such a those promoted by Prompyme.
*   Support a pilot project that will enhance the introduction in Peru of moreenvironment-frienidly vehicle scrapping methods and that will build the local capacityrequired to make sure that the adoption of those new methods will be sustainable.1.6.2 Consolidate Lima Northi Cone bikeways pilot project (US$ 4.180 million)
Through this component, the project will aim at resolving the problems identified in the context of the
WB-financed non-motorized transport pilot program (1994) and that are seen as the explanatory variablesof the still low levels of use of the North Cone bikeways. These problems are mainly linked to traffic andpersonal safety, low quality of the engineering design in some places, and lack of information andcommunication on the issue, This component can be divided into four sub-activities:
* Realize the required physical improvements on the existing network and extend it by 6 km of
""missing links"" to increase its connectivity, provide bike parking facilities and install
""ciclomodulos"" to improve the attractiveness of the bikeways (see Annex ""Ciclomodulos""),
*   Finance one year of bikeway maintenance during which municipalities will benefit from ahands-on training, 5
ISDS
*   Carry out a promotion campaign on bike use,
*   Restart the dormant credit program called Plan Bici for bicycles acquisition, by making itmore flexible and applicable to the financing of small bike-related businesses.
This component will be supported through a US$1 million investment plan from the infrastructurecomponent (1.1) to be financed by the World Bank loan.The GEF contribution and the World Bankcontribution have been bundled together in the consolidated budget table at the end of this section underthe ""bikeways pilot project"" heading.1.6.3. Carry out an Institutional Strengthening Program on Sustainable Transport (US$ 1.1 million)
This component will be targeting municipalities and institutions dealing with environmental issues and/ortransport planning. It aims at incorporating climate change and environmental considerations intodecision making processes, but will also strengthen the technical capacities of the municipal teamscurrently in charge of transport planning and that are stakeholders of the project. This institutionalstrengthening program, designed as an outcome of a diagnosis and capacity assessment exercise carriedout jointly with the expected beneficiaries, aims at laying the groundwork for the success of the projectand ensure it can be sustainable over time once those institutions will take over when the project isclosed.
The following institutions will benefit from the program: two provincial municipalities, Lima and Calloand seven municipal districts, Los Olivos, Independencia, San Martin de Porres, Comas, Rimac,
Bellavista, Carmen de la Legua - Reynoso, along with FONAM which is the Project Implementation
Unit.1.6.4. Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, Replication Strategy and Administrative Costs (US$950,000)
The project includes a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation component based on qualitative andquantitative performance indicators for each of the sub-components. These indicators will include publictransport and bicycle user surveys and impact assessments, public transport ridership data, road safetydata, general traffic counts on trunk routes and bus counts on public transport routes given in concession.
This data will be used in turn to estimate project-related GHG emission reductions.
The monitoring strategy for this project aims at tracking the changes towards the adoption of newtransport patterns and behaviors. The methodology opted for is probably quite time-consuming and mightrequire some more efforts than regular monitoring processes but the objective of the exercise is toprovide the GEF with the necessary information it needs regarding GHG impacts of sustainable transportprojects to decide whether expanding their support to similar measures is justified from a climate changeperspective.
At that point, a very important factor to assess will be evaluation the change in perceptions, attitudes andbehaviors within the different segments from the population vis-A-vis sustainable transport. This changewill be measured against the results of the various focus groups carried out in during the GEF projectpreparation phase. The final evaluation will be repeated two years after the project conclusion in order toexamine sustainability and medium and long term impacts. The source of financing of this last activityhas yet to be defined which is not an easy task since it will take place after project closing. One option isto use part of the uncalled capital in the Credit Guarantee Fund, another being to commit the Borrower todo this through the loan agreement.
A replication strategy will be designed in the first half of the project implementation period and carried 6
ISDSout in the second half. Mayors and technicians of secondary Peruvian cities will be invited to Lima forfield visits and discussion with their Lina counterparts while seminars on sustainable transport will beorganized in their cities, with the participation of stakeholders of the Lima project.

46,P082373,"The project development objectives are to improve urban living conditions in regard to sanitation, drainage, vehicular access, and solid waste management in a sustainable fashion, with special emphasis on the poor. 
","Component 1 - Storm Drainage  
Lining of secondary drains, tertiary drains and erosion control.  
The lining of urban storm drains with concrete or stone pitching that had been carried out in previous projects has resulted in a reduced frequency, severity, and duration of flooding. More high-priority secondary drains in the project towns will be lined, or their lining rehabilitated, mostly in low-lying, poor areas, complemented where necessary with tertiary drains and erosion control measures. This may involve dredging, realigning, widening, or narrowing of the existing drains in some sections. 
Component 2  Sanitation 
Subcomponents: (a) construction of household latrines, (b) rehabilitation and construction of public latrines, (c
) rehabilitation and construction of school  latrines, and (d) liquid waste management in Tema.  
The program for the construction of household latrines on a cost-sharing basis with the beneficiaries, as well as the rehabilitation and construction of school and public latrines, which was carried out under the Urban Environmental Sanitation Project (UESP), will be started up again in all project towns. When no more funds for this component could be allocated under UESP, a large number of applications for latrines was still pending with the Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies (MAs). The school latrine program will be accompanied by hygiene education and the provision of water supply. The public latrines will be mostly limited to public places, such as markets and transport terminals, and will be privately managed through a competitive selection process. A septage treatment facility for Tema was constructed under UESP, but not completed. It will be finished under UESP-2. A study of sustainable improvements to the Tema sewerage system will be done and, on the basis of the results, minor improvement works carried out. 
Component 3 - Solid Waste Management  
Subcomponents:  (a) construction of sanitary landfills, (b) equipment for sanitary landfills, (c) improved use, closure and rehabilitation of existing dumps, (d) operational support for existing sanitary landfills, (d) pilot private solid waste collection, (e) household bins, skips, and skip pads. 
New sanitary landfills will be constructed in Accra
 (located at Kwabenya) and 
Tema and the necessary operating equipment supplied. The preliminary design capacity is 500,000 tons/year for Accra and 100,000 tons/year for Tema. An access road and a conduit for storm drainage were built at Kwabenya in 2000 as Phase I of construction, financed by another donor. No further financing for construction is available. The construction of the sanitary landfill at Sekondi-Takoradi could not be completed under UESP because of the failure of the contractor to perform, and will be finished under UESP-2. Improvements will be made to the operation of the dumps in the project towns which still have to be used until the new sanitary landfills have been constructed, to prolong their life and to mitigate their negative environmental impact. These dumps, and others that have already been closed, will be rehabilitated in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner. An increase in the percent of refuse collected in the project towns has been achieved through 
UESP, partly due to more PSP in solid waste collection, increasingly in the form of a franchise, and the extension of the collection of user fees to middle and low-income areas. The component will include recurrent cost support for (i) the operation and monitoring of the sanitary landfills in Kumasi and Tamale, and later in Sekondi-Takoradi, and (ii) for additional private refuse collection contracts in poor and middle-income areas.  
Component 4  Community Infrastructure Upgrading
   
Infrastructure upgrading in low-income communities (mainly access roads, roadside drains, street lighting, water supply, and sanitation).  
This component was very successful in UESP, and several additional communities will be upgraded in the project towns under UESP-2. Many of the roads in these neighborhoods are now barely motorable because of gullies created by erosion. The  roads will be leveled and in some cases realigned, a surface dressing applied, and provided with roadside drains. In the process, water pipes that now run haphazardly through the neighborhood will be replaced with supply lines along the drains and service connections to  the existing users. Street lighting will be provided where it is a community priority, and some public latrines will be rehabilitated  
Component 5 - Institutional Strengthening (financed by NDF) 
Subcomponents:  (a) technical assistance and training, (b) capacity building in 
MLGRD and other central agencies,  (c) capacity building in MAs, (d) Malaria vector control, (e) HIV/AIDS prevention, and (f) house numbering. 
The Waste Management Departments, which were created in 4 additional towns under UESP, need further support and strengthening to play their lead role in urban waste management and to sustain the reforms that have been introduced in recent years. The transformation of their role from clean-up to environmental management
 will be supported technically and financially. Training and institutional strengthening will also be provided for the Environmental Health Departments and other departments of the Metropolitan/Municipal Assemblies, as well as the Submetros. 
Also included are the preparation of an integrated solid waste management strategy, impact evaluations, studies, and preparation of standard designs and operational manuals. The malaria vector control will consist of the removal of stagnant water accumulations near habitation in which the malaria-carrying mosquitoes breed, such as pools, puddles, unregulated drains, and old car tires, and other measures that are part of the motional malaria-eradication program, except for spraying. Financial assistance will be provided to ongoing programs on HIV/AIDS prevention, coordinated by the Ghana AIDS Commission.

47,P118287,"The objective of any prospective World Bank financial support to the proposed Kosovo Power
Project would be to reduce the environmental impact of electricity generation and strengthensecurity of supply in Kosovo in an economically efficient, environmentally sustainable, and acarbon-neutral manner.
","The proposed Kosovo Power Project is envisaged to replace the Kosovo A Power Station with arehabilitated existing power plant (Kosovo B) and a new power plant as well as the development of a mine to meet the fuel needs. As noted above, the determination of any World Bank financialsupport for the proposed Kosovo Power Project is linked to the forthcoming SFDCC External
Expert Panel review. It is envisaged that the new power plant be developed as an extension of the
Kosovo B power plant site and have some common facilities. Subject to a clearer definition ofscope, the associated infrastructure that might prospectively be needed would include anelectrical interconnection upgrade, a water buffer reservoir, a suitable disposal site for ash, aswell as other potentially associated infrastructure such as any necessary upgrades to the Iber-
Lepenc water canal.

The World Bank supports Kosovo’s energy sector through the Lignite Power Technical
Assistance Project (LPTAP) (P097635), which is helping the Government strengthen policy,legal, and regulatory frameworks to attract private investment in the energy sector. LPTAP hassupported several key activities related to the possible preparation of the proposed project:
    x Preparation of a Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment of proposed mining and
        power generation activities in the Obiliq area
    x Preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan for Hade Village
    x Purchase of air monitoring equipment

Depending on the scope of any prospective engagement by the World Bank based on theoutcome of the SFDCC External Expert Panel review, the World Bank might considersupporting the following additional items:
    x soil and water sampling
    x the preparation of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
    x engagement of an independent panel of experts to advise on the Social and
       Environmental Impact Assessment
    x preparation of a low-carbon growth strategy for Kosovo energy sector
    x preparation of an energy efficiency database (in collaboration with the Rochester Institute
       of Technology and the American University of Kosovo)
    x preparation of a wind power feasibility study (in cooperation with REPIC (Swiss) /AUK
    x a carbon capture and storage (CCS) assessment and capacity building, funded by the CCS
       Trust Fund
    x capacity building relating to environmental and social safeguards implementation

The main environmental issues of the proposed project would relate to:
(i)     direct and local impacts of construction, rehabilitation and operation of the thermal powerplants and the lignite coalmine, including land conversion and habitat loss; hazardous and non-hazardous waste disposal; emissions to air, soil and water; and
(ii)    global climate change impacts from use of lignite coal as a source of energy for powergeneration.

A Resettlement Policy Framework that is consistent with World Bank resettlement policyguidelines has been prepared and approved by the Government. The Government is currentlypreparing a Resettlement Action Plan for the Shala neighborhood of Hade Village for whichurgent access is needed to ensure that the Kosovo Energy Corporation (KEK) has continuity of coal supply to the power plants. The Government has engaged the services of a specializedmining resettlement firm, which is providing technical assistance and capacity-building. Inaddition to the households from Hade, the Government has made provision to resettle householdspreviously displaced by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)for safety reasons from mine subsidence areas in 2005. Most of these people, some 102households, have been living in temporary accommodations since then.
","The Ministry of Environmental and Spatial Development (MESP) was initially established as adepartment within the UN caretaker structure and subsequently became a ministry in 2002-2003.
Environmental Impact Assessments are reviewed by the Environment Department at MESP, and
MESP forms expert groups when needed for the review of EIA reports. In 2007, the Kosovo
Environmental Protection Agency became operational under MESP and one of its tasks isissuing opinions on environmental impact assessment and on environmental consents forconstruction permits. The institutional structure for the review of EIAs and issuance ofenvironmental permits exists. The Cleanup and Land Reclamation Project (P096181) includedactivities to support the Environmental Department of MESP to gain practical experience withenvironmental cleanup projects as well as the EIA review and environmental permitting process.

48,P145439,"The proposed scaling-up activities are consistent with the current MINIS projectdevelopment objectives (PDOs) and description which are to facilitate investments ininfrastructure to support mining and downstream processing activities, regardless offunding source, and to build local capacity to prepare and transact infrastructure projects.
","The MINIS focuses on technical assistance activities for general infrastructure that willsupport the mining sector and local communities within an investment’s area of influence.
While many of the projects are expected to be in the Southern Mongolia Region, projectsin other locations throughout the country will also be eligible for financing under the
MINIS. The project consists of the following four components:
  i.   Component 1 - Support for Infrastructure Investments (US$19.69 million).
       This component will provide financing to prepare regional infrastructure
       investment plans, conduct feasibility studies to assess technical options and
       determine economic and financial implications of proposed projects, and address
       emerging priority issues as a result of the country’s nascent enabling environment
       governing private participation in infrastructure.       The types of feasibility studies that are eligible for financing under the MINIS
       include technical assessments, such as engineering designs, geotechnical surveys,
       economic and financial analyses, environmental and social impact evaluations,
       and reviews of specific aspects of the country’s legal, regulatory and institutional
       frameworks. Funds could be used to prepare mining-related infrastructure
       projects whether financed from the government budget or the private sector.       Projects in the energy (power plants, transmission and distribution networks),
       transport (railways and roads), IT and communications, water (water supply and
       waste water systems), housing and social sectors (schools, hospitals and clinics)
       would be eligible, as would logistics and border crossing facilities. In addition,
       the evaluation and structuring (for private investment) of downstream, value-
       added activities, such as copper smelters, coal processing facilities and iron
       pellets plants, would also be eligible for funding. If funding is used to prepare a
       power plant, then the March 2010 Operation Guidelines on Criteria for Screening
       Coal Projects under the Strategic Framework for Development and Climate
       Change would be followed.       It is possible that one or two (at most) infrastructure projects will be prepared as
       PPPs with some support from the MINIS. ii.    Component 2 - Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer (US$1.45
       million). This component is devoted towards the development of local skills. The
       emphasis would be on learning by doing but with sufficient support from
       qualified consultants. This support will be extended to line ministries and
       agencies charged with preparing government-funded projects, as well as
       transactions with investors iii.   Component 3 - Strengthening Groundwater Management (US$7.43 million).
       This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of local authorities to
       manage groundwater resources in the Southern Mongolia. The government has
       established a framework of 29 water basins for the entire country. For Southern
       Mongolia, these basins are centered on groundwater, as surface water is of minor
       importance in the southern part of the country.       In 2011, AusAID approved a proposal to provide additional financing of US$4.2
       million to this component to strengthen groundwater management in Mongolia
       after two years discussion with the Bank. This additional financing increased the
       budget of Component 3 from original US$3.23 million to US$7.43 million. With
       additional financing, this component will mainly support: a) Establishment of                                                                                         2
       Ground Water Management and Information Unit (GWMIU); b) Establishment of
       River Basin Council (RBC); c) Establishment of 3 River Basin Administrations
       (RBA); d) Consultancy service such as assessing legal/institutional framework;
       preparing and implement groundwater management plans and conduction
       groundwater investigation; e) Capacity building activities for established RBC
       and RBAs; f) groundwater assessment and management studies. iv.   Component 4 - Project Management (US$0.63 million). This component will
       finance the staffing, operation and support of the Project Management Unit
       (PMU) at the Ministry of Finance. The PMU oversees the implementation of
       MINIS and will reports to the State Secretary for Finance. The PMU Director has
       the overall responsibility for managing the MINIS, including: (i) implementing
       project activities per the Project Implementation Manual, within budget and
       according to schedule; (ii) all procurement activities, including contracting
       consultants, and purchasing goods and equipment; (iii) maintaining financial
       records, making disbursements, managing the Designated Account, and financial
       reporting; (iv) monitoring the performance of consultants to ensure that
       contractual obligations are fulfilled; (v) reviewing and approving all reports and
       outputs issued by consultants; (vi) evaluating project activities and reporting on
       implementation progress; and (vii) ensuring that the environmental and social
       safeguards framework is effectively implemented. A Procurement Specialist and
       Financial Management Specialist will be hired to manage the fiduciary
       requirements of the project. Proceeds under the project will be used to hire a
       PMU Director and technical staff, as needed.       This component would also finance the services of domestic and international
       consultants to help monitor progress and assist in implementation, including
       financial audits for the project, and to acquire office equipment, pay PMU
       operating costs, and purchase one vehicle for the PMU. Incremental operating
       costs will also be financed through the Credit and include, inter alia, office rent,
       office consumables, communications, vehicle operating and repairs, and salaries
       of contractual staff (other than consultants)

The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is providing transaction advice to the
Government to identify, develop, market and competitively select privatedevelopers/investors for up to three pilot projects. This support is expected tocomplement some of the activities of the MINIS. It has been agreed with the IFC that the
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) that was prepared for the
MINIS will be considered to apply to both World Bank and IFC in line with the
Environmental and Social Policy and Procedural Guidelines for Projects in IDA
Countries that are financed jointly by the World Bank, IFC and Multilateral Investment

Community-Based activities in Cropland and Grazing Land: Resilience of agriculture toclimate change, promotion of land productivity and water-use efficiency and SLM bestpractices will be piloted and promoted in targeted areas. Community-Based Sustainable Forest and Wetland Management: Communities will beassisted in preparing sustainable financing plans and in developing small incomegeneration activities in and around select protected areas and forests to reduce pressureon forest resources and restore ecosystem services. Component 3: Early Warning, Monitoring, and Knowledge Systems Early Warning System (EWS): A nation-wide EWS will be developed to alertcommunities of upcoming possible flood events and allow them to take appropriateactions to protect lives and property, through enhanced collaboration andcommunications between the national hydro meteorological services and the Togolese
Red Cross. Specific technical equipment and training will also be provided to the keyplayers. Environmental Monitoring: A country-owned climate and land monitoring system,including geo-spatial data, will be developed to monitor vegetation cover and land use(crop, pasture/range, forest, wetland, protected area, and other relevant categories), and toprovide carbon sequestration estimates in select project areas. Knowledge: An update of the national cartography and targeted risk assessments will beconducted to identify appropriate disaster mitigation investments and/or risk transfermechanisms, including hazard, asset, and vulnerability analyses. A guide of select SLMbest practices which incorporates climate change impacts will also be developed. 
 Component 4: Project Management  For the project to be effectively implemented, project management functions includingfiduciary management, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), technical supervision,reporting and audits, will be covered under this component.

51,P055991,"The projects development objective is: An integrated and decentralized land administration system (composed of public and private entities) to provide users in the project area with accurate information on urban and rural land parcels and effective land administration services (purchase, mortgages, cadastral and registry certifications, etc.) in a timely and cost-effective manner. The system will help to increase land tenure security, facilitate land market transactions, develop national and municipal territorial plans, and develop management plans for protected areas, forests, and indigenous peoples lands. 
","The project will have three components: (i) Policy framework and institutional strengthening; (ii) Area-based systematic land regularization, titling, and registration; and (iii) Project management and monitoring and evaluation.  
Component 1 will be national in scope. It forms part of Governments strategy to modernize a fragmented institutional framework and streamline the massive land registration process while increasing accessibility of land services at the local level. This component will support increased transparency and improved governance of the countrys main land administration institutions. The Components main output will be the establishment of a National Property Administration System (SINAP) through legal, regulatory, and institutional means. SINAP will include a National Territorial Information System (SINIT), a Registry of 
Norms (RENOT), and the Unified Registries System (SURE) and will be operated by public and private entities.  The project will finance preparation of policies and norms, technological development, and institutional strengthening.
 
Component 2 will be area-specific. Activities under this component will directly benefit the populations residing in the project area by massive regularization and registration of an essential asset: land.  The project aims to cover different types of rural and urban land and a diverse cross-section of Honduran society including the rich and the poor; men and women; ladino, indigenous, and Afro-Honduran. The 
Components main output will be the incorporation of land parcels in the project area into SINAP. The project will finance pre-field work such as aerial photography
, field surveying of macro boundaries such as  inter-municipal boundaries, parcel-level surveying and validation, conflict resolution, regularization, titling, and mass registration into SINAP. 
Component 3 covers the administration costs of the Project Coordination Unit that will carry out monitoring and evaluation activities. The unit will be a critical instrument to ensure efficient administration of the project and effective coordination with other land-related projects in the country.
