B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The Supplemental Credit aims at providing additional resources that would allow GoSL to settle 
the legitimate claims of foreign and local contractors, without jeopardizing the implementation 
of the Poverty Reduction Strategy. Project restructuring and claims related to war interruptions 
created a funding gap.

The proposed Supplemental Credit in the amount of US$3.2 million would aim to complete the 
contractual payments outstanding since the closing of the Project.  The arrears?related contracts 
are the following:  
 
(a) Two works contracts for the rehabilitation and expansion of the distribution networks in 
Freetown (outstanding payments: US$1. 54 M equivalent);

(outstanding payments: US$0.74 M equivalent);
