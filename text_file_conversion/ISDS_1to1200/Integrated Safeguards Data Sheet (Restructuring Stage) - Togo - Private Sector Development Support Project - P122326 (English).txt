6. Safeguard Policies  Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental          Yes         The ongoing operation is a Technical Assistance (TA)
Assessment OP/BP 4.01              project. However under component 3, the restructured
project aims to support the development of a new free
zone that may induce significant potential adverse
impacts. That is why the project rating is upgraded to the
higher EA category A. The TORs for the feasibility study
Page 2 of 8


﻿include the preparation of strategic environmental and
social impact assessment.
At the project preparation an Environment and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) had been developed,
consulted upon and disclosed in Togo and thereafter at the
Infoshop respectively on January 1 and 11, 2010 which
will continue to be implemented
When the exact location of the free zone will be
determined and prior to the commencement of its
construction, an Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA) will be prepared, reviewed, consulted
upon and disclosed both in Togo and at the Infoshop as
per the ESMF.
Natural Habitats OP/BP  No          The policy is not triggered by the project as the project is
4.04                                not expected to impact on any natural habitats.
Forests OP/BP 4.36      No          The policy is not triggered by the project; the project does
not involve afforestation nor is it expected to impact on
forests.
Pest Management OP 4.09 No          No pest management activities are foreseen under the
project.
Physical Cultural       No          The policy is not triggered by the project as no large
Resources OP/BP 4.11                excavations or movement of earth is foreseen and the
project is not expected to impact on physical cultural
property.
Indigenous Peoples OP/  No          There are no indigenous people in the project area.

Involuntary Resettlement Yes        With the development of the new free zone, displacement
OP/BP 4.12                          of people may occur. To anticipate these potential social
impacts, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) had
been developed, consulted upon and disclosed within
Togo and at the Infoshop respectively on January 1 and
11, 2010. Further to this RPF, a Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) focusing on the new free zone will be prepared if
needed be. This RAP, once prepared will also be
consulted upon and disclose publicly in Togo and at the
Infoshop.
Safety of Dams OP/BP    No          The project does not entail construction of dams, nor will

﻿II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
)           Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
A. 1.1. Existing Togolese Free Zone
0
The situation of the existing Togolese Free Zone (TFZ) is unusual. One on side, the TFZ counts
around 60 businesses. On the other side, the TFZ has two plots of land (72 hectares and 35
hectares) in the port zone, the Togolese Government recently acquired around 140 hectares
(undeveloped), 20 km North of Lome, and it also has a 30 ha. plot near Kara, in the north of the
country.
However, most of the TFZ businesses are not located within the plots of the existing Free Zone.
The 35 ha. plot in the port area is used for storing imported cars (MAD, Magasins et Aires de
Dedouanement, Shops and Customs Clearance) and space is rented to around 27 enterprises. No
business in the existing Free Zone is located in this plot. The 72 ha. plot in the port area counts 4
Free Zone businesses. The 30 ha. plot near Kara counts 1 Free Zone business. The fourth plot
(recently acquired) is undeveloped and no business is located on the plot. The vast majority of the
businesses are therefore located outside of the physical existing Free Zones, but operate under the
Free Zone regime (#point franc#).
Project approach to strategically reposition the Free Zone
Following the analyses undertaken for the CEM and during project preparation, there is a
consensus on the need to develop a new Free Zone model, as the current Free Zone model is
unsustainable. However, in the present situation, it is not possible to make any concrete
propositions on what and where will be the future strategic positioning of the new Free Zone, as
O
U           there is first a need to undertake a number of diagnostics studies, such as:
#     Cost benefit analysis of the Free Zone
#     Togolese Free Zone competitiveness analysis
#     Review of customs and external trade laws and regulations and of their implementation
#     Institutional and organization diagnostic of the Togolese Free Zone
#     Assessment of the Public Private Partnerships framework in Togo
Based on this diagnostic, a strategy to develop a new Free Zone will be developed. In addition,
the concept of Free Zone is relatively narrow and is becoming outdated (a free zone # zone franche
# is a zone in which businesses do not pay customs for their imported inputs, as these enterprises
focus on export markets), so there might be a need to move to the wider concept of Special
Economic Zone.                            There is also the need to identify market
segments where Togo would have a competitive advantage.
This preliminary analysis would therefore allow the Government to identify the strategic focus of
the new Free Zone (or Special Economic Zone). The new focus of the zone would then allow to
identify the most appropriate geographical location of the new zone.
As a result, the future site of the new Free Zone is not yet known.

﻿Relationship between the project and potential resettlement issues:
The project will finance technical assistance to develop a strategy to establish a new Free Zone
O
Q)          including Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment work. The output of this technical
assistance at the end of the project would be to have a development plan for a new Free Zone,
validated by the Government of Togo, which would be presented to private investors. A
Resettlement Policy Framework has been developed to provide guidance to the authorities on how
to manage potential resettlement issues in the new Free Zone site.
Within the existing Free Zone sites there are occupants on some of the sites who do not have title
to the land; in addition, former occupants with title are seeking compensation for the land that was
expropriated for the existing Free Zone sites over 40 years ago. However, as indicated the
activities financed by the World Bank for this project are limited to activities related to a
contemplated new Free Zone only.
A. 1.2. Togolese Free Zone: potential environmental issues
The existing Togolese Free Zone counts around 60 businesses operating in various sectors,
notably: agribusiness, wood and construction materials, textiles, medicines and cosmetics,
services, plastic and wrapping and metal works. The operations of these businesses can have
negative environmental and social impacts.
An environmental audit has been conducted on the current Zone, concluding that the existing
legal, regulatory and institutional framework is satisfactory. In addition, the audit notes that,
overall, Free Zone enterprises are operating in an adequate environmental situation. In particular,
these enterprises have implemented relatively sound waste management and have applied
environmental good practices. The audit also highlighted a number of areas where there is limited
compliance (on the side of Free Zone enterprises) with environmental good practices (such as the
necessity to check the quality of wastewater once a month, the necessity to have wastewater
treatment systems or the necessity to clearly identify recipients which contain used oils). The audit
also provided detailed recommendations to improve compliance with environmental good
practices. Finally, the audit recommends the development of an environmental management
a           system as well as capacity strengthening in environmental good practices for key stakeholders.
A. 1.3. Other potential environment issues
The project has funded the rehabilitation (very minor rehabilitation: painting, small electrical
works and partitioning) of a building housing the one-stop shop for enterprise creation. The
Project Coordination Unit has ensured that the firm handling the rehabilitation works had as an
annex to its contract the environmental and social management clauses for construction works.
The project will finance the Business Plan Competition, a screening mechanism acceptable to the
Bank will be put in place in the context of the Business Plan Competition to ensure that the
development of award-winning business plans will comply with the Bank's safeguards
requirements and not lead to any investment projects that may trigger the Bank's safeguard
policies, such as those on involuntary land acquisition, population resettlement, or negative
environmental impact.

﻿The existing environmental and social management framework (ESMF) and RPF will continue to
be used within the Business Plan Competition. The Business Plan Competition activities are
expected to have minimal to moderate environmental and social impacts.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:
The section above highlights potential environment and social issues in the Project # including
potential indirect impacts, in particular with regard to resettlement.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
The project will provide technical assistance to the Government of Togo and the Free Zone to
develop a new Free Zone / SEZ. This technical assistance will include guidance on and
consideration of social and environment issues (see following section).
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The Borrower has prepared the following documents:
#     Analysis of potential involuntary resettlement issues in the new Free Zone and elaboration
of a Resettlement Policy Framework;
#     Environmental audit of the Togolese Free Zone;
#     Environment and Social Management Framework
Based on the findings and recommendations of the above studies, the following approach is
proposed.
The component will focus on the development of a new Free Zone / SEZ site, which is not yet
known (it could potentially be the recently acquired site 20km North of Lom6, however diagnostic
and feasibility studies will indicate the best possible location of the new site). The ESMF and RPF,
elaborated during project preparation, will provide guidance to the Togolese authorities on how to
prepare ESIA and RAPs as needed and assess, avoid, and mitigate adverse environmental and
social issues (including potential resettlement issues) for the new site.
Once the new TFZ strategy has been approved and once a site has been identified for the
strategically repositioned TFZ, technical assistance to undertake an Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment/Environmental Management Plan of the identified site and Resettlement
Action Plan will be provided.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Various consultations with stakeholders were undertaken in the course of the elaboration of the
safeguards documents described above. The ESMF and RPF have been disclosed in country and in
the Infoshop. Furthermore, stakeholder consultations will be held as part of the preparation of
ESIAs and RAPs as and when those are being developed.
