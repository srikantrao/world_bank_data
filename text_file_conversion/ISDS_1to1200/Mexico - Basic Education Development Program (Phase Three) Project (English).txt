A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The APL supports the Government's compensatory education program, as 
outlined in the National Education Program (PNE) 2001-2006 and the Education 
Development Program 1995-2000.  Specifically, the objectives of Phase III focus on fine-
tuning the delivery mechanisms while extending the successful components of Phase II.  
Therefore, the objectives of Phase III are: (a) to consolidate and expand quality 
improvements in initial and basic education (preschool, primary and lower secondary), 
covering, 
inter alia
, infrastructure improvements, didactic materials provision, teacher 
training, school supervision, and implementation of school-based management strategies; 
(b) to strengthen management of the education system through support for the 
Government’s ongoing strategy to consolidate the organization and management of basic 
education (preschool through lower secondary), and to integrate the operation of the 
compensatory education program; and (c) to continue strengthening states’ institutional 
capacity to plan, program and evaluate the delivery of basic education services. 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project, with a total cost of US$ 503.0 million ($300.0 million Bank financing) 
would include the following components and activities:

school training for parents and other adults directly involved raising small children, with 
the objective of contributing to the child’s integral development and to a smooth 
transition to preschool. PAREIB III proposes to expand coverage of initial education by 
10 percent a year, in line with the recently approved Mexican law that mandates 
preschool education. The objectives of this component will be achieved through the 
following subcomponents:  (a) Subcomponent 1.1—Training for Education Promoters, 
Module Supervisors and Zone Coordinators ($22.0 million);  (b) Subcomponent 1.2—
Community Participation ($0.9 million); (c) Subcomponent 1.3—Sessions with Parents 
and Young Children ($54.3 million); (d) Subcomponent 1.4—Educational and 
Dissemination Materials ($7.2 million); (e) Subcomponent 1.5—Monitoring and 
Evaluation of the Initial Education Program ($1.3 million).   
 
Component 2—Support for Basic Education ($358.2 million).
  The objective of this 
component is to help improve basic education indicators in isolated, rural communities, 
by providing for a package of interventions comprising material, pedagogic and school 
management actions in selected preschools, and primary and lower-secondary 
telesecundaria 
schools.  In addition, support will be provided to rehabilitate and equip 
teacher’s centers located in isolated rural areas.   
 
The objectives of this component will be achieved through six subcomponents:  (a) 
Subcomponent 2.1—School infrastructure ($104.7 million);  (b) Subcomponent 2.2—
Didactic Materials ($88.9 million);  (c) Subcomponent 2.3—Training and Technical 
Assistance for Technical School Councils (CTE) ($ 24.7 million).;  (d) Subcomponent 
2.4—Training and Support to the Parents Associations (APFs) ($ 89.0 million);  (e) 
Subcomponent 2.5—Teachers’ Incentives ($42.9 million);  (f) Subcomponent 2.6—
Support for School Supervision ($8.0 million).   
 
Component 3—Institutional Strengthening ($56.2 million).
  The objective of this 
component is to continue strengthening the capacity of the SEPEs to plan, program and 
evaluate basic education service delivery. This objective will be achieved through the 
following subcomponents:  (a) Subcomponent 3.1—Strengthening the Pedagogic 
Capacity of State Secretariats of Public Education (SEPEs) ($2.0 million);  (b) 
Subcomponent 3.2—Strengthening of the Administrative Capacity of the State 
Secretariats of Public Education (SEPEs) ($3.4 million);  (c) Subcomponent 3.3—Project 
Monitoring and Evaluation ($4.1 million); (d) Subcomponent 3.4—Project 
Administration ($46.7 million).

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The Safeguard policies that are triggered by the project are the Environmental 
(OP/BP/GP 4.01) and the Indigenous Peoples (O.D. 4.20, being revised as OP 4.10).  A 
Social Assessment was carried out in November 2003 and full details are presented in 
Annex 10 of the PAD.  An IPDP has been carried out for Phase III and is included in 
Annex 10. 
An Environmental Assessment framework has been prepared and will also be described 
in detail in Annex 10 of the PAD.   
 
All studies concluded that the project’s impact will be positive, especially since it will be 
managed in accordance with the Bank’s and the Country’s environmental guidelines. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Groundwater and soil pollution, as well as soil erosion have been identified in previous 
studies as potential environmental impacts of rehabilitation and construction 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Given that the Project will support construction activities, the following measures have 
been taken: 
a)  The project operational manual includes environmental rules for contractors, basic 
design specifications and project screening criteria 
b)  a stand-alone EAF has been prepared and is included in Annex 10. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultations were held with state level program coordinators, state education planning 
authorities, and national and international educational specialists and academics, in three 
separate workshops of two days each.  A common feature of these consultations is that 
they demonstrated the excellent ability that CONAFE has to seek and receive feedback 
from civil society and from the principal actors involved in the program. 
 
CONAFE maintains a permanent dialogue with the School Councils of indigenous 
schools. Based on consistent recommendations from those Councils, CONAFE makes

PAREIB Phase III, specialists visited six indigenous communities in the Mexican states 
of Oaxaca and Michoacán to better understand the perspectives of indigenous people 
towards CONAFE’s compensatory programs. Interviewers spoke with preschool 
students, primary school students, 
telesecundaria
 students, parents of students attending 
schools supported by PAREIB and teachers in schools supported by PAREIB.  In 
Oaxaca, interviewers visited communities in Tlaxiaco; in Michoacán, interviewers visited 
Purepecha and Nahuatl communities.
