                         health and feeding programs. It has the following sub-components:
                         Sub-component 1.1: School construction, rehabilitation, and equipment (US$ 21.15 million). This
                         sub-component aims to accommodate displaced and affected students and expand the number of
                         student places in primary and lower secondary education in the seven academies. The Government
                         has defined priority areas for the project where activities will be implemented. The six targeted
                         regions are Bamako, Kati, Mopti, San, Douentza, and SÃ©gou. These priority areas were determined
                         using the following criteria: (i) the number of displaced people in the area, (ii) the number of
                         community schools located in underserved zones, and (iii) the gross enrollment rate of the area. In
                         this context, the project will support:
                         a) Construction and equipment of 1050 classrooms distributed as follows: (i) 960 classrooms
                         equipped in primary; (ii) 81 classrooms equipped in lower secondary schools (new and existing
                         schools); and 9 classrooms equipped in general secondary in the Mopti region to accommodate 600
                         secondary students displaced from the North. Each school (new and existing) will received 3
                         equipped classrooms with 2 blocks of latrines, and a well. Only new schools will receive a block of 3
                         classrooms with an administrative office.
                         b) Rehabilitation of 200 classrooms; construction of 100 blocks of latrines, construction of 200 wells
                         and distribution of 3,000 students desks in existing schools.
                         Of the planned 1,050 classrooms, the project has completed the construction of 789 classrooms and
                         distributed 3,000 students➢❨ desks in affected schools. The second phase of civil works activities
                         will include: the construction and equipment of 261 classrooms in northern regions, as well as the
                         rehabilitation of 200 classrooms, the construction of 100 blocks of latrines, and the construction of
                         200 wells. As per the agreed action plan with the Ministry, construction sites and implementing
                         agencies have been identified and ToRs developed for each of the remaining activities. As soon as
                         proposed extension is granted, contracts will be signed to launch the implementation process of these
                         remaining activities. However, implementation of activities and monitoring in northern regions

                         remain a challenge with the limited security outside of cities. The team is considering working
                         closely with local NGOs and CSOs in northern regions to ensure better and closer M&E of activities
                         to be implemented in the North.
                         Sub-component 1.2: School health and feeding and teaching materials (US$ 8.7 million). This sub-
                         component aims to increase access and retention of children and improve the learning environment,
                         especially for girls living in areas of food insecurity and vulnerable children of school age living in
                         areas with high concentrations of displaced children, through provision of food and health services
                         and teaching-learning materials in schools.
                         This sub-component consists of the following:
                         a) Support to 300 school canteens (of which 120 in the North) and provide food for around 50,000
                         students per year including 20,000 displaced students; Training of 1,500 student-mothers; and
                         development of school health activities in 300 schools per year.
                         b) Provide incentives such as school materials (textbooks, notebooks, calculator, etc.) to girls with
                         100 percent monthly attendance, to foster girls➢❨ enrollment and attendance.
                         This sub-component has provided 12 million meals to more than 130,000 students in more than 400
                         schools across the country (in the South as well as in the North). Student-mothers have been trained
                         and school health activities have been developed as well; and 10,525 girls have received kits for their
                         improved attendance. It is planned to deliver 17 million meals by the end of the current school year.
                         Remaining activities will include delivery of close to 10 million meals to students including in
                         northern regions, and the scaling-up of the school feeding M&E system to at least seven academies.

                         Component 2: Strengthen the technical and pedagogical capacity of the education system (US$ 6.2
                         million). This component aims to improve the learning environment of schools through teacher
                         training activities and pedagogical support for affected students. It aims at improving the capacity of

                         pedagogical advisors, school directors, and teachers to provide adequate pedagogical support to
                         students. These interventions are expected to improve students➢❨ learning based on the government
                         ongoing program.
                         Sub-Component 2.1: Teacher training (US$ 4.05 million): This sub-component consists of the
                         following: training of regional teams made up of 75 teacher trainers; training of 1,200 teachers (at
                         least 500 Community Teachers); training of 300 school directors and pedagogical advisors; and
                         training of 250 secondary teachers.
                         Sub-Component 2.2: Pedagogical Support to affected students (US$3.7 million). Activities include
                         training of teachers in charge of remedial courses in the techniques of remedial teaching and in
                         psycho-social support for 30 regional trainers; organization of remedial courses; and purchase and
                         distribution of school materials kits to students (a bag, a notebook, pen, a pencil, a sharpener, a hand
                         board, and an eraser).
                         All the activities planned under Component 2 have been completed and targets surpassed: 2,708
                         teachers have been trained; 400 school directors, 350 secondary teachers, and 100 regional trainers
                         have benefited from project supported activities. In addition, 39,800 students have received remedial
                         classes with support from trained teachers. Remaining funds will be used to strengthen M&E system
                         for teachers➢❨ in-service training.
                         Component 3: Strengthen the administrative and monitoring capacity of the education system (US$
                         5.65 million). This component consists of project management activities including strengthening of
                         the CGS and the M&E system.
                         Sub-Component 3.1: Involvement of the CGS in School Management (US$1.5 million). This sub-
                         component aims to establish 1,000 CGS in new and existing primary schools and monitoring of
                         school activities especially related to school canteens, student and teacher absenteeism and girls➢❨
                         enrollment and security will be developed.
                         Sub-Component 3.2: Support to the ministry M&E system in targeted areas (US$ 0.8 million).

                         Sub-Component 3.3: Project M&E and TA (US$1.8 million).
                         The project has provided support and set-up 1,332 CGS in communities including in northern
                         regions. The project is performing satisfactorily despite the challenging environment and frequent
                         changes in leadership at the central level. However, the M&E system would need greater support and
                         time to be completed; the study for monitoring school activities especially related to school canteens,
                         student and teacher absenteeism and girls➢❨ enrollment has been developed, a pilot is under
                         implementation, and it is expected that the next school year would allow implementation of the M&E
                         system in regions and communes.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The six priority areas (Bamako, Kati, Mopti, San, Douentza, and SÃ©gou) selected by the
                         government, for the implementation of the project, are located in the southern part of the country.
                         Though this countryside hosts the main natural ecosystems and water-bodies, there is no salient
                         physical feature which would be threatened by the activities to be developed in regard of their small-
                         scale and nature. Nevertheless, due to the historical status of the territory, the exploitation of
                         borrowing pits for the construction of classroom must take into account the potential existence of
                         undiscovered archealogical and cultural richness; this will be analyzed in the environmental
                         management framework and appropriate measures integrated in civil work contracts.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                                The project is classified category B in regard of the activities to be developed essentially under
                              component 1 which will support the construction of infrastructures (classrooms and associated
                              facilities). No large scale, significant or irreversible negative impact is foreseen to be induced by
                              the project activities. The negative impacts would be minor and manageable with a minimum of
                              efforts in place. To this end, three safeguard policies have been triggered: OP 4.01 on
                              Environmental Assessment; OP 4.11 on Physical Cultural resources; OP 4.12 on Involuntary
                              Resettlement. But, as the project is processed through a Bank emergency policy (OP 8.00), an
                              Environmental and Social Screening Assessment Framework (ESSAF) is developed during the
                              appraisal to help managing the environmental and social issues at the early stage of the project
                              implementation. Later on, four months after the effectiveness, two safeguards instruments (an
                              Environmental and Social Management Framework and a Resettlement Policy Framework) will be
                              prepared, consulted upon and disclosed in-country and at the Infoshop of the Bank. Environmental
                              and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) and Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared,
                              consulted upon, and disclosed, once sites and works are finalized.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                                Environmental and social impacts are minimal to moderate, and are not expected to have long-
                              term and major negative impacts.

                                                                         Page 4 of 6
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                             The two safeguard documents (ESMF and RPF) will be prepared, consulted upon and disclosed
                           publicly both in-country and at the InfoShop not later than four months following the effectiveness
                           date. The assessment of borrower?s capacity reveals a need of support; the Project Implementation
                           Unit (PIU) will appoint a part-time safeguard specialist to ensure proper implementation,
                           documentation, follow up and reporting of the mitigation measures (screening, execution of
                           specific ESMP, etc.) recommended in the updated instruments (ESSAF, ESMF, RPF). This will be
                           a condition for Project effectiveness. ESMPs and RAPs will be prepared during project
                           implementation, once sites and works are finalized. A provision of a total amount about US
                           $50,000 is earmarked in the project budget for the execution of the above-mentioned measures.
                           Finally, this new operation will build on the many years of experience and the lessons learned
                           from implementation of several bank-funded projects in the country. This provides the project
                           Teams and relevant actors a good framework for acceptable implementation of safeguard
                           covenants.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             The stakeholders that will be consulted in the preparation of the safeguard documents will
                           include the direct beneficiaries (local communities, local governments, etc.) and potentially
                           affected people during the determination of activities? sites. Where displacedpopulation are
                           concerned, appropriate sensitization and communication mechanisms will be implemented to
                           involve them in decision making. The Direction Nationale du ContrÃ´le des Pollutions et
                           Nuisances and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will ensure that any safeguard document is
                           processed through the existing Malian EIA procedure till the issuance of the environmental permit
