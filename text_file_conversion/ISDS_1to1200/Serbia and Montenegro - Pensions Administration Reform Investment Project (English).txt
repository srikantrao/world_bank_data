A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project’s development objectives would be to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
pension system through the modernization and streamlining of the institutional capacity in the pension 
system, improved pension system administration, developed capacity for policy identification, analysis and 
monitoring and increased public understanding of the system. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed Project would have five main components:  
 
Component 1: Consolidation of Collection and Reporting (US$10 million).
This component would finance system design, capacity building in the collecting 
institution, database development, design of the new reporting form, its testing, 
implementation and training of the employers in using the new system, development of 
communication links with all data users and upgrade of their systems to enable flows and 
processing of the data.   
Component 2: Capacity Building for the Supervision of the Voluntary 
Pension System (US$0.5 million).
 
This component would support the development of 
the voluntary pension system supervision capacities in the National Bank of Serbia and 
the design and implementation of a broad public education campaign related to the 
voluntary pension system.  The component would finance the provision of foreign and 
local technical assistance, training of staff, and purchasing of equipment and specialized 
software.  
Component 3:  Consolidation and Institutional Strengthening of the PAYGO 
Page  2
Pension Funds (US$12.9 million)
.
This component would support the consolidation of 
the three PAYGO funds along the program adopted by the GOS, modernization of the 
new institution and implementation of a new strategy which would allow it to refocus its 
activities on a narrower range of core functions which it would seek to carry out with 
substantially increased efficiency and security.  This would also facilitate it being an 
effective partner in the broader revenue and reporting consolidation.  The component 
would also support costs associated with retraining of staff associated with transition to a 
new set of core functions and potential severance payment.  
 
Component 4: Strengthening Capacity for Policy Analysis and Development 
(US$1.1 million).
 
This component would support the capacity development of the 
MLSEP Department for Pension Insurance.  The Department is responsible for 
determining, conducting and supervising pension policy and overall pension system. It 
carries out work related to pension legislation, pension policy and supervises delivery of 
benefits by PAYG pension funds, but also all the work related to bilateral pension 
insurance contracts. Current Department's human resources and technical capacity 
including equipment and office space are insufficient to ensure efficient fulfillment of 
required work program. This component would finance technical assistance, equipment, 
training and public education efforts. 
 
Component 5: Project Coordination and Management (US$0.5 million).
 
The project 
coordination and management would largely be developed within the existing institutional framework, in 
which the line ministries/agencies would be in charge of preparing TORs for the employment of 
consultants and training, and specifications for the procurement of works and goods under the project. 
Most likely, procurement and financial management functions would be outsourced to one of the three 
existing project implementation units (PIUs).  These options are being considered and the final decision is 
to be made during the appraisal mission.
