    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    The project development objective is to strengthen Tanzania’s institutional capacity to implement the
    country’s EITI legislation and achieve compliance with the 2016 EITI validation Standards.
    C. Project Description
    The project consists of the following activities:

    1. Enhancing transparency of the extractive industries: this is achieved by supporting activities aimed at
    implementing the EITI Board corrective actions and Validator's recommendations emerging from the
    2017 Validation exercise ($210,000): On 25 October validation against 2017, Tanzania underwent a
    review of progress toward validation against the 2016 EITI Standard. The EITI Board determined that
    Tanzania has made meaningful progress overall in implementing the EITI Standard. The EITI Board
    recommended corrective actions on the following requirements:

    • EITI Standard relating to government engagement (requirement 1.1),
    • MSG governance (1.4),
    • EITI work plan (1.5),
    • License allocations and register (2.2 and 2.3),
    • Government's policy on contract disclosure (2.4),
    • State participation (2.6),
    • Production and export data (3.2 and 3.3),

                                                 Page 1 of 3
• Comprehensiveness of revenue disclosures (4.1),
• Transportation revenues (4.4),
• State-owned enterprises transactions ( 4.5),
• Direct subnational payments (4.6),
• Revenue management and expenditures (5 .1 ),
• Quasi-fiscal expenditures by state-owned enterprises (6.2)
• Economic contribution of the extractive sector (6.3),
• Public debate (7.1), and
• Follow-up on recommendations (7.3).


2. Promoting Public-Private Dialogue on the impacts and benefits of the extractive sector ($240,000):
This activity will address current public concerns about the benefits of mining through increased public
understanding of EI revenues, utilization of receipts at district level, public debates on EI resources
revenue management, and support to CSOs to improve their capacity in analyzing and using EITI
Reports.

3. Supporting the Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA) to undertake a study for
developing a framework for a register of beneficial ownership for the extractive companies in Tanzania
($150,000): At the Anti-Corruption Summit in London on May 12, 2016, the United Republic of
Tanzania committed to ensure that beneficial ownership is publicly available for all companies active in
the extractive sector. Tanzania also committed to ensuring that Tanzania will establish a central register
for beneficial ownership of extractive companies where law enforcement agencies will have access to
the information. In fulfillment of this commitment, the project will support BRELA to design a register
for a beneficial ownership of all the extractive companies in Tanzania.

4. Implement Recommendations and undertaking amendments on provisions of the identified laws that
do not support concept of BO disclosure ($110,000): In July 2017, Tanzania published a study on
beneficial ownership, which focused on sixty-eight extractive companies that had participated in the
reporting of the Fifth and Sixth Tanzania EITI Reports. Fifty-four companies (33 mining and 22 oil and
gas) provided data. Twenty-three out of the fifty-four companies provided details of entities/persons
with which they are cooperating - contractors and joint venture, etc. Eight companies disclosed natural
person as beneficial owners. Thirty-one companies disclosed their beneficial owners as a combination of
company and individuals. Eleven companies disclosed company as beneficial owner. Twenty-five
companies disclosed persons with influence over the actions or management of their companies. Two
companies disclosed existence of politically exposed persons (PEP) within their companies. The project
will support a review of legal arrangements and recommendations which will improve the coverage and
scope of beneficial ownership registry.
