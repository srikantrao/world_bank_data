B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
A
multi-phased APL program has been created for supporting investments and technical 
assistance needs of the countries participating in the regional electricity market for South East 
Europe (called European Community of South East Europe-ECSEE). The proposed project is 
third in the series (Phase-1 includes Romania and possibly Turkey, Phase-2 includes Albania) 
 
The overall APL objective is the development of a functioning regional electricity market in 
South East Europe and its integration into the internal electricity market of the European Union, 
through the implementation of priority investments supporting electricity market and power 
system operations in electricity generation, transmission and distribution, and technical 
assistance for institutional/systems development and project preparation and implementation. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The APL Phase-3 (Serbia) project would facilitat
e
Serbia’s participation in ECSEE by financing 
the transmission substations and associated transmission lines, and preparation of a feasibility 
study for rehabilitation of a hydro project to be proposed for funding through future APLs.  The 
project will comprise of two components: 
Page  2
Component 1
:
Investments in six 110 kV subs-stations and associated transmission links to the 
110 kV network. 
 
Component 2:
Feasibility study for rehabilitation of Zvornik (92 MW) hydro power plant. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Six 110kV sub-stations, and the associated transmission lines are located in different 
Municipalities across Serbia.  
 
Arilje 110/35 kV Substation and 1.4 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line  
Avranje 2 110/35 kV Substation and 9.1 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line 
Jagodina 3 110/20-10 kV Substation and 5.3 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line 
Macvanska Mitrovica 110/20 kV Substation and 9.5 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line  
Ni 8  110/10 kV Substation and 9.6 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line 
Mosna 110/35 kV Substation and 23.3 kilometers long 110 kV Transmission Line. 
 
For Arilje, Avranje, Macvanska Mitrovica, and Nis, the company owns the land. For Jagodina 
(0.2 Hectares) and Mosna (0.6 Hectares) of land is to be acquired.  In addition, land will be 
acquired for setting the Transmission towers (about 25 sq. meters per tower).  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The project will be implemented by Serbia’s power utility (EPS and, after restructuring of EPS, 
its successor entities).  EPS is currently implementing some projects funded by donors such as 
EBRD, KfW, and EIB, which require environmental and social impact mitigation plans. 
Extensive laws, guidelines, rules, and recommendations exist in Serbia and Montenegro for 
environmental management, which are overseen by the Ministry of Environment. However, the 
institutional capacity of the implementing agency to develop and implement the safeguards 
policies will be assessed during project preparation and necessary measures taken to ensure 
compliance with the policies.

An Abbreviated Land Acquisition Plan will be prepared and made public by the 
implementing agency, before the Bank starts its appraisal. The implementing

agency plans to follow its normal procedure of acquiring land through 
negotiations with the owners. The eminent domain is exercised only as a last 
resort, but is not expected to be used in this project because of the flexibility in 
the route of the Transmission line and acquisition of very small quantity of land 
for the sub-stations ( Section D above) and for Transmission towers.

The environmental impacts are expected to be minimal and will be addressed through design, 
specification of equipment, including the mitigation measures and responsibilities for the 
construction impacts (noise, dust, avoidance of PCB) in the construction contract, and through 
maintenance practices the minimization of impacts of operation (proper disposal of solid wastes 
and sewerage water from the sub-station, noise, and mitigation measures to reduce spillage of oil 
in case of accident).  
 
III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. April 15, 2005 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. March 31, 
2005

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
