B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 3 of PCN]
Outcomes
. The key development objectives of the project are to improve the business environment and 
reduce transaction costs, and thereby promote entry of new private enterprise
s, private investment, and 
employment creation. This would be accomplished through the following activities: simplification of 
entry requirements for firms through reform of the regulatory regime and establishment of “one
-
stop
-
shops” within a group of pilo
t municipalities; strengthening enforcement of property rights by addressing 
weaknesses in the legal framework and the judiciary (particularly within the municipal court system) and 
strengthening capacity of Municipal Cadastre Offices to update and maintai
n reliable land registries; and 
establishing and implementing EU food safety standards and a product certification framework.    
Beneficiaries
. The principal beneficiaries of the project would be private enterprises (in their capacities as 
investors, exp
orters, market competitors, property owners, borrowers, and parties to contracts).
C.  Project Description 
[from section 4 of PCN]
Main Components
. 
The proposed project is a joint effort of ECSPF and ECSSD, and would support 
implementation of the Governm
ent’s agenda to improve the business environment through a technical 
assistance grant comprised of the following four components:
Page  2
(i)
Integrated Municipal Services Pilot
: assistance to harmonize the enterprise regulatory regime 
and a pilot program of assistan
ce to municipalities to simplify and streamline regulatory and 
administrative requirements and improve their enforcement through integration of central and 
municipal systems and services (“one
-
stop
-
shops”). This could include assistance to integrate 
servic
es and data by reorganizing current municipal structures to combine many enterprise
-
related services within a given municipality in a single office (including services provided by 
central level authorities, such as business and tax registration), developme
nt of new operating 
procedures  and  monitoring  systems,  introduction  of  web
-
based  access  to  forms  and 
information, and training of staff.;
(ii)
Strengthening  Enforcement  of  Property  Rights
:  (a)  assistance  to  the  judiciary  to  identify 
priority areas hindering enf
orcement of creditor, property and contract rights and assistance to 
reform legislation, procedures, and practices as appropriate; and (b) 
support to the evolving 
cadastral registration system to finalize the legal basis for its future institutional setup 
and 
modernize its systems in order to render property registration more reliable, streamlined and 
affordable;
(iii)
Food Safety Policy Development
: 
assistance to the Food Safety Board to define a realistic set 
of policies to guide the system toward phased adopti
on of EU standards
; and, 
(iv)
Building Capacity to Fight Money Laundering
: support for implementation of the new anti
-
money laundering regime by assisting the FIC to define and administer operating procedures, 
training local staff, and establishing internation
al coordination.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
The main objective of the Law on Environmental Protection that was promulgated in 2003 is 
the  gradual  reduction  of  envir
onmental  pollution  and  environmental  damage,  sustainable 
management of natural resources, and biodiversity conservation. The law provides for the 
preparation of the new standards and admissible norms of discharges into air, water, soil and 
noise.  The  law  h
as  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  provisions  for  permitting  and 
authorizing activities that affect the environment. The lead institutions are the Ministry of 
Environment and Spatial Planning and Kosovo Environmental Protection Agency (KEPA). 
The role of t
he Ministry is policy and strategy formulation, environmental permitting and 
enforcement.  KEPA  is  in  charge  of  pollution  control  and  monitoring,  preparation  of 
environmental information system and undertaking of research

Category C is proposed because there is no physical construction 
activity or civil works 
associated with any of the project components. The primary focus of the proposed project is 
institutional capacity building.
