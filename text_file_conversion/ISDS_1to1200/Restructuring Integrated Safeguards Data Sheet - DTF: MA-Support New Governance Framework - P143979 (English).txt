4. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
   KNOWN)
The project mainly focuses on technical assistance and institutional capacity building. There are no physical
interventions which might trigger the need for safeguard analysis. The institution-building and technical
assistance to be provided under this grant aregeared towards improving the internal functioning and
performance of public institutions. The incremental environmental impact of this project is not apparent and
the low level of risk involved in helping to improve the access to such loan mechanisms is commensurate
with the C rating. No involuntary resettlement can be envisaged in relation to project activities and therefore
OP 4.12 does not apply.
