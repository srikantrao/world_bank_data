                           The activity consists has two components: a) results-based subsidies to eligible companies selling Lighting
                           Global certified products; b) implementation support.

                           Component 1: Results-based subsidies (US$ 3.25 million) provided to eligible companies/NGOs for solar
                           products ranging from 0.3 watt peak (Wp) solar lamps up to 50 Wp SHS. These products cater for basic needs
                           such as lighting and phone charging (Sustainable Energy for All - SE4All tier 1 access) as well as the operation
                           of direct current (DC) appliances such as televisions and fans (SE4All tier 2 access). The activity will contribute
                           to more sustainable, private sector driven off-grid solar market development. It will address high initial

                           market development costs faced by the private sector in Myanmar, contributing to supply chain
                           development and provision of quality sales and services. As RBF/OBA solar energy programs have
                           demonstrated, potential customers would benefit of increasing market competition, which is expected to
                           result in offer of quality products at competitive price.

                           RBF grant will promote Lighting Global certified products that are delivered with 1-3 year warranty
                           requirement depending on product and after sales service. The Lighting Global testing procedure for small
                           solar systems up to 10 Wp has become an international standard IEC-TS 62257-9-5, while the testing
                           procedure for SHS kits up to 350 Wp is planned to be formalized as IEC standard in 2018. Companies can
                           either select one of currently 134 certified products of 65 suppliers or submit their untested products for
                           certification.

                           Companies entering the rural solar market in Myanmar with quality products and services are facing the

                           challenge of high market risks and market entry costs. Risks include uncertainty of market uptake caused by
                           low willingness to pay of the households due to the competition of cheap low quality products and
                           uncertainties of planning rural electrification projects. Market entry costs include marketing, employment
                           and training of staff, rent for office and warehouse space, import and transport logistics, and facilitation of
                           consumer financing. Companies' income consist of sales revenues which are usually low and difficult to
                           predict in the pilot phase. High initial investment is required to bridge the time until increased sales
                           eventually pay off. Depending on their confidence in the market potential, equity investors will accept higher
                           risks to quickly scale-up a companyâ€™s market entry or require a slower approach, expecting first results
                           before decisions on further expansions are taken. The RBF grant incentive aims to accelerate market uptake
                           by partially compensating companies for risk taking and high marginal retail costs incurred by entering new
                           markets.

                           A subsidy of maximum US$ 50 per system sold will be reimbursed to solar companies/NGOs based on
                           certification of sales by an independent verification agent hired by DRD, on sample basis. The subsidy
                           calculation and adjustment mechanism will be presented in the Operating Manual. Commercial practices will
                           be applied for the proposed RBF grant.

                           Component 2: Implementation support to DRD (US$ 200,000). Key activities include overall management
                           and promotion of the RBF Off-grid Solar, launch of the RBF call for proposals, communication with
                           companies, processing of RBF subsidy contracts, annual review of the RBF incentive, monitoring of the grant
                           implementation, hiring and coordination of the independent verification agents (IVA), review of the output
                           verification reports and processing of subsidy disbursement transactions.

                           ESMAP approved US$450,000 for the RBF. The ESMAP recipient executed grant will provide results-based
                           subsidy to facilitate the market uptake for Lighting Global certified products. Additional grant funding in the
                           amount of US$ 3 million has been approved for eligibility (concept stage) by GPOBA as follows: a) US$ 2,8
                           million for RBF subsidy; and b) US$ 200,000 for implementation support.

                          analysis (if known)
                          Based on the nature of the technology, the Lighting Global certified products supported under the proposed
                          grant have very small footprint and are widely dispersed. The proposed RBF proposed grant will initially
                          support the ongoing IFC-led Lighting Myanmar activities in central Myanmar as envisaged at NEP project
                          design. In the longer term, the scope of the project remains national, demand driven, where households are
                          willing to buy Lighting Global certified solar products. The revised NEP's ESMP will apply. The ESMF will
                          include this activity in the typology of sub-projects covered, with corresponding brief ECOPs added (e.g.
                          encouraging appropriate disposal). An Action Plan to address NEP safeguards policies issues has been

                          articulated as a part of the project MTR. The key elements include (i) revision of ESMF by the client with
                          support provided by GIZ, (ii) upstream E&S support by GIZ, (iii) recruitment of the minimum number of local
                          safeguards consultants with a view to add additional consultants as capacity deficit becomes clearer; (iv)
                          continued training of implementing agencies staff.



                          E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          DRD is responsible for monitoring the safeguardsâ€™ compliance for the proposed grant. Overall, DRD in-house
                          safeguards capacity has been weak. In March 2018, a local environmental and social safeguards consultant
                          was engaged by PMO. Moreover, GiZ has recently engaged an international consultant to support the client
                          with the ESMF's revision. Since safeguards staffing and resources have been below those agreed at appraisal,
                          the World Bank has provided training and capacity building activities included: in-mission training session to
                          assigned staff on screening using the ESMF screening form (May 2017), two day training on environmental
                          and social safeguards to NEP staff (June 2017), two day training on grievance redress and village
                          electrification guidelines to NEP Union level staff (September 2017), two day training on grievance redress
                          and village electrification guidelines to NEP township engineers (November 2017), two day training on
                          environmental and social safeguards to NEP staff (April 2018).
