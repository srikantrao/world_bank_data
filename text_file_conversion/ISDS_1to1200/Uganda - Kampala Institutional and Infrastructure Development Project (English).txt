B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The overall objective of the project is to develop a strong governance and institutional structure within 
KCC to enhance service delivery and improve the economic performance of Kampala. This is important 
particularly in the light of the critical role that Kampala plays within the wider Ugandan economy.  The 
continued deterioration of the physical infrastructure in Kampala and the weakening of the service 
delivery capabilities of its governance structures are likely to have negative spillover effects on the 
performance of the Ugandan economy.  The project aims to arrest this development and to put Kampala 
on a new path of improved physical and institutional development.  These economic goals will have 
poverty reducing effects within Kampala and at the national level and will also attract private sector 
investment.  These goals will be realized through a combination of two interlocking and simultaneous 
initiatives:  (i) a program of institutional and fiscal reform of the local governance structures in Kampala, 
with the specific objective of significantly improving the service-delivery effectiveness and efficiency of 
these organs; and (ii) a program of investment at the city-wide scale, focusing on the areas of drainage, 
roads/traffic management, and solid waste removal. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The project has the following components (estimated to cost US$90.0 million): 
 
Component 1:
 
Institutional Development
.
This component will assist Kampala and its stakeholders to 
refine and expand the SFR into a comprehensive approach to municipal development, consonant with 
Kampala’s central role in the nation’s economic and political life.  Achievement of key activities will 
Page  2
trigger investments under the various phases of component 2.  Activities will include:  (i) developing and 
beginning to implement a long-term vision for the city, including an effective development plan, which 
identifies the steps to be taken in the near and medium term to achieve that vision with specific annual 
milestones, (ii) developing and implementing a financial recovery plan designed to place KCC and its 
divisions in a sound and sustainable financial condition as soon as possible, (iii) creating and 
implementing a comprehensive organizational development strategy, based on affordability and on the 
clear and enforceable separation of council’s role of policy-making and oversight from staff’s 
management role, and (iv) introducing and sustaining mechanisms to improve the transparency and 
accountability of KCC, including the development and ongoing implementation of an effective and 
meaningful communication strategy between KCC and its stakeholders.  Technical and financial support 
will be also provided to ensure that an effective collaborative process is put in place to identify barriers to 
competitiveness and to address these appropriately, in order to improve the ability of the private sector 
(formal and informal) to contribute to economic development and poverty reduction in Kampala 
 
Component 2:
 
Citywide Infrastructure and Services Improvement
.
This component will support 
activities aimed at improving the provision of critical services to the city.  The investment in 
infrastructure and service improvements will address four priority areas: (i) drainage system; (ii) traffic 
and road maintenance management; (iii) solid waste management; and (iv) urban markets infrastructure.  
These four areas are critical for inducing the confidence of the public and service recipients and will 
contribute to the economic and commercial development of the city.  The infrastructure investments will 
be phased and predicated on defined institutional and fiscal milestones/targets that will trigger investment 
packages during project implementation.  These milestones/targets will be determined during project 
preparation and agreed with KCC. 
 
Component 3:  
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation, and  Civil Society Participation
.
This 
component will have two sub components: 
(i)
 
Project management, Monitoring and Evaluation:
 This will 
encompass the management activities associated with the implementation of the project, and will support 
program management, the establishment and implementation of a comprehensive monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) system and future program formulation; and 
(ii) Civil Society Participation:
 
This will 
provide technical and financial support to a coalition of civil society organizations (NGOs, CSOs, Private 
Sector Associations, Universities etc.) to effectively participate in the strategic and budget planning 
processes of KCC in order to increase budget responsiveness, accountability and transparency to KCC's 
constituents 
 
D.  Project location 
 
The project will involve the Kampala City Council and its five divisions.  The institutional components of 
the project will be implemented at KCC Headquarters and in the five divisions.  The physical 
infrastructure and service improvement will be in all the five divisions. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Kampala City Council (KCC) is implementing the IDA-financed Nakivubo Channel Rehabilitation 
Project (NCRP) which involves the rehabilitation of the main channel in Kampala to alleviate the frequent 
and increasing incidence of flooding in the city.  During the project design, KCC carried out the 
preparation of an Environmental Mitigation Plan (EMP) to address the impact of the project and a Social 
Impact Assessment to identify any significant social risks resulting from the implementation of NCRP. 
During the implementation of the project, KCC has demonstrated adequate capacity to monitor 
compliance of the EMP and other safeguards issues

Environmental Assessment Category: 
 [ ] A   [X] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI   [ ] TBD  
 
Based on the physical investments to be financed under Component 2, it is expected that the project will 
trigger two safeguard policies: Environmental Assessment and Involuntary Resettlement.  Environmental 
Assessment will be required for all the physical infrastructure in roads, drainage and markets 
improvements; and resettlement plans need to be prepared for the people to be possibly affected by the 
physical intervention.  This would require the preparation of an Environmental and Social Management 
Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).  
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  The specific 
studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
The preparation of the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and the Resettlement 
Policy Framework (RPF) will commence  in January 2005 and it is expected that the first draft will be 
submitted to IDA in June 2005.  The tentative date for public disclosure is August 2005 prior to appraisal.
