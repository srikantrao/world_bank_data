B. Project Development Objective(s)
To improve the quality of project preparation for PPPs and maximize developing country
governments' limited resources for project preparation through the provision of standardized project
document templates and training on how to use the templates and web portal.
C. Project Description
The International Infrastructure Support System (IISS) initiative is an international initiative
coordinated by the Sustainable Infrastructure Foundation (SIF) and recognized by the G20. It has
developed an international infrastructure support system consisting of a project preparation platform
in the form of online guidelines from general to sector-specific criteria centered on project data
templates in a secure multi-user online platform. The IISS aims to: (i) maximize limited public sector
project preparation funds through the use of standardized documentation and a consistent approach to
project development; and (ii) increase the interface between private sector firms, financiers and
public sector sponsors, with the ultimate goal to increase the delivery of sustainable infrastructure by
increasing the availability of private finance for projects in developing countries. This project will
enhance the IISS by creating sub-sector templates and training government officials on how to use
the platform to prepare projects. The project templates produced in this project will include, as


﻿appropriate, reference to the environmental and social requirements and procedures associated with
any proposed operation
The objective of this activity is to improve the quality of project preparation for PPPs and maximize

standardized project document templates and training on how to use the templates and web portal.
This activity includes two components in support of the IISS platform: i) supporting a pilot of the
platform; and ii) developing standardized templates.
