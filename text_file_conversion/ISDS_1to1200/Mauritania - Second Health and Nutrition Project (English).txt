B.  Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the Second Health and Nutrition Project would be to support the GOM in 
implementing it’s strategies to improve the health and nutrition status of the population and support the 
achievements of the PRSP and MDGs targets.  This would be done by:  (a) consolidating past 
achievements of the Health Sector Investment Project and the Nutrition Project; (b) further strengthening 
the availability of quality health and nutrition services and their utilization by the poor and vulnerable 
groups; (c) increase of resource allocation and use of resource according to the needs of the poor and 
vulnerable groups; and (d) permanent capacity building for improved performance.  Special attention 
would be paid to the equity, efficiency and effectiveness of the health and nutrition systems.  The project 
would capitalize on some of the reforms implemented under previous projects and strengthen the current 
sector-wide approach arrangements in place in the health sector.  The rationale for combining health and 
nutrition is justified.  Malnutrition is linked to 54% of the deaths of children under five, more than half of 
child deaths are associated with chronic malnutrition and malnourished children suffer more often from 
infectious diseases.  Community-based nutrition services provide out-reaches for preventive basic health 
services. 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
The project consists of three main components that are consistent with GOMs health and nutrition 
strategies:  (i) improving health service delivery; (ii) strengthening of community-based nutrition and 
health services; and (iii) strengthening the financing and performance of health and nutrition services.  A 
matrix combining the previous projects and comparing component-goals to achievement served as basis 
to develop the components.
 
The proposed project would address the entire population (although 
component 2 would be implemented only in selected areas) with emphasis on the rural poor population, 
women and children.  The design has been made in such a way to ensure a harmonious transition toward 
the possible program approach
.

Component 1: Strengthening health service delivery (US$6.0 million) 
 
1a:  Improve access, quality and utilization of health services. 
 The project would seek to make 
essential health services available and better adapted to the needs of the population, especially in remote 
areas, making them technically and socially acceptable and utilized with the full involvement of the 
beneficiaries.  This will include the construction of about 25 health posts in the two poorest regions of the 
country as well as the implementation of a part of the National Medical Waste Management Plan. 
1b:  Increase availability and performance of health personnel.
 
In order to increase the number of 
skilled personnel and their productivity the project would provide support to further enhance ongoing 
policy reforms regarding recruitment, training, utilization and loyalty of health personnel. 
1c:  Increase financial access of the poor vulnerable groups to health and nutrition services.
 
The 
project would support the implementation of ongoing and planned reforms aiming at developing pooling 
systems and mitigating the effects of the cost recovery system on the poor and vulnerable groups. 
 
Component 2: Strengthening of community-based nutrition and basic health services (US$2.5 
million) 
 
2a:  Implement the nutrition policy and strengthen implementation capacity.
 
The project would seek 
to strengthen policy development capacity, implementation capacity, and support the implementation of 
the iodization program. 
2b:  Expand and reinforce community-based nutrition and basic health services.
 
The project would 
continue to support the expansion of successful nutrition and basic health interventions implemented at 
community level. 
 
Component 3: Improving health sector financing and performance (US$ 1.5 million) 
 
3a: Promote governance, institutional capability and accountability.
 
The project would support 
activities to strengthen sector planning, resource management and administrative performance and 
activities to enhance accountability for results. 
3b: Improve the monitoring and evaluation system.  
The project would continue to support the 
building of national statistical capacity especially at the lower tiers of the health system, making sure that 
data (on resources, outputs and outcomes, policies and institutional performance) are collected in a timely 
manner, analyzed, disseminated and effectively used to monitor sector performance and progress towards 
the MDGs. 
 
D.  Project location  
 
The proposed project would address the entire population (although component 2 would be implemented 
only in selected areas of the country), with emphasis on the rural poor population, especially women and 
children.  Moreover, the project will support the construction of about 25 health posts in two poorest 
regions of the country. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Ministry of Health and Social affaires is responsible for the improvement of the legal and regulatory 
framework, especially the Hygiene National Centre (CNH), in the first year of the program. Within the 
health care facilities, Health Care Waste management HCW Regulation and regiment action should be 
conducted by Direction de la medicine public (DMP), Direction de la Protection Sociale (DPS) and CNH.

The Borrower’s institutional capacity to implement safeguards policies is currently limited.  However, 
some additional training and capacity strengthening will be supported by the project.
