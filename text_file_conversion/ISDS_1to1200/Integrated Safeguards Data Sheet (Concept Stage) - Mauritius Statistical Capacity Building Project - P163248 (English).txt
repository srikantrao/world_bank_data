    D. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
    (if known)
    This is a statistical capacity building project coordinated by Statistics Mauritius, with the exception of
    surveys and gathering of statistical data, which will take place across the country. Project benefits will
    be nationwide. It concerns improvements in survey design methodology and data collection (CAPI), in
    data analysis, and in data cataloguing and dissemination. The activities to be funded by the project are
    limited to statistical capacity building in data collection, data analysis, and data cataloguing and
    dissemination. It will not fund any civil works that could have adverse environmental or social impacts.
    The social impact is expected to be positive because by improving data quality and making them
    publicly available it will nurture public debate on matters of economic, financial, and social interest,
    facilitate public accountability, and make it possible to better target public policies and better use public
