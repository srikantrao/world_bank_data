B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
Project Development Objective
.
The development objective of the proposed TAL would be to support the 
implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the Government reform program supported by the 
Housing Sector Programmatic Development Policy Loan (PDPL). The Second Programmatic Loan for 
Sustainable and Equitable Growth aims to improve the policy environment for improving the living 
conditions of the poor and strengthening their access to assets, notably housing and serviced/serviceable 
land and would be the first in programmatic series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs), presented to the 
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in conjunction with the proposed TAL. The Second Programmatic 
Loan for Sustainable and Equitable Growth supports the Government’s program to (a) strengthen the 
sector institutions managing Federal housing and urban development policy and programs; (b) build an 
efficient market for formal housing finance capable of absorbing long-term savings and which will 
provide a stock of finished housing for medium-term down-filtering of middle class housing; (c) establish 
a
rational and complementary system for housing subsidies for the poor; and (d) improve the conditions 
for land and urban development by reducing barriers to formality and improving the affordability of 
formal land and housing development.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed TAL would channel Bank financial support the four areas of programmatic support being 
incorporated under the concurrently-prepared series DPLs. The TAL would aim to support the overall 
policy reform agenda and, concretely, establish the necessary conditions under which the Bank could 
Page  2
provide investment-linked support to the housing subsidy programs through a sector investment loan 
under the Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) beginning in 2006. The TAL would be designed to allow for a 
large amount of implementation flexibility to account for the likely evolution of the financial sector 
linked inimitably to Brazil’s macroeconomic conditions. Table [2] identifies the Project components and 
their associated costs.

The four components of the TAL are: 
 
Component 1: Supporting the Institutional and Legal Framework for Housing Policy (US$ [XX] million)
.
The TAL would include resources to support the Ministry of Cities in its internal reorganization, 
including the consolidation of the National Housing Secretariat as the key technical and policy entity for 
managing coordinate policy design across the many public sector actors. The component would finance 
technical assistance related to the establishment of the FNHIS and, critically, to implement a broad 
program of capacity building and training for local officials at the municipal and state level. Because 
municipalities will be taking on greater responsibilities in the context of the evolving legal framework, 
efforts are urgently needed to strengthen the ability of local governments to recover costs and manage the 
basic fiduciary and technical aspects of urban development.  
 
Component 2: Housing Finance Market Development (US$ [XX] million).
 The TAL would include 
resources to support the improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for housing loans, including 
incremental reforms to the existing housing finance system, the further deregulation of the SBPE, and 
overall strengthening of the into the market-based SFI. While the reform agenda is broad and complex, 
and the sector actors have initiated a number of studies and technical reviews, the Government has 
requested that the TAL activities be highly focused on (a) efforts to disseminate information about the 
importance of a credible regulatory and legal framework for housing finance among a broad audience 
which would include the judiciary and members of Congress; (b) a technical review of the issues related 
to the development of a functioning credit insurance market; and (c) a strategic study, by independent 
consultants, of the medium-term future of FGTS. The TAL activities would complement other 
Government technical work on a number of issues, including: (a) the development of new legal and 
financial instruments for promoting greater primary and secondary market development; (b) the transition 
and future deregulation of SBPE, and (c) efforts to support the drafting of housing-specific consumer 
protection legislation, including a short study tour to the United States and/or Western Europe where such 
efforts are also underway. 
 
Component 3: Housing Subsidies for the Poor (US$ [XX] million)
.
The focus of technical assistance 
activities as relates to housing subsidy policy would be the rationalization of the Government’s various 
Page  3
subsidy programs and the establishment of effective targeting, monitoring, and evaluation mechanisms. 
Activities to be supported include (a) technical assistance for subsidy harmonization and regularization 
across the various subsidy programs (including OGU, off-budget, and FGTS programs); (b) the 
establishment of a tiered system of monitoring and evaluation, including regular monitoring of subsidy 
programs as regards targeting, impact, unit costs, the performance and compliance of financial 
intermediaries, and which would address both real-time needs and medium-term living standards impact; 
(c) demand-side technical assistance to local communities/local governments for structuring and 
packaging requests to the PSH; (d) a series of outreach and dissemination activities as regard national 
subsidy programs to improve understanding at the local level; and (e) technical assistance to improve the 
targeting of subsidies, including studies and analysis for the establishment of a system for poverty 
categorization that is more reliable than the current system of self-declaration and is consistent with Bank 
and Government experience. 
 
Component 4: Land and Urban Development (US$ [XX] million). 
Technical assistance under this 
Component would be aimed at (a) federal-level research, monitoring, and evaluation of the remaining 
policy and regulatory efforts for urban development and land subdivision; (b) support for the Ministry of 
Cities’ program to strengthen local governments in their efforts to achieve “
gestão propria
,”
the 
accreditation of their institutional capacity which allows them to take the lead in local urban development 
policy setting and implementation; and (c) the development of a series of toolkits to facilitate the 
implementation of the policy innovations supported by the DPL, including toolkits for progressive 
housing development, the preparation of 
Planes Diretores
 (local master plans), and demand-side 
organization for housing subsidy programs. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The operation would provide Technical Assistan
ce for the Government’s policy reform program 
and thus would not be location-specific.
