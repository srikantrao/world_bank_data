A.2. Project Objectives 
The project’s development objective is to increase the effectiveness of public funding for tertiary education 
by enhancing coherence, responsiveness, equity and quality in the system, through stronger accountability 
for performance. 
Indicators that would measure progress toward the development objective include: (i) surveyed perception 
among employers on the quality of tertiary graduates; (ii) number of graduate students from CFTs and IPs 
transferring to universities; (iii) socioeconomic profile of tertiary first year students; (iv) first year drop-out 
rate by institutions; and (v) percent of public funding for tertiary education allocated on a performance or 
competitive basis. 
 
The project forms part of the GoC’s efforts to place Chile in a favorable position to realize the benefits of 
the emerging knowledge economy. The goal is that the educational sector will provide the skills and the 
knowledge necessary to sustain Chile’s economic and social development. To this end, the proposed 
project would, in conjunction with the Science for the Knowledge Economy Project (P077282) and the 
Life-long Learning and Training Project (P068271), form a coherent set of policies and investments in 
skills and knowledge. 
CAS 
GOALS SUPPORTED BY THE PROJECT
 
The proposed project is firmly founded on the Bank’s three CAS-pillars of intervention in Chile. First the 
project would add to the CAS goal of sustaining overall economic growth and social progress in Chile. 
Second, the project would contribute to heightening inclusion by improving tertiary learning opportunities 
for students from poor and/or indigenous backgrounds. Finally, the project would support the 
modernization of the state by (i) building capacity for strategic policy formulation; (ii) strengthening sector 
monitoring and evaluation; and (iii) increasing accountability for the use of public funding.

–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Despite the great strides that Chile has made in reducing poverty and reforming the 
education structure, it remains a country marked by high levels of inequality both in 
terms of income distribution and educational achievement. Although significant 
improvement can be observed between 1990 and 2000, students from vulnerable groups, 
including the poor, rural and indigenous remain underrepresented in TE.  This under-
representation can be largely explained by two factors; (a) lack of academic preparation 
at the secondary level due to poor schools in poor rural areas, and (b) lack of financial 
means to continue education. 
President Lagos’ administration has stated a goal to increase TE coverage to 50 percent 
of all 18-24 year olds by 2012, as expressed in the New Deal Policy with Indigenous 
Peoples and Chilean Society.  The CAS also includes a goal to heighten inclusion by 
improving TE opportunities for poor and/or indigenous students.  This project aims to 
achieve these goals by (i) financing studies on how to improve financial aid mechanisms 
and (ii) supporting innovative projects to assist vulnerable students improve their 
academic preparedness for entry into, and success at, TE institutions. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
The proposed actions to improve the indigenous scholarship program and the academic preparedness of 
indigenous students are expected to increase tertiary education enrollment and graduation for this group. In 
turn, this is expected to improve the performance of indigenous peoples in the labor market and, in part, 
contribute to reducing poverty among indigenous peoples in Chile.
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant): N/A 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The project would increase the quality of tertiary education in under-represented regions 
and seek ways to improve access to university education for inadequately prepared 
secondary graduates and students in non-university tertiary institutions. Specifically, an 
Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) has been prepared to ensure that 
indigenous and poor students benefit from the project. This IPDP is intended to address 
issues hindering these students access to TE, as identified through a study and 
consultation carried out during project preparation. The IPDP contains three main 
actions: (a) the design of targeting mechanisms to identify and promote indigenous 
student participation in TE; (b) incentives for universities in selected areas to provide 
remedial learning opportunities for indigenous students; and (c) studies on ways to 
strengthen indigenous scholarships for talented individuals. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

According to the 2002 Census, 692,192 people or 4.6% of the population identified 
themselves as indigenous. The Census classified as indigenous those groups identified by 
the Indigenous Peoples Law. These groups are: Alacalufe (0.4%), Atacameno (3.0%), 
Aymara (7.0%), Colla (0.5%), Mapuche (87.3%), Quechua (0.9%), Rapanui (0.7%), and 
Yamana (0.2%). 
According to the Chilean Indigenous Law 19.243, the institution in charge of indigenous peoples’ 
development is the National Corporation of Indigenous Peoples (CONADI). This organization has provided 
key input to the IPDP and will be closely consulted during the implementation of the plan through joint 
meetings, workshops, etc. In addition, the project will seek to improve dialogue with regional stakeholders 
and tertiary education students with indigenous background. 
During pre-appraisal the Bank preparation team met with the Minister for Planning – who is responsible for 
indigenous issues in Chile – and discussed the content of the IPDP. The Bank was commended for drafting 
the IPDP and incorporating specific actions targeted at indigenous peoples in the project design.  
On January 31, 2005 the IPDP (Spanish version) was posted on the web-site of the 
Ministry of Education with an invitation to provide comments to the plan.
