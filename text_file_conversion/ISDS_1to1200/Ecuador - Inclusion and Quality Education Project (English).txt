B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The projec
t’s long term development objective is to improve the quality of the education service 
provided by the Ministry of Education.  In order to achieve this, the project aims at strengthening 
MEC’s performance in tackling chronic system-wide human resource inefficiencies.  The project 
will support a comprehensive revision of the human resources management and the improvement 
of the pre-school or early childhood education level.    
 
The project specifically backs recommendations of the 2004, 
Third Nationwide “Educación 
Siglo XXI” Consultation
,
which emphasizes the access to quality education for all children, 
especially those from less fortunate backgrounds. The proposed project fits, therefore, the overall 
objective of the April 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ecuador that recommends a 
comprehensive financial assistance to reduce poverty, promote equitable economic growth, 
support human capital development and foster t
he
“integral reform of the education system to 
ensure quality and access.”

C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Two project components have been outlined in a draft proposal presented by the country and 
developed through extensive discussion with MEC staff during the identification mission, as well 
as a visit to the Bank by the Education Minister and other educational and financial leaders. The 
process has been further enhanced by an inter-institutional mission to Ecuador with IDB and 
CAF to refine the coordination strategy and refine the components of each project in order to 
align them in support of the overarching Bicentennial Plan. This coordination and alignment 
process will be deepened as the three projects move forward with the final objective of moving 
toward the core principles inherent in a SWAp. This has already begun through the joint World 
Bank/IDB Public Expenditure review and other pieces of analytical work moving towards 
harmonization, capacity development and country ownership.     
 
The first component, 
Rationalization and Strengthening of Human Resource Management
 
will address in a comprehensive fashion the main issues affecting the administration and 
management of human resources within the Ministry of Education. It would include a systematic 
analysis aimed at reviewing the teacher’s selection process, assignments and reassignments to 
provinces and municipalities, the teacher’s promotion system and the retirement procedures and 
regulations.     
 
It is estimated by MEC that at least twice as many teachers could be hired with the resources 
saved from a revision of the contracting, promotion and retirement procedures. More 
importantly, the project will include a carefully designed plan for the placement of new teachers 
in the areas most in need. In order to guarantee an integrated approach, the assignment of new 
teachers will be closely coordinated with the investments to be financed by CAF and IDB.     
 
The second component, 
Strengthening of the Non-Formal Early Childhood Education 
(ECE) Program,
 aims to upgrade MEC leadership as the normative and promoting agency of 
Initial Education in terms of coverage and quality of services provided to children aged 0-5 
years. Within the Bicentennial Program framework, the World Bank will support Initial 
Education as IDB and CAF will cover the other areas. Non-formal early childhood programs 
offer a low level of coverage (24 percent of the 0-5 age group) and are sponsored by a handful of 
ministries and other public agencies lacking shared objectives, quality standards and evaluation 
mechanisms.  
 
Three major institutions lead the national Early Childhood Education (ECE) efforts: the National 
Childhood and Family Institute (INNFA), the Ministry of Social Welfare (MSW), and the 
Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC). INNFA supports the Childhood Development 
Program (PDI), MSW sponsors the Operation Child Rescue (ORI), and MEC develops the 
National Childhood Education Program (PRONEPE). Poor coordination between the three leads 
to wastage and incomplete coverage. Services are provided through community-based childhood 
development centers. The programs finance equipment, furniture, didactic materials, training and 
technical assistance, as well as a stipend to mothers working in the centers. Resources are also 
assured for the purchase of food and supplies. A committee of community families selects the 
mothers who, after due training, take charge of the centers, caring for an average of twenty 
Page  3
children eight hours a day and five days a week. The community centers are also managed by 
NGOs and other local organizations.        
 
Because of the proved positive impact of early childhood education on reducing repetition, 
decreasing drop-outs rates and increasing achievement in primary education, the MEC plays a 
leadership role and is determined to continue supporting coverage and program-oriented 
programs in all participating ministries and agencies. A National Childhood Education Council 
was created, a core national curriculum agreed upon, and an ambitious goal proclaimed to reach 
universal 0-5 group coverage by 2015. A set of basic standards for the operation of each center is 
currently under discussion. All of the institutions and programs associated with early childhood 
development and education are now under the umbrella of the newly created Childhood 
Development Fund (FODI), a mechanism devised to offset financial constraints and 
administrative discontinuity. In this perspective, the project will support MEC’s capacity to: (i) 
increase non-formal Initial Education coverage by a percentage and in a modality or modalities 
to be agreed upon with MEC; (ii) promote the institutional coordination of ECE providers 
through seminars, workshops, incentives and publications; (iii) develop an institutional 
evaluation and accreditation system based on national curriculum and standards; (iv) train ECE 
human resources and provide didactic materials; and (v) carry out a social communication 
program to increase ECE awareness and participation. 
 
Relationship Between the Project and the Programmatic Human Development Loan-PHDL 
currently under Implementation.  
 
The proposed project complements and reinforces key actions currently implemented in the 
Programmatic Human Development Reform Loan-PHDL as priority interventions in the 
education sector. In particular, significant synergies between both products can be identified in 
various areas. The 
Rationalization and Strengthening of Human Resource Management 
Component will provide additional resources and institutional support to the ongoing efforts to 
strengthen MEC's effectiveness and efficiency in the management of the sector's human and 
financial resources, processes initiated under the PHDL. Similarly, the Programmatic Operation 
in the social sectors also calls for the design of a strategy to improve education in rural areas. 
The Project’s 
Non-Formal Early Childhood Education 
component will allow for extended, 
improved coverage of young children, hence facilitating their transition into the formal education 
system at age 6, and contributing to the above-mentioned objective.
