B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
At the global level, the Project will help the Hungarian Government to reduce trans boundary 
pollution into the Danube-Black Sea region, which represents the single most important body of 
water in Europe. The strategic importance of the region is increasing in the context of an 
enlarged Europe, and the development of new areas, which will further challenge the purification 
ability of the ecosys
tems. At the national level, the Project will support Hungary’s progress 
toward compliance with EU directives. At the regional level, the Project will help securing a 
safer environment for water intakes and recreation in the Hungarian part of the Danube and 
compare the effectiveness of wetlands and point source tertiary treatment. At the local level, the 
Project will permit water companies to test the latest technologies for abating pollution 
discharges into the environment. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
The Project (overall budget of 28.9 million US$, of which 8.9 million US$ would be financed by 
the GEF grant) is simple in design, with three focused components: (a) installation in the North-
Budapest wastewater treatment plant of tertiary treatment facilities to reduce nutrients in the 
effluents from the city of Budapest (26.7 million US$); (b) improvements in the trapping 
capacity of about 10.000 hectares of wetlands in the Gemenc and Beda-Karapancsa region, to 
further reduce nutrients in the Danube river (2.5 million US$); and (c) a project management, 
Page  2
replication and dissemination component, to support project implementation and promote further 
action on nutrient reduction in the basin (0.4 million US$). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The Project location entails the North-Budapest wastewater treatment plant of the city of 
Budapest for the first component and 10.000 hectares of wetlands in the Gemenc and Beda-
Karapancsa region. The precise location of the 10,000 hectares will be determined during Project 
preparation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Environment and the Danube-Drava National 
Park
.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The MOB completed the environmental assessment report for its component and got 
Government’s approval. The WA, on behalf of the DDNP, is working on the preparation of the 
required assessment for the DDNP component. As the process for its approval is rather 
bureaucratic in Hungary, the Project provides for late implementation for the DDNP component.  
Notification to other riparian countries has been made within the scope of the Danube 
Commission.  No land acquisition or resettlement will be necessary in any of the two Project 
components
.
The possible application of the Safeguard policy on Natural Habitats will be determined during 
project preparation, once the location of the 10,000 hectares is further known. In case it applies, 
assistance from specialized consultants will be sought to help the DDNP and the MOEW fulfill 
the requirements.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS 
would be prepared. 
 
Target Date for the QER meeting and for the PAD stage ISDS is on or around January 24, 2005. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
As indicated above, the MOB completed the environmental assessment report for its component 
and got Government’s approval. The WA, on behalf of the DDNP, is working on the preparation 
of the required assessment for the DDNP component. It is expected to be completed by 
December 15, 2004.
