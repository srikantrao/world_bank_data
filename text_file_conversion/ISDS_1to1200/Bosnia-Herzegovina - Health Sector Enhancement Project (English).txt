A.2. Project Objectives
The proposed project would enhance health system efficiency by expanding and enhancing the
family medicine model of primary health care, building management capacity in the sector and
strengthening the policy making process through the development and implementation of a system for
monitoring and evaluating sector performance and addressing inefficiencies of the sector.
The following indicators would be used to assess project performance: improved overall results
for non-communicable diseases; contained trend of growing expenditures for health care as a percentage of
GDP; and improved access to quality primary health care.
A.3. Project Description
The Project would integrate the policy work underway under the Social Insurance Technical
Assistance Project (SITAP) and would complement a conditionality framework to be supported through
the proposed Programmatic Development Policy Credit (PDPC). It would have three components:
(1) Family Medicine Scale Up. This component would aim at restructuring primary health care to
address important health issues such as the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and at
enabling development of an effective interface between outpatient care delivered through FM and
inpatient care. Building on the experience gained through demonstration sites for family medicine under
the BHP, the component would support: (i) implementation of training programs in family medicine for
doctors and nurses, including family medicine specialization and the Program for Additional Training,
(ii) training of faculty of the Family Medicine Cathedras in the universities, (iii) refurbishing and
equipping FM facilities, and (iv) communication activities to inform policy makers, providers and the
public about the reform. The curriculum for FM specialization and for the PAT will be adjusted to
address more deeply preventive services to allow FM teams to expand their scope of work. It would also
support expansion of the existing model of patients' registration and selection of primary care doctor, and
introduction of new performance-based payment mechanisms for PHC developed under the Basic Health
Project and SITAP to provide incentives for efficiency and consolidation at the provider level. To this
end, the project would strengthen capacities of the health insurance funds under component 2 to become
effective purchasers of health services.



The first three activities would expand on successful experiences under the Basic Health
Project, while ensuring that the institutional capacity within the universities is strengthened to ensure
sustainability of the training programs. The fourth activity would complement efforts under SITAP
where communications, community involvement, and customer perspectives activities are being
supported focusing on reforms of the social insurance systems. Communication activities under this
project would focus on PHC reforms and the interface between PHC and higher levels of care to:
(i) communicate the rationale and the substance of the FM reforms to providers and the public at large,
(ii) develop ways of assessing and benchmarking customer satisfaction, including through surveys of
customer and consumer expectations, and (iii) improving the knowledge of policy makers about the FM
principles
The component would finance civil works, technical assistance, surveys, medical and office
equipment, training materials, workshops, travel and incremental operating costs.
(2)    Professional Development and Improvement of Management Capacity. The overall aim of the
component would be to support ongoing efforts of professional development in the sector and build
capacities to implement essential changes in service delivery at different levels of the health system. It
seeks to build on development and implementation of health management training initiated under BHP.
The training and professional development programs would target: (i) hospital managers and board
members, and health centers' managers, (ii) change management training for FM teams, (iii) academic
degree training (masters and PhD programs) for faculty of health management, and (iv) development of
purchasing and contracting skills for staff of the health insurance funds to support the expansion of health
finance reforms to be piloted under SITAP and to be expanded under MTERG-PDPC. Details on the
scope of the training are presented in Annex 4.
The component would finance technical assistance, training, and incremental recurrent costs.
(3) Health Policy Formulation and Project Support. The overall aim of this component is to support
efforts to irnprove data collection and analysis, enable benchmarking and improve use of evidence for
priority setting and allocation of resources, and help modernize the role of the Public Health Institutes.
M&E efforts would support the data and study needs of MOHs to develop reports/information required
for policy and strategic purposes (e.g. benchmarking, MOHs' annual plans and preparation of national
health accounts) and institutionalization of M&E (including data collection, data validity and analysis)
through capacity building.  To this end, this component would support the development and
implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating sector performance and improving the
dialogue among governments, local stakeholders and external partners. The component would support:
(a) the definition of a list of sector wide indicators and the organization of surveys and studies on key
issues, (b) the preparation and organization of sector performance reviews, and (c) the organization of
"health sumnits" at which the results of the performance reviews would be discussed. The reviews
would be conducted during the first part of the year to ensure that recommendations from the "health
reviews" can be taken into account during the preparation of annual work programs and budgets for the
next year.
The component would also support health innovation funds, which would make available grants
that support: (i) NGOs and youth organizations to develop and implement initiatives such as HIV/AIDS
prevention and control, (ii) improvements in the continuum of care, and (iii) expansion of provider
payment reform tested under SITAP.
The component would finance technical assistance, surveys, studies, training, limited office
equipment, and recurrent costs.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:



The project envisages the nationwide scaling up of the Family Medicine model of primary health care
delivery. It would include the rehabilitation and remodeling of existing health centers and ambulantas and
would entail minor constructions such as remodeling, renovation and refitting of existing buildings, and
the provision of medical equipment for arnbulantas. Rehabilitation of facilities through remodeling and
refurbishing will not include major structural changes and, therefore, minor quantities of debris will be
generated. Nonetheless, these works will require proper handling of construction debris and safe
management of sharps (syringes, blades).  The Project Implementation Manual will guide the
implementing agencies on workers safety, dust and noise pollution, proper handling, transportation and
disposal of construction waste materials.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
The Project has been rated "C" as it does not raise concerns of major health or environmental impacts
since refurbishment is minimal and blood and urine samples are for minor outpatient diagnostics only.
Although an environmental assessment is not required, certain environmental issues need to be taken into
account during project implementation, and are summarized below. Other safeguards policies are not
applicable.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
The Family Medicine Scale-up Comnponent would include rehabilitation and remodeling of existing health
centers and ambulantas. These works will require proper handling of construction debris and safe
management of sharps (syringes, blades).
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final deternination of the parties'
claims on the disputed areas



Not applicable.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
This project will follow up on good measures practiced in Bosnia and Herzegovina for safe practice of safe
management of sharps (syringes and blades).
Rehabilitation of facilities through remodeling and refurbishing will not include major structural changes
and therefore minor quantities of debris will be generated. The Project Implementation Manual will guide
the implementing agencies on workers safety, dust and noise pollution, proper handling, transportation
and disposal of construction waste materials.
The Project Implementation Manual will have provisions for and guidance on the safeguards for
preventing health impacts from direct and indirect exposure of humans to health care waste during
implementation. The Bank will monitor that such provisions are in place in the bidding documents and
follow-up contracts.
Consultants to be engaged in the design of the refurbishing of facilities supplemented by advice from the
Bank team will advice on management of environmental risks, including risks arising from management
of environmental risks arising from reconstruction works, including appropriate disposal of construction
waste, and mitigating effects of noise and dust.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders with regard to safeguard issues are the Entity, Cantonal and Regional Ministries of
Health, the respective Project Implementation/Coordination Units, the management and staff of
participating health institutions, local municipalities and communities, patients and construction contractors
under the Project. Consultation and advice on health care waste issues will be built into management of
implementation of civil works and of management and staff training activities during project
implementation.
