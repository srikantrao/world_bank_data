                           The objective of the Trust Fund is to assist the Republic of Serbia in improving the organizational
                           and functional structures of its public administration system in accordance with the Strategy for
                           Public Administration Reform through:
                           • implemented rightsizing exercise in selected public administration sub systems,
                           • implemented change management and communication strategy.
                           C. Project Description
                           The EU is providing funds for the WB administered Trust Fund aimed to support second phase of the
                           reforms which will focus on restructuring and right sizing of the public sector. The Trust Fund is
                           divided into two components with interlinked activities: (i) functional reviews (Bank Executed); and
                           (ii) support to implementation, accompanied with change management and communication
                           (Recipient Executed).
                         Through the Bank Executed activities, the Bank will undertake a comprehensive functional review of
                         the central administration, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental
                         Protection. Additionally, it would cover specific sector ministries e.g. Health, Education and Social

                         Protection. It is intended to simplify administrative procedures, eliminate redundant tasks, and
                         eliminate or restructure departments with duplicate functions, without compromising service delivery
                         standards. It would also include changing the organizational structure, job definitions and staff levels
                         to ensure that the organizational and functional structure determine the staffing needs in the public
                         sector. The functional reviews will not necessarily be limited to staffing reduction, but also consider
                         other expenditure items and the mode of service delivery.

                         The Recipient-executed activities, for which the MPALSG will be responsible, will support the
                         Recipient's reforms and will also oversee EU visibility activities during the life of the project. This
                         part of the Trust Fund will support the project throughout its duration by developing a
                         comprehensive change management and communications strategy, a communication campaign for
                         internal and external audiences, and organizing workshops and seminars with senior managers of the
                         Recipients public administration, and public employees. This component will support, inter alia:
                         establishing a Change Management Support (CMS) team for the overall project, and task force teams
                         of Government representatives for each. Activities under the Recipient-executed activities are
                         expected to commence 45 days from the date of the Grant Agreement and expected to last about 24
                         months.

                         The CMS team will be responsible for promoting a participatory and collaborative process, as well as
                         genuine ownership of project outputs by the Recipient's authorities. Moreover, the CMS team will
                         facilitate the alignment of the project with the Public Administration Reform Strategy (PAR
                         Strategy) and Action plan, as well as with the Government Program for Optimization (rightsizing).

                         The CMS team will carry out, on behalf of the Recipient, the following activities:
                         (i)      Review of international best practices on communication and change management in public
                         sector reform and rightsizing/downsizing.

                         (iv)     Conducting workshops and seminars with senior management of the Recipient’s public

                         (v)      Conducting awareness raising workshops and other events to communicate planned support
                         mechanisms for staff affected by right-sizing exercise.
                         (vi)     Provide technical support to public administration bodies in the implementation of the
                         roadmaps (technical support in preparation/revision of relevant legislative pieces, preparation of
                         additional analytical materials necessary for implementation of particular recommendations/
                         measures, provision of support for implementation of recommendations related to Human Resource
                         Management (HRM) and Human Resource Development (HRD) aspects in particular PA
                         subsystems, assessment of the success of targeted subsystems of the PA system in implementing the
                         recommendations, etc.).

                         (vii)   Undertaking EU Visibility actions as needed, in collaboration with government counterparts.

                           This project has no environmental impact therefore no assesment of the borrower's institutional
                           capacities for safeguard policies is required.
