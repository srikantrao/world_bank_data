                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) of this small Recipient Executed Trust Fund
                           (RETF) is to assist the RS and FBiH in reducing selected non-communicable disease (NCD) risk
                           factors by promoting tobacco and alcohol control, and improving diet and physical activity in four
                           selected local communities.
                           C. Project Description
                           This project consists of only one component, which aims at reducing health risk behaviors in four
                           local communities through prevention and health promotion by:
                           a) strengthening the capacity of kindergarten and school teachers in promoting health behaviors
                           among children and youths;
                           b) strengthening capacity of employers to implement healthy lifestyle polices and related
                           promotional programs among the employees;
                           c) strengthening the capacity of local self-government units to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent
                           non-communicable disease risk factors among the population;
                           d) supporting advocacy and mass media campaigns for adoption and implementation of policy and
                           regulation documents for improving health behaviors; and
                           e) supporting social mobilization focused on behavioral changes.
                           These will be achieved through technical assistance, training, workshops, and operating costs.

                           The project activities are envisaged to be implemented through the two entity ministries in four
                           communities, two communities in each the FBIH and RS. Four communities where the RHRF
                           project will be implemented are selected in cooperation with relevant ministries taking into account
                           the size and population density of the community, the number of public and commercial entities in
                           the community, the existence of capacity to implement the project, and previously implemented
                           public health activities.
                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           There are no safeguards policies triggered, so there is no need to assess the institutional capacity of
                           the borrower to implement them. However, it is important to note that both Ministries have a long
                           track record of implementing World Bank financed projects and that a certain level of knowledge
                           and implementing of WB safeguards policies does exist.
