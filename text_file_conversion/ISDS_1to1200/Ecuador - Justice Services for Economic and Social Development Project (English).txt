B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The main objective of the proposed Justice Services for Economic and Social Development 
Project (the “Project”) is to improve the provision of services and access to justice in target areas 
critical to Ecuador’s development, including enhancing the overall “legal security” or 
predictability of judicial decisions.    
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The Project’s design will build on ESW and other Bank diagnostic work, lessons from 
previously approved projects, including on-going JSDF and IDF grants. It will also reflect 
collaboration with other donors, such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and civil 
society.  The Project seeks to define and narrow its scope to those areas with the greatest need 
for Bank assistance and those most likely to result in measurable impact for economic 
development.     
 
The following is a preliminary description of the Project’s components thus far:  
 
Page  2
(1)  
Justice Sector Management Component
:
Based on performance assessments of model 
systems piloted in various cities, the Project will assist the Judiciary in scaling-up the National 
Court Management System. This measure will ensure optimal court productivity while protecting 
due process guarantees. Furthermore, the component includes a thorough review of internal 
policies and procedures to identify opportunities for possible reorganization and redistribution of 
functions and responsibilities, and an overall process re-engineering. A major contribution of 
integrated management system will be the creation and maintenance of statistical information 
generated by judicial districts and specific court offices. This information would then be 
appropriately collected, analyzed, and disseminated. This component will also include the 
development of an IT plan and other management tools for the justice sector, court performance 
monitoring and evaluation indicators, and the preparation of user profiles.   
 
(2)  
Human Resources Management Component
:
The Project will assist the Judicial Council 
and the Judiciary to recruit and retain quality personnel and provide them with appropriate 
professional development, including the application of such modern human resource concepts as 
planning, performance, and the successful use of incentives. This component will also strengthen 
the justice sectors ability to enhance its capacity in the areas of budget preparation and 
expenditure management. Additionally, this component will also include support for the newly 
established Judicial Training Unit to be able to develop a focus different from traditional judicial 
education programs to include modern training techniques. The Training Unit would also include 
a
focus on training judges on oral proceedings, and it would coordinate with other entities to 
address the training of lawyers and court personnel in these proceedings. Local realities and the 
preferences of judges and court staff will be taken into account through participatory 
consultations, and economic and social issues will be given preference over traditional legal 
topics. The possibility of outsourcing training services will be considered as will partnerships 
with public and private universities and law schools. Finally, to address  issues of accountability 
and integrity, the Project will include both internal and external interventions to strengthen the 
capacity of the Judiciary to sanction cases of corruption by ensuring that internal disciplinary 
bodies are equipped with effective investigative tools, as well as establish coordination 
mechanisms with civil society, including the Citizens Anti-Corruption Commission (
Comisión 
de Control Cívico de la Corrupción
). 
 
(3) 
Economic Development Component
:
This component will focus on strengthening the 
capacity of the Judiciary, the Judicial Council and the practicing Bar  to conduct complex cases 
relevant to economic development. It is expected that “legal security” and the predictability of 
judicial performance will be beneficial for foreign and domestic investment The Project will 
target selected administrative, fiscal, labor and civil courts’ and their users in  the processing 
complex cases, including such market-oriented laws as intellectual property, antitrust, insolvency 
and bankruptcy, consumer protection, and environmental degradation. Due to varying levels of 
preparedness in terms of experience with prior reforms and priorities of local judicial staff and 
users, this component will likely be structured as a “menu” of potential investments. The Project 
will use annual work programs to  determine the amount and sequencing of such investments, 
which may include minor infrastructure (rehabilitation of common service areas) and computer 
equipment (hardware and software for the operation of networks and workstations).

Social 
Inclusion 
Component
:
In order to meet the particular needs of poor families, 
youth and marginalized groups in Ecuador, the Project will seek to address the obstacles these 
groups face in accessing justice services. This includes support to the courts which deal with the 
types of cases which often affect poor families, such as tenancy disputes, community conflicts, 
consumer protection, and ensuring operational small claims and family courts.  These activities 
will take into account existing grant activities financed under a JSDF and PROPEDINE II's 
progress in the area of indigenous justice systems. In addition to improving the quantity and 
quality of justice services available, the Project will support making basic information about the 
functioning of the sector and its diverse institutions available to the public so as to enhance 
transparency, better inform citizens, and provide opportunities for public participation in the 
overall reform of the justice sector.
