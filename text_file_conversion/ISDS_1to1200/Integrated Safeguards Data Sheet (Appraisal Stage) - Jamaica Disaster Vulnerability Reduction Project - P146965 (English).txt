2. Project Development Objective(s)
The Project Development Objective is to enhance Jamaica's resilience to disaster and climate risk.
3. Project Description
The operation has been designed in a participatory manner, through consultations with multiple
government agencies, local governments, and other partners. A prioritization process was performed
Page 1 of 8


﻿during the project preparation stage to define Project components and activities. This prioritization
was done on the basis of relevant previous technical studies and a set of selection criteria, including:
traffic volume, structural integrity, and socio-economic impact (for national bridges interventions);
number of buildings impacted by flooding, number of persons indirectly impacted by flooding, and
O
severity of flooding (for urban drainage activities); hazard profile, vulnerability, environmental
significance, readiness for implementation, and level of intervention received (for coastal
management sub-projects); and facility vulnerability, and population vulnerability (for critical
facilities -schools and fire stations). The proposed Project will finance four components, which will
be implemented over a period of six years. Complementary activities will be carried out through
grant financing that will leverage the Loan. These activities are related to i) disaster risk financing
and insurance; ii) disaster response and recovery; iii) safer schools; and iv) risk reduction.
Component 1: Technical Assistance for Improved Disaster and Climate Resilience (~US $4.5M).
This includes improving the generation and collection of targeted hazard and risk information, its
analysis and use in monitoring systems and decision making. In order to improve the ability of
government officials to generate and use hazard and risk information for decision-making and policy
development, this component will finance the following activities : (i) equipment and facilities to
strengthen the seismic monitoring network; (ii) the establishment of a National Risk Information
Platform and Coastal Risk Atlas; (iii) multi-hazard risk assessments for coastal areas, including
ecosystems-based analyses and microzonation studies; (iv) a training program to support the
implementation of the National Building Code.
Component 2: Risk Reduction (~US $23M). This includes the retrofitting or constructing key assets
given that the infrastructure sector is one of the most severely impacted after a major disaster event.
To reduce Jamaica's physical vulnerability to adverse natural events, this component will finance
structural mitigation measures. The sub-components and activities to be financed under this
component are: (i) retrofit/construction of national and sub-national priority infrastructure (bridges
and urban drainage); (ii) retrofit/construction of critical public facilities (schools and fire stations);
and (iii) coastal protection measures.
o
Component 3: Contingent Emergency Response (~USD $OM). The proposed operation will include a
contingent 'zero component', which in the event of a disaster caused by a natural hazard would
enable the government to quickly reallocate project funds to disaster response and recovery purposes
a         under streamlined procedures . This Contingent Emergency Response Component (CERC) will
support Jamaica's emergency preparedness and response capacity to the impact of natural hazards,
including financing of post-disaster critical emergency goods or emergency recovery and associated
services, as well as targeted provision of post-disaster Social Safety Net (SSN) support to affected
households and individuals. Following an adverse natural event, the Government's declaration of
disaster in accordance with national law, and subject to the Bank's activation policy, the contingent
component would be triggered.
Component 4: Project Administration (~US $2. 5M). This component will finance costs associated
with program management, including project-related audits, monitoring, mid-term review and end-
of-project impact evaluation, equipment and training to strengthen the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU), as well as individual consultants and operating costs. This component will also finance
workshops to promote public awareness raising relating to climate and disaster risk management.
Likewise, this component will finance the core professional and technical staff for project
management, including a Program Manager, Supervision Engineers and specialists in the areas of
climate and disaster resilience, safeguards compliance, finance, procurement and related project
Page 2 of 8


﻿management areas. Core staff will be recruited on time-bound basis.
4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Preliminary project typologies were assessed during project preparation. The types and
characteristics of project works under consideration have been prioritized to encompass the repair/
construction and rehabilitation of critical facilities (schools and fire stations) and priority
infrastructure (bridges and urban drainage), upgrading of seismic monitoring network, and
construction or improvement of sea defense structures to protect human settlement. Buildings and
bridge projects typically would entail relatively minor construction works with limited potential
environmental impacts during construction, which can be mitigated with standard methods. Seismic
sub-projects will utilize existing sites and access for upgrades, and so will have minimal
environmental footprints. Coastal works will require comprehensive feasibility studies and
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) to properly design and develop the appropriate mitigation
measures. Since the specifics of program activities and projects were not fully identified at the time
of appraisal, an Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been prepared to provide
standardized mitigation measures for the simpler projects, as well as guidelines for conducting EIAs
for the more complex sub-projects.

6. Safeguard Policies   Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental           Yes          The project team proposes an environmental classification
Assessment OP/BP 4.01                of B as per OP/BP 4.01. The borrower has adapted and
strengthened its existing Environmental Management
Framework (EMF) as the environmental safeguards
instrument, since the specifics of program activities and
projects are not fully identified at appraisal. The draft
EMF includes a preliminary program-wide impacts
assessment of the sub-projects under Components 1 and 2,
which are expected to be chiefly small works with
relatively minor environmental impacts that can be readily
mitigated with standard construction environmental
mitigation and monitoring procedures. The draft EMF
also provides procedures for the application of Bank
safeguards including information on subproject screening
and categorization, and additional assessment studies as
necessary for subprojects such as Environmental Impact
Assessments (EIAs) for complex projects (e.g. coastal
defense works) as necessary, and includes a section with
clear safeguard guidelines for emergency investments and
works, including types of activities as well as
responsibilities for screening, for environmental
management, and for preparation of any safeguard studies
prior to works (as pertinent under Special Considerations
under OP 10.00 and consistent with the project category)
Page 3 of 8


﻿that may be considered under the Component 3.
Natural Habitats OP/BP   Yes           The Project is not planning to carry out works in natural
4.04                                  habitats, however, the policy is triggered as a precaution
given that some civil works (e.g. bridges, river or coastal
defenses) may involve relatively large-scale works or
could affect riparian zones, coastal zones, or other
sensitive habitat.
Forests OP/BP 4.36       No            There are no works that aim to bring about changes in the
management, protection, or utilization of forests, nor are
there any projects considered for harvesting or converting
forest resources.
Pest Management OP 4.09 No             There are no works such as greenhouses, crop
management, or others likely to involve the use of
pesticides and herbicides. Standard measures will be
specified for incidental use of pesticides (e.g. termite
treatments for buildings, or safe use of pesticides for
vector control) and will be built into a generic
standardized EMP. As an additional precaution, the EMF
also references a Pest Management Plan already in use by
the JSIF.
Physical Cultural        Yes           The Project is unlikely to impact physical cultural
Resources OP/BP 4.11                  resources, but given the possibility of affecting historic
buildings or encountering artifacts during excavation or
clearing, this policy has been triggered as a precaution,
and a "chance-find" procedure has been included in the
EMF.
Indigenous Peoples OP/   No           Although there are cultural minorities (such as Maroons,
BP 4.10                                Rastafarian and other groups) in Jamaica, there are no
groups that could be considered indigenous people as
defined in OP 4.10.
Involuntary Resettlement Yes           Because the project will finance the construction of civil
OP/BP 4.12                             works there is the possibility that land acquisition or
resettlement will be necessary. Therefore, the World
Bank's Policy on involuntary resettlement (OP/BP 4.12)
is triggered. During project preparation a comprehensive
screening process was applied to the sub-projects
identified, which determined that there would be no
permanent land acquisition or resettlement impacts
resulting from the current sub-project designs. However,
it is possible that temporary land acquisition will be
necessary during implementation. Also, the project may
finance civil works under the Contingency Emergency
Response Component that could result in land acquisition
or resettlement. Because of the likely temporary nature of
the impacts, or the possibility that they will result from
activities that will be defined during implementation as
Page 4 of 8


﻿part of the CERC, it was not possible to identify sub-
project land acquisition or resettlement requirements
during project preparation. Therefore, a Resettlement
Policy Framework will be used in lieu of site-specific
resettlement plans. To this end, the Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Policy Framework currently used by JSIF
for the other World Bank financed projects was updated
to include possible impacts that might result from the
Jamaica DVRP.
Although technical assistance activities financed under
component 1 will not have direct resettlement impacts, it
will be important to determine whether or not these
activities could result in downstream resettlement impacts
in the future. Therefore, the task team will ensure that
terms of reference and deliverables for the preparation of
the studies under this component will be consistent with
the requirements of OP 4.12
Safety of Dams OP/BP     No           There are no projects under consideration that involve
4.37                                  improvements, rehabilitation, or construction of dams.
Projects on International  No         There are no projects under consideration that involve
Waterways OP/BP 7.50                  international waterways.
Projects in Disputed     No           There are no projects under consideration that involve
Areas OP/BP 7.60                      disputed areas.
II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Works at buildings and monitoring stations should involve minimal environmental impacts, and
present few safeguards issues. Bridges and coastal works are more complex and will require
detailed mitigation measures to be developed, including rigorous traffic safety and sediment
control plans for the bridge works and comprehensive EIAs for the coastal defense works. All
impacts can be mitigated or minimized to avoid any large scale, significant and/or irreversible
impacts, for which reason the team proposes a Category B for the project.
In terms of resettlement, the project will not involve any large-scale impacts, but will more than
likely only result in small-scale temporary impacts.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
in the project area:
Environmental conditions in coastal areas may benefit over the long term from studies and
projects undertaken through the DVRP, particularly as regards erosion control. Efforts will be
made to incorporate soft works for coastal projects (e.g. reef restoration, beach nourishment),
which could have long-term positive effects on communities and their environment.
In terms of resettlement, it is unlikely that future unanticipated activities (e.g. under the CERC)
Page 5 of 8


﻿will result in long term or significant impacts.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts.
Feasibility studies associated with the more complex works (e.g. coastal defenses) will include
screening and evaluation of alternatives as part of the EIAs to be prepared for each project.
O
A number of alternative urban drainage sub-projects were considered for inclusion, but were
ultimately excluded due to the significant resettlement impacts they would have caused.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
During project preparation, the JSIF has updated the EMF for the specific projects and activities to
be undertaken under the DVRP. The revised EMF has been disclosed to the public on the
government's website and delivered to community groups, agencies and ministries for comment.
The JSIF has made continuous improvements in the EMF as part of ISO 14001 recertification, and
increased the JSIF's capabilities in environmental management include staffing of a full-time
Environmental Manager whose duties involve program management, staff development and
training in environmental matters. Supervision for environmental compliance would be managed
by the JSIF in close coordination with the relevant Ministries and agencies. As with other World
Bank projects, the JSIF would be responsible for ensuring environmental compliance in
accordance with procedures detailed in the Project's OM and would be responsible for including
these requirements in associated works contracts.
During project preparation a comprehensive screening process was applied to the sub-projects
identified, which determined that there would be no permanent land acquisition or resettlement
impacts resulting from the current sub-project designs. Because it was not possible to identify sub-
project land acquisition or resettlement requirements during project preparation a Resettlement
Policy Framework will be used in lieu of site-specific resettlement plans. To this end, the Land
Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework currently used by the JSIF for the other World
Bank financed projects was updated to include possible impacts that might result from the DVRP.
During the World Bank financed Inner Cities Basic Services for the Poor project, the JSIF
developed significant capacity in the application of the World Bank's Operational Policy on
Involuntary Resettlement having successfully implemented the land acquisition and policy
framework, and prepared three abbreviated resettlement plans that were acceptable to the World
Bank.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key individuals and agencies have been consulted during preparation of the EMF, which has been
disclosed to the public on the government's website and delivered to community groups, agencies
and ministries for comment. The final EMF includes record of these consultations. Extensive
public consultations would be conducted as part of the EIA process for complex projects (e.g.
coastal defense works).
The Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework being used for this project was
developed to ensure that all persons potentially affected by involuntary land acquisition have a
voice in the consultations, and that they agree on the mitigation measures if land acquisition is
found to be unavoidable, it is important that the consultation arrangements during the community
based project preparation process are: (1) transparent and inclusive, so that people are made aware
Page 6 of 8


﻿of their options, and that those potentially affected by land acquisition are included in the
consultations, (2) held in a location accessible to all interested community members, and (3) that
community members and particularly those potentially affected by land acquisition are informed
of the purpose, time and venue well in advance. This is achieved through a multi-stage process,
O
which culminates in presenting an Abbreviated Resettlement Plan in a community consultation to
obtain endorsement from PAPs and community.
