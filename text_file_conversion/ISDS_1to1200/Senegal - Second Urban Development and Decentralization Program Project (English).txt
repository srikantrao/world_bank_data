B.  Project Objectives  
 
The program’s development objectives are: (a) to strengthen the financial and organizational management 
of municipalities; and (b) to increase the provision of infrastructure and services in urban areas. 
 
C.  Project Description 
 
The project would have two main components: (i) capacity building; and (ii) investment programs. 
 
Component 1: Capacity building
.
This component would be carried out along two tracks: (a) Municipal 
contracts: implementation of a Municipal Adjustment Program (PAM); and (b) cross-cutting measures 
outside of the municipal contracts. 
Sub-component A
:
The activities would be identified during the updating exercise of the financial and 
organizational audits and would be targeted to specific adjustment or improvement measures along the 
main clusters of (a) mobilization of local resources, (b) staffing and training, (c) management of assets. 
Sub-component B
:
The activities will include: (i) consolidation and generalization of street addressing; (ii) 
development of fiscal registers in municipalities which have been addressed based on the model of Thiès 
and Kaolack; (iii) follow-up implementation of tax collection software (Colloc and Commair); (iv) 
support to the management of revenue-earning facilities; (v) Urban data bank; (vi) Urban Atlas based on 
the cartographic information of urban audits; (vii) Municipal financial ratio manual (guide des ratios 
financiers); (viii) study on Dakar and its metropolitan area. 
 
Component 2: Investment programs
.
This component would be carried out along two tracks: 
 
(a) 
Municipal contracts - implementation of Priority Investment Program (PIP) and Priority 
Maintenance Program (PEP).  The PIP will include a wide range of investment categories and will favor 
Page  2
rehabilitation rather than new investments.  A catalogue of investments will be redefined during project 
preparation and will include social, administrative and economic infrastructure.  A new project data sheet 
will also be produced to strengthen the eligibility criteria with a special attention to site availability and 
management arrangements. 
 
(b) 
Larger scale investments in the Dakar metropolitan area to take into account the inter-
municipality needs.  Dakar is obviously the greatest challenge in Senegal and there is a need to look at 
investments needs at the metropolitan level and consolidate funding for subprojects which have a larger 
impact than their immediate surroundings.  A preliminary mission was conducted by the French 
Development Agency (AFD) in November 2004 in order to identify these potential investments as part of 
the updating exercise of the urban audits of the 5 major cities of the metropolitan area of Dakar. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Municipalities of Senegal (67) 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
 
The Borrower has successfully completed the Urban Development and Decentralization Program I 
(closed on December 31, 2004) which included investments in all 67 targeted municipalities.  There was 
no major issues with respect to safeguard policies.  Specific project datasheets for each sub-project 
includes criteria for environmental and social impact.  These project datasheets will be further improved 
during the preparation of the proposed UDDP II.

Environmental Assessment
(

/
BP
4.01) 
The project is categorized B and no major investments with potential negative impact are 
planned.  The Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) safeguard policy is being 
triggered by the project due to potential construction, which may have temporary 
environmental or social impacts.  Provisions will be made in the Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF) to mitigate these impacts.

Involuntary Resettlement
(
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
This safeguard policy is being triggered by the project due to potential construction, which 
may have temporary environmental or social impacts.  Provisions will be made in the 
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to mitigate these impacts.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS would 
be prepared: QER review scheduled for April 6, 2005. 
 
B.  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage ISDS.  
Not applicable 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  The 
specific studies and their timing

should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS. 
 
The terms of reference for the ESMF and RPF have already been finalized and consultations were 
launched in January 2005.  Final reports are expected to be available by April 15, 2005.  The ESMF and 
RPF will be disclosed by the Borrower in country and at the Bank’s InfoShop on/about May 27, 2005 
before project appraisal  In the project areas, it is very probable that planned civil works may lead to loss 
of land, incomes, assets, access to sources of livelihood etc. either temporarily or permanently.  To this 
end, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be prepared.  During project implementation, 
Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared by the Borrower and the individual RAPs will be 
reviewed and approved by ASPEN, then disclosed by the Borrower in the country at appropriate and 
accessible locations and by the Bank on behalf of the Borrower to the InfoShop before commencement of 
civil works using guidelines provided in the RPF.  These safeguard instruments (i.e. EIA, ESMF, RPF) 
will be prepared in accordance to national environmental policies, and the World Bank environmental and 
social guidelines and safeguard policies. On completion and approval by ASPEN, these instruments will 
be disclosed in country and at the Bank’s Infoshop.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard-related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (ii) in-country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
