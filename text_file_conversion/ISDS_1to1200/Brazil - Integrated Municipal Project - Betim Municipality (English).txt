Component I: Municipal Policies and Institutional Capacity Strengthening  
Component I will focus on strengthening policies, finance and management capacities of the Betim 
Municipality in key thematic areas.  
 
1.
 Governance and planning.
 The project includes assistance in updating and implementing the long-term 
Municipal Strategic Development Plan. The project will help Betim apply state-of-the-art approaches, 
including: policy analysis of options and cost implications, proposals for alternative development goals 
related to fiscal performance, methodologies for stakeholder impact evaluation and consensus building, 
indicators and evaluation criteria for impact of policy actions, and detailed monitoring of financial 
performance using methodologies developed during project preparation. The plan will be drawn up in a 
participatory framework, with consultation of stakeholders including representatives of those without a 
voice, like children, the elderly, and the destitute. Specifically, the project will help update the Urban 
Master Plan and review major institutional, financial, and territorial planning issues to be discussed in the 
context of the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. Specific policy papers will be prepared to assist policy 
makers on the options and implications of alternative scenarios. They include specific analysis on public 
expenditure reviews; selected fiscal and financial management issues; property tax policy and land 
regulation; cadastre and tax collection; territorial management and economic instruments for environmental 
management; policies to address regularization of illegal settlements; cost-effective programs to foster 
access to land and basic services; social development, including monitoring of SUS cadastre and 
applications for broader policy formulation; environmental management, including scope for economic 
instruments and payment for environmental services; consensus building for policy making; studies related 
to improved transparency; accountability; and information-sharing mechanisms in selected areas of 
municipal government. 
 
2.
 Local services
: The project will help strengthen municipal policies, regulation, and management capacity 
for a broad set of local basic services. To reach this objective, the project will undertake  
a. 
An assessment of policies and management capacity: 
Policy, regulation and management arrangements 
will be assessed to assist Betim in establishing an appropriate institutional and legal framework for efficient 
delivery of local services. This assessment will clarify the constitutional division of responsibility for local 
service delivery between central and sub-national governments; discuss the metropolitan region’s impact 
on local services; foster dialogue on improving efficiency with surrounding municipalities; identify 
alternative delivery models; and measure efficiency of current service delivery models and their associated 
costs, subsidies, and tariffs.  
Page  4
 
 
b. 
An information system for institutional and public control.
 This system will help strengthen the 
Municipality’s capacity to fulfill regulatory responsibility for local service provision and will enhance 
governance by giving public access to information on expected and achieved quality of local services. To 
develop this system the project will assess current quality of services, determine their contractually required 
quality, promote user consultations, and establish service benchmarks.  
c.
 A basic infrastructure cadastre
. A cadastre of basic infrastructure will complement the existing 
municipal geographically referenced management database. The additional information, mainly on macro 
and micro drainage, will be used in developing a drainage management plan. This plan is in turn a key 
element of the Urban Master Plan and the Environmental Management Plan. 
 
3.
 Environmental Management. 
The project will strengthen the Municipal Secretariat of Environment’s 
institutional and technical capacity through:  
a. 
Environmental policies, regulation, and management
. A Municipal Environmental Management Plan 
will be developed in line with the Municipal Strategic Development Plan, addressing issues such as policy 
instruments; financing mechanisms; administrative procedures; an environmental database; transparency 
and public participation; and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. In addition, this activity will aim to 
strengthen the Secretariat of Environment’s technical capacity to execute its licensing mandate. 
b. 
Water resources management and water quality monitoring
. The project will help Betim strengthen 
Minas Gerais’ water resources policies and institutional system through the Paraopeba River Basin 
Committee, which is responsible for monitoring and enforcing water quality standards for the Betim River. 
The project will complement the Committee’s technical capacity through specific assistance to update its 
geologic and geo-technical database; expand its cadastre of water users and pollution discharge; develop 
decision models for water withdrawal and discharge, and map land use and aptitude. This system will be 
the basis for project tools to monitor water quality.  
c. 
Environmental Education Program
: An environmental education program will be developed and 
implemented to increase the population’s awareness of local environmental vulnerabilities and of measures 
to safeguard that environment.  
 
Component II: Social Inclusion  
Component II will finance short- and long-term initiatives to improve living conditions for poor and 
vulnerable families. It will also strengthen municipal social policies and programs. It will 
1. 
Resettle families living in risk-prone areas
. A comprehensive resettlement program aims to improve the 
living conditions of 820 poor families now living on floodplains. The program provides for a socially sound 
compensatory policy; resettlement in nearby housing with basic infrastructure in an established community; 
legal and social assistance during the resettlement process; and support for income generation. Annex 11 
summarizes the resettlement program.   
2.
 Strengthen municipal social policies and programs
. The project will strengthen 
SEMAS’s policies and programs by evaluating the impact of its municipal social 
assistance programs on the poor. It will also evaluate the federal social safety net 
programs that make cash transfers to reduce poverty in Betim (
Bolsa Familia
). 
Specifically, it will evaluate their targeting criteria, gaps in coverage, duplication with 
municipal cash transfer programs, allocation transparency and consistency, local 
management, and database efficiency. 
 
Component III: Municipal Infrastructure and Urban Environmental Rehabilitation 
Component III will invest in environmental improvement of the Betim River basin by  
1. Expanding basic infrastructure, including one 500 l/s sewage treatment plant; 7,500 sewerage 
connections; 15 km of macro-drainage; 18 km of secondary roads improvements; 5 open-air flood 
regularization basins.  
2. Protecting water resources and riparian ecosystems by creating three urban parks 
(totaling 30 ha), most of which run parallel to city watercourses, and restoring riparian 
vegetation along all creeks within the project area. 
Page  5
 
 
Component IV: Project Management
  
Component IV will establish a project management unit (PMU) responsible for managing 
and monitoring project implementation and providing for civil works supervision and 
project auditing.   
 
 
A.4. 
Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: The project is located within the Betim River Basin, part of the larger Paraopeba 
Watershed, in the Municipality of Betim, State of Minas Gerais. The city is home to 
about 300,000 persons. The project interventions directly target Betim River tributaries, 
through the following actions: collection of sewerage, drainage improvements, 
resettlement of families living in the river floodplain, urban parks creation and 
enhancement, riparian vegetation restoration, construction of open-air flood regulation 
basins.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. 
Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed 
project. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or 
irreversible impacts. 
The project aims to support and assist the municipality in achieving 
sustainable socio-environmental local development, reduce poverty, improve urban 
environmental conditions, and enhance quality of life for city residents. In order to minimize 
environmental impact associated with the project, a comprehensive Environmental Assessment 
has been carried out in accordance with Bank Safeguard Policies. A summary of this documents 
is presented in Annex 10. The EA evaluates the existing conditions, identifies the potential direct 
and indirect environmental impacts and proposes adequate mitigation measures for each negative 
impact identified, as well measures for enhancing each identified positive impact. The mitigation 
and enhancement measures are summarized in the Environmental Management Plan, including 
associated costs, responsibilities and schedule for all activities (including Dam Safety-related 
measures). A public consultation has being carried out supported by appropriate documentation 
allowing for a meaningful community decision making process.  
 
As part of the project objectives and design, the project has a strong environmental emphasis, including 
strengthening the environmental institutional capacity of the municipal environmental secretariat, including 
the capacity of the regional river basin committee. Moreover, the project will undertake a review and 
update of all existing municipal environmental policies and regulations so as to significantly improve 
municipal capacity to respond to Betim’s environmental needs. Through the development of an updated 
and comprehensive environmental management plan associated with the municipal master plan, the project 
will improve and enhance natural resources management. The project investments will also strongly reduce 
and mitigate social and environmental vulnerabilities, including natural disasters such as flooding. It will 
also protect public health of local residents and the environment by expanding collection of sewerage, 
separating storm and wastewater, and treating wastewater. Additionally, the project includes a number of 
compensatory environmental measures such as the creation of 30 ha or urban parks, and restoration of 
riparian vegetation along the length of creeks affected by the project. 
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.  
The EA found the range of potential environmental impacts (positive or negative) relate primarily 
to water quality, flood control and drainage, biodiversity, environmental management and 
strategic planning. On balance, the proposed project is expected to be highly positive from an 
environmental standpoint. It would improve environmental quality of the urban wetlands and
 
water-courses of the Betim River Basin through the implementation of sewage collection and 
treatment, resettlement of flood-prone settlements, creek restoration and urban parks 
development, improvements in water quality related to industrial pollution through improvements 
in regulation, licensing
, 
and monitoring, and through promoting the integration of
 
environmental 
concerns in long-term municipal development planning. Additionally, project-supported training 
activities targeting regulators, planners and decision-makers, as well as stakeholders would 
induce a series of behavioral changes among urban residents, which would be expected to be 
environmentally positive. 
 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
The borrower carried out an environmental assessment and a resettlement plan in accordance to the Banks 
safeguard policies. 
Page  7
 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has carried out an EA and a RAP in accordance with the Bank’s safeguard 
policies. These studies were conducted by consultants contracted by the Municipality. 
The EA includes assessments of, and measures for, all relevant environmental safeguards 
including Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01), Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Dam 
Safety (OP 4.37).   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.  
During the project preparation, consultation events were carried out with the main stakeholders including 
NGOs, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), representatives from Betim’s medium and large 
industries, and the population to be resettled. Results of the EA was presented to the population to be 
resettled and to broader  public audiences, as well.  Additionally, the RAP was consulted with the affected 
parties.
