I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The basic development objective of the SILEM program (APL) is to strengthen the capacity of rural
communities to undertake an integrated management of their ecosystems, so as to help reduce, mitigate
and reverse to some extent the degradation of their natural resource base, and thereby alleviate, in a
sustainable manner, poverty and vulnerability.

The specific global environment objectives of the SILEM program are to contribute to the goals of the
international conventions for: combating desertification, promoting bio-diversity, mitigating climate
change, and protecting international waters. In particular, the Program will generate multiple and
interconnected global environmental benefits such as: (a) build capacity for sound and sustainable
integrated ecosystem management planning and implementation at local, regional and national level; (b)
reduce, stop and reverse land degradation and desertification with adequate and innovative soil and
water management technologies in lowlands as a means for improving the productivity and sustainability
of plant and animal production systems, and for protecting natural habitats of local and global
importance; and (c) strengthen the natural resource base and decrease vulnerability to climate change
(drought and other stress factors) by better conserving and maintaining (agro-) biodiversity at ecosystem,
species and genetic level.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The SILEM Program is designed to provide supplemental GEF support to the IDA-funded
Community-Based Rural Development Project (CBRDP) which became effective in December 2001.
CBRDP is funded by an IDA APL, and is expected to be implemented in all 45 provinces of Burkina Faso
over a 15-year period, consisting of three 5-year phases. SILEM is also designed as a GEF APL to
supplement each one of the three phases of CBRDP APL during fifteen years.

In the first phase (2001-2006), CBRDP plans to intervene in 26 provinces with an ambitious target of
2,000 villages. SILEM plans to intervene in the first phase (2003-2006) in only 100 of such villages to
initiate and demonstrate integrated ecosystem management (IEM) activities. In the second phase
(2006-2010), CBRDP will intervene in an additional 2,000 villages with SILEM intervening in 200 of such
villages. The overall national CDD program of Burkina Faso (PNDRD) funded by several donors is
expected to cover all the 8,000 villages in Burkina Faso by the year 2010. SILEM plans to intervene by
the end of its third phase in a total of no more than 600 PNDRD villages to initiate, consolidate and
confirm IEM demonstration activities.

    Project Components

    The baseline project (CBRDP) has the following five components: (1) local capacity building; (2) local
    investment fund; (3) Institutional capacity building, (4) land tenure security pilot, and (5) program
    coordination. SILEM will provide incremental support for environmental and natural resource
    management related activities under each of these five components as described below (right-hand

          Implementation Manual.

A baseline study is underway to provide a census and characterization of lowlands. It provides a GIS database
for all lowland ecosystems across the country, and other potential intervention zones. The information in the
database will be further improved during the first year of implementation to insure that it contains all necessary
information needed to undertake adequately the monitoring and evaluation of the project as described above.
Specific benchmarks and milestones will be set to guide the M&E exercise.

Institutional and implementation arrangements:

SILEM will support the overall national CDD program (PNDRD, including CBRDP) with respect to decentralized
integrated ecosystem management capacity building. The PNDRP is coordinated by the national forum put in
place to evaluate and harmonize experiences and approaches to decentralized rural development in Burkina
Faso (the Cadre National de Coordination et de Concertation du Développement Rural Décentralisé). At the
regional level, there will be gradual transfer of PNDRP coordination responsibilities from the national forum to the
regional directorates for studies and planning (DREP). At the provincial level, the donors coordination and best
practices gathering responsibilities will be carried out by the provincial PNDRD coordination entities entitled:
Cadre de Concertation Technique Provincial (CCTP).

A project Steering Committee has been established to guide the implementation of CBRDP, to review and
approve its annual work program and budget. The same Steering Committee will guide the implementation of
SILEM. The national environment management agency (CONAGESE) will be represented within the Steering
Committee. The work programs, budgets and procurement plans of both projects will be blended and submitted
to IDA after approval by the Steering Committee. Day-to-day management of CBRDP and SILEM will rest with
(i) a national coordination unit (Coordination Nationale du Projet, PCU) and (ii) operational units at the provincial
level. The day-to-day screening of sub-projects for compliance with safeguards requirements will be handled
within the PCU by a certified national safeguards unit (the ESMP will provide more details). CONAGESE will,
based on PCU requests, appoint and host as necessary scientific or steering committees to guide project
implementation, to conduct the external evaluation of the SILEM project and to coordinate the strategic
collaboration framework between SILEM and other NRM/Environment projects.

         I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
         characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
         critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The Program will primarily support an integrated approach towards the rehabilitation of degraded lowland
ecosystems for Burkina Faso Sahel desert margin northern provinces Soum, Oudalan, Seno, Yatenga, Loroum
and Bam covering 36 829 sq km (13,4% of the country) and 662,129 inhabitants. However, the Program will also
be implemented and replicated in other provinces of Burkina Faso wherever land degradation and desertification
appear to be major threats from the viewpoint of rural communities.

An inventory of major lowlands across the Sahel and across the rest of the country has been carried out during
project preparation. A GIS data base is being developed using the result of the inventory and of field surveys
carried out to assess the ecological and economic characteristics and potentials of the lowlands. Six hundreds
(600) village lowlands with greatest potential local and global benefits will be selected as intervention sites of the
Program for fifteen years of implementation. One hundred (100) sites will be covered during the first phase
(2003-2006), followed by 200 sites during the second phase (2007-2011) and 300 sites during the third phase
(2012-2017).

The Program will give priority to lowlands and related micro-basins and watersheds of rural communities living
around natural habitats of global importance (150 kms radius) in order to provide the latter with knowledge,
technologies and resources to prevent or reduce the destruction of the natural habitats. In particular priority will
be given to communities living around officially protected habitats such as the Northern Sahel sylvo-pastoral and
wildlife reserve, the protected natural habitats on the central Mossi plateau, in the Eastern, Southern and
Western provinces of the country. Protected habitats of interest are mainly those located in the following

provinces: Soum, Seno, Oudalan, Mohoun, Sanmatenga, Passoré, Ganzourgou, Oubritenga, Boulgou,
Bougouriba, Comoé, Houet, and Poni. Attention will also be given to communities living around protected wildlife
reserves such as the wildlfe reserves of Arly, Madjoari, Singou, Bontioli, Kourtiagou, Pama, and Nabéré in the
provinces of Tapoa (including the W park), Gourma and Bougouriba, including wildlife reserves covered under
the Partnership for Natural Ecosystems Program ( PAGEN).


        B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

        Comments:

The SILEM Project is a GEF window within the base project (CBRDP) which is classified as "B" category project.
This SILEM project will be funding mainly supplemental activities and investments to protect and promote local and
global natural resources and the environment in general in the lowland ecosystems of Burkina Faso. In particular,
the project supports preventive measures and local investments to protect and improve natural habitats,
biodiversity, carbon sinks, and international waters.

Although it is designed to have mainly positive environmental and social impacts at its intervention sites, the
project activity domains may trigger some of the safeguard policies listed in section C below:

        Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
        D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
        describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

        II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
        any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

Environmental Assessment: The SILEM project is not likely to have any major negative impacts on the
environment. However, an environment management framework (EMF) will be prepared to address any
unexpected negative environmental impacts during the project implementation stage.

Natural Habitats: Since GEF does not fund projects which impact negatively on natural habitats, the SILEM will
not support any activities that will result in tempering of natural habitats.

Forestry: According to OP 4.36, "forest policy is triggered by forest sector activities and other Bank sponsored
interventions which have the potential to impact significantly upon forest areas". In SILEM case, the focus is on
promoting agro-forestry in farmers field. Therefore this policy is not likely to be triggered.

                                                                                                                   ISDS




Pest Management: SILEM does not involve the direct promotion or support the use of pesticides.

Cultural Property: The project will not have a negative impact on any national or international cultural heritage
or property.

Indigenous People: Not applicable.

Involuntary Resettlement: The projects will not involve any activities that displace people involuntarily, because
of the participatory processes put in place to insure that consensual and win-win decisions are reached to satisfy
all parties. However the risk of marginalization of the weakest social groups in the process by dominant groups,
which could lead to involuntary resettlement of the weakest groups persists and may need to be monitored. The
project will prepare a resettlement policy framework (RPF) to ensure that if any of the above happens the
requisite plans will be prepared. A process framework will also be prepared to deal with potential lack of access
to natural resources by local communities.

Safety of Dams: SILEM does not support the construction of dams.

Projects in International Waters: The Project will not divert or obstruct the free flow of international waters, it
will on the contrary support activities aiming at protecting international waterways and removing obstacles so as
to permit free flow of waters.

Projects in Disputed Areas: The project area does not include any disputed territory as defined in
BP/GP/OP/7.60.

         II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
         due to multiple project component.

All the activities proposed in the proposed project are geared towards protection and conservation of natural
resources and environment, and thus in principle, the project is not expected to have any significant negative
cumulative potential impacts on the environment.

         II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
Described in the previous section.

         II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)


         II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Provisions to ensure compliance with applicable safeguard policies are as follows:

(i)      An environment management framework (EMF) will be prepared to address any potential environmental
issues that may arise while implementing the capacity building (component 1 and 3) and land tenure security
pilot (component 4) activities identified in the project document.

(ii)     As a CDD operation, community sub-projects (component 2) are not predetermined and/or imposed.
Thus, only eligible activities are proposed which may or may not occur during project implementation depending
on choices made by the communities. An in-country safeguard system certified by ASPEN will be set up to
undertake the screening of sub-projects and where needed, an environmental and social mitigation plan will be
prepared locally and implemented jointly with the M&E system.

(iii)    The manual of procedures for implementing the EA of the base project will also be upgraded
incorporating the provisions for SILEM.

                                                                                                                    ISDS


(v)      A resettlement policy framework (RPF) and a process framework (PF) will be developed and utilized to
manage and mitigate any potential resettlement issues or lack of access to natural resources that may arise
during the project implementation stage.

         II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
         policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The base project CBRDP and the supplemental project SILEM have been designed to be broadly participatory at
all levels, and first and foremost at the community-level. Well known participatory needs assessment techniques
will be applied to involve the maximum number of beneficiaries in the selection of investment sub-projects and
capacity building activities.

The EMF, RPF and PF will be submitted to the Bank for review, and then disclosed in-country and to the
InfoShop prior to appraisal.

         E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
         on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
         triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

         [ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
                   management of one or more safeguard areas
         [X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
                   technically and institutionally manageable
         [ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
         [ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
                   projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
                   issues.
