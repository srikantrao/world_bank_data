2. Project Development Objective(s)
   A. Original Project Development Objectives – Parent
   The project development objectives of KWSCRP-1 are to: (i) increase availability and
   productivity of irrigation water for project beneficiaries; and (ii) enhance the institutional
   framework and strengthen capacity for water security and climate resilience for thecountry.
   B. Proposed Project Development Objectives – Additional Financing (AF)
   The PDOs of KWSCRP-1 are to (a) increase availability and productivity of irrigation water for
   project beneficiaries and (b) enhance the institutional framework and strengthen capacity for
   water security and climate resilience in certain areas of the country.

   Within the PDO, ‘capacity for water security and climate resiliency’ primarily includes improved
   water services, flood protection, and analytical capacity to understand and manage hydrological
   variability.
3. Project Description
The current KWSCRP-1 includes the following three components:
•        Component 1 Water Resources Development (US$76.8 million ) supports climate
resilience and water security for economic growth by financing water investments and by building a
longer-term investment pipeline. Component 1 includes: (i) implementation of an irrigation scheme
in lower Nzoia, a flagship project of the Kenya Agricultural Sector Development Strategy (ASDS)
and of Kenya Vision 2030; and (ii) identification and preparation of new investments, starting with
the Mwache dam, expected to be financed by IDA through KWSCRP-2.
•        Component 2 Effective Water Sector Institutions             (US$56.3 million) supports the
strengthening of current sector institutions, as well as reform activities. The component funds pre-
reform transition and reform of the of the water sector to align with the devolution processes
mandated by the 2010 Constitution of Kenya, as well as to improve the capacity and knowledge base
for basin-level water resources management in Kenya. This component also includes strengthening
the planning, analysis and licensing functions of the Water Resources Management Authority.
•        Component 3 Support for Project Implementation (US$15.2 million) supports the PMU to
provide for effective KWSCRP-1 implementation.

The following sub-components are added to the project under the AF:

•        Activity 1.1.1.2: Lower Nzoia Flood Protection (US$54 million in Additional Financing
from IDA, plus $3.5 million from TF). Proposed activities will include: (i) repair and improvement
of existing dykes and construction of new dykes, culverts and drains to provide enhanced flood
protection to the communities of the Lower Nzoia River; and (ii) strengthening of monitoring and
community early warning mechanisms. The proposed flood mitigation dykes improvement works
have been planned to protect residents' life and property, as well as the new irrigation scheme,
including infrastructure and crops. The dykes have been designed based on an estimated 750 m3/sec
flood flow which is equivalent for 30 year return period. New dike works comprise 5.8 km of new
dykes and 28.4 km of improvement of existing dykes. The main works in the flood mitigation dykes
component comprise of an earth embankment wall about 5.0 m high, which also provides a 5.0 m

wide road at the crest. Details are as follows:
Southern Dykes; 17.1 km
�       Realigning sections of the dykes; New dykes 4.7 km
�       Raise and strengthen the existing dykes; 12.4 km
Northern Dykes; 17.1 km
�       Realigning sections of the dykes; New dykes 1.1 km
�       Raise and strengthen the existing dykes; 16.0 km
Provide filter drains on new and existing dykes
Provision of 8 gates at specific locations on northern dyke

A flood early warning system exists for the Lower Nzioia River, and flood forecasting is conducted
daily by the Kenya Meteorological Authority, which is part of the MEWNR. Through the project, the
flood early warning system will be improved, in order to minimize damage to life and property in the
event of a flood. If funding is obtained from a World Bank Trust Fund, the flood early warning
system will include the combination of IT and river water management technology. It could possibly
include for real-time monitoring of hydraulic data, including CCTV and containment action for flood
events through the early warning broadcasting based on alarm criteria. Other potential improvements
could include: installation of hydraulic measuring devices, including water level gauges and rainfall
sensors; flood analysis (including inundation mapping) and refinement of flood warning criteria for
Lower Nzoia River; establishment of customized control system with monitoring system; and
technology transfer and knowledge sharing.

•       Activity 1.1.1.3: Nzoia Watershed Management (US$4 million). Proposed activities include
planning and implementation of watershed management activities throughout the Nzoia watershed,
with a goal of improving livelihoods through the promotion of sustainable land management
practices; and reduction of sediment loads in the lower Nzoia watershed. The highest erosion
hotspots will be identified and watershed management activities will be implemented in these areas,
potentially including soil conservation, improved grazing and cropping patterns, terracing, gully
repair and construction of small works to reduce erosion, and other needed community entry-point
and livelihood activities.

•       Activity 1.1.2: Program for the Improvement of Water Services in Mombasa County. (US
$25 million in IDA Financing reallocated from Sub-components 1.2 and 2.1). Activities will include
the design and implementation of the first phase of a program for the reduction and management of
non-revenue water for implementation by Mombasa Water and Sanitation Company (MOWASCO),
as well as other activities to increase the institutional capacity of MOWASCO and Mombasa County.
Future phases beyond this financing will be sought from other sources, including a potential new
World Bank financed project.

This sub-component will support the implementation of a non-revenue water (NRW) reduction
program mainly by rehabilitating and expanding the tertiary distribution network, and to a limited
extent the primary and secondary network including the establishment of District Metering Areas .
This activity is aimed at drastically reducing NRW in selected areas to contribute in improving
MOWASCO's operational and financial performance. The activity will follow International Water
Association (IWA) recommendations—on the need to measure flows of water being dispatched and
consumed by customers to improve services, and will identify and fix leaks in the tertiary distribution
network, and eliminating illegal connections.

Further, the project will build on ongoing MOWASCO pilot work in 8 DMAs.

 4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The Lower Nzoia Flood Protection project is located in Bunyala district, Western Kenya. The
current dykes have a total length of about 34.09 km comprising 17.0 km on the southern and 17.09
km on the northern side. The construction, operation and decommissioning phases of the project are
likely to have some adverse impacts on both the local community and surrounding environment.
While project designs have not been finalized, a census showed that land taking for the Flood
Protection project activities could affect 1,163 households, encompassing 4,482 individuals. Of this,
a total of 225 residential structures could be affected. The remainder of households would be
affected by land-take or need to relocate non-residential structures for the expansion of dykes or
right-of-way

For the improvement of water services in Mombasa County, construction is expected to install new
or replace existing secondary and tertiary distribution networks as well as installation of water
meters. Environmental and social impacts resulting from such construction works are site specific,
expected to be easily manageable, will be included in EMPs that will be prepared in accordance with
the KWSCRP Environment and Social Management Framework.

 6. Safeguard Policies      Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
 Environmental              Yes            An EIA and EMP have been developed, consulted upon
 Assessment OP/BP 4.01                     and disclosed before appraisal for the Lower Nzoia
                                           Irrigation Scheme Phase 1, as well as for the Nzoia Flood
                                           Protection activities, detailing the mitigation measures
                                           required under this sub-investment.

                                           Additionally, as part of the preparation of an Investment
                                           Framework for the Water Sector being prepared by the
                                           project, MEWNR prepared an Environmental and Social
                                           Management Framework (ESMF) that establishes the
                                           environmental criteria for selecting investments, the
                                           detailed procedures for preparing the environmental
                                           assessments necessary for those investments, as well as
                                           the details of potential impacts and suggested mitigation
                                           measures for the kinds of activities envisaged by the
                                           project.
 Natural Habitats OP/BP     Yes            Some of the wetlands in the project area may be affected
 4.04                                      by project activities and related infrastructure. For this
                                           reason, the Natural Habitats policy is triggered. The
                                           project will strive to retain the ecological functions of the
                                           wetlands, which include water purification, flood
                                           protection, habitat for aquatic animal and plant species.
                                           The ESMF and ESIA nclude guidance on mitigation
                                           measures.

Forests OP/BP 4.36       No    While the policy does not apply to the currently identified
                               investments, as the investments being prepared under
                               Component 1.2 could be located in forested areas, the
                               forestry policy will be looked at during the preparation of
                               the relevant safeguard documents for those investments. If
                               the policy is triggered, a Tier-1 Restructuring will be
                               prepared. The forestry policy has also been considered in
                               the preparation of the ESMF.
Pest Management OP 4.09 Yes    Although the project will not be financing pesticide, the
                               Lower Nzoia Irrigation Scheme will involve use of
                               different types of agrochemicals to control diseases and
                               pests. The project will promote the use of integrated pest
                               management approaches and seek to reduce reliance on
                               synthetic chemical pesticides. An Integrated Pest
                               Management Plan (IPMP) has been included in the ESMF
                               to provide guidance on the pest and pesticide management
                               under the Lower Nzoia Scheme. The IPMP provides
                               guidance on assessment of environmental and health risks
                               associated with the current or envisaged pesticide use and
                               integration of specific measures to these risks in the
                               project design.

                               Additionally, an Integrated Pest Management Framework
                               (IPMF) is being prepared that will establish the detailed
                               procedures for preparing the pest management plans, as
                               and when necessary, for those investments selected under
                               the Investment Framework.
Physical Cultural        Yes   Location of cultural heritage resources are not yet fully
Resources OP/BP 4.11           known. The ESIAs for the subprojects will address
                               impacts on physical cultural resources and provide a
                               cultural resources management plan, including “Chance
                               Finds”. As the investments being prepared under
                               Component 1.2 could be in areas with cultural heritage
                               resources, this policy will be looked at during the
                               preparation of the relevant safeguard documents for those
                               investments. The policy has also been considered in the
                               preparation of the ESMF.
Indigenous Peoples OP/   Yes   There are no Vulnerable or Marginalized Groups (VMG)
BP 4.10                        in the Lower Nzoia Irrigation Scheme or Flood Activity
                               regions.

                               However, since the project is also preparing an
                               Investment Framework for the Water Sector, a Vulnerable
                               and Marginalized Groups Framework (VMGF) was
                               prepared in accordance to the World Bank’s Policy on
                               Indigenous Peoples (OP 4.10).

Involuntary Resettlement Yes      A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Lower Nzoia
OP/BP 4.12                        Irrigation Scheme has been prepared. With respect to loss
                                  of assets, according to the RAP, in total 81 structures will
                                  be affected including 17 residential units and 28
                                  commercial units. There are Approximately 1871
                                  households (995 farms) will be affected and a total of
                                  about 135.3 hectares of land will be acquired. In addition,
                                  564 vulnerable people are affected. The RAP, which was
                                  prepared in close consultation with the affected people,
                                  provides a detailed plan on to how to mitigate these
                                  impacts and to ensure scheme sustainability and
                                  livelihoods benefits.

                                  Lower Nzoia Flood Control Project: a draft RAP has been
                                  prepared, consulted upon and disclosed for the project.
                                  While project designs have not been finalized, a census
                                  showed that land taking for the Flood Protection project
                                  activities could affect 1,163 households, encompassing
                                  4,482 individuals. Of this, a total of 225 residential
                                  structures could be affected. The remainder of
                                  households would be affected by land-take or need to
                                  relocate non-residential structures for the expansion of
                                  dykes or right-of-way.The ESIA and RAP provide for
                                  capacity building for the lower level implementing

                                  issues.

                                  As the project is also preparing an Investment Framework
                                  for the water sector, a Resettlement Policy Framework
                                  (RPF) was prepared based on the Kenyan laws and the OP
                                  4.12. The RPF establishes the criteria for selecting
                                  investments, the detailed procedures and processes for

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
   1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
     and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
     The AF to KWSCRP-1, has been assigned Environment Assessment Category A like its parent
     project. It triggers the following Safeguard Policies: Environmental Assessment OP/BP 4.01,
     Indigenous Peoples OP/BP 4.10, Involuntary Settlement OP/BP 4.12, Pest Management OP/BP
     4.09, Physical Cultural Resources OP/BP 4.11, Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04, and Projects on
     International Waterways OP 7.50.

    KWSCRP Additional Financing is expected to have positive benefits through investments that
    increase water storage for productive use and increase resilience to floods and droughts. However,
    the Lower Nzoia Flood Protection infrastructure may result in adverse environmental and social
    impacts. Potential adverse impacts may include loss of land or structures, loss of critical habitats,
    interruption to migratory patterns, displacement of people, loss of access to areas for livelihood
    support and public safety issues. For the Nzoia Flood Control Infrastructure, a draft Environment
    and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and a draft Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) have been
    prepared, consulted upon and and disclosed. Further, the original project ESMF, RPF, and VMGF
    have also been updated to include activities in Mombasa County, and re-disclosed both in country
    and at the Bank Infoshop.

     Social analysis carried out and detailed in the ESIA indicates that there are no indigenous groups/
     vulnerable and marginalized groups living in the Lower Nzoia Project area.
   2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
     in the project area:
     N/A
   3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
     impacts.
     Several alternatives to the proposed flood control infrastructure and to World Bank financing for
     the Lower Nzoia Flood Control activities were considered. Through the Western Kenya
     Community Driven Development and Flood Preparedness Project funded by the World Bank, over
     fifteen potential options for coping with the Lower Nzoia Floods were assessed based on technical
     viability, financial, social and environmental costs through a participatory process. The option of
     rehabilitation of existing dykes and construction of new dykes was chosen by the communities and
     by the Government as the optimal solution. Before implementation begins, the designs for the
     Nzoia dykes and irrigation will be jointly optimized and reviewed to minimize and address
     environmental and social impacts.
   4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
     assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
     Lower Nzoia Flood Control Project: a draft ESIA, ESMP and a draft RAP have been prepared for
     the project. These documents explain the project's environmental and social impacts and provide

                                               Page 7 of 11
  detailed mitigation measure to ensure sustainability and compliance with GoK's regulations and
  legislations, as well as with World Bank social and environmental policies. While project designs
  have not been finalized, a census showed that land taking for the Flood Protection project
  activities could affect 1,163 households, encompassing 4,482 individuals. Of this, a total of 225
  residential structures could be affected. The remainder of households would be affected by land-
  take or need to relocate non-residential structures for the expansion of dykes or right-of-way. The
  ESIA and RAP provide for capacity building for the lower level implementing agencies to handle
  environmental and social management issues.

  For the Improvement of Water Services in Mombasa County, the details of works are not yet
  available by appraisal and therefore an ESMF, RPF and VMGF have been prepared and disclosed.
  The frameworks will guide the preparation of the relevant plans by MOWASCO once the civil
  works have been designed. The frameworks also include capacity building activities for the
  relevant implementing agencies.

  Generally, experience in Kenya has shown incremental safeguards capacity in the relevant PIUs
  and therefore their strengthening is required and the project will take measures to build the
  required capacity. Training programs will target capacity issues related to the implementation of
  the social and environmental management plan and the resettlement plan. The World Bank team
  has been working closely with the safeguards team preparing the above documents to ensure they
  comply with the relevant World Bank polices and will carry out close, field-based implementation
  support and supervision.

  The PMUs constituted under Component 3 of the parent project has core roles in fiduciary
  (procurement and financial management) aspects, environmental and social safeguards
  supervision, management and coordination, reporting, monitoring and evaluation. The PMU
  would include social and environmental safeguards specialists, and will be responsible for
  ensuring the application of the EIA, RAP and social and environmental frameworks (ESMF,
  VMGF and RPF) and supervising the implementation of safeguards instruments.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
  on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
  Potential stakeholders are found at national, regional and catchment levels, including WRUAs,
  farmers, municipalities, county governments, national ministries, civil society, and others. The
  ESIA, RAP and the frameworks detail the stakeholder consultation process for their preparation,
  disclosure and implementation.
