I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The Project Development Objective is for households in rural communities completing micro-project
investments to improve living standards and increase the use of infrastructure services. Micro-project
investments in economic and social infrastructure will be identified and selected using demand driven
processes. Funded micro-projects will be designed to increase access to, and quality of, rural economic and
social infrastructure (e.g. markets, roads, schools, clinics).

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project has three components. Two components address key issues identified in Section B. The third
component provides project management support. Each component is summarized below:

Component A -- Infrastructure. This component funds grants for approximately 350-450 rural
infrastructure micro-projects. It includes the identification, design, construction, rehabilitation, operation
and maintenance of rural infrastructure, based on the priority needs identified by communities. Potential
investments include basic economic (e.g., rehabilitation of secondary roads, water systems, electricity
transformers) and social (e.g. schools and health clinics) infrastructure. The average size of micro-projects
is US$35,000. Micro-projects over US$50,000 will require prior review by the Steering Committee and
World Bank no-objection.

Eligible grantees are municipalities, community-based organizations (CBOs, including local NGOs)
cooperating with municipalities, and cooperatives and limited liability companies (LLCs). Investments will
be identified in cosultation with communities, prioritized through local participatory planning processes,
and appraised according to technical, financial, social, economic, institutional, and environmental criteria
set out in the Operational Manual (OM). Generally, grantees will be responsible for all phases of the
micro-project, including preparation of the proposal, contracting, implementation and operations and
maintenance (O&M). As needed, local NGOs and CBOs or other intermediary service providers (ISPs) will
provide support. Training needed at the community level will be built into the micro-project cycle and
financed by Component B ­ Capacity Enhancement.

                                                                                                          ISDS


Component B -- Capacity Enhancement. This component provides grants for training and technical
assistance. It will help create the required capacity of all involved stakeholders, e.g. communities,
NGOs/CBOs, municipalities, Regional Grant Approval Committees (RGACs), and ISPs. In the community
mobilization phase, communities and municipal councils will be assisted in all aspects of micro-project
development including completing problem analysis, needs assessments/prioritizations,           and proposal
preparations. Grantees will receive training in contracting, procurement when specified, implementation of
financial management, and participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E). NGOs, as implementing
partners as well as other ISPs will have their capacities enhanced through trainings, conferences, lesson
learned seminars, consultations and PM&E (Sub-component B-1). This component will also develop the
capacity of the Project Management Unit (PMU) and four Regional Operations Offices (ROOs) to
appraise, supervise, monitor and evaluate the micro-projects (including participatory M&E). The capacity
enhancement will take place through management, planning and other trainings, on-the-job training,
consultations, lessons-learned workshops, and use of resource materials (Sub-component B-2).

Component C -- Project Management. This component finances the administrative and operational project
implementation and management costs, including hiring of qualified personnel to undertake procurement,
disbursement, financial management, internal auditing, as well as reporting, monitoring and evaluation.
Project management staff will be responsible for appraising micro-projects submitted for financing by rural
communities in a manner consistent with Bank standards for community driven development projects.
Training of project management staff will be financed under sub-component B-2.

Components:


Comp. A -- Infrastructure
Comp. B -- Capacity Enhancement
Comp. C -- Project Management




I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project targets rural communities (greater than 1,000 and less than 10,000 people) in four economic
zones: (i) Absheron-Guba, (ii) Sheki-Zagatala, (iii) Ganja-Gazakh, and (iv) Mugan-Salyan. A total of
about 440 micro-projects will be implemented over five years. The average size of each micro-project
investment is $35,000. Micro-projects over $50,000 will require no-objections from the World Bank.
Micro-projects investments are not identified prior to appraisal and a negative list of micro-projects is
being prepared with the Government. The majority of the interventions will focus on the rehabilitation of

existing infrastructure, not construction of new infrastructure. The social assessment revealed that the most
likely micro-projects are secondary rural roads, village water supply and sanitation, village transformers
and gas connections, and school and health clinic rehabilitation.


B. Check Environmental Classification: F (Financial Intermediary Assessment)

Comments: The project is classified as a Financial Intermediary. The bulk of project activities will be
demand-driven and micro-projects cannot be identified prior to appraisal. Therefore, rather than carrying out
an environmental assessment as part of project preparation, a mechanism for screening sub-projects for their
environmental impact will be designed. Environmental assessments will then be carried out for specific
sub-projects and/or project sites as appropriate.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

For environmental assessment, prior review of similar projects by the World Bank and INGOs in
Azerbaijan suggests that there are no major environmental issues are associated with the activities proposed
under the project. Many of the micro-projects are expected to produce environmental benefits (for example
reduction in erosion through proper road rehabilitation or small-scale wastewater treatment.) However,
because the micro-projects are not pre-identified, there could be unforeseen environmental impacts during
implementation. Within the EMP framework, the operations manual contains procedures in case there are
chance cultural property finds.

There are no foreseen potential large scale and significant and/or irreversible impacts. Since micro-projects
larger that US$50,000 will be subject to no-objection by the World Bank, there will be the opportunity to
address unforeseen issues as they arise.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

The team does not expect any indirect and/or long-term impacts related to the environmental assessment
policies in the project area.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

None

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

N/A

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
For micro-projects where safeguard policies apply, the Operational Manual defines the measures to be
carried out in accordance with Bank guidelines. This includes an environmental management plan
framework. The likelihood that micro-projects will trigger safeguard policies was assessed during project
preparation and evaluated as very low. Micro-projects that include land or building expropriation are not
eligible for grants through this project. Under the EMP framework, the operations manual contains
procedures for handling chance cultural property finds.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

Key stakeholders include members of communities that participate in the project, members of Government,
and Non-Government Organizations. The Project Preparation Unit has been holding monthly meetings with
stakeholders from the Government, Parliament, and the Community Empowerment Network to discuss the
organization and content of the Operations Manual. The EMPF have been drafted and integrated into the
Operations Manual. They have been discussed with key stakeholders and disclosed on the PMU and the
Azerbaijan Community Development Research websites.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[ ] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[X] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
