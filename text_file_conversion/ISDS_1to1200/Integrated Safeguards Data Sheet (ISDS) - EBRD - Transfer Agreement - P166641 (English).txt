                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The objective of this assignment is to develop the occupational road risk toolkit that can be utilized by the MDBs under
                           the MDB road safety working group applicable to many countries for applied work/research that is transferable. EBRD
                           have recently identified Tajikistan as a potential focus country where EBRD have been stepping up their activities
                           related to road safety and occupational road risk. EBRD may therefore use Tajikistan as one of the focal countries to
                           ensure whatever tools are developed are suitable for businesses --and transferable to other Low/Low- Middle Income
                           countries. However, the this may be expanded to other countries and will be determined. The project is global in
                           nature.
