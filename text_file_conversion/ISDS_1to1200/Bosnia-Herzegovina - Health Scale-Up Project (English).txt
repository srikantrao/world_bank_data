B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 2 of PCN]
Buildin
g on the successful results from the pilots under the Basic Health Project, the objective of 
the proposed Health Scale Up Project is to expand the family medicine model of primary health care and  
improve quality, efficiency, and access to primary health c
are services.  
. 
The following indicators would be used to assess project performance: 

 
Population covered by the family medicine model;

 
Referrals to secondary level of care;

 
Implementation of preventive services, including immunization coverage;

 
Patien
ts and Providers satisfaction;

 
Percentage of family medicine teams accredited by the Agencies for Quality Assurance; and

 
Percentage of PHC doctors/nurses trained and using evidence
-
based protocols of care.
C.  Project Description 
[from section 3 of PCN]
For a sector or thematic program:  key elements
Page  2
For a project:  key components
The Project would be a single operation to support both Entities.  
The Project would have three 
components: 
(1) Primary Health Care
 (estimated to cost US$28.5 million, in
cluding contingencies).  This component 
would expand on the Family Medicine pilots under the Basic Health Project, which covered about 16% of 
the  population  and  trained  31%  of  the  countries  FM  teams.    The  component  would  support:  (i) 
implementation  of  trai
ning  programs  in  family  medicine  for  doctors  and  nurses,  including  family 
medicine specialization, Program of Additional Training (PAT), (ii) training of faculty of the Family 
Medicine Cathedras in the four universities, (iii) refurbishing and equipment fo
r FM facilities, and (iv) 
communication activities to inform the public about the reform.  The curriculum for FM specialization 
and for the PAT will be adjusted to address more deeply change management.  It would also support 
expansion  of  the  existing  mode
l  of  patients  registration  and  selection  of  primary  care  doctor,  and 
introduction of new payment models for PHC developed under the Basic Health Project and SITAP.  The 
first  three  activities  would  expand  on  successful  experiences  under  the  Basic  Health  Pr
oject,  while 
ensuring that the institutional capacity within the four universities is strengthened to ensure sustainability 
of  the  training  programs  once  the  foreign  technical  concludes  its  work.    The  fourth  activity  would 
complement efforts under SITAP wh
ere a comprehensive communications, community involvement and 
customer perspectives activities are being supported focusing on reforms of the social insurance systems.  
Communication activities under this project will focus on primary health care reforms
 to: (i) 
communicate the rationale and the substance of the FM reforms to the public at large, (ii) develop ways of 
assessing and benchmarking customer satisfaction, including through surveys of customer and consumer 
expectations and experiences with PHC s
ervices, (iii) improving the knowledge of policy makers and 
members of parliament about the FM principles, and (iv) assisting participating health institutions at the 
center and local levels with the development of communications strategies, and strengthen
ing the capacity 
and skills in communications and public relations.  The component would finance, civil works, technical 
assistance, surveys, medical and office equipment, training materials, workshops, travel and incremental 
operating costs.  
(2)  Health
  Management  Training
(estimated  cost  US$1.5  million,  including  contingencies).   
This 
component  would  further  support  development  and  implementation  of  health  management  training 
initiated under the Basic Health Project.  These training programs would addre
ss the following areas: (i) 
regulations, (ii) macro and micro management, (iii) disease management and prevention, (iv) quality 
improvement, (v) application of standards and protocols, (vi) referrals, (vii) rational drugs prescription, 
and (viii) budgeting
 and accounting.  While the component would support health management broadly, in 
terms of FM, it would help FM teams to:

 
prepare business and strategic plans for health centers and organize focus groups for medical staff 
in health centers on PHC reforms
, and support to further strengthen capacity of the centers of 
health  management  to  upgrade  level  of  their  services  and  ensure  future  sustainability  of  the 
centers,

 
provide training in change management developed under the Basic Health Project targeting fi
rst 
line managers of health centers,  
Page  3

 
support academic degree training (masters and PhD programs) for teachers of health management 
to build cadre of teachers to be able to teach masters and other courses offered by the centers for 
health management, and

 
develop regulations for accreditation of teaching staff of health management centers.  
(3) Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation
 (estimated to cost US$1.0 million).  The Entity 
level Ministries of Health would be the implementing agencies for the
 Project.  Both Ministries of Health 
will take responsibility for managing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) under the project.  M&E will be 
conducted with the help of a simple, but effective M&E system to be designed during project preparation, 
which will e
nsure integration with PRSP monitoring by MOHs and the Public Health Institutes.  The 
project will provide funds to strengthen M&E skills in both MOHs.  Proposed monitoring indicators are 
presented in Annex 3.  The third component of the project provides r
esources for M&E.  The BHP Credit 
which closed on June 30, 2004, has been successful in building considerable institutional capacity for 
planning, management, coordination, procurement, and financial management.  The BHP financed local 
technical  assistance
  to  be  directly  responsible  for  project  implementation.    Under  this  project,  both 
Ministers of Health and the Bank have agreed that further institutional building must be pursued directly 
with the ministries.  The responsibility for design/preparation/impl
ementation of this project has been 
placed inside the two Ministries, with the support of local consultants.  This approach follows institutional 
arrangements already in place for the implementation of SITAP.  During project preparation and the 
initial pha
se of implementation of the project, technical support from local consultants will be required in 
specific areas and for a limited time period.  These consultants, however, will act as advisors to MOH 
staff and will not be directly responsible for project 
implementation as it was the case under the Basic 
Health Project and other health projects financed by the Bank.  This approach shows ownership and 
commitment by the Ministries of Health to be involved from the outset in the design of the project and 
furth
er  strengthen  staff  capacities.    Consultants  responsible  for  fiduciary  tasks 
–
  procurement  and 
financial management
-
 recruited under the Basic Health Project and now financed under SITAP will 
expand their responsibilities to cover the needs of the Health S
cale Up Project.     The component would 
finance technical assistance, limited office equipment, and recurrent costs.
D.  Project location (if known)
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations u
nder consideration or how the 
location is to be determined during project preparation]
The Primary Health Care Component will include small civil works consisting of internal remodeling of 
existing buildings in selected Family Medicine health posts (FM Am
bulantas).  The Project aims to scale 
up the FM pilots from the Bank
-
financed Basic Health Project country
-
wide with sites to be identified at a 
later stage.  During the implementation of the pilots under the Basic Health Project, no environmental 
issues (
asbestos/lead paint) were encountered.  The Project Operational Manual (POM) of the new project 
will include a provision to the effect that civil works contractors must pay particular attention to issues of 
asbestos/lead paint and other environmental matte
rs.  This will be closely monitored by the Project 
Coordination Units and the Bank team.  
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
[from PCN]
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
The country has cons
iderable experience in this type of civil works.  Under the pilot supported by the 
Basic Health Project, over 100 ambulantas were refurbished.  No environmental issues were encountered 
in the implementation of the pilots.
