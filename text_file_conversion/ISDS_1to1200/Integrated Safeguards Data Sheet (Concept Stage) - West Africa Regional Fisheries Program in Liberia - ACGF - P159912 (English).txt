                           Key construction work at Mesurado Pier and Robertsport landing site completed.
                           C. Project Description
                           The ACGF financing of US$4.193 million will directly contribute to the broader West Africa
                           Regional Fisheries Program, in particular Component 3 : Increasing the Contribution of the Marine
                           Fish Resources to the Local Economies.

                           With WARFP SOP A1 disbursement in Liberia reaching 98%, the requested additional ACGF
                           funding will allow Liberia to access funds not available from elsewhere to accomplish the
                           rehabilitation of the Mesurado industrial fishing complex, while also expanding economic
                           opportunities for the country's small scale coastal fisheries. To this end, the additional ACGF support
                           will be deployed to:
                           (i) Meet construction cost increases triggered by the Ebola crisis, and design modifications required
                           to meet evolving performance needs for completion of the Mesurado complex construction; and
                           (ii) Create an integrated Mesurado-Robertsport fishery cluster by filling the financing gap in the
                           WARFP's financed Robertsport landing site pilot, to support new business and export revenue-
                           generating opportunities for the local fishermen and communities.

                           As this new funding activity is self-contained and will be implemented until July 2017 while the
                           WARFP SOP A1 closes in September 2016, the team was advised to pursue a stand-alone small
                           grant rather than additional financing under the larger WARFP project.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           All proposed activities will be located inside the Port of Monrovia (The Mesurado fishing pier) and
                           in the Robertsport fisheries landing cluster site, both of which are already covered by an existing
                           project infrastructure works sites under WARFP SOP-A1. The proposed new activities will not
                           expand beyond the footprint of the existing/on-going works.
                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The institutional capacity for safeguard policies is satisfactory, as it is the same counterpart that has
                           been responsible for the safeguards management of the same type of works in the same locations
                           throughout WARFP SOP-A1. Safeguards management performance hasbeen consistently rated
                           satisfactory.
