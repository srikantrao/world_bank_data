                           The PDO for MIGEP is to assist Mongolia to enhance the governance of extractives through its
                           implementation of EITI
                           C. Project Description
                           The Minister of Finance requested continuing grant support to finance implementation of EITI by a
                           letter of October 14 2015. The MIGEP grant will be financed by the Extractives Global
                           Programmatic Support (EGPS) Multi-Donor Trust Fund and will be recipient executed. Three
                           previous grants to support implementation of EITI were funded by the EITI MDTF, a global trust
                           fund which closed on December 31, 2015

                           Project Components:

                           The project will support the activities essential to EITI implementation and meeting Mongolia’s
                           obligations as an EITI member under the 2013 Standard. The Government continues to allocate
                           funds for Reconciliations Reports for EITI each year while the costs of running the program and
                         outreach remains funded by various grants. The proposed EITI Law has been pending submission for
                         over a year and resources allocated by the Government remain limited. Going forward, more
                         government engagement will be required to ensure long-term sustainability, and the EITI Law

                         institutionally in its post-compliance phase from March 1, 2016 until December 31, 2018. The

                         analysis (if known)
                         The proposed Project is a technical assistance grant of a limited scope with activities that do not have
                         any likely adverse environmental or social impacts. Funding of the EITI Report and training and
                         other capacity building activities are aimed at improving the transparency of payments and revenues
                         in the extractives sector. Therefore, per OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment, the proposed project is
                         classified as a Category C Project.
