B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the proposed Project is 
to meet the priority needs of rural communities in Bhutan through 
capacity-building and financial support of 
geog 
plans
. Achievement of this objective requires a multi-sectoral 
approach and will finance rural access sub-projects (i.e. farm roads), basic infrastructure, income-generating 
activities, crop/livestock productivity, agricultural marketing, and sustainable natural resource management, in 
combination with training support. A secondary objective may be to “prime the pump” of fiscal decentralization by 
providing dialogue and technical assistance to encourage efficient resource transfers and capacity-building in local 
governance at the 
dzongkhag 
(district) and 
geog
 levels. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Achievement of the Project objective will require a dual approach that finances 
geog
 plans in a way compatible with 
fiscal decentralization in addition to providing technical backstopping and administrative support required for plan 
implementation. As such, the guiding principle for any Project financing will be direct relevance to the 
geog
 plans -- 
providing such support is not already addressed by other development partners. 
 
a)  
Financing for 
geog
 plans:
  This component, which comprise the majority of the IDA credit, would finance 
existing 
geog
 plans in a programmatic way, largely based on the model piloted and now established in the DSP in 5 
of the 20 
dzongkhags
 (which supports 32 
geogs
). In this way, the Bank would provide gap financing (within the 
availability of IDA funds) for those areas not covered by other funding sources. Funds would be made available 
through 
dzongkhags
 to 
geogs
 to address priority needs irrespective of the sector. The Bank should strive to work 
within the current legal framework underpinning the decentralization program and in the context of existing 
procedures and administrative processes, rather than following a more traditional project approach. This would 
avoid the need for parallel implementation arrangements and help ensure sustainability. If consistent with the DSP, 
geogs
 may receive approximately $15,000 each for their annual plans. However, given the widespread demand for 
rural access, its expense (farm roads cost approximately $25k per km), and the fact that such roads may connect 
multiple 
geogs
, a separate window of financing may be required at the 
dzongkhag
 level for farm road construction. 
 
b) 
Capacity-building for rural development
: The second component would support capacity-building needs 
at all levels for supporting the 
geogs
 in the implementation of their plans. This would need to occur in two ways. 
The first would assist MoA in strengthening capacity at the sectoral level for technical backstopping. This would 
involve in-country training for upgrading the skills of extension staff (most of whom are already in place), as well as 
Page  2
 
 
enhancing the capacity of farmers and community leaders with respect to the RNR sector. The second 
subcomponent would provide assistance in planning, financial management, and core administrative tasks (planning, 
budget formulation, execution, and reporting). Some assistance under this subcomponent may be outsourced to 
specialized institutions (such as the Royal Institute of Management) or international technical assistance (as SNV is 
providing for the DSP). 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The Project is national in scope and will likely be implemented in 15 of the 20 districts of Bhutan (as the UNDP’s 
“Decentralization Support Project” is working in the remaining five with a similar approach. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Bhutan is internationally recognized as exceptional in terms its conservation and guardianship of 
its natural resources and has well established procedures for environmental assessment. The 
Bank will need to ascertain whether these are in line with our own safeguards. A social 
assessment will be required to ensure that social safeguards are in place. 
 
II.  SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY 
 
Applicable?
 
Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[ Y] 
Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01) 
 
Assessment of subprojects and Bhutan’s framework for evaluating them will be needed. 
[ TBD] 
Natural Habitats
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.04) 
 
Some communities may be situated in or near protected areas. 
[TBD ] 
Pest Management
 (
OP 4.09
) 
 
Some sub-projects include intensification of agriculture. 
[ TBD] 
Involuntary Resettlement
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.12) 
 
Unlikely, since communities are expected to voluntary donate land for small infrastructure (such as 
schools, clinics) 
[ TBD] 
Indigenous Peoples
 (
OD 4.20
) 
 
Need to confirm project’s impact on vulnerable groups. 
[Y ] 
Forests
 (
OP
/
BP

Likely, given the demand for community forestry

No dams are foreseen.

Cultural Property
 (draft OP 4.11 -

No damage to cultural property is foreseen.

Environmental Assessment Category:
    
[ ] A   [X] B   [ ] C   [ ] FI   [ ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
If TBD, explain determinants of classification and give steps that will be taken to determine that EA category 
(mandatory):

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the
 
disputed areas
 
Page  3
 
 
Sub-projects will be very small in size (normally <$15,000) but given the demand for farm roads (normally 
upgrading of existing paths) environmental screening of certain classes of sub-projects will probably be desirable.
