                         3. Project Description
Public Disclosure Copy




                         The project is the first support provided to the VBA by the World Bank. It is expected to be
                         implemented over four years with implementation from September 2015 to August 2019. The project
                         will be financed by a $7.2 million grant from the GEF and $3.5 million grant from CIWA, and will
                         consist of four components: (i) Water Charter Development for the Volta River Basin; (ii)
                         Facilitating Dialogue, Communication and Project Monitoring ; and (iii) Implementation of SAP
                         Priority Actions. A fourth component allocates funding related to the Project Management. A
                         parallel, bank-executed activity will be conducted for an institutional assessment of the VBA, and
                         will be financed by an additional $0.5 million from CIWA. This activity is bank-executed so as to
                         have an independent assessment.

                         Component 1: Water Charter Development for Volta River Basin (US$1,992,000). The aim of this
                         first component is to develop a Water Charter which specifies roles and responsibilities of riparian
                         countries with regard to water resources use, strengthens the underpinning of VBA to promote
                         coordinated and harmonized water policies in the Basin and defines guiding principles for improved
                         water resources development and management for the basin such as better integration of IWRM
                         where transboundary resources are concerned. The Water Charter will be developed under the
                         leadership of the legal unit of the VBA, and the process of its development will involve extensive
                         consultations with relevant stakeholders in the member states to ensure ownership of the process and
                         final document. The Water Charter has the objective to: (i) facilitate dialogue and cooperation
                         between member States in the planning and implementation of programs and projects that affect
                         water resources; (ii) strengthen solidarity and promote sub-regional integration and economic
                         cooperation between Member States; (iii) specify the regulations for utilization of water resources of
                         the basin; (iv) specify the regulations on the preservation and protection of the environment,
                         especially those relating to water quality; (v) strengthen collaboration on flood management and
                         defining the modalities for exchanging hydro-meteorological data and flood information; and (vi)

                         define the modalities for participation of water users in decision making on management of the water
                         resources of the Volta basin.

                         Activities in the development of the Water Charter would include: a stakeholder assessment, a legal
                         and diagnostic study, preparation of and consultation on the draft charter and dissemination of the
                         signed document. The communication of the final Water Charter to ensure that all stakeholders are
                         aware of their rights and responsibilities links into the Communication Plan under Component 2.

                         Component 2: Facilitating Dialogue, Communication and Project Monitoring (US$1,260,000). In
                         order to effectively carry out its coordination role, the Strategic Plan for the period 2015-2019
                         recommends that VBA establish communications mechanisms that target different sections of the
                         basinâ€™s stakeholders as well as facilitate exchange of information and data on environmental, water
                         resources and monitoring of planned and ongoing projects in the Basin. While some of these efforts
                         are being addressed through the VBA Observatory and other avenues, they are being carried out in
                         ad hoc and non-coordinated manners. As such, this component focuses on the development of a
                         Communications Strategy and Plan which will serve as the guiding document for improving
                         coordination and collaboration among all relevant stakeholders; and on information sharing on
                         current and planned projects in the Basin. A stakeholder assessment will be carried out as part of the
                         development of the Communications Strategy and Plan. The component will also support activities
                         related to participation in the International Water Learning Exchange and Resource Network (IW-

                         implementation of SAP measures through priority actions. It supports th e development of projects
                         that lead to improvements in water quality, flows and ecosystem services. Initial selection of actions
                         was done based on their transboundary nature, criteria for which was developed through consultation
                         with the VBA; additional consultations with the VBA and its national Focal Points, as well as
                         representatives of local agencies and organizations led to the final choices for priority actions. The
                         list includes actions across Components A and B of the SAP, integrating measures that directly
                         address physical stresses, to those related to human capacity, governance, knowledge and livelihood
                         in maintaining the environment. Priority actions include restoration of flows through river bank
                         rehabilitation, reversal of vegetation degradation through reforestation and enhancing of agricultural
                         practices through water-conserving techniques. Priority actions also include funding for feasibility
                         studies, consultations, capacity building and awareness-raising at the national and local levels and
                         M&E.

                         Sub-Component 3.1. Reforestation: Being implemented in Benin, Cote dâ€™Ivoire, Ghana and Togo,
                         this activity builds priority actions based on SAP Actions B.4 and B.7, which highlight the degraded
                         forest ecosystems in these countries. Forest area degradation is attributed to shifting cultivation,
                         transhumance, overgrazing, uncontrolled bush fires used to clear land for agriculture and
                         uncontrolled exploitation of timber and other crops. In Benin and Togo, these challenges are acute
                         along the mountainsides and near river banks of the Pendjari-Oti, whereas in Ghana and Cote
                         dâ€™Ivoire these problems occur within the Black Volta sub-basin. All four priority actions will
                         contribute towards conservation of critical ecosystem functions by rehabilitating degraded forest
                         ecosystems in the project sites.

                         Sub-Component 3.2. River Bank Protection: Being implemented in Burkina Faso, this activity
                         corresponds to SAP Action A.2, which addresses challenges to the water levels of the tributaries of
                         the Mouhoun River, one of the key streams of the Volta, and situated in the northern region of

                         Burkina Faso. These tributaries used to be permanent, but in recent years have been drying due to
                         human impact. Furthermore soil erosion of the river banks is leading to increased sedimentation
                         which is in turn negatively impacting flows.

                         Sub-Component 3.3. Development of Market Gardens: This component corresponds to Action A.3
                         and will be implemented in Mali. Small market gardens will be developed using water conserving
                         techniques showcasing alternate forms of irrigation applicable for the Sahel.

                         Component 4: Project Management (US$790,000). The component will finance activities related to
                         the management and strengthening of internal processes related to strengthening the capacity of the
                         VBA. This component will also provide support to the PCU to implement the project. It will thus
                         finance costs relating to fiduciary management, monitoring and evaluation of the projectâ€™s results,
                         technical reporting and audits, additional consultants for the PCU as well as any operating costs such
                         as meetings, workshops, travel expenses and training to assure project implementation according to
                         standards acceptable to IDA
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard

                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              No significant environmental impacts are expected from this project as its intention is to promote
                              sound water resources management and improve natural resources biodiversity. However it is
                              recognized that despite this the project's relatively modest environmental impacts, it is necessary
                              to follow a structured assessment process to ensure that no activities will have unintended
                              consequences on the environment. Based on these aspects, the project is classified as being EA
                              category B and triggers six safeguards policies. There are OP/PB 4.01; OP4.04; OP4.36; OP4.09;
                              OP 4.12 and OP/PB 7.50. The project may take place in or near natural habitats and forests, and
                              so the ESMF includes measures to avoid such areas or mitigate such impacts; it also includes
                              measures for undertaking some reforestation activities. The project will involve pest management,
                              and the focus of the IPMP is to use chemicals as minimally as possible. The project could include

                          livelihoods -- most likely some minor land take. Therefore, an RPF has been prepared. To be in
                          compliance with these policies the following safeguard instruments (ESMF, IPMP and RPF) have

                          been prepared reviewed, consulted upon and disclosed in VBA member countries on April
                          17,2015 and at the infoshop on April 17, 2015. Based on the triggering of OP/PB7.50, a letter for
                          endorsement has been sent to all six Volta Basin riparian countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote
                          dâ€™Ivoire, Ghana, Mali and Togo) on February 20, 2014. In return, the VBA received responses
                          from all the six countries mentioning their agreement for this ongoing project.

                           During the whole phase of the project, the ESMF, the IPMP and the RPF will be implemented as
                           guidance/guidelines for any activity that will have to be financed under the project. ESIAs and/or
                           ESMPs and/or RAPs will be prepared as and when necessary.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           No long-term impact due to project activities is foreseen.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           N/A
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The ESMF prepared by the borrower contains: (a) a systematic environmental and social impact
                           assessment for all activities before selection and implementation; (b) procedures for conducting
                           activity-specific Environmental and Social Impacts Assessments (ESIAs) or Environmental and
                           Social Management Plan (ESMP); (c) capacity strengthening and awareness raising campaigns
                           targeted at relevant stakeholder groups for better implementation and monitoring of project
                           safeguard measures; and (d) establishment and implementation of a consultation framework for
                           the environmental control and monitoring.

                          Similar to the ESMF, the RPF also outlines the principles, organizational arrangements, and
                          design criteria to be applied to investments to be prepared during project implementation. An
                          investment specific Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be prepared in line with the RPF and
                          submitted to the bank, as required, for approval after specific design information becomes
                          available.

                           Lastly, the IPMP seeks to provide guidance in how to protect environment, biodiversity and
                           people in case pesticides are used during the project implementation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The safeguard documents (ESMF, IPMP and RPF) mentioned above have been consulted upon
                           and disclosed before the Appraisal scheduled for April 17, 2015.

                          While the project aims to ensure a better management of the Volta Basin water resources, the key
                          stakeholders comprising community members living around the main Volta river tributaries,
                          farmers, and breeders in the targeted project sites of the project have been consulted. At these
                          different occasions, they have given their comments, concerns and viewpoints for a better
                          implementation of this ongoing operation. Moreover from February 26-27, 2015 a regional
                          workshop held in Ouagadougou and gathered stakeholders coming from all the six countries with
