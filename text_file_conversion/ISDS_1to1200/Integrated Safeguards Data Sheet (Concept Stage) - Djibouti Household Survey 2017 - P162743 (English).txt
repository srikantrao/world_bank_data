                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The PDO is to support the Department of Statistics and Demographic Studies (DISED) to collect,
                           analyze and disseminate data emanating from the Household Survey for Social Indicators (Enquete
                           Djiboutienne Aupres de Menages - EDAM) 2017.
                           C. Project Description
                           The activities conducted under this operation will have the objective of supporting the successful
                           implementation of the data collection of the EDAM 2017. Given the expected improvements to the
                           questionnaire and sampling strategy, the 2017 EDAM is not only intended to produce poverty
                           estimates, but also a substantially improved measure of households' welfare, and nationally
                           representative indicators that include the nomadic population for the first time. The grant amount if
                           for $500,000 USD.

                           Preparation of the questionnaire and piloting is expected to be carried out between November 2016
                           and January 2016. Training of surveyors and codification of the surveys into tablets will be
                           conducted between January and February 2017. Data collection is expected to start in mid-March
                           2017 and run for 2-3 months. The full cycle will culminate in the preparation of the associated
                           datasets and public use files of the data collected. At that point, complementary TA activities,
                           including that of welfare and poverty measurement are expected to be put in place for the
                           development and production of new poverty estimates in Djibouti.

                           The data collected from the EDAM 2017 is expected to help inform several World bank operations,
