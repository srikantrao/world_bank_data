                           Subcomponent 1.1: (i) Development of tax policies; (ii) drafting of tax legislation and secondary legislation;
                           and (iii) consultations, dissemination, training, and outreach activities to relevant stakeholders. The MoF’s
                           PFM Strategy foresees the drafting of new and updated legislation for a number of laws, including the
                           general tax law, asset tax, land tax, income tax, housing tax, and environment tax law. This subcomponent
                           will provide support to strengthen the MoF’s capacity through local expertise for the drafting of the
                           legislative initiatives and undertake consultations, dissemination, and training with the relevant stakeholders.
                           These legislative initiatives will contribute to strengthen the current legal framework for taxation and to build
                           a foundation for increasing revenue collection

                           Subcomponent 1.2: Improvement of the Tax Department’s organizational and administrative processes,
                           including communication activities and services to tax payers with a specific focus on the large taxpayer
                           segment. Activities in strengthening tax compliance are focused on the LT segment and will enable the Tax
                           Department’s RCD to introduce a proactive and targeted compliance management, building on systematic,

                           correct, and up-to-date taxpayer data; an improved audit approach; enhanced LT’s industry expertise; and
                           the introduction of taxpayer outreach and services. Specifically, this subcomponent will provide support to
                           strengthen the capacity of the Tax Department through local expertise to support the implementation of a
                           proactive compliance management approach and carry out training and capacity workshops and stakeholder
                           dissemination events. These activities are expected to increase the share of tax revenues collected from the
                           LT segment.

                           Component 2: Improving the legal and institutional framework of PFM and public sector governance.

                           Subcomponent 2.1: Improvement of budget preparation and execution processes. Activities under this
                           subcomponent will support the Budget Department to organize capacity-building and dissemination events
                           and hire local consultants for activities to prepare the State Budget for FY2020 in accordance with the
                           requirements of the revised State Budget Law 2015. The preparation of a summary budget and dissemination
                           of budget information will also be supported aiming to contribute to budget transparency and availability of
                           budget information on time. The activities under this subcomponent are expected to contribute to more
                           affordable and realistic budget plans, limit unaffordable commitments, and ultimately improve the
                           achievement of sector performance targets.

                           This subcomponent will also support the NT in strengthening its capacity for the implementation of reforms
                           to improve payment processes, cash management, and forecasting capacity. This will include to carry out
                           workshops and trainings for the revision of the CoA, and improving cash balance consolidation. These
                           activities are expected to result in faster and more secure payments, reduce costs, allow for reporting
                           according to IPSAS and International Monetary Fund (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (GFS), and reduce
                           out-of-budget spending.

                           Finally, this subcomponent will include activities supporting the readiness for a new FMIS (to be financed by
                           the Public Finance Management Modernization Project [P167534]), such as the improvement of the MoF’s
                           overall ICT capacity and security, through training activities for the implementation of elements of the MoF’s
                           ICT Strategy, which are relevant for the FMIS implementation.

                           Subcomponent 2.2: Strengthening governance capacity in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). This
                           subcomponent builds on work previously undertaken under the Governance Programmatic ASA for SEA
                           Lower Middle Income Countries (P161155), which provided recommendations to the MoHA for the rollout of
                           its Personnel Information Management System (PIMS) to the provincial level. While the technical rollout to
                           all provincial departments of the MoHA has been completed, capacity building in the use of the PIMS for staff
                           from the provincial departments of line ministries will be supported. Once the PIMS database is completed
                           with provincial personnel data, automated payroll calculations and payment will be expanded to the
                           subnational level. The expanded scope of the PIMS and automatization of the payroll process is expected to
                           eliminate manual processes and speed up salary payments. This subcomponent will also provide support to
                           the MoHA on capacity-building and dissemination activities on topics related to potential civil service
                           reforms.

                           Component 3: Strengthened public procurement. This component aims to strengthen the MoF’s

                           implementation capacity for the new Public Procurement Law and to provide training to all relevant
                           stakeholders.

                           Subcomponent 3.1: The implementation of the Law, including the preparation of manuals and guidelines, the
                           introduction of a training program for procurement staff of all procurement units, and strengthening of the
                           procurement monitoring function. This subcomponent will support the MoF in the adoption of the new
                           procurement framework through the dissemination of the new law among public and private stakeholders
                           and by strengthening PrMO’s capacity through local expertise to support the update of standard bidding
                           documents and the preparation of guidelines and manuals. These activities will set the foundations for the
                           operationalization of the law.

                           This subcomponent will also support the setup of a staff training program and other capacity-building
                           activities to strengthen the competency and skills of staff involved in procurement at all levels of
                           government. To enhance the monitoring functions, the designated procurement department in the MoF
                           (PrMO) will be strengthened, and capacity building will be provided to the State Audit Organization (SAO) to
                           conduct procurement audits. This subcomponent will also provide for local expertise to support a spending
                           analysis that will collect, classify, and analyze procurement expenditure to identify areas where new
                           approaches, such as framework agreements, may be implemented to reduce costs of goods and services and
                           transaction costs. These activities are expected to build the necessary capacity for the implementation of the
                           law and provide input for informed decision making of public procurement approaches.

                           Subcomponent 3.2: Establishment of an accessible public procurement website and an operational complaint
                           mechanism. This subcomponent will support the establishment of a procurement portal (website) for the
                           publication of procurement information and the introduction of a procurement complaints mechanism. The
                           website is expected to increase the transparency and accessibility of information of public tender
                           opportunities.
