A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The physical target is to have an improved road condition and also to install regular maintenance 
on much of the Ethiopian road network.  In addition, network density (Km per 1000 sq. Km) is 
expected to increase.  Through this process the management of the sector will be strengthened, 
and an efficient and self-sustaining construction industry that is capable of meeting the diverse 
needs of the sector will be developed.  Key output indicators are: 
 
In addition to the output indicators identified above, a number of outcome indicators associated 
with the MDGs, and road sector specific outputs
will be measured by setting up social 
observatories along the corridor development area with a focus on: improved earning capacity of 
the residents along the impact area, improved access to health facilities and education centers, 
improved capacity in preparation and review of social and environment reports and promoting 
gender equity, especially in employment.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
(i) 
The upgrading and rehabilitation of: (a) Assela-Dodola-Goba and Shashemane - Dodola 
section (316 km) of the Nazareth-Dodola/ Shashamane-Goba federal trunk road (b) Gob 
Gob-Woldiya section (194 km) of the Woreta-Woldiya federal link road; and (c) Shire-
AdiAbun section (83 km) of the Adigrat-Shire federal link road.   
 
(ii) 
The construction of Magna-Mechra section (119 km) of the Dera-Mechara federal link 
road to a high standard gravel road. 
 
Page  2
(iii) 
The upgrading from existing trail and construction of new sections of the Assosa-Guba 
regional road to gravel road surface standard (137 km). This is the only new road to be 
added to the program. 
(Road segments mentioned under (i) and (ii) were components of 
APL I and EIA’s and RAP’s were prepared and disclosed). 
 
(iv) 
Consultancy services for the construction supervision of the above road contracts, and the 
implementation of the associated environmental, safety, and resettlement plans and 
adverse social impact mitigation.   
 
(v) 
The continued support to the ERTTP with the preparation of additional WTTPs, and their 
physical implementation.  
 
(vii) 
The continued support to ERA to enhance its capacity to plan, procure and administer 
civil construction and service contract, and manage contract claims and disputes, and 
training of ERA personnel in the areas of planning and programming, environment 
management,  and contract administration and management.  
 
(viii)     Preparation of follow up operations in Stages 3, including feasibility of private sector 
participation in financing and implementation of road programs nationally as well as in 
Addis Ababa. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The roads are located in directions, from Addis, to the north, south and west of the capital (see 
names of the cities under project description).

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Road construction and rehabilitation has an impact on the environment, (water and air quality, 
land and hydrology, vegetation, etc). Although mainly beneficial to the local communities, road 
construction and rehabilitation will also have adverse impacts such as requirements of land which 
may be inhabited, cultivated or otherwise used in any way. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area
.
N/A
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant
)
The roads that are included in this 
project have been selected because they will link, or improve links, with otherwise isolated or 
remote communities. They were selected because they were considered the priorities.
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Ethiopia 
Roads Authori
ty has an environmental unit with considerable capacity. The five RAP’s for APL 
I, were prepared in collaboration with the unit. For APL II, an EIA and a RAP have been 
prepared to address environmental and social (safeguard) issues.   “
Environmental Management 
Guidelines for the Road Sector" as well as a "Resettlement Policy Framework" have been 
prepared, cleared and disclosed. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The 
major stakeholders are the local communities which will benefit from the upgraded roads. Other 
major stakeholders in the project are the Roads Authority and the Ministry. The affected people 
are part of a continuous consultation process which began when the roads were identified, and 
which continued during the EIA and social studies which lead to the RAP. During 
implementation of both the RAP and EMP, the local (affected) communities will play an 
important role in all different phases. The EIA and RAP have been disclosed in relevant public 
places and made available to all stakeholders (World Bank office, local government offices, 
ERA’s offices etc).
