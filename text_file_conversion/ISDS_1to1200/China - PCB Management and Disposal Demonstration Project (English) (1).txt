B.  Project Objective 
The objectives of this project is to (a) dispose PCB collected in the selected 
demonstration areas, (b) introduce disposal technologies in the demonstration areas, and (c) gain 
experiences that can be applied to the rest of China. 
Its principal outputs are (a) strengthening of management institutions and infrastructure 
in demonstration areas for PCB identification, collection, transport, storage, disposal, 
remediation and monitoring, (b) development and adoption of policies and instruments for the 
PCB management and disposal, (c) PCB disposal facilities, (d) collection and disposal of PCB in 
demonstration areas, (e) a replication program for the PCB management and disposal in the rest 
of China, and (f) information exchange and awareness raising throughout demonstration areas.
 
C.  Project Description 
This proposed demonstration project is designed as the first step in meeting China
’s 
commitment to PCB management and disposal in the country. This is a stand alone GEF full 
sized project and will follow standard Bank and GEF project processing procedures.  
Page  2
Preliminary design of the project consists of six components. These are:  
a. 
Institutional strengthening & capacity building,   
b.  Development of national and provincial PCB policy frameworks and enforcement 
modality, 
c. PCB management system from PCB identification, collection, packaging, 
transportation, storage, disposal, and evaluation of the process in the demonstration area,  
d.  Construction of PCB disposal facilities,  
e. 
Development of a monitoring and evaluation, and 
f. 
Design of a national replication program. 
The GEF CEO has approved the preparation grant (PDF-B) and the entry into GEF 
Pipeline for this demonstration project on November 13, 2003.
 
The PDF-B grant will support the 
following activities, which need to be finished within the next 6 months:  
a. 
Inception activities, including establishment of a working team in SEPA and 
conduction of a inception workshop (completed), 
b. 
Selection of demonstration areas (Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces are selected as 
the demonstration areas), 
c. 
Detailed PCB information collection in the demonstration areas,  
d. 
Related preliminary studies for the demonstration project, including (1) study on 
institution system and legal framework, (2) review the feasibility of the construction 
of a disposal center, (4) risk assessment and cost analysis of options available when 
PCB storage sites are identified, and (5) preliminary assessment of social, economic, 
and environmental impacts,  
e. 
Analysis and selection of PCB disposal technology, and 
f. 
Preparation of the financing plan and the operation mechanism. 
The output of the PDF-B will be the project brief with a number of supporting 
documents, which will be used to prepare the PAD and for the appraisal and negotiations of the 
project, specifically: 
a. 
Report on selection of demonstration provinces, 
b. 
Report on PCB collection, transport, storage, disposal, remediation in demonstration 
provinces, 
c. 
Assessment report on existing institutional/policy capacity in demonstration areas, 
d. 
Identification report on selection of PCB disposal technology and technical 
standards, 
e. 
Financing plan for the proposed project, 
f. 
Action plan of the project implementation, and 
g. 
A draft operation manual including a monitoring and evaluation plan. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
The selection principles should ensure that experience obtained be replicated and applied 
to other areas. Some basic criteria in the selection of demonstration areas are (1) comparatively 
longer history of PCB transport, storage, disposal, remediation at different levels of province, 
county, and district, (2) high level of PCB risks posed to both human health and the environment, 
(3) a better PCB management system at different levels of government -- province, county, and 
Page  3
district, (4) local economic development level, and (5) strong local government support. 
An inception workshop for the project was held in January 2004. At that workshop. 
Zhejiang province was selected as the demonstration province for the PCB project. In addition, 
Zhejiang and Liaoning provinces were selected as the two pilot provinces under the Italian PCB 
project. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
The POP team in the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) in SEPA is 
responsible for daily management of the project under the direction and guidance of a deputy 
director general in FECO. Other key players in the project include MOF, the National Electricity 
Grid Corporation and the local government as well as private sectors. SEPA, as the lead national 
agency, would fully and closely consult and collaborate with all other ministries, local 
government, and private sectors to guarantee their full involvement and participation.  The inter-
agency steering committee established under the NIP will guide and supervise this project in 
terms of coordination among various ongoing projects.

Safeguard Policy 
If Applicable, How Might It Apply? 
[YES] 
Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The main potential environmental impacts of the project would be the cleanup of 
the identified PCB storage sites and the construction of the PCB storage and 
disposal centers.  Environmental Assessment (EA) for  above impacts should 
follow both OP 4.01, BP 4.01, GP 4.01 of the Bank and Chinese EA procedures.  
Secondly, the potential environmental impacts of the project would come from 
the use of PCB disposal technology, which will also be identified through EA.

[TBD] 
Involuntary Resettlement (
OP
/
BP
4.12) 
Cleanup of the PCB storage sites and construction of new PCB storage and 
disposal centers in the demonstration province may entail impacts such as land 
acquisition and relocation of structures.  The project will either develop 
resettlement action plans if these sites are determined before appraisal or prepared 
a
policy framework to guide possible future resettlement planning if the storage 
sites are to be identified in the future. 
[TBD] 
Indigenous Peoples (
OD 4.20
)
The likely project sites in the demonstration province are urban or suburban areas.  
The possibility of affecting ethnic minority communities is small.  However, this 
would need to be confirmed through a screening exercise when the sites are 
determined.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION 
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN] 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental Management Plan will be 
developed for the cleanup of each identified PCB storage site and the construction of PCB 
storage and disposal centers.  
The cleanup of PCB storage sites and construction of new storage and disposal facilities 
may entail loss of land and structures.  At the moment, it is now clear yet whether these specific 
sites will be identified before appraisal or during project implementation.  If the former, all 
impacts would need to be identified and resettlement action plans prepared before appraisal.  If 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
 
Page  5
the latter, a resettlement policy framework will be developed before appraisal to guide future 
planning efforts. 
All sites will be screened for possible impacts on ethnic minority communities.  If such 
impacts are identified, they will be consulted with and participate directly in the impact 
assessment, development and implementation of the necessary mitigation measures.  All these 
will be documented in an ethnic minority people’s development plan. 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
Current Chinese environmental assessment procedures mandate that local (provincial and 
municipal) Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) have responsibility for (i) review and 
approval of environmental assessments and mitigation plans, and (ii) monitoring of projects and 
mitigation measures. Bank’s policies on public consultation and information disclosure will be 
followed during EA preparation. 
Project information will be disclosed to local population.  The affected population will 
participate in the identification and assessment of impacts, development and implementation of 
the mitigation measures.  The social safeguard documents (summarized version) will be 
distributed among the affected population, placed in local public libraries and in the Bank 
InfoShop.
