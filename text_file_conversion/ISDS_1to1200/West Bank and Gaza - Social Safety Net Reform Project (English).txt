A.2. Project Objectives 
To mitigate the impact of the social and economic crisis on the most vulnerable by 
protecting and promoting the human capital of poor children in the West Bank and Gaza 
is the immediate objective.  
 
This objective would be achieved 
b
y adding a conditional cash transfer (CCT) scheme to the existing  
Special Hardship Case (SHC) program in MOSA. The SHC program currently helps the poor and 
vulnerable families with regular cash assistance, food donations and health insurance provision. The CCT 
objectives would be accomplished by supporting the investment of very poor and vulnerable households in 
the education of their children age 6-18 years and in the health and nutrition of their children age 0-6 years, 
in addition to other benefits SHC may provide to them. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The proposed project would expand the existing Special Hardship Case (SHC) program, i.e. social 
assistance, managed by the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) by adding a new conditional cash transfer 
(CCT) scheme to support families in the first consumption decile. The project would include three 
components: (a) financing of conditional cash transfer grants; (b) capacity building of ministries involved 
in social safety planning, administration, and evaluation; and, (c) administration, and monitoring of the 
project. The project would be implemented over a period of four years. 
Component 1: Conditional Cash Transfers (US$28 million). 
The project will provide 
a basic cash assistance grant and education and health/nutrition grants to about 30,000 
poor households (180,000 individuals), who are within the first consumption decile for 
the duration of the project. This would include eligible members of the approximately 
20,000 households, beneficiaries of the current SHC program (approximately 120,000 
individuals). It would provide estimated cash assistance to an additional 10,000 poor 
households or 60,000 individuals kee

The beneficiaries will receive on average a total benefit equivalent to 20% of the poverty 
line.  
Component 2: Capacity Building (US$ 1.2 million). 
Capacity building is required to be 
able to  better target beneficiaries, track and monitor conditional cash transfer grants and 
beneficiary compliance with conditions. This component will strengthen the institutional 
capacity of MOSA, MOH, MOEHE, and others involved in the implementation of the 
program.  
Policy planning
 (US$ 0.3 million), to support MOSA in the development of an effective 
social assistance strategy for the West Bank and Gaza. This sub-component will assist the 
ministry to  (i) operationalize the priorities of an strategic plan; (ii) prepare a medium-
term social safety net plan; and, (iii) identify and design other welfare programs to 
specially react to crisis situations. In addition, the sub-component would assist in the 
reorganization of the system of social workers in the West Bank and Gaza. 
Training
 (US$ 0.3 million), to strengthen the knowledge and institutional capacity 
required to implement the conditions of the Program and to establish a more responsive 
social safety net that (i) would mitigate the effects of the ongoing conflict; and, (ii) would 
aim at preventing a further deterioration of the human capital in the West Bank and Gaza. 
In specific, the sub-component intends to improve the technical, administrative (e.g., 
financial management and procurement), and social work capacity of MOSA in order to 
implement the modified Special Hardship Case program. MOH, MOEHE and MOSA 
staff involved in the implementation of the project, including social workers, health staff 
and teachers, will be trained in the procedures, and compliance requirements of the 
modified SHC program. 
Equipment and MIS Strengthening
 (US$ 0.3 million) to finance hard- and software 
required for the project implementation in the health centers, schools, district offices of 
MOH, MOEHE, and MOSA as well as in the MIS Centers of MOSA (Gaza City and 
Ramallah). The project will ensure training in operating the equipment where necessary.  
Awareness campaign
 (US$ 0.3 million), to finance a public awareness and promotion 
campaign aimed at informing the general public, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders 
about the modification of the eligibility criteria of the SHC program. Consultants will be 
hired to design and implement the activities.  
Component 3: Project administration (US$ 0.8 million)
.  
Project management
 (US$ 0.5 million), to finance the implementation of the project. This 
includes financing of the operational costs of the project management unit, including staff 
costs, office equipment, and other administrative costs.  
Monitoring and evaluation
 (US$ 0.3 million) to measure the outcomes and outputs of the intervention. The 
sub-component will finance baseline surveys, and yearly external monitoring of the project 
implementation.

The concerned ministries will sit on the PA Oversight and Coordinating Committee for the 
project.  MOSA managers and staff will have a significant input into project design, which is 
being done on a joint planning basis.  MOSA social workers will also be involved in testing the 
design to ensure that it is operationally feasible, as will key managers and staff in the MOEHE 
and MOH as well as in the Post Bank.  A sample of existing SHC beneficiaries was consulted on 
design issues and that will continue during project preparation and implementation.
