                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To provide an economic empowerment training program for conflict-affected youth in three selected areas of South
                           Sudan through development of the curriculum, skilling of trainers and piloting the training.

                           C. Project Description
                           There is widespread agreement that livelihoods support for youth is a priority in South Sudan. Conflict-
                           affected youth, defined as those that participated in conflict either over time or in short engagements and
                           those whose lives were significantly altered by conflict, are a particularly vulnerable subset of the youth
                           group. Unfortunately, the livelihoods models primarily rely on traditional vocational training or TVET, which
                           has been found to be inaccessible to this group and not targeted for their needs. The proposed project aims
                           to redesign the approach taken in traditional livelihoods programming to provide more realistic and targeted
                           training for conflict-affected youth.

                                  Economic Empowerment Training of Conflict-Affected Youth




                           This project will develop the tools and trainers for a holistic suite of economic empowerment training
                           specifically adapted to the needs of conflict-affected youth and pilot this new approach through a set of
                           trainings for conflict-affected youth. The programming will be designed specifically for this vulnerable group,
                           with particular recognition of low literacy/educational attainment levels, challenges resulting from exposure
                           to traumatic experiences, and time-use cost-benefit realities. Traditional vocational training and TVET
                           programming has been found to be largely ineffective as it presupposes levels of literacy, employment
                           opportunities and long timelines of commitment which are not realistic for these youth. The innovative
                           approach being piloted here instead builds skills that allow for immediate use in their communities while
                           training for long-term economic flexibility and mobility.

                           The project will include development of the curriculum, the training of local national trainers, and the
                           piloting of the training with conflict-affected youth. In this manner the beneficiaries of the project will
                           include not only youth receiving training but also local tradespeople newly trained as trainers. The business

                           and pedagogical skills gained will increase their capacity to expand their businesses and train additional
                           youth as their business expands, as well as bring new approaches to their communities. This emphasis on
                           expanding the pool of local trainers is necessary to provide services in local dialects to non-English or Arabic
                           speaking individuals and developmentally preferable given the increased need for understanding of local
                           contexts and challenges in the local business communities.

                           The training will include elements of vocational skills with immediate usage at the rural and semi-urban
                           community level; imbedded entrepreneurship, cooperatives and business skills; functional
                           literacy/numeracy; life skills on personal conduct, business conduct and conflict mitigation; and psychosocial
                           support training. The skills training will cover both agrarian and non-agrarian options. This will build on the
                           work of Japan International Cooperation Agency’s (JICA) Project for Improvement of Basic Skills and
                           Vocational Training in Southern Sudan (SAVOT & SAVOT2) but in a manner that is accessible and digestible to
                           vulnerable conflict-affected youth.

                           This project is guided by the following Key Principles: i) adopt a holistic approach to vocational training
                           courses, integrating business skills and life skills as well as providing literacy, numeracy and English language
                           courses in parallel; ii) Ensure a market-based and business orientation of services; iii) Ensure vocational
                           training activities build upon traditional livelihoods; iv) Ensure conflict sensitivity; v) Ensure gender
                           sensitivity; vi) Employ community-based, participatory mechanisms; and vii) place a strong emphasis on
                           monitoring and evaluation.

                           The project includes three components: Component A: Training of Trainers, Component B: Pilot the Training
                           Approach & ToT Model through Training for Conflict-Affected Youth, and Component C: Project
