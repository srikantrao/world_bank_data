    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    The objective of the proposed Grant is to support Panama's Ministry of Health effort to integrate
    different national health information systems in order for better evidence-based policy and decision-
    making to ensure health service delivery to the areas most in need. The integration involves information
    systems for water and sanitation, zoonoses and vectors, different types of waste, pollution and
    environmental risks, among others.
    C. Project Description
    The Government of Panama implemented over the last two decades several initiatives to increase access
    to health services in rural populations, especially among comarcas, that achieved positive results. A key
    aspect for continuing strengthening the health system is the health information system. Data related to
    Panama's population health is currently collected by several different offices and governmental
    organizations. The health information system needs to be able to integrate all these different health
    sources for improving decision making and delivery of health services. In assessing the landscape and
    integration of different health information systems the project will ensure that information is
    disaggregated to be able to capture specific health data regarding vulnerable groups, particularly
    indigenous peoples. This will also help to create synergies with other World Bank initiatives in Panama
    targeting health services and indigenous peoples.
