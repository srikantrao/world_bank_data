A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overall goal of the program would be to support GOTN’s strategy of reducing rural poverty 
through support for productive activities and investments, using the CDD approach.  The 
objectives of the proposed project would be to empower the poor and improve livelihoods 
through: (a) developing and strengthening pro-poor local institutions/groups (including Village 
Panchayats); (b) building skills and capacities of the poor; and (c) financing productive demand-
driven sub-project investments.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project would include the following three components: 
 
Component 1 -  Village Livelihood Component  (US $ 124.6 million)
 -
This component would 
be the most important component of the project and consists of all activities involving the village 
community. The bulk of the project budget (90%) would be earmarked for this component. The 
Village Livelihood Component would consist of the following sub-components: 
 
(A.1)
 
Formation and strengthening of local institutions
 to support and develop inclusive, 
self-reliant, self-managed and sustainable, Community Organizations and their Federations 
for livelihoods improvement.  
 
Page  2
(A.2)
 
Village Fund
 
to improve the livelihoods of the poor, especially women and 
unemployed youth by linking them with potential productive investments capable of 
generating employment and income opportunities and provide support for the  specialized 
programs for the disabled and vulnerable. The fund would consist of the following two 
windows:  
 
(i) VPRC Fund
-
This sub-component would include those activities for which 
the village poverty reduction committee (VPRC) would be directly responsible 
and funds would be released directly to the VPRC. The funds could be utilized 
for: (a) Capacity Building of Village Institutions/groups to plan and implement 
sub-projects; (b) Seed Fund for New self-help groups and existing groups that 
have not previously received seed funding from any donor; (c) Skills 
Development Training and (d) Special Assistance to the Disabled and Vulnerable 
to identify and assist the most vulnerable, disabled and destitute in the village 
community and mainstream them socially and economically in the project 
activities and benefits.  
 
(ii)  Community Productive Investment Fund (CIF)
–
This sub-component would 
focus on productive investments on a matching grant basis. The community 
groups would develop the business proposals and implement the productive 
investment activities. The District Unit would appraise the investment proposals, 
and release funds directly to the Community Economic Groups (CEGs) in 
installments after signing Financing Agreement with the CEGs; and  
 
(A.3) Gram Panchayat Incentive Fund
 
to provide incentive to GPs (additional 10% of the 
Village Fund) to improve their governance by becoming more effective, pro-poor, 
accountable and responsive to the needs and demands of the village community especially 
the poorest, the vulnerable, the women and youth in the village.  
 
Component 2 - Institutional Strengthening (US$7.0 million)  -  
This component would 
support and strengthen the project teams at the state and district levels and also provide value 
added services for livelihoods and business support for establishing linkages and partnerships at 
the district and state level. 
 
Component 3 - Project Management
(US$8.4 million)
 This component will facilitate overall 
co-ordination, implementation, monitoring and learning of the project at state and district levels
.
It would include setting up and strengthening state level and district level project management 
units, and providing office infrastructure and logistical support.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
ENVIRONEMNTAL ASPECTS: 
The nature and the scale of the activities that will be supported under the TNEPRP are 
not likely to cause any potential large-scale, significant and/or irreversible adverse 
environmental impacts.  
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20): 
The districts in which the project will be implemented have Scheduled Tribe populations 
who are both dispersed and concentrated in their settlements. Owing to their small 
numbers 
–
1.04%
of
the total population and 2% in the project districts, there is need for 
them to well targeted and reached out so that they participate and fully benefit from the 
Project interventions. The project is also looking at other social groups in the village that 
are poor, vulnerable and need support. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
The environmental impacts associated with the anticipated future activities are not 
expected to be significant or adverse in the long-term, due to the nature and scale of the 
likely activities. Environmental aspects will be mainstreamed in the sub-project cycle to 
ensure that activities with significant adverse environmental impacts are not supported in 
the TNEPRP, and that the cumulative environmental impact of the activities is 
manageable. 
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20)
 
In the absence of specific focus on the Scheduled Tribes and other vulnerable 
communities under this project; the social disparities will grow further disadvantaging 
these groups. Therefore the project is actively seeking to work with the poor and 
vulnerable communities under the project to facilitate the development of strong 
institutions and opportunities for livelihoods enhancement.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
NA 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An Environmental Management Framework (EMF) has been devised to address the 
environmental issues and to mainstream them in the planning, design and implementation 
of sub-projects. The EMF comprises of an 
environmental appraisal procedure for 
categorization of sub-projects, activity-specific Technical Environmental Guidelines (TEGs) to 
address the environmental concerns associated with a range of activities likely to be supported by 
the TNEPRP, an environmental monitoring and evaluation plan, and the environmental awareness 
and sensitization components.  An organizational and process structure has been developed to 
ensure adequate and effective implementation of the EMF. 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20): 
A
Tribal Development Plan as envisaged under OD 4.20 has been developed which aims 
at building strong self reliant and self managing institutions of Tribals, and through these 
institutions enable them to access economic and social opportunities to overcome poverty 
and raise their living standards. The TDP has incorporated strategies identified during the 
Social Assessment, and a range of consultations on the major causes of their poverty and 
approaches and opportunities to overcome them. Based on the needs and issues identified 
by the Tribals, the Project has established a dialogue and working arrangements with the 
Health Department, the Forest Department and the Tribal Welfare Department to 
implement this project to maximize synergy and complimentarity. A comprehensive 
vulnerable people’ plan focusing on the aged, disabled and destitute is under preparation. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20): 
The Tribal Plan was developed based on consultations with the Tribal community – men, 
women and traditional leaders, NGOs, representatives from the departments of health, 
forests and tribal welfare.  The draft final plan has been circulated for responses and 
consultations have been organized for finalizing the recommendations and design.
