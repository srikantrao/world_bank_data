                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support activities to increase efficiency of
                           health expenditures and improve quality of care for priority NCDs
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed Project would include the following four components:
                           Component 1: Strengthening Capacity for Improved Health System Management. This component
                           seeks to build capacity to improve health system management by strengthening performance
                           monitoring and active purchasing, improving pharmaceutical sector management and supporting
                           complementary investments in information systems
                           Component 2: Improving efficiency in health institutions. This component seeks to improve

                           efficiency in health institutions by supporting the design and implementation of pay-for-performance
                           in primary care and activity-based payments at hospitals, and investing in improvements in surgical
                           and diagnostic capacities in the public sector, with a view to rationalizing expenditures on treatments
                           abroad.
                           Component 3: Improving Quality of Health Care. This component would focus on improving quality
                           of health care. It would include traditional investment financing for TA, training and goods by
                           monitoring of health parameters; further developing pharmacotherapeutic protocols, clinical practice
                           guidelines and clinical pathways; and strengthening and institutionalization of Continuous Medical
                           Education.
                           Component 4: Project Implementation - This component would support the operational costs of
                           implementing the proposed Project, including project coordination and supervision, monitoring and
                           evaluation (M&E), fiduciary management (financial and procurement), audits of Project’s accounts
                           and technical audits for verification of DLIs.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The location of the project is Montenegro. Most of the Project-related activities will focus on
                           institutional support, policy reform, procurement process reform and reform of the health information
                           system. As such, the activities will be environmentally-neutral and the physical works will be limited
                           to installation of hardware and software, and, if required, small-scale refurbishment of offices where
                           the equipment is to be installed. The offices for this purpose already exist and are located in
                           urbanized areas. There will be no construction of new office buildings.
                           As a part of the Project Component 2 the Project will finance civil works, which will be related to (a)
                           reconstruction of the space within the Clinical Center of Podgorica for the new surgery block; (b)
                           installation of spectroscopes in the designated laboratory of the Agency for Drugs located in
                           Podgorica, and (c) possible installation of other medical equipment and computer hardware including

                           related electricity works, which may be incidental and specific to locations. There will be no
                           physical civil works in protected areas, no works on or near registered and/or known cultural heritage
                           sites and no works outside the urban areas.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The Ministry of Health has already implemented World Bank funded project and additional
                           financing from 2003 to 2012. The Borrower is broadly aware of the Bank’s requirements related to
                           environmental safeguards. Although the implementing agency does not have staff fully familiar with
                           the current Bank’s environmental standards, the adequate professionals exist in the country, and will
                           be engaged for preparing and subsequently supervising the environmentally-related documents and
                           activities.

                             in country before the Project Appraisal. The same is true for site-specific EMPs for any other
                             works that are known and developed by Appraisal. Also prior to Appraisal a generic EMP will be
                             prepared for any other works (e.g. extension of day-surgeries in other medical centers) that are not
                             prepared by the time of Appraisal. Detailed site-specific EMPs will be subsequently developed
                             during detailed design stage, and incorporated into resulting Bidding Documents.

                             As the land for the extension of the Surgical Block is located in the already well defined and
                             fenced area of the existing Clinical Centre Podgorica, the main stakeholder, beside the Ministry of
                             Health, is the Clinical Center. Other stakeholders that will be notified and invited include
                             Municipal Transport and Infrastructure Department as well as the municipal companies in charge
                             of water supply, waste water, energy and solid waste. General public will be notified of the
                             meeting through announcement in the local media (newspaper and radio), at web sites and at the
                             notice boards in the municipal assembly building.
