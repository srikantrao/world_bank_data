B. Project Development Objective(s)
As the proposed Project will be using the ASPIRE framework, the project development objective is
same as for ASPIRE project. The project development objective is "to increase PV generation in
Maldives through private sector investment". The funding from the proposed Project will go towards
the outer and remote islands and will not be funding the same islands as under ASPIRE project
making the two projects complementary to each other.
C. Project Description
A. INVESTMENT FRAMEWORK FOR PROPOSED PROJECT:
Currently, Maldives has a cumulative installed PV based generation capacity of around 2 MW,
spread across several islands and programs. Under ASPIRE project, IDA and SREP resources are
being used to develop and implement an appropriate investment framework that will result in the
deployment of PV systems through private sector investments. The investment framework has


﻿already been developed and appraised taking into account government and institutional
considerations and informed by feedback from potential private investors based on market sounding
exercise. The ASPIRE Project has three main components through which the investment framework
is operationalized: (1) Technical Assistance Support to GoM for institutional capacity building and
O
Q)      preparation of prospective subprojects for offering to private investors, (2) Structuring and Delivery
of Tariff Buy Down for subprojects, and (3) Security Package to cover payment shortfalls and
termination payments. The components are targeted to make strategic use of the different funding
sources (IDA Guarantee, grants, GoM, and private sector funding) to push for increasing private
sector investments and risk taking in the PV sector. During appraisal of ASPIRE, it was
acknowledged that investment framework will be supplemented with the other funding sources as the
ASPIRE Project develops a pipeline and based on a track record.
The PV subprojects in remote islands under the proposed Project will receive support from the
provision of tariff buy down funded through SIDSDOCK grant and support from ASPIRE through a
security package consisting of an IDA Guarantee and additional payment security funded through
SREP grant. The proposed Project will not only look at the new solar projects for investments but
also look at the existing solar projects where the utilization of the already installed capacity could be
used efficiently, may be by adding storage.
As mentioned above, the proposed Project will use ASPIRE's investment framework as per which it
is expected that the key parameters of the subprojects supported by SIDSDOCK including
technology, economic and financial outcomes and environmental and social aspects will be
materially similar to ASPIRE subprojects. Use of ASPIRE's investment framework also implies that
the proposed Project will have similar design, contractual arrangements, and institutional
arrangement. Further to that, there is a necessity to create awareness and build technical capacity
within the utility/operator to efficiently use solar wherever available. For instance, in case of
Thinadhoo Island, the operators are backing down solar instead of diesel when the load is less. For
this, the proposed Project will benefit from technical assistance to GoM that will allow the continued
development of a pipeline of PV subprojects.
o
The design and structure of each subproject under the investment framework will be materially
similar, given the underlying and relatively simple roof or ground mounted solar PV generation.
Moreover, the proposed Project will benefit from lessons from the initial ASPIRE subprojects and
a       technical assistance provided through ASPIRE. As of now, the first subproject under ASPIRE project
is in process to be bid out.
Based on ASPIRE project, the proposed Project will fund tariff buy down with allocated funding (of
US$ 1 million) for subprojects in remote islands. The subprojects will be identified and prepared for
bidding by MEE and will be under the FENAKA. The subprojects will be bid out to the private
sector developers, who will be investing in and operating PV generations. The tariff buy down
mechanism in ASPIRE project has been provisioned to provide capital subsidy per installed MW to
the developer (and through him, to the utility) so that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) price
offered by the developer is in the range desired by the off-taking utility. Please note that the end-user
tariff is not being affected since that is determined independently, and is currently heavily subsidized.
The tariff buy down will go directly towards reduction in cost of power being purchased by the
utilities (STELCO/FENAKA). The actual tariff buy down level may be different, including complete
elimination of tariff buy down - based on market assessment for different subprojects. Tariff buy
down for larger island subprojects under ASPIRE was estimated to need a maximum of $300,000/
MW; but for the smaller islands where higher solar penetration may be targeted (than larger islands)


﻿cost of storage has to be factored in, so a higher tariff buy down may be needed. We estimate that the
US$1 million SIDSDOCK grant will support about 1 MW of capacity. Depending on project details,
and where the bids come in, the funding could stretch to more or less capacity additions. As
mentioned previously, the available funds under the proposed Project may also be used for
O
Q)      promoting efficient utilization of the already installed solar energy capacity (say by adding storage).
Disbursements under the Project could be linked to implementation milestones achieved by the
developer, such as, upon achieving financial closure, upon commissioning, upon first year of
successful operation, etc. This will be developed further based on the lessons learned from
experience of first set of sub-projects under ASPIRE.
The proposed Project will be administered by the Project Management Unit (PMU), within the MEE,
that has been created and already operating for ASPIRE project. The tariff buy down is expected to
be delivered in 1-3 installments either upon commissioning, or towards the end of the construction of
a particular subproject (i.e. after the rest of the investment has been completed).The lessons from the
initial subproject under ASPIRE will be built into the design of the subprojects under the proposed
Project.
Apart from the tariff buy down funded by SIDSDOCK and enhancing the existing installed solar
energy capacity, the proposed Project will also depend heavily on the security package as well as
capacity building assistance under ASPIRE as explained below. Further, it should be noted that the
funding from the proposed Project will go towards the outer and remote islands and will not be
funding the same islands as under ASPIRE project, implying that the two projects will be
complementary to each other and not competing with each other.
B. BUILDING ON ASPIRE PROJECT:
The security package under ASPIRE targets to develop 20 MW given the corpus of funds available
under the security package. The same security package under ASPIRE will be made available for
about 1 MW of installations under the proposed Project, as appropriate to mobilize private sector
investment.
The security package under ASPIRE mobilizes US$3.9 million of SREP resources alongside US$16
million of IDA Guarantee exposure to provide a total of US$19.9 million in security cover. It will
a      function as a combination of a funded escrow account and an IDA Guarantee to (i) backstop short
term payment delays by STELCO/FENAKA under Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), as well as
(ii) termination events caused by defaults for which either STELCO/FENAKA or GoM are
responsible. A US$3.9 million escrow amount is expected to cover up to 6 months of payments for
20 MW of installations and US$16 million of the IDA Guarantee will partially cover termination
payments for around 8 MW. In reality, it is expected that the level of support needed will taper down
over time; hence more MWs may be covered including the 1 MW installation under the proposed
Project.
The proposed Project will also build on the technical assistance component that is part of ASPIRE
project under which US$1.75 million is available to GoM for the following activities:
a.     TA for Enabling Private Investing in PV: This includes activities are creating an appropriate
environment for private investments and reducing preliminary subproject development costs. This
includes working with agencies such as MEE and the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA) on follow-
up work to implement the private sector policy and regulatory framework for RE subprojects, as well
as developing arrangements to guide both off-taker utilities and private sector investors. Such


﻿guidance will help the subproject stakeholders negotiate partnerships, agree on and comply with
standard contracts such as PPAs and rooftop leasing contracts, and reduce possibilities of conflict,
thus enabling the smooth execution of transactions in this energy sub-sector. Standard contracts
developed with ASPIRE support will also be used in the proposed Project.
O
U       b.     Institutional Capacity Building and Knowledge Sharing: This support is building local
institutional capacity for planning, implementing, operating, and monitoring power systems that are
able to absorb increasing amounts of renewable energy. In addition, Maldives is witnessing a sharp
increase in demand, and this initiative will address the need to provide necessary information,
training and knowledge sharing in the area of renewables and energy efficiency, so that electricity
production and use can be optimized. Since the stakeholders are same across the two projects - the
proposed Project and ASPIRE project - this component will directly benefit this Project.
c.     Development of Pipeline: An ongoing exercise to identify and prepare pipeline of
subprojects also covers potential subprojects in remote islands. Such islands are focus regions for the
proposed Project.
Identification of appropriate subproject sites, resource assessment, pre-feasibility work, as well as
aggregation of opportunities into saleable subproject bundles, which can be offered to private sector
through competitive bidding, is being supported.
d.     Project Management and Implementation Support: Provision of operational support for
project management, supervision, and monitoring will help in implementing the proposed Project.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
Locations are not known as of now but will be implemented in the outer islands. Exact location will
be decided based on the readiness of the islands

resettlement,
vi.    PS 6: Biodiversity conservation and
sustainable management of living natural
resources, and
vii.   PS 8: Cultural heritage.
All investments under this Project will need to
be in compliance with PS 1, PS 2, PS 3 and PS
4. Based on the environmental conditions of
specific buildings selected for the installation of
solar PVs and the impact area, the applicability
of PS 6 and PS 8 will be decided. Since the


﻿impact of the proposed Project is going to be
similar to that under ASPIRE, the Project is
being retained as environmental assessment
category B. The developers will be assessed on
their environmental and social management
systems. Project will carry out social and
environmental screening to identify any adverse
impacts of subprojects. Environmental
Assessments will be carried out, standard
contracts for EMPs will be developed and the
implementations of the mitigation measures will
be monitored. Implementation risks of such
interventions are considered to be low.
