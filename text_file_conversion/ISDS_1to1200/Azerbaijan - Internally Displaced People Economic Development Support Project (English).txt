B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The proposed ‘IDP Economic Development Support Project – IDP/EDS’, would, as a ‘Repeater 
Project’, replicate, and continue, the activities developed under, the ‘Social Fund for 
Development of IDPs -SFDI’ component of the ongoing ‘Azerbaijan Pilot Reconstruction 
Project’ (Cr.  31090-AZ), beginning around the time of  closing of  the latter on June 30, 2005.  
The objective of the SFDI component was to improve the living conditions and the living 
standards of the most vulnerable groups of IDPs through better access to basic social services 
and the creation of employment opportunities
.
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
IDP/EDS will have two main components: (a) identification, development, and implementation 
of community based micro-projects; and (b) financing of micro-credits through partner lending 
institutions. Micro-projects to be financed (average cost USD 35,000) typically include 
rehabilitation of schools and other local public and social service facilities, improvement of 
water supply and energy distribution systems, and housing renovations. Micro-credits (average 
size USD 300) through partner lending institutions would primarily be extended to IDPs who are 
Page  2
operating very small, usually informal, microenterprises in the trading, agriculture and service 
sectors.   
 
IDP/EDS  will be implemented by SFDI, the implementing agency for the existing project, using 
the same arrangements and procedures as for the existing project.  SFDI has currently a portfolio 
of about 180 micro-projects estimated to cost about USD 7.7 million that have already been 
identified but whose preparation could no be pursued due to lack of funding.  Discussions with 
other donor agencies revealed the existence of a sizeable additional stock of micro-projects that 
lack adequate funding and could also be incorporated in the proposed operation.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
[Guideline:  If the location is not yet identified, please indicate if there are alternative locations 
under consideration or how the location is to be determined during project preparation] 
 
The micro-project component of IDP/EDS will be national in scope and target IDP communities 
in urban and rural areas.  The micro-credit component will be limited to the Greater Baku area 
due to the limited operational coverage the formal banking sector has outside the capital city and 
the existence of similar operations in other areas of the country.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
[Guideline: Based on past experience and other available information]
 
In keeping with the procedures of the ongoing Pilot Reconstruction Project, possible 
environmental concerns will be addressed by SFDI during the selection, development, and 
implementation of micro-projects in accordance with the practices and procedures employed by 
SFDI for the existing project and described in the SFDI Operations Manual (OM). The OM will 
be revised to include a more detailed environmental management plan framework.  The 
environmental section of the OM will be disclosed to the public prior to appraisal. 
 
Each micro-project to be financed by IDP/ESD will be individually screened and reviewed by 
SFDI.  If necessary, appropriate mitigation measures will be incorporated into the project design 
and implementation. Micro-projects with identifiable significant negative impacts that cannot be 
mitigated in a cost effective manner will be a priori excluded from funding. The performance of 
SFDI in environmental assessment will be monitored by the Bank during supervision of 
IDP/EDS implementation and corrective measures taken if needed.

Comment: The project is a social-fund type operation 
 
Many of the micro-projects are expected to produce environmental benefits (for example 
reduction in erosion through proper road rehabilitation or small-scale wastewater treatment.) 
However, because the micro-projects are not pre-identified, there could be unforeseen 
environmental impacts during implementation.  An environmental review procedure for 
screening and assessing environmental impacts of micro-projects as well as developing 
mitigation plans will be developed in the Environment Management Plan Framework (EMPF) as 
part of the Operational Manual. Environmental assessments will be carried out for specific 
micro-projects and/or project sites as appropriate. The SFDI staff will include a qualified 
environmental specialist to oversee compliance with the EMPF.  Alternatives to specific micro-
projects will be considered and assessed during micro-project preparation and appraisal, as per 
guidelines provided in the Environment Management Plan Framework. 
 
The project will not be involved in any  resettlement activities relating to IDPs and the micro-
projects for which it would provide funding are limited in scope, have no adverse impacts on 
host communities, and would not require any land acquisition. OP 4.12 is thereby not triggered.

By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas
