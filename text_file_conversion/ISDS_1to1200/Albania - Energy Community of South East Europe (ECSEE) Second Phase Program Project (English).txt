B.  Project Objectives  
 
The Athens process aims at creating a functioning regional energy market in South East Europe, 
covering both electricity and gas.  The Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE) APL 
program supports the countries of South East Europe and Kosovo in the implementation of their 
electric power sector commitments under the Athens process.   The World Bank may propose a 
separate APL program for the gas part of ECSEE once the proposed electricity APL program is 
underway.    
 
The key objectives of the ECSEE are: 
 
ƒ
Create a stable regulatory and market framework capable of attracting investment to 
the region in gas networks and power system so that all states in the region have 
access to the stable and continuous energy supply that is essential for economic 
development and social stability;  
ƒ
Establish integrated regional markets in South East Europe, closely linked to the 
internal energy market of the European Union, and fully complying with the 
rules applicable within the European Union; 
ƒ
Enhance the energy security of supply of South East Europe and the European Union 
by providing incentives to connect the Balkans to Caspian and North African gas 
reserves; and 
ƒ
Improve the environmental situation in relation to energy in the region.

The APL program would be considered successful if the countries in the region are able to fulfill 
their obligations under the Athens process and improve power supply in the region.   The 
countries will have to continue ongoing restructuring and reform measures, build up their 
institutions and improve their power systems including interconnections so that regional trade can 
increase.   The APL2-
Albania project would facilitate Albania’s participation in ECSEE by 
providing relevant investment support.      
 
C.  Project Description 
 
ECSEE is a regional program and it is proposed that the Bank investment support be provided 
using the APL instrument, horizontally on a regional basis (to support up to eight countries and 
Kosovo) and vertically (each country can in principle receive support from more than one APL 
installment over the APL program period).   
 
The APL instrument, by visibly committing substantial resources and complementing activities 
supported by other donors, would help ensure the availability of adequate resources to fund 
priority investments for a functioning electricity market.    The APL instrument would enable the 
Bank to provide support in a flexible manner – when individual countries have met the policy 
triggers (mostly country criteria under the Athens process) and when individual projects are ready 
to receive Bank support.  All countries might not actually borrow under the APL program, some 
might not be able to meet the eligibility criteria within the program period and some might not 
require Bank financing.  However, countries would know up-front that they can rely on the Bank 
to support them in achieving the goals of the ECSEE if they meet specific eligibility criteria and 
if they need Bank support. 
 
The key policy and institutional elements for the APL program have been defined and established 
in the Athens process.   ECSEE is a regional program, with strong country commitment and with 
well-established coordination mechanisms at the highest political level (a Ministerial Council), at 
the level of regulators and transmission companies in the region, as well as among donors 
supporting the program, plus a the South East Europe Energy Regulation Forum (the Athens 
Forum) which brings them all together with other stakeholders.   The APL program will enable 
the Bank to provide regional financial support, yet financing can be tailored to the needs of 
individual countries to help them meet their commitments to ECSEE.   
 
The Bank’s March 2004 framework paper 
1
highlights that significant investments are required in 
power generation, transmission and distribution for a well-functioning power market.   The Bank 
would therefore be prepared to consider a broad range of investments for support under the APL 
program:   
 
ƒ
The bulk of the projects is expected to be transmission links (lines and/or 
substations), system reinforcements and power system dispatch and 
communication system upgrades. 
ƒ
In line with the Athens Memorandum, the Bank would also support generation plant 
rehabilitations in cases where the priority and cost-effectiveness of the 
renovations can be readily established.   Such projects offer one of the best 
approaches to provide ancillary services to power system operators, by restoring

Europe, EMT Discussion Paper No. 12, March 2004.

capacity and improving plant availability and ability to follow dispatch 
instructions from system operators.  
ƒ
In power distribution, the Bank would consider support for special programs, such as 
metering and/or telecommunications, which are designed to quickly enhance 
revenue realization and/or coordination and communications capabilities of 
distribution utilities so that they can more effectively participate in the regional 
power market.    
ƒ
Along with the investments, APL projects could finance a wide range of technical 
assistance, for institutional/systems development and project preparation and 
implementation.  TA needs are significant, particularly in the development of 
market operators and their systems. 
 
It is currently expected that the APL2-Albania project will consist of: 
 
ƒ
Replacement of the high-voltage equipment and upgrading of the control and 
protection equipment in two transmission substations; replacement of the high-
voltage equipment in three transmission substations; and upgrading of the control 
and protection equipment in three transmission substations; and  
ƒ
technical assistance for strengthening the Transmission System Operator, project 
implementation, and streamlining procurement of electricity imports. 
 
D.  Project location  
 
The substations of Burreli, Fieri, Tirana 1, Elbasan 1, Elbasan 2, Vau Dejes, Fierza and Komani.
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
Substantial institutional capacity to implement the Bank’s safeguard policies has been developed 
by KESH through the implementation of five previous projects.  KESH has established and is 
strengthening an environmental cell with technical assistance financed under the Power Sector 
Rehabilitation and Restructuring Project. 
 
The Bank’s standard environmental requirements will apply to the APL2-Albania.

The classification of the overall ECSEE APL program is FI.   The APL2-Albania project consists 
entirely of replacement of existing equipment in the existing locations.  There would be no land 
acquisition. The environmental issues to be addressed are expected to be: avoidance of PCBs in 
equipment purchased under the project; ensuring that sewage water from substations is properly 
disposed of; movement of men, materials and equipment during construction/erection (noise, 
dust); and minimizing noise and communication interferences during operation.  Although the 
environmental impact is expected to be minimal, a Category B is being assigned to the project.
