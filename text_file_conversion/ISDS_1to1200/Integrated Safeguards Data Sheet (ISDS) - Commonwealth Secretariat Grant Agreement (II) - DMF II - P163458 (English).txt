                           To strengthen capacity of DMF-eligible countries to manage debts effectively, so as to enable governments to finance
                           their operations prudently with appropriate cost-risk mix to contribute to macro-economic stability and ensure
                           sustainable debt levels over the long term.

                           finance their operations prudently with appropriate cost-risk mix to contribute to macro-economic stability
                           and ensure sustainable debt levels over the long term.

                                 1. Assessment of debt management situation in Eligible Member Countries through application of the
                                    Debt Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA) tool to provide information relevant to debt
                                    management in a specific country.
                                 2. Design of debt management reform plans, particularly country-owned capacity building plans which
                                    detail expected outputs, outcomes, actions, sequencing and milestones and provide estimated
                                    budget and resources required to implement the plans, and which aim to alleviate the weaknesses
                                    identified and analyzed by assessments, including the DeMPA.
                                 3. Provision of technical assistance in Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy (MTDS) development
                                    for formulating and implementing a debt management strategy for the medium term.
                                 4. Strengthening capacity of Eligible Member Countries in the application of the Joint Bank-IMF Debt
                                    Sustainability Framework (DSF) through provision of regional training.
                                 5. Design of domestic debt market development plans through identifying strengths and weaknesses of
                                    debt markets and guiding the debt market reform process taken at the government’s request by
                                    building on the “Local Currency Bond Market-A Diagnostic Framework”.
                                 6. Organization of and participation in regional training events and development of related knowledge
                                    products for such events.
