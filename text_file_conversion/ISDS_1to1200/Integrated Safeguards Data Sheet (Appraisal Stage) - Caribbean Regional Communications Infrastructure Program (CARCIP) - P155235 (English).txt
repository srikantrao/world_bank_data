                            3. Project Description
                           The proposed CARCIP Nicaragua Project is structured in line with the broader CARCIP, taking into

                                                                     Page 1 of 11
                         consideration the country➢❨ s specific needs, while prioritizing regional actions. The proposed
                         Project will finance the following three Components:
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Component 1: Regional Connectivity Infrastructure (US$7.8 million). The objectives of this
                         Component is to fill key gaps in broadband connectivity on the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua, so as
                         to contribute to improved regional telecommunications linkages. This component will support
                         bridging priority gaps in the regional broadband communications infrastructure, which will be
                         deployed in Nicaragua➢❨ s Caribbean Coast, an area with one of the lowest Internet penetration rates
                         and one of the highest poverty rates in LAC. It will provide connectivity for at least 44 locations,
                         including schools and health centers, several universities, and public entities and cooperatives. The
                         new infrastructure will benefit about 110,000 people on the Caribbean Coast, increasing the
                         broadband penetration in the area by 14 percent, with regional spillovers in the Caribbean region by
                         strengthening the regional broadband network.

                         Component 2: ICT-enabled Innovation (US$ 11.8 million). The objective of this Component is to
                         boost human capacity and business development under a regionally harmonized framework and
                         approach, so as to generate employment and position the region and Nicaragua in particular, as a
                         destination of choice for IT/ITES businesses. This Component finances three subcomponents aimed
                         at: (i) enhancing the enabling environment for fostering a productive use of the broadband
                         infrastructure, including the IT/ITES industry, (ii) creating an IT/ITES skills development and
                         certification program; and (iii) fostering an ICT innovation ecosystem.

                         Subcomponent 2A: Enabling Environment Program (US$1.2 million). This subcomponent seeks to
                         establish a harmonized framework at the Regional level that ensures and promotes the productive use
                         of the broadband infrastructure. To do so, policy, regulatory, institutional and advisory support will
                         be provided to main stakeholders in the country, such as TELCOR or ProNicaragua, to foster the
                         productive use of the connectivity infrastructure (component 1), and of the ICT- enabled innovation
                         (Component 2).

                         Subcomponent 2B: IT/ITES Skills Development and Certification Program (US$9.4 million). This
                         subcomponent will help the IT/ITES industry from Nicaragua and the Caribbean Region to compete
                         globally by increasing the quantity, and improving the quality of skilled manpower. This
                         subcomponent will finance a skills development and certification program for areas with significant
                         market potential, and in line with the industry➢❨ s needs and requirements.

                         Subcomponent 2B will establish and implement a program to support critical IT/ITES skills
                         development in both Nicaragua and the wider Caribbean region. The skills development program
                         will aggregate demand for training from companies and individuals to ensure lower training and
                         certification program costs, and thus increase the availability of high quality training. This program is
                         intended to create middle income IT/ITES jobs in the long term, including those that require a
                         medium level of education (i.e. Micro Task, Online Freelance, Business Process Outsourcing, and
                         Animation), and more complex profile jobs in Information Technology and Knowledge Processes.
                         Skills development and certification will include four sets of competencies: (i) technical; (ii) soft
                         skills, such as communication, negotiation, and innovation; (iii) English skills; and (iv) freelancing
                         and online talent platform use.

                         The estimated number of beneficiaries under this subcomponent is more than 5,500 people (of which
                         70% are estimated to obtain an internationally recognized certification), and the expected number of


                                                                      Page 2 of 11
                         training courses is more than 200. Trainees may include current IT/ITES employees who want to
                         upgrade their skills, students, professors, or potential candidates to join the IT/ITES industry. The
                         number of internationally recognized certified manpower is the way the IT/ITES industry globally,
Public Disclosure Copy




                         measures the quality of the manpower. Special emphasis will be put on making training and
                         certification accessible to women by ensuring that by the end Project, 50 percent of beneficiaries of
                         the training are women.

                         Subcomponent 2C: ICT Innovation Ecosystem (US$1.2 million). This subcomponent will support
                         the overall CARCIP strategy to increase the region➢❨ s potential for innovation. The Caribbean
                         region lacks a competitive and vibrant environment for technology innovation. There is limited
                         capacity for and scale of research and development (both physical and human), entrepreneurship is
                         low, and national markets are generally too small to attract significant investment and establish
                         sustainable ICT-based value chains. A regional approach is required to generate the scale needed to
                         address these challenges. Some CARCIP countries are already investing in business incubators.

                         The subcomponent will finance the creation and operation of a university-industry collaboration
                         platform for regional innovation. This ➢❨ platform➢❨ will consist of physical facilities and human
                         resources that will link young talent to the private sector and universities. The specific activities to
                         be financed are (i) small works contracts to rehabilitate two sets of office facilities, one in Managua
                         and the other in Bluefields (which will be provided by universities), including supplying them with
                         telecommunications links; (ii) small goods contracts to equip these facilities with furniture,
                         computers, and other equipment; (iii) consultancy contracts for training and technical assistance,
                         including facilitators for these centers and other skills for users; and (iv) contracts with specialized
                         providers to adapt and operate successful models from other countries of open innovation systems.

                         To broaden the scope of the intervention beyond university students participating in the platform, this
                         subcomponent will also finance the creation of two open collaboration spaces. These would aim to
                         stimulate communities of entrepreneurs through a series of open innovation events, such as
Public Disclosure Copy




                         hackathons and community building activities. For these, the subcomponent will finance: (i)
                         repurposing of existing physical spaces into open collaboration spaces for connecting key
                         stakeholders; (ii) consultancy contracts for training and technical assistance, including facilitators for
                         these centers and other skills for users; and (iii) consultant contracts for specialized open innovation
                         events. Entrepreneur communities from different CARCIP countries will be involved in the process,
                         including through joint events.

                         Component 3: Project Implementation Support (US$2.60 million). The objective of this Component
                         is to provide resources for Project implementation through a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). It will
                         also finance oversight arrangements and capacity building for key policy and regulatory institutions,
                         and in particular, Nicaragua➢❨ s participation in: i) quarterly CARCIP Steering Committee
                         Meetings; and ii) up to twelve regional training sessions for the harmonization of ICT policies among
                         CARCIP countries.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The connectivity infrastructure will be deployed in the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. There exist
                         several areas within this Region that could be categorized as environmental sensitive areas. There
                         also exists several indigenous communities in the Departments of the Caribbean Coast that could be
                         affected by the deployment of infrastructure, and includes the following departments: RACCS
                         (RegiÃ³n AutÃ³noma de la Costa Caribe Sur), RACCN (RegiÃ³n AutÃ³noma de la Costa Caribe


                                                                       Page 3 of 11
                         Norte), and five municipalities of Rio San Juan.

                         The project area is a vast territory with lack of roads, infrastructure and limited access to basic

                         services (water, sewer, electricity, and telephone) and mainly collective transport. In many areas, the
                         only available routes, used by communities for generations, have been the rivers, as most of them sit
                         on the banks of rivers or coastal areas.

                         The project plans to deploy two different types of telecommunications infrastructure depending on
                         the necessities of the areas. The deployment of infrastructure could have very specific impacts, which
                         are expected to be low to moderate, on the environment, areas of natural reserves or forests, are, low
                         to moderate intensity. The team is studying all the possible situations for mitigating the possible
                         negative effects in these areas from the deployment of the infrastructure.

                         Infrastructure 1. Tower: The towers include shelter telecommunications equipment and there exists
                         two types, self-supported and braced. The team has estimated that for being able to cover the
                         population estimated the operator should install 14 towers.

                         Infrastructure 2. Deployment of Fiber Optic. There exists two methods for the deployment of the
                         infrastructure, aerially through existing electric posts, using the existing power lines of the country
                         wherever is possible; and through the deployment of underground cable. The team has estimated that
                         a total length of 255 km of fiber optic would be needed for covering the communities expected in the
                         project.

                         The exact location of the works that are going to be done have not been determined due to the fact
                         that the only requirement that will be specify in the bid documents is the communities that need to be
                         covered and have service. The specific technology to be used and the location of the infrastructure
                         will depend on the contractors choice.

                         The construction of the planned infrastructure could involve sensitive or critical environmental areas

                         (eg national parks, forests, wetlands, etc). The deployment of the infrastructure could also affect
                         some properties of the soil (eg, crops) and private infrastructure (fences, houses, etc.). Environmental
                         measures to prevent, mitigate and/or compensate potential negative impacts should be included in the
                         Environmental Management Plan (EMPs) of each subproject. Also, measures to mitigate possible
                         effects on resettlement should be included in the Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs).

                         Due that the specific location of the subprojects is not known, an environmental and social
                         frameworks were developed during the project preparation stage: 1) Environmental Management
                         Framework (EMF), 2) Indigenous and Afro-descendent People Framework (IAPF), and 3)
                         Involuntary Resettlement Framework (IRF); according with the Bank➢❨ s safeguards requirements.
                         Additionally, the subprojects should comply with the national and regional environmental and social
                         law and regulations, and the Bank➢❨ s safeguards policies.

                             If the deployment of fiber optic is through existing ➢❨ communication space➢❨ or in conduits in
                             transportation ROWs environmental negative effects will not be significant.

                             The main possible negative environmental and social impacts will be during the construction of
                             the telecommunications infrastructure. The main negative effect when using aerial fiber optic


                                                                       Page 7 of 11
                           infrastructure is the visual impact during the implementation of the project . When deploying new
                           under-ground or aerial fiber optic the project should be classified as A or B+, according with the
                           EMF classification. In these cases the project will need an Environmental Impact Assessment

                           (EIA) or an Environmental Valuation (EV), as required in the Nicaraguan national law and the
                           CARCIP➢❨ s ESMM. No large scale or irreversible impacts under CARCIP are expected.

                           Regarding people affected under the project (PAPs), the construction of new communication tower
                           and optical fiber (under ground or aerial), potentially will affect people along the line and the
                           places where the towers will be constructed. People could be affected physically or economically
                           (in the case of crops affectation). In these cases the specific subproject will trigger the OP/BP 4.12
                           and there will be required a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) according with the specific
                           Framework included in the ESMM called Involuntary Resettlement Framework (IRF). Specific
                           location of the towers and fiber optic lines are not known during the project preparation. When a
                           specific subproject requires a RAP, this instrument should be implemented before the construction
                           starts. No large scale or significant resettlement impacts are expected under CARCIP.

                           Finally, regarding indigenous group, some of the direct beneficiaries of the project will be
                           indigenous and afro-descendants communities located in the Caribbean Coast Region of
                           Nicaragua. Most of them are ➢❨ Misquitos➢❨ and ➢❨ Mayagnas➢❨ , which preserve their own
                           traditions and legal structures. No significant negative impacts are expected for these communities
                           but these groups could be potentially affected f by the towers and fiber optic construction. In order
                           to assure the proper participation of these groups an Indigenous and Afro-descendent People
                           Framework (IAPF) was prepared for the CARCIP-Nicaragua. When the specific subproject
                           triggers this safeguard, a specific Indigenous and Afro-descendent Plan (IAP) should be developed
                           during the subproject design.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           Given the characteristic and physical footprint of the subprojects, there are no significant indirect

                           or long-term impacts.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Project alternatives will be considered during the evaluation of subprojects at implementation
                           stage, especially in the definition of the right of way of the fiber optic and the location of the
                           telecommunication towers.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The borrower has previous experience with World Bank safeguards policies (Nicaragua Rural
                           Telecom ➢❨ P089989). After the Mid Term Review of the previous project the PCU implement
                           some environmental and social management tools in order to comply with the
                           Bank➢❨ ssafeguards policies. The PCU➢❨ s Technical Safeguard Team (TST) has prepared the
                           Environmental and Social Management Manual (ESMM), which includes the specific Frameworks
                           in order to fulfill with the Bank➢❨ s Safeguard Policies: Environmental Management Framework
                           (EMF); Involuntary Resettlement Framework (IRF); and Indigenous and Afro-descendent People
                           Framework (IAPF), following the Bank➢❨ s requirements for this type of projects although the
                           exact location of the infrastructure is unknown at this stage. These Frameworks should be applied
                           during the implementation of all the activities under CARCIP-Nicaragua project.



                                                                      Page 8 of 11
                           The TST of the PCU will support the environmental and social management during the CARCIP
                           implementation. This team includes 3 environmental specialists, and 2 social specialists. This
                           mentioned team has already worked in the implementation of the previous project, Rural Telecom

                           (P089989) and has proved enough experience on Bank➢❨ s safeguards policies and in the
                           application of the national and regional environmental and social regulation and policies.

                           As mentioned before, the ESMM, including the safeguards Frameworks, has been developed
                           during the project preparation and has been approved and disclosed by the Bank's Infoshop and
                           TELCOR, in compliance of the Bank➢❨ s information and disclosure policy.

                           As mentioned in the project description, Component 3, the Project also include resources to
                           strength the capacity building of the UCP-TELCOR safeguard team, in order to assure the proper
                           environmental and social management during the project implementation.
                           Before project implementation some specific training at the internal level in the use and
                           application of the safeguard management tools included in the EMF has been planned, in order to
                           assure a good environmental and social management during project implementation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The main stakeholders are: TELCOR and the PCU; the Operators (Claro, others); Contractors
                           (empresas torreras); SERENA as the regional environmental authority in the RegiÃ³n AutÃ³noma
                           Costa Caribe Norte (RACCN) and RegiÃ³n AutÃ³noma Costa Caribe Sur (RACCS); MARENA as
                           the national environmental authority; the Regional Governments in the RACCN and RACCS; the
                           Municipalities at the local level; and the Communities and the Indigenous Territories.

                           The mechanisms of participation, consultation, and disclosure, is included in the Environmental
                           Management Framework (EMF) and in the Indigenous and Afro-descendent People Framework
                           (IAF), both included in the ESMM.
