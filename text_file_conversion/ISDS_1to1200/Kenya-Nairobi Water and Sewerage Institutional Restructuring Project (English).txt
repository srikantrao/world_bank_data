A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objective of the proposed project is to build a strong governance, 
institutional and service delivery framework that will enable the efficient and sustainable 
delivery of water and sewerage services to the population of Nairobi.   
 
The project will support the creation and strengthening of new autonomous and ring-
fenced service provision utilities – with clear roles, responsibilities and contractual 
arrangements.  The key outcome will be an institutional framework that is capable of 
delivering affordable services to all strata of the Nairobi population in accordance with 
commercial and sustainable principles.  Progress towards achieving the development 
objective will be monitored principally through the percentage reduction in financial 
operating deficits of the service delivery institutions throughout the project 
implementation period. 
 
The GOK’s 
Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation
 
(ERSWEC) – GOK’s PRSP – calls for the implementation of structural reforms to make 
water and sewerage services autonomous (including introducing commercial and private 
sector principles), mobilize investment for construction and rehabilitation, and enter into 
partnerships with community based organizations to expand services to the urban poor 
and rural communities.  The Project directly contributes to GOK’s Poverty Reduction 
Strategy by supporting the implementation of these reforms.  The Project represents one 
of the first GOK implementation of the institutional arrangements in the Water Act 
(2002), the main vehicle by which the GOK will carry out structural reforms in the 
sector.  A successful implementation of the Water Act (2002) would lead to a harmonized 
institutional and service deliver

 framework for the WSS sector in Ken
y
a.  Success in 
Page  3
 
 
implementing this Project is likely to lead to a scaling up of the institutional reforms in 
the sector especially with regard to the large urban cities. 
 
The proposed Project is fully consistent with the strategy outlined in the CAS (Document No. [tbd] dated 
[March 2004] – 
awaiting approval of new CAS
).  The CAS aims to support GOK’s 
Economic Recovery 
Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation
 (ERSWEC). The CAS determines that deteriorated 
infrastructure based services including water and sewerage seriously impacts the private sector’s ability to 
contribute to Kenya’s economic growth. The CAS targets the Bank’s contribution to GOK’s sector strategy 
by focusing on the setting up and operationalization of new service delivery institutions in Nairobi capable 
of delivering sustainable services.  In this way, the Bank envisage to contribute to the successful reform of 
the sector through full implementation of the Water Act 2002, creating autonomous and professionally 
managed institutions to provide sustainable service delivery framework.  
 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project has the following three major components, with a total project cost of 
US$16.9 million equivalent (including contingencies of about US$1.5 million), of which 
IDA will finance about US$15.6 million and the Government will contribute with about 
US$1.3 million. 
 
Component 1:
  
Institutional Strengthening of New Service Delivery Framework (about $5.6 million 
excluding contingencies)
.
 
This component will support the setting up and operationalization of (i) a new 
autonomous asset holding entity - Nairobi Water Services Board (NWSB); and (ii) a new autonomous and 
ring-fenced water and sewerage service provision company for Nairobi.  The new institutions will be 
appropriately strengthened to ensure professional management and commercial operations. 
 
Component 2:
  
Immediate Services Delivery Improvement Program (about US$6.2 million excluding 
contingencies)
.  This component will support selected activities aimed at strengthening the commercial, 
financial and technical operations of the service provision company – Nairobi City Water and Sewerage 
Company (NWSC). The focus will however be on strengthening the commercial operation of the six 
area/business centers.  Some tangible service improvements to consumers are expected and specific service 
improvement targets will be set for the new institutions in the duration of the Project.
 
  
Component 3:  
Project M&E, Consultations and Communications, and Preparation of Follow-on Program 
(about US$3.6 million excluding contingencies)
. This component will support monitoring of project 
activities, implementation of a complementary communication program in support of the new institutional 
transformation in services provision as well as support the preparation of a follow-on investment program 
in Nairobi and Mombasa. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will support water and sewerage institutional restructuring in the Nairobi city 
area.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
This is meant to be a ‘short and quick’ institutional restructuring project (2-3 years) in 
preparation for larger future capital investment activities. Under the proposed 
institutional restructuring project, there will be no civil works, but only refurbishment of 
office space and set-up of equipment, replacement of components on distribution 
systems, spare parts for electromechanical equipment, replacement and provision of new 
laboratory equipment, transport vehicles and utility equipments. Thus, the project is not 
likely to have any adverse environmental impact and  none of the safeguard policies will 
be triggered.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
N/A 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As the project will focus on institutional restructuring aspects which will lead to a new 
and sustainable service delivery institutional framework, there will be no safeguard 
issues.   
 
A separate follow-on project is envisaged which will involve large capital investment 
activities. The proposed institutional restructuring project will provide for the 
environmental and social impact studies associated with the follow-on project, to be 
conducted by environment and social specialists. Under the follow-on project, it is 
expected that the majority of the works will be carried out and supervised through private 
sector contracting arrangements. The executing/contracting agency will employ an 
environmental specialist to supervise and ensure compliance with environmental 
standards and safeguards. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
In view of the project’s focus on institutional restructuring, there will be no consultation 
or disclosure requirements with regard to safeguards.
