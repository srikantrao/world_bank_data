                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective is to increase access to justice sector services for poor Jordanians,
                           particularly women, and refugees in host communities through innovative service delivery reforms
                           where public sector services are strained by hosting of refugees.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project supports the SPF strategic objectives by: i) supporting measures to improve
                           governance through service delivery improvements involving partnerships between government and
                           civil society and enhancing institutional performance of the Family Protection Departments and the
                           Legal Aid Referral Unit of the Ministry of Social Development; ii) responding to the needs of
                           vulnerable Jordanians and refugees by providing more effective means to resolve legal problems that
                           exacerbate poverty/exclusion and increase tension between hosting communities and refugees; and
                           iii) increasing the knowledge base for successful interventions in resolution of legal problems for
                           communities affected by hosting large numbers of refugees. Successful piloting of legal aid services
                           will lay the foundation for improved service delivery and could be translated into more systematic
                           reforms benefiting all of Jordan.

                           It consists of two components:

                           Component 1 – This component will pilot a legal aid referral system by the Justice Center for Legal
                           Aid (JCLA) within the Ministry of Social Development (MoSD). MoSD provides services primarily
                           to women, thus most beneficiaries will be women. Roughly 70% of JCLA beneficiaries of legal aid
                           are women. A referral unit will be established to refer MoSD clients to legal aid (information,
                           counseling and legal representation) providers, such as JCLA, to resolve legal problems related
                           primarily to family law (alimony, child support, child custody), juveniles charged with crimes,
                           domestic violence and access to National Aid Fund benefits. These services will be provided to poor
                           Jordanians and refugees. Capacity-building activities will also be conducted with MoSD and JCLA
                           staff to ensure proper management of the referral unit.

                           Component 2 – This component will pilot legal aid offices managed by JCLA attached to units of the
                           Family Protection Department (FPD) of the Ministry of Interior. The FPD was established under the
                           Law on Domestic Violence, and are a one-stop shop for addressing domestic violence complaints
                           through intake, investigation by the police, and access to medical and social services. The
                           beneficiaries of its services are mostly all women. To enhance their work, FPD would like to include
                           the provision of legal aid services to the one-stop model that will allow poor women to initiative
                           criminal complaints against their abuses, and obtain civil protection orders (restraining orders)
                           guaranteeing them access to their homes and expedited access to alimony, child support and child
                           custody. The pilot will involve establishment of legal aid units in Amman, Mafraq and Aqaba. The
                           centers in Amman and Mafraq will allow FPD offices to cope with increased cases linked with
                           refugee communities.
