                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective of this grant fund is to strengthen Government of Bihar’s institutional
                           capacity and tools/models in operational flood forecast and inundation modeling, and community
                           outreach for flood risk management in Bagmati-Ahwara basin, within the Ganges basin.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project design primarily would focus on improving the flood forecasting capacity of WRD/GoB
                           through development of appropriate models including strengthening existing model in Baghmati-
                           Adhwara basin, operational use of ensemble rainfall forecasts and assimilation of satellite based
                           near-real time rainfall estimates, improving community outreach, and institutionalizing modeling
                           capacity within the WRD.

                           Activity 1: operationalization and use of ensemble rainfall forecasts and satellite based near--real
                           time rainfall estimates
                           Activity 2: The flood forecast model developed in FMIS2 will be extended from Hayaghat to Dumri,
                           confluence with Kosi river
                           Activity 3: Setting up Open Source Distributed Flood Forecasting Models to compare and improve
                           modeling capacities of FMIS.
                           Activity 4: Community based flood risk management
                           Activity 5: Capacity Building, Training and Outreach

                           The key issues to meet Development Objectives include flood forecast modeling in a data-poor
                           environment in a shared basin, use of free-to-use modeling software to enable scaling up in the
                           Ganga basin, enabling community based flood management through targeted and timely flood alerts,
                           and institutionalizing modeling capacity through trained modeling team.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The TA will aim at strengthening flood modeling capacity in Water Resources Department (WRD)
                           of Government of Bihar (GoB) to improve flood forecast in the target area of Bagmati-Adhwara
                           basin in North Bihar. The technical activity will include: preparation of flood forecast model for the
                           basin; effective community outreach through innovative mobile technologies; and capacity building
                           of Water Resources Department of Government of Bihar.

                           The basin is highly flood prone and flood alerts based on the model will improve community and
                           institutional preparedness and consequently help minimize loss of property and lives. No physical
                           intervention is planned and hence no safeguard policies are triggered.

                           No safeguard policies are triggered.
