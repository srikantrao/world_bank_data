I.A.2. Project Objectives
The project will support the generation of 297,045 tons of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emission
reductions by the year 2017, through the reforestation of 600 ha of privately owned degraded agricultural
lands in southern Nicaragua. In addition, within the same land and as part of this project, Precious Woods is
aimed at the conservation of approximately 350 ha of secondary forest and major single trees, for whichi
carbon credits from the BioCarbon Fund (BCF) will not be claimed. The project will also create a
sustainable source of valuable wood for national and international markets, thereby reducing the pressures
on natural forests. The project will thus bring about not only carbon sequestration but also benefits to
ecological, wildlife, and landscape diversity. This will enable sustainable income generation options for
poor and vulnerable communities.
As with all BioCarbon Fund projects, this project represents a unique opportunity to simultaneously
promote the objectives of the United Nations Conventions on Climate Change, Biological Diversity, and
Desertification; to improve rural livelihoods; and to contribute to the sustainable development objectives of
one of the poorest nations in the Western Hemisphere.
I.A.3. Project Description
As indicated above the project's aim is to reforest degraded pasture land with teak and valuable native
wood species on former cattle ranches in southwestern Nicaragua. The project components are:
1. Reforestation of former pastures. A total of 600 ha are planned to be reforested. The project is likely to
expand to 4,000 ha if the experience gained under the proposed activity lead to positive results, specifically
regarding its registration as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project. However, it would not be
subject to agreement with the BCF.
2. Preservation of existing secondaly forests. These are located mainly along creeks and steep slopes and in
swamps. As forest preservation is not an eligible sink activity under the CDM, no emission reductions
(ERs) will be claimed for this component. These secondary forests amount to about 350 ha.
The project's financing plan totals $8.37 million. Approximately 14 percent of the resources ($1.19
million) will come from carbon finance. Precious Woods estimates that teak plantations in Nicaragua with
good growth and low operational costs can generate a yield of 9-14 percent. The sale of CO2 credits can
improve yields by approximately 1-2 percent. The harvesting cycle will be between 18 and 30 years.
However, the total estimated amount of ERs to be generated in a 30-year period ending in 2032 is
1,157,641 tons of CO2e. The BCF would purchase 297,045 t CO2e by 2017, or 26 percent, at $4 per ton.
The carbon purchase funds from the BCF would be spread over a period of 10 years.



I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics of
the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural habitats, or
any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project is located on two former cattle ranches (fincas) near the village of Sapoa, community of Cardenas, in
southwestern Nicaragua between Lake Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean. Finca La Pimienta is located directly on the
border with Costa Rica, and Finca Javalina is about 3 km to the north. The two project sites are not connected and are
not in the proximity of any protected area, critical natural habitats, or other culturally or socially sensitive areas.
Tlhe project is situated in the community of Cardenas in southwestern Nicaragua near the border with Costa Rica.
Cardenas has an area of 228 km2 and a population of 6,388 most of whom live in rural areas. In the Poverty Map of
Nicaragua the municipality of Cardenas is classified as having a high level of poverty with a poverty. Due to the lack of
employment opportunities most people depend on subsistence agriculture. Many migrate to other parts of the country
or to Costa Rica.

describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
As indicated above there are no potential environmental risks or impacts in the project's area of influence.
Potential large-scale, significant, and/or irreversible impacts have not been identified. However, the project
has taken measures to comply with OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment; an EA focused on forestry and
pest management issues (OP 4.36 and OP 4.09) was carried out.
II.D. lb. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project components.

II.D. Ic Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
n/a
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
n/a
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
During preparation the EA has confirmed that the proponent operates in line with Bank policies, SFC
standards, and WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines for
Classification.
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
A Bank mission in March 2005 met with project sponsors Precious Woods (PW), the Nicaragua Designated
National Authority (DNA) representative, the Minister of Environment, and the Mayor of Cardenas. They
all expressed strong interest in supporting the project and Minister Arturo Harding emphasized the project's
importance for the country development plan and other environmental and sector strategies.
According to the mayor, PW's past forestry activities have increased employment opportunities and income
for the area's population. The Nicaragua Designated National Authority (DNA) of the ONDL, under the
Ministry of Environment, participated in project preparation and consultations. Both fincas are registered in
INAFOR and representatives of MAGFOR as members of the ONDL Board have approved the project. A
public consultation was held on October 5, 2005 by invitation of the Ministry of Environment and Precious
Woods. Based on this the Government of Nicaragua has endorsed the project and PW is in the process of
submitting the project to the CDM.
E. Safeguards Classification (select one). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or on basis
of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is triggered the provisions of
that policy apply.
[ I S1. - Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. - One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
technically and institutionally manageable
[1S3. - No safeguard issues
SF - Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or
similar projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
issues.
