B.  Project Objectives 
The proposed credit will provide additional financing for the ongoing Pakistan: Partnership for 
Polio Eradication Project.  
The purpose is to assist the Government of Pakistan in erad
icating 
Poliomyelitis from Pakistan.  The original project objective is to support 
timely supply to GOP 
of the additional OPV
, needed during 2003
-
05, for the country’s Supplemental Immunization 
Activities  (SIAs),  i.e.,  for  conducting  National  Immunization 
Days  (NIDs),  Sub
-
National 
Immunization Days  (SNIDs) and “mop
-
up operations”. This project is part of 
World Health 
Organization 
led  multi
-
country  program  and  will  contribute  to  a  global  public  good:  the 
eradication of poliomyelitis by 2005.
The proposed su
pplementary credit supports the CAS objective of improving equity through 
supporting pro
-
poor policies, and CAS’s health sector priorities.  The poor are at greatest risk 
from  polio  due  to  their  unsanitary  and  crowded  living  conditions,  lower  health  status
  and 
immunization coverage.  Polio creates both short and long term impoverishment, severely limits 
the children’s future potential and reduces capacity to benefit from education and employment 
opportunities.  The project seeks to eradicate polio from Paki
stan and contribute to its eradication 
from the world.

C.  Project Description 
As the initial project, the proposed supplementary project will also have one component, i.e., 
procurement and supply of OPV to immunize all children up to five years of ag
e as part of SIAs.  
IDA support will ensure timely procurement and supply of the additional quantities of OPV 
needed during October 2004 and 2005.  IDA will finance the procurement of additional OPV 
though UNICEF.  UNICEF is an established agency for vacci
ne procurement and will supply 
OPV under a sole source services procurement agreement between the Government of Pakistan 
and UNICEF.  UNICEF is already procuring the OPV under the initial project and other vaccines 
for Pakistan’s immunization program.
Pak
istan  will conduct two additional rounds of National Immunization days (NIDs) in 2004 and 
2005 and 2 additional rounds of Sub
-
National Immunizations Days (SNIDs) during 2005.  OPV 
requirements  are  defined  by  the  target  population  and  regularly  updated  by 
the  Technical 
Advisory Group (TAG) based on surveillance results.  The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) of 
national and international experts meets periodically, and provides to the government a detailed 
analysis of program performance, its status, and recom
mended actions.
D.  Project location  
The project will target all children under five years of age across Pakistan. 
The project has a 
strong  poverty  focus,  targeting  poor,  remote  and  underprivileged  communities,  and  children 
whose mothers are unable to 
take them to health facilities due to restricted female mobility.  
The 
immunization program is managed at the federal level and implemented through provincial and 
district governments across Pakistan.  The project will not create any new structures and wil
l be 
implemented through the existing program with technical support of WHO and UNICEF.
