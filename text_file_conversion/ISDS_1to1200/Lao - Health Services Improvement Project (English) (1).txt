A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project objective is to contribute to GOL’s goal of enhancing the health status of the 
population by (a) expanding access to and improving the quality of a core package of 
health services in 8 southern and central provinces; (b) building capacity, both technical 
and managerial, in the health workforce at all levels in order to improve health outcomes; 
and (c) improving the management of health expenditures and making basic health 
services affordable for the poor. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project has three components: (1) improving the quality and utilization of health 
services in 8 provinces; (2) strengthening institutional capacity for health services 
provision; and (3) improving equity and sustainability of health financing. 
 
Component 1
.
This component will support the development of operational health 
districts in each of the 60 districts in the 8 central and southern provinces, with extra 
support to 30 districts identified as poor/poorest in the NGPES.  Each level, from village, 
to sub
-
district to district level, will deliver a core package of quality services comprising 
Page  2
the most essential services to be available at the respective levels of the health system, 
draw
n
from the MOH’s Minimum and Complementary package of services. The core 
package of preventive and curative services at each level is enumerated in Annex 4. The 
package is  designed to increase the demand for health services by supporting quality 
improvements and activities that inform clients through outreach activities, the 
maintenance of village health networks and community participation.  HSIP funds will 
complement other funding available at the district level for such services, filling funding 
gaps and shortfalls identified through a district planning process.  District allocations 
(pre-determined on the basis of agreed criteria) will be used to finance drugs and 
contraceptives; reagents and medical consumables; logistics support; local training, 
supervision and technical support; small equipment and furniture; and for operating costs, 
including spare parts and maintenance.   
 
The component will also support the phased expansion of the model of Integrated 
Community Health Centers (ICHCs) in selected health centers of the 30 priority districts. 
The model was successfully developed with Belgian Technical Assistance under the first 
IDA funded project (HSR&MC).  The ICHC model supports the provision of a range of 
health services discussed and agreed with the community, at agreed prices, and with fee 
exemptions for the poor. A functional ICHC operates with a minimum complement of 
trained staff and is open 24/7.  The HSIP provides initial and refresher technical training 
for ICHC staff, training in health center management and training of trainers of village 
level staff.  It will finance renovation of infrastructure and upgrading of utilities (water, 
electricity, toilets), and provide funds for small equipment, drugs and medical 
consumables. A detailed description of the ICHC model is presented in Annex 4. 
 
Finally, the component will support the improvement of basic health infrastructure in the 
30 priority districts, including 3 provincial hospitals, 3 inter-district hospitals
1
,
7
district 
hospitals and 4 health centers. Decisions on the site and scope of the civil works is based 
on criteria including remoteness from existing facilities, ethnic minority population, and 
area health needs.  
 
The component addresses the lack of access to quality health services in the rural and 
remote areas of Lao PDR, and the outputs are improved service delivery (see key 
indicators above) and better health outcomes. 
 
Component 2
.
The component will build institutional capacity for health service delivery in Lao PDR.  The 
project will adopt a multi-year, competency-based training approach which applies adult learning principles 
focused on developing and maintaining specific skills which can be assessed and monitored. The credit will 
finance the training of provincial/district health personnel, a Primary Health Care worker training for ethnic 
minorities and support to the Faculty of Medical Sciences (FMS) for medical education.  
 
The focus of HSIP is on capacity building to improve service delivery, principally at the district and village 
levels. The training program is designed to assure appropriate, effective and well managed health programs 
which will have the greatest impact on health status of the communities served.  It will include both 
technical and health management training. T
he HSIP would support short
-
term training through the district

allocation) for, (a) core courses to train village, health center and district levels; and (b) training of trainers 
for the delivery of the core courses. Longer term specialized training (laboratory, X-ray and medical 
specialties) offered at central and large provincial hospitals,  lasting between 3-9 months would also be 
financed under the credit. A summary of course sequence for the short-term training and course options for 
long term training may be found in Annex 4. 
 
The project would support the Primary Health Care Worker training which would recruit 
students from communities comprising remote and minority populations, provide them 3 
years of training and then employ the trainees in the health centers in their communities 
upon graduation. Nursing schools in Champassak, Savannakhet and Khammouane would 
deliver the training for which the development of the curriculum and training materials is 
currently underway with ADB support.  A minimum of 90 students (30 from each school) 
will be supported under the project.  
 
Support would be provided to the Faculty of Medicine for the implementation of a 
Family Medicine Intern Program, to enhance teaching skills through selected fellowships 
and provision of technical assistance, the purchase of pedagogical equipment and 
supplies, and for rehabilitative civil works. Investment will also be provided for 
upgrading training venues and equipping them, including at the Mahasot and Friendship 
Teaching hospitals.       
 
The component would also finance Project Management including the Procurement and 
Financial management units (see C-2).  
 
Component 3.
 
The objective of the HSIP health-financing component is to prepare the 
district-level of the public health system to manage equity funds and/or subsidies for the 
purchase of community-based health insurance for the poor, that will be funded by the 
project and possibly other donors in the near term and eventually by the Government. In 
addition, the HSIP health-financing component is designed to complement and strengthen 
the project’s other components. For example, the project’s financial management system 
(FM) system and the MOH’s new health management information system (HMIS) will be 
implemented in all 60 project districts during the first year of the project. Both systems 
will strengthen the project’s district-level planning sub-component and provide a basis 
for effective monitoring of project activities at the village, sub-district, district and 
province levels.  
 
The HSIP health-financing component will provide additional health financing support in selected pilot 
districts with one or more functioning Integrated Community Health Centers (referred to as “ICHC 
districts”). This assistance includes: (a) development of accounting systems that will track all health-related 
sources of income and expenditure in 10 pilot ICHC districts; (b) development and implementation in the 
same districts of transparent mechanisms for identifying and exempting the poor at public health facilities; 
(c) establishment and operation of equity funds in 5 of the 10 pilot districts to finance health care for the 
poor; and (d) purchase of health insurance cards for the poor in the remaining 5 additional pilot districts in 
which community health insurance schemes have been established. The comprehensive district-level 
accounting systems and transparent mechanisms for identifying and exempting the poor will be pre-
conditions for implementing equity funds or for purchasing health insurance cards for the poor.  
 
In addition, the HSIP health-financing component provides limited support for the further development of 
health financing policy in Lao PDR. Support is provided for four policy studies on important health-
financing issues, (including revision o
f
Decree 52 on cost recovery), for workshops disseminating the 
Page  4
studies’ findings and for participation by MOH and project staff in international conferences, workshops, 
and short-term training courses, and for two study tours to neighboring countries.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment
 
The Project is classified as a Category B activity where targeted environmental 
assessment (EA) is considered appropriate to address specific environmental issues.  
Potential environmental and human health impacts of the HSIP examined in completing 
the EA corresponded to: (i) planned renovation of and new construction at national, 
provincial and district health care facilities (HCF); and (ii) health care waste (HCW) 
management practices at HCF.  Environmental issues relevant to the foregoing aspects 
were identified and recommendations made as to appropriate mitigation measures and 
monitoring programs with a view to guiding project design and incorporating appropriate 
management actions during project implementation.  Mitigation measures corresponding 
to the abovementioned aspects of the HSIP are detailed in an EMP. 
 
Future activities recommended included retaining a full-time staff in the Project Management Unit (PMU) 
with qualifications in water supply and sanitation and health care waste management (HCWM).  However, 
if this is not possible, resources will be made available to ensure that needed functions are adequately 
carried out. The Project Implementation Plan (PIP) will include preliminary schedules and costs associated 
with:  (i) PMU and health care
 facilities’ implementation of the Environmental Management Plan (EMP), 
including provision of monitoring equipment and supplies, and training; (ii) adoption of the proposed 
HCWM practices; and (iii) procurement of EMP monitoring equipment and supplies, as well as training

Social Assessment 
 
Project preparation included a Social Impact Assessment to address the social issues associated with the 
project, and in particular to assist in HSIP formulation by considering potential impact of proposed 
activities, how to improve the design of specific interventions and activities, and whether there are 
activities which should not be included because they are unlikely to work or would have undesirable social 
impacts; ensure there is an appropriate system for monitoring the impact of the HSIP and mechanisms for 
the collection of baseline data; carry out consultations and a participatory process to ensure views of 
relevant stakeholders (especially poor and ethnic groups) are taken into account; and review relevant parts 
of HSIP documentation to ensure they are appropriate and reflect the findings from social development 
inputs and stakeholder consultation.  In most cases, the upland ethnic groups in the project areas are 
culturally, socially, and economically distinct from the lowland groups, and they are vulnerable to 
becoming disadvantaged in the development process.  Measures to address this issue include the 
recruitment and training of Primary Health Care workers from ethnic minorities, who will  return, after 
being trained, to provide services in the communities to which they belong.  Overall, the project is 
anticipated to have a positive impact on ethnic groups living in the target districts.  
 
The team will review the Ethnic Groups Development Plan (EGDP) recommendations 
with the government to agree on a Plan that is sufficient and feasible given the Lao PDR 
context.  The EGDP can be improved in a number of key areas:  a more focused 
implementation plan for addressing issues pertaining to ethnic groups as they relate to the 
project; a more detailed plan for the "informed participation" of ethnic groups; more 
details on monitoring and evaluation; more detailed implementation arrangements to 
Page  6
ensure that project will be able to implement EGDP activities.  The District Operational 
Manuals under preparation should reflect the issues discussed in the EGDP.  The PAD 
should detail the full scope of consultations undertaken during project preparation.  For 
project monitoring and evaluation, the team should explore which performance indicators 
can be disaggregated by ethnicity.  The PAD should confirm that the project will not 
directly support Focal Sites and Relocation, as the latter concern GOL practices of 
relocating remote villages, which have shown to have a number of adverse social and 
environmental impacts.  It is noted that the Social Impact Assessment and EGDP define 
indigenous peoples more broadly than Bank policy.  The team should confirm its 
willingness to do so and clarify this distinction in the PAD. 
Involuntary Resettlement
 
The project includes the continued development of primary health care facilities by 
financing rehabilitation and new construction.  Supported infrastructure projects will be 
small in scale and are expected to cause little or no significant adverse impacts.  The 
government has confirmed in writing to the World Bank that there will not be any land 
acquisition or resettlement related to health facility renovation and construction.   
 
The team will explicitly confirm with the government that all civil works, including 
external networks and facilities related to these buildings, will take place on existing, 
unoccupied land owned by MOH or relevant government authorities.

D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Environmental Assessment 
 
For purposes of the project for which environmental impacts are expected to be limited 
and readily mitigated, attention is given in the EMP to specifying best management 
practices that will be put in place to ensure that environmental and human health 
concerns corresponding to planned HCF civil works and operations are fully addressed 
on an ongoing basis during project implementation.  Mitigation measures contained in the 
EMP emphasize: (i) incorporation of environmentally safe technologies in civil works 
planning and design; (ii) adoption of best practices during renovation and construction to 
avoid or minimize adverse impacts to natural ecosystems and neighboring communities; 
(iii) adheren
ce to strict occupational health and safety safeguards to protect construction 
Page  7
workers and the general public; (iv) application of best international practices 
corresponding to the removal and disposal of asbestos  containing materials during 
building demolition and renovation; (v) meeting or exceeding international guidelines for 
drinking water supplied to HCF; and (vi) adoption of best accepted practices 
corresponding to handling, treatment and disposal of solid and solid wastes typically 
generated by HCF.  Taken together the aforementioned measures address all 
environmental issues identified in undertaking the EA, and are expected to be 
successfully applied during HSIP implementation. 
 
Monitoring of HCF operations will be undertaken under the HSIP to ensure full 
compliance with stipulated safeguards and other applicable regulatory requirements, and 
to demonstrate good environmental performance on an ongoing basis.  Responsibility for 
fulfilling reporting requirements and timely submission of reports to the national 
regulatory agency will rest with individual HCF, with the HSIP Project Management Unit 
(PMU) acting in an oversight capacity.  Funding will be allocated under the project to 
procure necessary equipment and consumable supplies, and to deliver appropriate 
training in support of monitoring activities.  Satisfactory implementation of all 
recommended safeguards for the HSIP will be subject to external evaluation by the Bank 
both at project mid-term review and final evaluation. 
 
Indigenous Peoples
 
–
Social Assessment 
 
An Ethnic Group Development Plan (EGDP) has been prepared to provide a strategy and 
a
programmatic approach to enhance the inclusion of different ethnic groups in the HSIP.  
The EGDP also includes a Monitoring Plan and the 
Beneficiaries’ Consultation and 
Participation Plan.  It furthermore aims to ensure compliance with policies of the Lao 
People’s Democratic Republic concerning ethnic groups, as well as the World Bank’s 
Operational Directive 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples.  The EGDP describes the legal, 
cultural, and socioeconomic context surrounding ethnic groups in Lao PDR, particularly 
pertaining to the receipt of health service benefits, and describes measures, institutional 
arrangements, and budgetary needs that address the particular needs and circumstances of 
ethnic groups.  Implementation of the EGDP will be monitored together with the other 
HSIP activities and evaluated both at mid-term and at final evaluation.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Environmental Assessment 
 
Extensive consultation was sought with the Lao PDR Ministry of Health (MOH), and 
participating HCF at the national, provincial and district in completing the EA to ensure 
that potential project impacts are fully understood and appropriate conclusions and 
recommendations have been reached.  The Science, Technology & Environment Agency 
(STEA), the national agency responsible for EA oversight, was also consulted with 
respect to existing environmental regulations pertaining to HCF, and corresponding 
monitoring and reporting responsibilities.  Feedback was provided by the MOH and 
STEA in finalizing recommendations contained in the EMP to preven
t, minimize or 
Page  8
mitigate any adverse impacts and to improve environmental performance.  The final EA 
document has been submitted to the STEA for their approval.  The Borrower has also 
publicly disclosed the same report immediately following Bank approval. 
 
Indigenous Peoples 
–
Social Assessment 
 
The SIA was carried out by direct consultation with rural populations, district and provincial health 
personnel in target districts, which took the form of field studies undertaken by the social development 
consultant and a team of social researchers who traveled to each province, and by consulting relevant 
available existing documentation.  The SIA Report and EGDP was publicly disclosed in Vientiane, Lao 
PDR on June 21, 2004.
