A.2. Project Objectives  
 
Project Objectives 
This Project will enhance both the quantity and reliability of power supply of the region 
in an environmentally responsible manner.
 
Developmental Objectives 
As the first wind farm project in the Philippines, the Project will have a significant 
demonstration effect in accelerating the commercialization of wind power, thereby 
contributing to GOP’s goal for reducing the country’s dependence on imported energy 
and broadening its resource base with an indigenous, inexhaustible and environmentally 
desirable option. The Project will also contribute towards the global environment 
objective of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the avoidance of diesel 
power generation.

A.3. Project Description  
The project is a 24.75 MW wind turbine power plant to be located in Bangui Bay, 
Philippines, which is expected to produce 74.48 GWh of electricity annually. The project 
is sponsored by NorthWind Power Development Corporation (NWPDC), a private 
corporation incorporated in the Philippines. The electricity produced by the project will 
be transmitted through a 50-km, 69kV overhead transmission line to a substation in 
Laoag City. 
 
The wind turbines are pitch regulated variable speed type or active stall turbines arranged 
in a single row stretching 4 to 5 km along the shoreline. The turbines will have each 
690/13.8kV step-up transformer and shall be grouped into three. The power from each 
group will then be combined into one 13.8kV/69kV step-up transformer. The design calls 
for asynchronous generators, utilizing microprocessor-based integrated electric 
controllers. Power will be generated at 690V, 60 Hz and the turbines will be 
synchronized to the national grid’s frequency. Revenue meters will be located at the 
project’s outgoing circuits. 
 
The overhead transmission line will be concrete, pole type with height ranging from 18 to 
25 meters. The line will be installed over the existing 13.5 kV TL of Ilocos Norte Electric 
Cooperative (INEC) and will comply with local and international standards.  
 
The proponent has already signed an Electricity Sales Agreement with the local electric 
utility, INEC. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The wind farm (turbines and control facilities) will be located on a stretch of 9 km long, 
100 m wide foreshore area which run east-west on Bangui Bay, Bangui, Ilocos Norte, on 
the Northern tip of the island of Luzon. The foreshore area is an undeveloped, 
uninhabited sandy beach area, devoid of any man-made improvements or structures. The 
local residents used the area for occasional pebbles/gravel gathering and fishing. The 
wind tower will be erected within the inter-tidal zone of the beach, occupying a 4-5 km 
portion of the 9 km stretch foreshore area. 
 
The 50 km 69kV overhead transmission as proposed will utilize the existing right-of-way 
of the service line of INEC along the Bangui-Laoag City stretch of the national highway.

Comments
:
The environmental and social impacts of the project is expected to be benign, short term 
or limited only during the construction period. The impacts will mostly be due to civil 
works activities during construction.  
 
Hence there will be very minimal impacts anticipated on residents and their livelihood. 
There are no permanent human structures in the beach area. The nearest residential house 
is about 200 m from the site. There is also no evidence of any thriving recreational 
activity. Disruptions of the economic/livelihood activities including fishing, 
pebbles/gravel gathering and grazing but these are expected to be minimal and temporary 
as residents will continue to have access to the foreshore area during after construction 
 
There may be short-term disturbance in the inter-tidal ecosystem, the immediate marine 
environment, workers and nearby communities during the construction period.  Also, the 
marine assessment conducted by the proponent reported the sighting of a juvenile green 
sea turtle (
Chelonia mydas
), an endangered species, in the waters fronting one of the 
villages hosting the project. Further study needs to be conducted to ascertain the presence 
or absence of nesting sites within the wind farm area and, if present, determine their 
population status so that proper protection and conservation measures can be 
implemented by the proponent.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. 
 
D.1. (a) Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed 
project. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible 
impacts. 
 
These are two environmental issues related to the project, both of which are considered 
not significant if addressed properly. These include: (1) the short-term impacts of civil 
works activities to  workers, nearby communities and the marine ecosystem during the 
project construction; and (2) the potential negative effects of wind farm operation on 
green sea turtle (
Chelonia mydas
)
nesting, an endangered species, if confirmed to be 
present in one of the host villages.  
 
The only social concerns noted so far revolve around improving employment 
opportunities for residents from host sitios/barangays during construction and operation 
of the project, and  preparation/implementation of a concrete social development support 
for the residents of the host barangays/sitios where the turbines are situated.  The 
proponent has committed to develop a transparent and objective local hiring policy that 
would favor residents of the host communities and prepare/implement a social 
development program using a portion of the credits they would derive from the carbon 
facility. 
D.1 (b). Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one 
safeguard policy or due to multiple project component 
No cumulative impact is anticipated.  
 
D.1c. Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
After construction of wind farm and transmission line there will be only occasional 
maintenance activity in the project area. Increased tourism activity due to the novelty of 
wind farm in the area is being anticipated by the local government but the impact of this 
activity at the project site will be minimal and can be easily managed. 
 
D.2. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)
 
Without the project an equivalent power generating capacity would have to be built 
which is most probably coal- or diesel-fired. Compared to fossil-fuel fired plants, wind 
power plants will provide substantial benefits to the Philippine economy in terms of 
foreign exchange savings, insulation from unpredictability of world fuel prices and 
carbon emission credits.  
 
Page  5
D.3. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
a) Re. Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01) 
The Proponent has conducted separate environmental assessment (EA) studies for the 
wind farm and the transmission line. The EA reports in the form of Initial Environmental 
Examination (IEE) Checklists were submitted to the Bank and to the Philippine 
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). Separate Environmental 
Compliance Certificates (ECCs) were also issued by DENR based on the EAs submitted. 
Upon request of the Bank, a special assessment on the marine ecosystem was conducted 
in April 2004. The report of the special assessment indicated the potential presence of 
green sea turtles in one of the villages hosting the wind turbines and the presence of coral 
communities not very far from the project site. The EA reports provide adequate 
environmental mitigating measures to address civil works impacts, such as requiring 
contractors to observe good housekeeping practices, proper construction site 
management, proper collection and disposal of solid wastes, installation of sanitary 
facilities for workers and strict adherence to appropriate standards on noise, water 
quality, dust, occupational health and safety. In addition, the proponent will be required 
to properly managed excavated materials and install relevant silt protection measures to 
ensure protection of the marine ecosystem. The proponent will also be required to 
conduct, in coordination with DENR, a detailed assessment on green sea turtle to: (1) 
confirm the presence or absence of the said species in the project site; (2) where present, 
assess the population status; and (3) formulate protection, mitigation and conservation 
measures.  
 
b) Re. Natural Habitats (OP/BP/GP 4.04) 
The bird migration study conducted by PNOC-Energy Development Corporation for their 
proposed wind power project in the same area as the proposed project concluded that  
Northern Luzon is not part of the major flyway of migratory birds. The same study 
concluded that wind turbines do not pose risk or hazard to both migratory and local bird 
species. On the other hand, the marine assessment study conducted by the proponent 
revealed the potential of some coral reefs, about 1 km away from the project site, to be 
affected by the project, if earth materials are not properly managed during construction. 
The same study identified mitigating measures to ensure protection of coral reefs during 
project construction.
 
c) Re. Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) 
No land acquisition and resettlement is anticipated since the land where the turbines shall 
be installed is a foreshore area covered by a foreshore lease agreement between the 
proponent and  the Philippine Government. The area is also free from improvements or 
private structures. Access of fishermen to the shore during construction and operations 
will not be impeded due to adequate spacing and the limited area to be occupied by the 
wind turbines. Furthermore, no settlement, structure or livelihood is anticipated to be 
affected by the transmission line, as it will be installed over the existing alignment (right-
of-way) of the service/distribution line of INEC.  
 
d) Re. Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20) 
The site of the wind turbines and the alignment of the transmission line is outside any 
known IP communities/domains situated in the Province of Ilocos Norte. This is 
confirmed by the a field based investigation of the Philippine National Commission on 
Indigenous Peoples (NCIP). Likewise, no known areas of significant cultural/historical 
significance are expected to be affected by the construction works and operation of the 
Page  6
D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders include: the project debt financier, Danish International 
Development Agency (DANIDA), the local residents of four host barangays, the local 
governments and the Ilocos Norte Electric Cooperative (INEC). The residents and 
property owners along the transmission along the proposed transmission line route may 
also have legitimate concerns on the project. 
 
The proponent conducted consultations/discussions among local residents and the host 
local governments including the four Barangays, the Municipal Council of Bangui and 
the Provincial Council of Ilocos Norte. The consultations/discussions were conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of the Philippine EIS system and the foreshore lease 
application. The proponent has also secured endorsements from all host local 
governments and government agencies, including the Department of Tourism.
