A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The development objectives of the MWSIP are (i) to strengthen the state’s capacity for multi-
sectoral planning, development, and sustainable management of the water resources, and (ii) to 
improve irrigation service delivery on a sustainable basis to increase productivity of irrigated 
agriculture and contribute to rural poverty reduction.
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The MWSIP comprises four components: (i) water sector institutional restructuring and capacity 
building; (ii) improving irrigation service delivery and management; (iii) innovative pilots; (iv) 
project management (see Annex 4 for detailed project description, and Annex-5 for detailed cost 
breakdown). The project components are briefly described below: 
 
Component A: Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building (US$24.85 million) 
 
This component will focus on institutional reforms in the water sector with the objective of  
strengthening the state’s capacity for multi-sectoral planning, development and management of the 
water resources on a river basin basis. This component will support: (i) the establishment and 
Page  2
operationalization of  the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA); (ii) 
restructuring and capacity building of the existing Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development 
Corporation (MKVDC) into the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Water Resources Corporation 
(MKVWRC); (iii) restructuring and capacity building of the Irrigation Department (ID); (iv) 
strengthening and capacity building of  the Water and Land Management Institute (WALMI); and 
(v) the establishment of an integrated computerized information system (ICIS). 
 
Component B: Improving Irrigation Service Delivery and Management ( US$351.66 million) 
 
This component will focus on improving  irrigation service delivery and productivity in irrigated 
agriculture through improved irrigation system performance, effective participation of water users 
in irrigation system  management,  increased cost recovery, implementation of water entitlements, 
and improved agricultural support services delivery. It will support: (i)  participatory rehabilitation 
and modernization of about 286 selected (9 major, 13 medium and 264 minor)  irrigation schemes 
covering about 670,000 ha, with WUAs contributing Rs. 500 per ha towards the cost of 
rehabilitation/modernization of irrigation system falling under their jurisdiction (of which, at least 
Rs.200 per ha will be paid upfront in cash and the remaining Rs. 300 per ha can be paid either in-
cash or in-kind or a combination of both). All the irrigation system rehabilitation/modernization 
works at the WUA level will be carried out by the WUA with the technical support of the ID, 
unless the WUA explicitly decides to entrust the works to the ID for execution; (ii) enhancing the 
safety of 22 dams supplying water to the project area through rehabilitation; (iii) formation and 
capacity building of water users organizations in about 286 selected irrigation schemes, covering 
about 20% of the state’s surface irrigated area;  (iv) implementation of improved water 
management practices, such as bulk supply and volumetric water charging, in 6 selected irrigation 
schemes ( 2 major, 1 medium, and 3 minor) in the Krishna Valley during the project, and then 
begin the upscaling to the other schemes in the following phases; (v) strengthening of agriculture 
support services in the project area through the introduction of multi-disciplinary (irrigation, 
agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, etc) technical support groups (TSGs) for the Water 
User Organizations (WUOs), and public-private coordination for technology transfer to farmers; 
and, (vi) implementation of a 
social and environmental management plan, consistent with the  
Social and Environmental Management Framework (SEMF), that will address the social and 
environmental issues related to the project interventions, and strategies devised for enhancing the 
positive social and environmental impacts. 
 
Component C: Innovative Pilots ( US$5.09 million)
 
This component will focus on implementing  innovative pilots and will support: (i) 4 pilots of user-
centered acquifer level groundwater management; and (ii) 4 pilots of commercialized irrigated 
agriculture. 
 
Component D: Project Management ( US$5.83 million) 
 
This component will support (i)
 
establishment of a state level Project Preparation and Management 
Unit (PPMU);(ii) monitoring and evaluation through an agency external to the government; (iii) an 
information, education, and communication campaign to create awareness about the project 
initiatives and  build broad-based consensus and support for the State Water Policy and reform 
program in the water Sector; (iv) consultancies needed during project implementation; and (v) 
preparation of Phase II of the Maharashtra Water Sector Improvement Project.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis
:
The project is located in the state of Maharashtra in central-western part of India and falls between 
16.4 and 22.1 degrees North latitude and between 72.6 and 80.9 degrees East longitude. 
 
Maharashtra is the second largest state (30.8 million ha) with the third largest population (97 
million) in the country. About 58% of the state’s population is in rural areas, 80% of whom are 
dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Since the project covers mainly the existing irrigation 
schemes for rehabilitation to improve irrigation service delivery system,  strengthen Participatory 
Irrigation Management together with improved agriculture support services, there are no safeguard 
issues relating to planning of irrigation projects. Under the existing laws of the country, no 
environmental clearances are required  and the project does not envisage any land appropriation 
and therefore, physical displacement and resettlement is not an issue.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
A
detailed analysis of safeguard issues and impacts associated with the project has been 
carried out as part of an Integrated Social and Environmental Assessment (ISEA). The 
assessment reveals no large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts due to the 
proposed project interventions.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
No potential indirect and/or long term impacts are envisaged due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not relevant 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Based on the findings of the ISEA and consultations held with project stakeholders, a 
Social and Environmental Management Framework (SEMF) has been prepared which 
provides a good basis to respond to the environmental and social issues in a 
programmatic manner. SEMF includes an entitlement framework for resettlement of 
project affected people, strategy for consultation, participation, and strategy to address 
issues related to women and  tribal people, as well as institutional strengthening activities 
in relation to the social and environmental management of project. The SEMF describes 
the process to be followed to  ensure that environmental and social aspects are integrated 
in planning and implementing project activities at the sub-project level. Based on the 
findings of ISEA and SEMF, social and environmental management  plan has been 
prepared taking into account the  respective framework and strategies for  key issues. i.e., 
Dam Safety, Sustainable Agriculture including Pest Management, Resettlement, Tribal 
and  Gender development and Community participation. It also includes institutional 
design and detailed budget for executing these plans.  A model tribal development plan 
for one of the sub-projects has also been prepared. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
While the key stakeholders of the project are the primary users of irrigation water and 
affected people, others include functionaries of Irrigation and other line departments 
(specifically Agriculture, Tribal Development, Women and Child Development), and 
NGO/Civil Society. As part of project preparation and ISEA study, the key stakeholders 
(including affected people, tribal, women, landless and other vulnerable groups) were 
consulted through interviews and groups discussions besides organizing stakeholders 
consultation workshops at different lev
els. The consultation strategy prepared for the 
Page  5
project  envisages consultation and involvement of key stakeholders to continue through 
out the planning, implementing and monitoring project activities at the individual 
irrigation scheme covered under the project. All mitigation plans including SEMF have 
been disclosed as per the Bank’s disclosure policy.
