                           The development objectives of the project are to increase access to piped water services and
                           improved sanitation in selected Districts; and to strengthen the capacity of associated institutions.
                            3. Project Description

                                                                         Page 1 of 14
                         The project comprises of the following components which are described below.
                         •      Component 1 - Water supply and sanitation infrastructure
                         •      Component 2 – Strengthened Rural Service Delivery
Public Disclosure Copy




                         •      Component 3 - Sector Capacity Building
                         •      Component 4 - Project Management

                         Component 1 –Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure ($141.57 million, IDA $130.91 million)

                         This component would finance infrastructure investments to support expansion of piped water
                         services in urban, rural and estate areas in the selected districts. Cost effective technical solutions
                         will ensure that each unit of investment delivers the maximum service improvement. Decentralized
                         schemes will be the norm, whether in rural water supply or urban sanitation. Within the urban sub-
                         sector the focus will be on towns given that the Government has a number of projects already
                         planned for the larger urban centers.

                         In urban small towns, the investments will be made for intake, pumping main, conventional water
                         treatment plant and the distribution network where the water will be treated to Sri Lanka Standards
                         for drinking water. The per capita supply would range from 80 to 120lpcd depending on the
                         availability and cost effectiveness of the delivery.

                         Rehabilitation of existing rural systems would be included based on agreed criteria and up to 15% of
                         the rural sub-sector investment amount. Community contribution for rehabilitation of rural water
                         supply (RWS) schemes will be higher, ranging from 20% to 40%, with priority given to community
                         based organizations (CBOs) who will contribute higher % share of the cost. In cases where good
                         performing CBOs request expansion, it can be included within this 15% allocation.

                         In Central Province investment will focus on piped water supplies and sanitation in estates and
                         adjoining rural villages. From experience of earlier pilots in the estate sector some of the key issues

                         to be considered include: (i) Capacity of the estate workers to manage the schemes, and alternatives
                         in the event of low capacity/interest; (ii) Roles of the different parties in O&M – the Board, the
                         plantation owners, the community, the Plantation Human Development Trust (PHDT) and the Estate
                         Workers Housing Cooperative Society (EWHCS).

                         According to Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) practice the community contributions toward capital
                         costs of the rural and estates schemes will be 15% (in cash and kind) of the total costs, including the
                         cost of a meter and house connection. Payment modality will be decided at the community level. The
                         rural and estate scheme design will include metered connections to all households who register to
                         receive water. In addition the rural and estate programs will be implemented through a “Demand
                         Responsive and Participatory Approach” and in close coordination with the Local Authorities,
                         Pradeshiya Sabha.

                         In urban sanitation, the project will finance the construction of Septage Treatment Plants in each of
                         the districts for the collection and treatment of septage. These will be strategically located to
                         encourage maximum use of the facility. The proposed technology to be employed is primarily based
                         on waste stabilization ponds and the discharge will be treated to prescribed standards. Each plant will
                         be provided with at least one gully bowser for the collection of septage.

                         Rural sanitation improvements will use appropriate models in line with government policy. Latrine


                                                                      Page 2 of 14
                         technology and specifications (at least for the sub-structure) and cost will be prepared and applied
                         across project areas. An incentive grant of 80% of latrine cost will be provided to the poor and
                         hardcore poor identified and listed by the Government’s Samurdhi Program in each village. To

                         ensure full sanitation coverage, other households are encouraged to build hygienic latrines with 50%
                         incentive grant. Identification and selection of beneficiaries will be done by the close coordination of
                         CBO in coordination with the NationalWater Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB) District Units.

                         Hygiene Education and Awareness Programs are at the heart of any successful sanitation program.
                         The project management unit (PMU) will support and organize intensive hygiene promotion
                         programs to educate communities, in particular school children, on the socio-economic costs of lack
                         of sanitation and the benefits of good hygiene and improved sanitation.

                         Component 2 – Strengthened Rural Service Delivery ($7.73 million, IDA $7.73 million)

                         The project will support the operationalization of the Department of National Community Water
                         Supply (DNCWS) through the following activities.

                         o         Assistance to build the capacity of DNCWS through: (a) institutional design of the
                         department including organizational structure, staff numbers and skill sets, job descriptions and so
                         on; (b) offices and equipment needed to set up the department in each districts; and (c) training for
                         staff of the departments
                         o         Design and implementation of sustainability financing and incentive framework to: clarify
                         liability for repairs, rehabilitation and replacement costs; generate incentives for CBOs to manage
                         schemes and sanitation facilities better; and encourage regular and reliable monitoring of scheme
                         performance and sustainability.
                         o         Design and implementation of a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) system to capture
                         indicators of system functionality and CBO sustainability. This will include a baseline survey of all
                         existing CBOs/WUAs (Water User Associations). The system will include mobile phone monitoring
                         systems that are simple and cost-effective.

                         enhance the performance of all CBOs. This will help ensure that schemes are functional for their full
                         economic life through a range of initiatives including: (a) administrative backstopping to CBOs; (b)
                         technical backstopping; and (c) a system of training and networking to help the CBOs solve
                         problems on their own.
                         o         Establishing a program for confirming the legal status of CBOs.
                         o         Designing an approach to ensure long term sustainability in the estate water supply schemes
                         through appropriate financing and institutional arrangements, including partnering with the PHDT,
                         the plantation companies and the EWHCS.

                          
                         Component 3–Sector Capacity Building ($5.94 million, IDA $5.94 million)

                         The project will finance two capacity building activities:
                         •        Preparation of a comprehensive Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Program, in
                         collaboration and consultation with the National Planning Department (NPD), to improve water
                         supply and sanitation across the island. This will allow GOSL to address the gaps and strategically
                         invest in the sector through a programmatic approach which can be financed by local or foreign
                         funds.
                         •        National Program to develop a strategy to mitigate the aggravating effects of drinking water

                                                                      Page 3 of 14

                         assessments at the district levels, which help to identify possible risk areas in relation to the spread of
                         chronic kidney diseases of unknown aitiology (CKDu) and other diseases in the Island; and (ii)
                         preparation of a National Strategy to enable NWSDB and other sector organizations to provide a
                         comprehensive WSS response to the CKDu threat; which include developing a risk rating system
                         (based on the water quality mapping), assessing different t2echnical and cost effective approaches (e.
                         g., Rain water harvesting, bowser supply, Reverse Osmosis (RO) Plants).

                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented in 7 high priority districts for water supply and sanitation
                         infrastructure development. These districts have been selected based on (a) % of people with access
                         to unimproved/unsafe water (ii) % households with access to non-piped water sources and (iii)
                         location in the dry zone. Poverty, measured by the poverty head count, has a strong co-relation with
                         access levels and is therefore implicitly captured in the district selection process. The districts are;

                         The Mullaithivu and Killinochchi district share similar physical environmental conditions due to
                         their location within the Northern Province. Physical features of Mullaithivu district consists of flat
                         land terrain, with a 70 Km long coastal belt and four key lagoons. Its highest elevation is 36.5 m, and
                         has a land area of 2617 km2. Of this about 64.1% of the total land area consists of forests, agriculture
                         nearly 16.9%, range land 5.2%, homesteads about 5.1% and the rest constitute of water bodies.
                         Urban centres are small with relatively new infrastructure built after the cessation of the conflict in
                         2009. Kilinochchi district covers about 1237.11 Km2 of land area and has an average population
                         density of 96 persons per Km2. Terrain in Kilinochchi is also flat dotted with many irrigation tanks
                         and a big tank that supplies water to the local population. Climatically, both districts are dry and
                         humid with an average rainfall of about 1325mm of which nearly 75% is received during September
                         to December North East Monsoons. Water is scarce in the district and varies in terms of quality, with
                         salinity being a major issue that renders water sources undrinkable near coastal areas. In both
                         districts, apart from a few surface reservoirs, groundwater is the main source of drinking water.

                         In contrast, the Nuwera Eliya district is in the central highlands of the country which is located in the
                         highest plain. The terrain is mountainous with deep valleys, forming a complex of massifs, mountain

                         The wet weather and terrain make NE a scenic area with numerous streams and rivers flowing and
                         forming cascading waterfalls/ across the many valleys. The main environmental issues in NE are soil
                         erosion from land exposed for cultivation and other development and contaminated run off
                         originating from tea and vegetable cultivations where chemical fertilizer and pesticides are
                         intensively used.

                         The Badulla and Monaragala Districts have very different terrain even though they are both located
                         in the Uva Province. Badulla District covers a land area of approximately 2,861 Km² and has a
                         highland terrain with ample rainfall. Much of the mountainous terrain has been utilized for tea and
                         vegetable cultivation and the lower region where climatic conditions are drier and the terrain is flat,
                         for paddy cultivation. The mountainous terrain of the upper region is susceptible to earth slips and
                         landslides, especially during the rainy seasons. The Monaragala District has a similar terrain to the
                         lower regions of Badulla, where the land is flat and dry. It is the largest of the 25 districts of Sri
                         Lanka, with an area of 7,133 Km². The district is mainly made up of rubber, cocoa and sugar cane
                         plantations and paddy lands. The valley is mostly dry and rainfall is sparse, thus cultivation is linked
                         to the monsoonal seasons. The townships are located in the flat land and are fairly small settlements,
                         with the city of Monaragala being the main township. The Savanna like plains situated along the
                         Southern parts of Monaragala, bordering the Hambantota District, has been designated as part of the
                         Yala National Park.

                         The Kegalle District encompasses a land area of 1663 km2 of mountainous terrain of transitional
                         slopes between the high land and of the central hills. Elevations within the district as you start from
                         its periphery and move towards the central regions, are 50m to 1800m above sea level. The
                         mountainous terrain from the east meanders down to valleys in the western parts of the district,
                         where a number of rivers and streams are located. These include the Kaleni River, Ma Oya and

                         Rambukan Oya. Annual rainfall varies from 2,500 mm to 3,000 mm and temperature varies from
                         25.7 °C-30°C. Settlements are centered on rubber cultivation, which has stretched over most of the
                         area of the District, and minor export crops such as coffee, cocoa, pepper, clove and nutmeg.
                         Population densities in the rural regions are dispersed while there is high population density in the
                         major cities such as Kegalle, Mawanella and Ambepussa.

                         Situated in a Valley, the Ratnapura District (3,275 Km2) has a rich environment with numerous
                         streams and waterfalls and is located in the wet zone of the island. The district receives rainfall
                         mainly from south-western monsoons from May to September. During the remaining months of the
                         year also, there is considerable precipitation due to convective rains. The average temperature varies
                         from 24 to 35 °C, and there are high humidity levels. Ratnapura is the center of a long-established
                         industry of precious stone mining including rubies, sapphires, and other gems. Apart from gem
                         mining, large plantations of tea and rubber surround the main settlements of Ratnapura, Embilipitiya
                         and Balangoda. Segments of the Sinharaja Forest Reserve and the Udawalawe National Park are also
                         located in the South East of the District. Ratnapura experiences frequent floods and is prone to
                         landslides.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Environment

                             By adopting an integrated approach towards safe drinking water supply, sanitation, septage
                             management and hygiene education in the selected urban, rural and estate areas, the project is
                             expected to deliver many positive health and environmental benefits to the receiving communities,
                             where currently access to these facilities are relatively low compared to national levels. Given the
                             Bank’s two earlier projects in the sector - Second Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project
                             (CWSSP II) and the North East Pilot Water and Sanitation Project (NEPWASH) -, there is ample
                             knowledge about the type and extent of environmental benefits and challenges that could be
                             typically expected under the proposed investments and lessons learnt that could be positively built
                             upon.

                             It is known that causes of persistent malnutrition include poor hygiene habits, lack of access to
                             clean water as well as affordability of food. At the same time, it is reported by World Health
                             Organization (WHO) that both malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation are linked
                             to poverty. Sanitation (together with hygiene) forms the first barrier between its user and the
                             environment, and prevents exposure that could affect public health and cause environmental

                             pollution. Therefore, with access to clean water provided to an estimated 623,000 people and the
                             sanitation program benefiting about 53,000 families, the project will make substantial
                             contributions to the progress of many public health and environmental indicators.

                             As evident from the World Bank-financed CWSSP II and NEPWASH), construction impacts of
                             water supply and sanitation facilities, as proposed under the project, are not anticipated to be
                             serious and can be managed with good environmental planning and management practices at site.
                             However, there are larger issues of concern with implications for project design and
                             implementation.

                             One that requires attention during the design and implementation of water supply schemes is the
                             long-term safety and management of the water resource. First, it includes water scarcity and
                             potential conflict among different water use groups. The project will be implemented in several
                             districts with widely varying climatic conditions and substantial water shortages are often
                             experienced, especially in the dry zone districts. Although small town and rural water supply
                             schemes may not involve large scale abstractions that result in significant depletion of water
                             resources, it is necessary to consider potential environmental impacts arising from volume of
                             water abstracted and method of abstraction for both ground and surface water resources.
                             Construction of weirs across rivers/streams would need to adequately consider impacts to riverine/
                             aquatic habitats and maintaining minimum flows downstream under all weather conditions.

                                                                       Page 7 of 14
                         Similarly, the project must ensure that other downstream uses, if any, are not altered or
                         compromised in a negative way. Where groundwater is used as a source, especially in the dry
                         zone, the cumulative impact of current and planned abstraction must be considered to ensure that

                         the aquifer has adequate buffer to protect from salt water intrusion.

                         Second, is the risk of source contamination due to various activities and land-use developments
                         that take place in the catchment subsequent to project development. While source water quality
                         testing will be an integral part of sub-project development, implementation of basic water safety
                         plans needs to be streamlined into scheme operation and maintenance. Regular source water
                         quality monitoring and management of the immediate catchment will be critical requirements in it.
                         The project will take a pragmatic approach in this and capitalize on the GOSL’s policy decision to
                         introduce water surveillance and safety planning for all types of water supply schemes and
                         operators.

                         Currently, none of the project served areas have sewage collection or treatment facilities. Septage
                         collected by gully bowsers is currently disposed of at open dumpsites maintained by the local
                         authorities, which pose a major environmental and health hazard. The project will finance small
                         scale septage treatment facilities in selected townships where septic waste will be treated before
                         discharging to the environment. The septage treatment proposed are low cost, small capacity
                         plants (35-65 m3), and will be managed by the NWSDB which has a good track record of
                         delivering quality service. The siting of the plants should be planned at design stage so that it does
                         not cause any unaesthetic views. The project will need to carefully look at practical challenges in
                         operating and maintaining the treatment plant as part of its feasibility, as lack of technical and
                         financial capacity to attend to breakdowns and malfunctions without delay can have serious
                         consequences.

                         With the provision of pipe borne water supply to communities, the risk of increased generation of
                         wastewater that is improperly disposed may arise. Under the World Bank financed CWSSP II and
                         NEPWASH, wastewater management from increased pipe supply was not observed to be a major

                         issue in the rural areas as water is mainly used for drinking purposes only. Hence, amount
                         generated as waste water is insignificant and is generally diverted to the garden. However, this
                         issue in town areas could be of more significant. The NWSDB will be encouraged to assess the
                         extent of the problem under all its urban small town schemes and develop practical wastewater
                         management solutions.

                         Social

                         Preliminary social screenings point to the need for additional lands for water asset development
                         due to lack of suitable Government lands in some project locations. Though the extents of land
                         required for water infrastructure such as building pumping stations and treatment plants are
                         relatively small in scale, there are instances of non-availability of government or community land
                         in the locality, particularly in urban areas. This issue poses a major challenge for project
                         implementation, particularly in following a lengthy land acquisition policy of the Government.
                         Also, there may be situations where Government land in urban areas is already encroached by
                         illegal settlers or squatters and therefore require systematic social assessments and alterative plans
                         to be considered. A Social Impact Assessment Framework (SMF) being prepared to provide
                         guidelines including policies and regulatory frameworks for instituting mitigation measures that
                         need to be adopted to address land acquisitions and resettlement issues, if any. Social screening of
                         Year 1 subprojects indicate that there are no resettlement impacts and therefore no RAPs required.

                                                                    Page 8 of 14
                           The project focuses on poverty stricken areas in order to improve the quality of life of the people
                           in rural, semi-urban and estate areas. Initial social assessment indicates that there might be some

                           issues related to affordability to obtain safe drinking water through improved facilities such as
                           pipe borne water through agencies by poorer and vulnerable households. Particularly, this may be
                           an issue for the households affected by the conflict and resettled recently in the Northern Province
                           as well as among people in the estate plantations. Access to safe water in estate sector is limited to
                           two third of people and rest obtain water from open water source such as river, tank and stream.
                           More than half of households are dependent on public tap/street tap for their water needs which are
                           usually much away from their line rooms requiring more time to walk along difficult terrains and
                           effort in fetching water. The problem of polluted water sources used to provide pipe born water
                           supply is also recorded in many places.

                           On the other hand, some recent estimates suggest that out of the total households having any kind
                           of toilets, only 45.5 percent of households are having toilets exclusively for them. Approximately
                           30 percent of estate households have no toilet facilities compared to all island figure of 6.1 percent
                           of the households without latrines. Unlike rural and urban areas, there is no strong civic
                           organizational arrangement or community based organizations to rely on implementing sub
                           projects in estate areas. Therefore the project expect to implement comprehensive awareness and
                           community mobilization program for the project to organize these communities as water users and
                           responsible for O&M of the assets that to be created by the project.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           Availability and vulnerability of the water sources, both in terms of quality and quantity aspects,
                           may present issues that go beyond the coverage of safeguard management of this project. Safety of
                           the water source in the long–term will hinge upon proper management of the watershed of which
                           the project or the communities will have little control over. Unregulated extraction and
                           contamination of water resources due to activities that take place elsewhere in the watershed or

                           subsequent to sub-projects being developed are some of the reasons that could lead to the
                           depletion or deterioration of water resources. While management for surface water is better
                           structured institutionally, there is no systematic approach to groundwater management in the
                           country.

                           While some of these issues have no easy solution and involve multi–sectoral & multi-stakeholder
                           discussions, certain positive developments have taken place. In 2005, the NWSDB together with
                           the Ministry of Health proposed a water surveillance system for all water supply schemes
                           operating within the country. Although this policy has been slow to get off ground, the NWSDB is
                           increasingly paying attention to developing water safety plans for its schemes around the country.
                           Under the project, water safety planning will be encouraged to be integrated into the design and
                           implementation of the water supply schemes with the required technical assistance mobilized for
                           the purpose.

                           No indirect and/ or long term adverse social impacts are expected as a result of the project
                           intervention. Most of the project components will have positive impacts on the reduction of
                           poverty, improved health and sanitation and greater ownership by communities and willingness to
                           improve sustainability of local water sources.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.

                          Sri Lanka has met the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in terms of access to improved
                          water supply and sanitation. However, despite this national average and the country being ranked
                          higher than its South Asian regional comparators, service delivery declines rapidly for

                          communities in small towns and rural areas. The proposed project areas are lagging regions and
                          have lower than national average in access to clean water and sanitation. The Central province is
                          home to some 54% of the estate population in the country where water supply and sanitation
                          services are lower and poverty is higher than national average. The Northern and Uva Provinces of
                          Sri Lanka, which are characterized by small towns and rural communities, are in the dry zone of
                          the country, thus community’s access to natural sources of water is restricted with severe
                          hardships faced during seasonal droughts. The Northern Province is further affected resulting from
                          prolonged underinvestment and damage to water infrastructure due to the conflict.

                          The Government has set targets for the water sector to provide access to safe drinking water for all
                          citizens over the medium term with a particular emphasis on increasing the quality of service.
                          Progress in reaching the MDG for malnutrition and child mortality is also linked to progress in
                          improving water supply and sanitation in the country. Given this background, and the project’s
                          potential to reduce poverty and shared prosperity, it is considered that there are no alternative to
                          the proposed project.

                           The project will be using simple technologies in developing sub-projects and expected not to have
                           any adverse impacts to the environment or the people. If complex sub-projects gets identified
                           during project implementation, measures that will avoid or minimize any negative will be
                           identified and incorporated in the sub-project design.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an

                          The demand-responsive approach adopted under this project means that the participating

                          communities and sub-projects are yet to be identified. As such, the Ministry of Urban
                          Development, Water Supply and Drainage has prepared an Environment Assessment &
                          Management Framework (EAMF). The EAMF identifies environmental concerns that require
                          attention during the design and implementation stages of sub-projects and recommends a process
                          for the early identification and mitigation of potential impacts in all categories of sub-projects.

                          As a routine, the project environmental staff, together with the communities and the Partner
                          Organizations (POs) in the case of rural schemes, will undertake an early environmental planning
                          exercise using the environmental screening form given in the EAMF. The screening form covers
                          all important elements in an Environmental Analysis (EA) in a structured questionnaire manner
                          and will capture potential environmental issues early in the sub-project cycle to recommend way
                          forward based on the significance of issues identified. As per the EAMF guidelines, a detail EA
                          will be warranted in the event that significant environmental issues are anticipated, if not, the
                          project could proceed with an Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

                          The EAMF has been applied to the year 1 investments which are comprised of 1 ground water and
                          2 surface water extraction schemes. According to the environmental screening, all three schemes
                          will require only EMPs. In the surface water extraction schemes, particular attention has been paid
                          to potential impacts on aquatic habitats from the proposed methodology of water extraction. As
                          part of environmental screening for year 1 projects, public consultation has been carried out. The

                          EAMF has been cleared by the World Bank. The Environmental Screening Reports are currently
                          being finalized and EMPs prepared or the year 1 projects. These sub-project specific
                          environmental safeguard documents have been submitted for clearance on April 23, 2015.

                          The main responsibility for ensuring compliance with environmental safeguards requirements will
                          be borne by the PMU which will be supported by a full-time environmental specialist who is
                          suitably qualified and experienced. Technical capacity to undertake environmental screening,
                          EMPs and water safety plans will be developed within the District Support Units (DSUs) with the
                          support of the NWSDB, under training programs conducted and dedicated staff allocated by the
                          project. In the event EA/EIAs are warranted, the PMU will recruit consultants with the required
                          expertise. Review and clearance of sub-project level environmental screening and EAs will be
                          undertaken by the PMU and in the case of Cat B sensitive type of sub-projects, concurrence of the
                          World Bank will be required.

                          The GOSL has past experience in managing environmental safeguard risks in large scale
                          development work funded by international donor agencies. The Central Environmental Authority,
                          the country’s premier environmental regulatory agency, has almost three decades of experience in
                          environmental management and monitoring of development projects. However, the CEA is
                          unlikely to be closely involved with the project given that most of the sub-projects will not be
                          prescribed projects. The NWSDB has implemented several WB and ADB funded projects in the
                          sector and hence is familiar with safeguard requirements. Having said that, the project will need to
                          build its own technical capacity to support safeguard management in its sub-projects.

                          Social

                          Ministry of Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage has prepared a Social Management
                          Framework (SMF) which also includes a Resettlement Policy Framework. The process of land
                          acquisition has been been explained in detail. The Government Land Acquisition Law will apply
                          in acquiring private lands. The implementing agencies will also use the option of direct
Public Disclosure Copy




                          purchasing (willing buyer-willing seller principle) because the size of land plots are very small for
                          water assets development under the project.

                          The social management will form an integral part of the overall scheme cycle. Each detailed
                          scheme report shall contain environmental/ social screening formats and shall guide in decision
                          making. Roles and responsibilities for ensuring implementation of the environment and social
                          safeguards have been already identified at district, agency and national level. The PMU
                          established at the Ministry of Water Supply will liaise with other implementing partner agencies to
                          identify social and environment issues.

                           At national level officer, PMU functions under the Ministry of Water Supply will be responsible
                           for ensuring the implementation of the SMF in all selected districts. At the PMU level Social
                           Safeguards Specialist will ensure that social management activities are in conformity with the
                           SMF and that necessary guidance and budget is provided to implement these plans. The District
                           level, the responsible agency (Water Board, CWD and PHDT), Social officer is charged with the
                           overall responsibility of ensuring the implementation of social aspects. The project will develop
                           capacities of social and environment staff through training and other information sharing measures
                           to execute safeguards functions effectively.

                           Initial social screening has identified key stakeholders and consultations have been held to seek
                           their views and incorporate the same into the design of the program. Community level
                           stakeholders include: (i) beneficiary households (including women, poor, estate plantations
                           community, war affected resettled ethnic minorities; (ii) Elected members of Local authorities
                           (Pradesha Shaba , Municipal and Urban Councils), (iii) Technical staff including Engineers of
                           NWSDB, DNCWS, PHDT and (iv) community based organizations as well as members of the
                           community who are potential project recipients (ex communities in Nanu Oya, Siyabalanduwa,
                           Haldamulla, Galigamuwa, Pambahinna, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi). Community level
                           consultations for each of above subproject areas were conducted during the period between
                           February 1 to 20th March 2015

                           Both the social and environmental screening has been conducted with the active participation of
                           these relevant stakeholders. In addition, technical consultations with regulatory agencies such as
                           the Central Environmental Authority, Department of Archaeology, and National Building
