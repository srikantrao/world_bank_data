                           The Development Objective is to enhance modern statistical and data management and sharing
                           capabilities in the Kyrgyz Republic in alignment with the tenets of the "Data Revolution" described
                           by the United Nations. This will strengthen the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic's national data
                           analytics, statistics, and public sector innovation agendas.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will build foundational elements of the Open Data ecosystem in four areas: (i)
                           the core legal, institutional, and technological framework; (ii) the supply of open data; (iii) the
                           demand for and use of open data; (iv) the capacity of government to manage complex ICT projects.
                           The project follows on the recommendations of the Open Data Readiness Assessment (ODRA) and
                           action plan that was developed in 2014-2015. The proposed project will also support a number of
                           pilot innovation initiatives in the most promising sectors identified during the ODRA, which will
                           include support for both supply and demand aspects of Open Data. Project activities are as follows:
