                           sector reforms that aim to improve financial protection and quality of care in the Republic of Kosovo.

                           C. Project Description
                           The grant will support two components:

                           1. Technical support for an improved poverty targeting system. The objective of this component is to support the
                           design and the implementation of an improved poverty targeting mechanism to target health insurance subsidies. The
                           existing poverty targeting mechanism in Kosovo or the “Last Resort Social Assistance” scheme is already based on a
                           proxy-means test, which is relevant in Kosovo given the high level of informality; however it needs to be fine-tuned as
                           it involves substantial exclusion errors and cumbersome procedures. The improvement of the poverty targeting
                           instrument are also supported under the Bank-Executed component (P150300). The Bank-Executed component
                           supports in particular the development of a new formula based on the latest household budget survey and of a new
                           questionnaire, as well as technical support to further integration of databases of key stakeholders such as the HIF’s
                           Information System, municipal centers for social work, various departments of the MoLSW, and the tax administration.

                           This Recipient-Executed component will include capacity building of institutions that will be in charge of implementing
                           the improved poverty targeting instrument.

                           2. Study tours and workshops. The objective of this component is to ensure that international best practices are
                           incorporated by the client into policy design and implementation of reforms in procurement systems for drugs and
                           supplies; targeting mechanisms to direct health insurance subsidies to the poor; and mandatory health insurance and
                           purchasing & service delivery reforms. Direct beneficiaries of workshops and study tours will include: MoH, HIF, Kosovo
                           University Clinical and Hospital Services of Kosovo (KUCHS), MoF, and MoLSW staff to support the incorporation of
                           international best practices into the design, implementation, and dissemination of best practices within these
                           institutions. TF audit(s) will also be financed under this component.

                          There are no safeguards policies triggered, so there is no need to assess the institutional capacity of the borrower to
                          implement them.
