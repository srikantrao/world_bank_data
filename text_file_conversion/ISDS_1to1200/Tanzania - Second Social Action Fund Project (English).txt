A.2. Project Objectives 
(a) Project development objective and key indicators. 
The PDO is to empower communities to access opportunities so that they can request, 
implement, and monitor sub-projects that contribute to improved livelihoods linked to 
MDG indicator targets in the Tanzania PRSP.  The key outcome indicator will be the 
percentage of targeted poor communities receiving grants to complete their subprojects 
within the agreed time-frame to benefit the following: (i) households with limited access 
to and use of specified service packages, (ii) vulnerable individuals needing assistance, 
and (iii) food insecure households with limited employment opportunities. 
 
(a) How would the project contribute to: The borrower’s higher level objectives for the sector and for 
poverty reduction?  The relevant CAS objective(s)? 
The Project will contribute to the goal of GOT to build human capabilities through (i) 
improving health (including tackling HIV/AIDS), education, and water and sanitation, 
and (ii) increasing empowerment and accountability in the areas of finance and 
governance.  The CAS is aligned to these goals by focusing on four areas of strategic 
importance; two of which inform the design of TASAF II as they seek to bring about (i) 
“sustainable rural development to improve the livelihood of the majority of the poor, who 
live in rural areas”, and (ii) “improved social infrastructure, to improve social indicators 
and enhance access to essential public health services by the poor” (CAS, p.20) 
 
Page  2
(b) Does the project depart from the CAS in content or other significant respects?  If so, how and why, and 
what implications does this have for the CAS program? 
The project is in line with the current CAS, and further focuses on results; in this case 
intermediate results that contribute to the attainment of specified MDG indicator targets. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
(a) What are the components of the project? 
The two components are: (i) National Village Fund (NVF), and (ii) Capacity 
Enhancement (CE). 
 
(b) On what basis were the components selected? 
As a project adopting the CDD approach, it was necessary to provide for a mechanism 
that would allow Local and Village Governments to respond to community demands for 
interventions that allow communities to contribute to the attainment of specified MDG 
indicator targets.   The management of a NVF will require the enhancement of capacities 
at National, Local and Village levels in the empowerment of communities to participate 
in poverty reduction activities.  Thus, the CE component is to facilitate the 
implementation of the NVF component.  The components were chosen on the basis that, 
based on experience to date in CDD in Tanzania, they are best suited to assist in attaining 
the development objectives.  The principal target group of the NVF are the poor.  
Specifically access to the Fund will be made by communities who are considered poor 
because they (a) lack access to basic social services; (b) are able-bodied but are food 
insecure; and (c) are vulnerable (i.e., orphaned, disabled, elderly, affected/infected by 
HIV/AIDS, etc.).  The poor who are interested in saving, and as individuals don’t have 
access to traditional banking institutions will be supported through the CE component. 
 
(c) For each component, what is the principal target group and the main project-related outcome 
for that group? 
There are four types of beneficiaries to be targeted by the NVF in order to improve their 
livelihoods: (i) service poor households who will avail themselves of improved services 
in health, education, water and sanitation among others, (ii) food insecure households 
with able-bodied adults who will increase their incomes from working in NVF-financed 
public works programs, and (iii) vulnerable individuals who will work through 
community-based organizations to access resources for increasing incomes at the 
household level.  Under the CE component, beneficiaries will be agencies (public and 
private) that support communities to make the best use of resources made available under 
the NVF component.  Another group of beneficiaries under the CE component are the 
poor individuals who will participate in group savings as a way of increasing their 
incomes by investing in opportunities created by various private-public partnerships.  
Outcomes for the groups are as follows: 
 
·
Households with increased availability and use of basic services 
·
Individuals with better employment opportunities to increase household 
income for meeting basic needs 
·
Vulnerable individuals reached with benefits 
·
Poor individuals with increased opportunities to save and undertake profitable 
investments 
Page  3
·
Subprojects completed in a satisfactory manner 
 
(d) For each component, what are the key inputs and outputs? 
The NVF will provide money to a Village level fund, 
Mfuko wa Kijiji/Shehia/Mtaa,
 as 
the principal input for households to produce outputs that improve service availability 
and use, as well as incomes for the able-bodied poor and the vulnerable.  Beneficiaries 
will be facilitated to identify priority problems, design interventions, and prepare 
proposals which TASAF will finance in the form of sub-projects.  The NVF will finance 
these sub-projects through the 
Mfuko wa Kijiji/Shehia/Mtaa
,
which will delegate 
subproject management to a democratically-elected Community Management 
Organization (CMO); specified amounts will be retained by the Local Government 
Council and Village Council to finance facilitation for the successful management of sub-
projects.  The NVF will finance sub-projects aimed at (i) improving service access to 
health, education, water, and other services; (ii) transferring cash through labor-intensive 
public works; and (iii) supporting income generation for households with vulnerable 
individuals.  
 
Key outputs for the first component are: 
·
For those with poor access to basic social services:  households with increased 
access to and use of specified service packages. 
·
For the able bodied poor who are food insecure:  poor individuals with increased 
and quantified employment opportunities through the subprojects. 
·
For the vulnerable:  vulnerable individuals receiving assistance from subprojects.  
 
The CE component will provide resources for training, supervision, monitoring, and 
evaluation of activities financed from the NVF component; the main outputs being the 
number of sub-projects completed in a satisfactory manner.  Members of  CMOs, their 
trainers, and the training of trainers will receive support under this component.  In 
addition, Community Savings and Investments Promotion (COMSIP) activities will be 
supported under this component for the establishment of voluntary COMSI Groups of at 
least 10 members, COMSI Clubs of at least 10 COMSI Groups, and COMSI Banks 
formed within the public private partnership between COMSI Clubs and commercial 
micro-finance institutions.  Funding to Clubs which require infrastructure to support 
sustainable savings mobilization at community level will also be provided through this 
component. 
 
Key outputs for the second component are: 
·
For the poor interested in savings:  individuals participating in informal and 
formal savings and market-driven initiatives (COMSI Groups, COMSI Clubs and 
COMSI Banks) 
·
For others, individuals reached with capacity enhancement activities at Village, 
Ward, District/Municipal, and National levels. 
 
(e) Of the sector issues mentioned in A.1, which are to be addressed through the project, and in what ways? 
The Project adopts the Social Risk Management (SRM) approach to social protection by 
creating rules for households to access resources that can stimulate economic activities 
Page  4
that can benefit poor households increasing their incomes to address issues of 
vulnerability and limited availability and use of social services.  Thus, the Project 
provides a multi-sectoral response to the needs of communities whose actions will better 
prepare them to take advantage of market-created opportunities as well as utilize 
resources made available under the MTEF.  Communities and sectors (represented at 
Ward and District/Municipal levels) will be able to undertake activities that assist GOT 
meet its targets as laid out in the PRS 
–
in health, education, water and sanitation, savings 
mobilization, incomes among the poor, tackling vulnerability, and increasing access to 
the market by the poor. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project location will be nation-wide.  Sub-projects are expected to be small in size 
and site-specific.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The range, scale, location and number of sub-projects are not yet determined; they will 
emerge from the participatory process with communities.  Sub-projects that cannot 
develop mitigation measures that are acceptable to the community and are not in line with 
national environmental policy guidelines and norms cannot be funded by TASAF II. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
There will be limited local impact for the majority of sub-projects.  The other sub-
projects will be assessed as demanded. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The Borrower has prepared an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RFP) which have been reviewed, 
approved and disclosed at the World Bank Info Shop and in-country on July 21, 2004. 
 
Although sufficient capacity for management of safeguard issues exists at the national 
level, there is limited capacity at the district and lower levels of local government.  
TASAF II will make resources available to strengthen lower levels of local government 
through training, capacity and awareness building of the various actors and stakeholders 
in order to mainstream safeguard activities into the subproject cycle. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The ESMF and the RPF have been prepared following a broad-based consultation with 
relevant stakeholder groups in the public and private sectors and civil society, including 
communities and sectors at the village, Ward District/Municipal and NGOs.  Both RPF 
and ESMF have been reviewed, approved by the Bank and disclosed in-country and at 
Bank InfoShop on July 21, 2004. 
 
As part of the subproject cycle, an Extended Participatory Rural Appraisal will be 
undertaken with communities to identify potential environmental and social impacts of 
selected subprojects
.
A
Limited Environmental Im
pact Assessment (LEA) will be 
Page  6
conducted under the leadership of Ward and District extension staff trained in 
environmental issues. At desk appraisal, the Local Government Authority (LGA) officer 
responsible for environment and natural resource management will sign off confirming 
that either no negative environmental impacts are identified or confirming that an LEA 
has been conducted.  Measures to minimize and mitigate environmental impacts will also 
be confirmed during field appraisal, and the leader of appraisal team will sign off that this 
has been done.  
 
Projects requiring an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIAs) will be sent to the 
National Steering Committee for evaluation by the Sector Experts Team, which will send 
environmental experts to the LGAs in order to conduct the necessary EIA. Subproject-
specific EIAs will be conducted in close consultation with stakeholders, including project 
affected people.  The EIAs and resulting EMPs and/or RAPs will also be reviewed, 
approved and disclosed in-country and at World Bank InfoShop.
