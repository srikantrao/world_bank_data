A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project Development Objective is 
to support the Arab Republic of Egypt in providing quality early 
childhood education that improves the school readiness of 4 and 5 year old children, particularly the 
disadvantaged.
 
The key performance indicator for this project is: 
a
20%
increase in enrollment over 
baseline in KG1-2 of adequate quality in targeted areas (with particular emphasis on 
those who are disadvantaged by gender, poverty and disability).
 
The proposed project supports the GOE’s overall human development goals in general, and the MOE’s 
goals for the ECE level in particular.  The Ministry of Education’s (MOE) goal is to expand ECE coverage 
from 13 percent to 60 percent by 2010.  World Bank analysis of the current provision through the public, 
private, and NGO providers, and the potential for expansion of these providers, shows that this goal may be 
difficult to attain.  The ECEEP is designed to support the attainment of intermediate goals (see Results 
Framework) towards reaching Government’s 60 percent target.   
In addition to the access goals, this project will support the GOE in comprehensively addressing the multi-
faceted ‘quality’ and ‘capacity’ challenges at the ECE level through an ECE reform program, to which this 
five-year, multi-donor project is contributing.  It is important to address these multi-faceted issues 
comprehensively because of the linkages and synergies among the required interventions.  For example, 
Page  2
increasing access requires raising the quality of ECE programs and improving management.  Similarly, 
i
mproving quality requires increased access to complementary types of programs (public and NGOs) as 
well as improved management and monitoring and supervision of quality.  While presented as separate 
interventions (see component descriptions), it is important to note the multi-faceted dimensions and inter-
linkages among the components, particularly at the level of the communities and schools.  The ECEEP, 
therefore, is designed to lay the ‘groundwork’ for extensive reforms at the ECE level (with significant 
impacts expected also at the primary level) and build on the innovative and successful models of education 
provision implemented in Egypt and in the region and on the strengths and comparative advantages of the 
specific donors (World Bank, CIDA, and WFP).
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed project aims to achieve its development objective through the following three components:  
(1) Increase Access; (2) Improve Quality; and (3) Build Capacity. 
Component 1 - Increase Access (US$75.73 million)
 
The Access component of the project has the following 3 subcomponents: (1.1) Support 
public construction and maintenance program; (1.2) Support expansion through MISA-
registered KGs and community provided facilities; and (1.3)
 
Address demand-side 
constraints. 
 
Subcomponent 1.1
 
Support public construction and maintenance program - 
US$31.47 million (GOE $15.74 million, IBRD $15.74 million) 
–
the project will 
finance construction and furnishing of 1,988 new KG classrooms under the on-going 
public construction program, enabling access to 119,000 students during the five years of 
the project.  On average, each classroom unit (i.e., including requisite toilet and open 
space) will cost approximately US$14,540 (L.E. 90,000) for civil works and US$1,292 
(L.E. 8,000) for furniture. 
 
The MOE KG Department will work closely with GAEB and PCC to establish the 
locations of new KGs that will be constructed during Phase I of the project (years 1-2) 
through the use of the school mapping system.  GAEB already has available layout and 
drawings showing the internal organization of KG classrooms (including disabled 
accessibility). 
 
Subcomponent 1.2 
Support expansion through MISA-registered KGs and 
community provided facilities -  US$15.96 million (GOE $6.23 million, IBRD $3.07 
million, Communities $6.66 million) 
–
the project will enable access to 192,000 four 
and five year olds to quality ECE through partnerships with MISA registered NGO-run 
KGs and communities during the life of the project.  To maximize access within the 
target areas of the project in a cost-effective manner, the MOE will cooperate closely 
with MISA to identify registered nurseries and KGs with 4 and 5 year old children for 
educational inputs (e.g., educational materials, furniture, equipment) and technical 
assistance (e.g., supervision, teacher training, classroom management training) from the 
MOE.  Where such facilities are not available, the MOE will solicit community 
contributions in the form of donated rooms/buildings.  Communities (or NGOs acting on 
behalf of the communities) will be provided approxima
tely US$1,670 (LE 10,000) to 
Page  3
renovate and US$1,292 (LE 8,000) to furnish about 1,776 donated rooms/buildings into 
KG classrooms that can serve as acceptable quality learning environments
1
.
Upon 
completion of the renovation, the MOE will provide the necessary teaching staff and 
learning materials to these KGs, as in the public ECE system.  The Local Coordination 
Committee, in coordination with GAEB (using the school mapping system), will 
facilitate the initial choice of locations for community-donated facilities.  To benefit from 
the linkages built under the Community Participant Grants component, this process will 
begin towards the end of each project phase. 
 
Subcomponent 1.3 
Address demand-side constraints (including Administer 
Community Participation Grants Program) - US$28.29 million (GOE $20.0 million, 
CIDA $8.29 million
2
)
–
the project will, through Community Participation Grants, 
increase the enrollment of disadvantaged boys and girls in ECE programs, enhance the 
quality of existing programs and strengthen community capacity to support these 
programs and their children. Under this subcomponent, technical and financial support 
will be provided to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Community Development 
Associations (CDAs), Parent Teacher Councils (PTCs) and other community-based 
organizations to develop community-level ECE Improvement Action Plans that outline a 
program of activities, both project-funded and community resourced, to address the 
particular priorities of each community. Eligibility criteria for the grants will be specified 
in an Operations Manual and agreed by the PCC and CIDA. 
 
The annual fees at the preschool level (a key demand-side constraint) have been reduced 
from about LE120 to about LE28.  This measure is expected to relieve the financial 
burden on many poor families that otherwise would be unable to send their children to 
KGs.  The MOE will provide US$4million per year in the form of educational materials 
and operations and maintenance (O&M) and other required support services to 
compensate for the loss of fees in the 152 disadvantaged project areas.   
 
Component 2 
–
Improve Quality (US$28.45 million) 
 
The Quality component of ECEEP will finance TA, curriculum and educational materials 
development, teacher training, and food for the improvement in quality of teaching and 
learning in MOE public KG programs and NGO-operated KGs for 4- and 5-year old 
children.  This will entail developing a quality gender-sensitive, child-centered and 
activity-based curriculum based on KG national standards that addresses the 
developmental needs and interests of 4- and 5-year old children and ensuring that KG 
teachers implement this pedagogical approach in the classroom.  In order to improve and 
maintain quality, TA will be provided for key institutions that are responsible for both 
curriculum and educational materials development (CCIMD) and in
-

training (CDIST).  The subcomponents are: (i) Develop a child-centered curriculum and 
educational materials based on national standards, (ii) Develop and deliver an effective 
teacher training program, and (iii) Link nutrition and health to ECE. 
 
Subcomponent 2.1 
Develop a child-centered curriculum based on national 
standards - US$1.31 million (GOE $0.13 million, IBRD $0.70 million, CIDA $0.48) -
 
the project will finance TA to support and assist CCIMD with the development of a new 
KG curriculum and educational materials for use in MOE public kindergarten classrooms 
and MISA registered NGO programs for 4- and 5-year old children.  The curriculum 
framework will be founded on a child-centered, activity based pedagogical approach and 
the KG National Standards (to be developed under subcomponent 3.1). 
 
Subcomponent 2.2 
Develop and deliver an effective teacher training program - 
US$8.67 million (all GOE) 
–
this subcomponent
 
will finance TA to support and assist 
CCIMD and CDIST in the development of an ECE teacher training program.  Teacher 
training will be based on:  (i) the new KG curriculum; (ii) required ECE basic 
needs/skills; and (iii) results from field work in model classrooms developed and 
delivered to five distinct groups of trainees (see Annex 4 for details).  In addition, a Train 
the Trainer program will be developed and delivered to 80 teacher trainers who will then 
be responsible for delivering the teacher training to all participants through face-to-face 
and video conferencing sessions. 
 
Subcomponent 2.3 
Link nutrition and health to ECE - US$18.47 million  (GOE 
$1.61 million, IBRD $0.39 million, CIDA $0.13 million, WFP $16.34 million)
 –
this 
subcomponent will address the health and nutritional needs of young children and aims to 
improve their learning potential.  The subcomponent includes one major activity (with 
cost implications) and several other activities that are integrated into other components, 
which will be implemented as per the Project Implementation Plan.  The key activity of 
the subcomponent is a school feeding program targeting the most disadvantaged children 
at the ECE level in seven Governorates (funded by the WFP subject to project approval 
and donor support).  All non-food related expenses, including transportation, storage and 
handling costs, TA and any necessary project support expenses, will be covered from 
Government contributions and the project budget.  In addition to the US$1.61 million 
contribution, the MOE will complement WFP inputs to the feeding program for KG 
students, to cover the remaining 11 project governorates not funded by WFP. 
 
The food aid program supported by WFP will be carried out in the seven governorates 
with the highest malnutrition rates (of the 18 project governorates), synchronized with the 
phasing plan of the project.  The WFP will sign an MOU with the Ministry of Education 
describing the roles, responsibilities and financial obligations of each institution by Jan 
end, 2005. 
 
Component 3 - Build Capacity (US$5.77 million) 
 
This component will finance capacity building in the relevant MOE Departments at the 
national and local levels to develop a system to implement KG Standards and better 
Page  5
manage the ECE expansion plans as well as institute long-term policy reforms for the 
ECE sector.  The two subcomponents are:  (i) Develop a System to Implement KG 
Standards; and (ii) Support the MOE. 
 
Subcomponent 3.1 
Design a System to Implement KG Standards - US$0.35 
million (all CIDA)
 
–
this subcomponent will finance TA to support and assist the PCC to 
establish standard based criteria for assessing KG classrooms.  An international 
consultant will facilitate comprehensive participatory sessions with relevant stakeholders 
such as the NCEEE, MISA, and NGOs to develop national KG standards that include:  (i) 
domains; (ii) standards for each domain; (iii) indicators for each standard; and (iv) a 
corresponding checklist which will support a progressive model of implementation.  A 
system design supportive of program development and enhancement efforts of MOE KG 
teachers, junior assistants working with MOE KG teachers in the classroom and 
facilitators working in NGO programs for 4- and 5-year old children will be developed. 
 
Subcomponent 3.2 
Support the Ministry of Education - US$5.43 million (GOE 
$0.22 million, CIDA $5.21 million)
 –
this subcomponent, through a Canadian 
Assistance Team, will support the KG Department at national and governorate levels to 
effectively manage:  (i) the planned expansion of kindergartens; (ii) the intra- and inter- 
Ministerial coordination necessary to plan and implement a cohesive early childhood 
education system; and (iii) the development of core management skills such as planning, 
reporting, monitoring and evaluation.  Support to the MOE under this subcomponent will 
include technical assistance from local and international sources as well as ongoing 
mentoring of management and coordination functions.  In addition to technical 
assistance, professional development opportunities and equipment and materials will be 
provided in an integrated fashion to strengthen those areas agreed through successive 
annual work plans.
