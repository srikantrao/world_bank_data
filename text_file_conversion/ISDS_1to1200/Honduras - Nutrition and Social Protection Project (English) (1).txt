B.  Project Objective
The development objective of the project is to strengthen the country’s social safety net to  
effectively and efficiently improve the nutritional status of children less than five years old and 
to pr
ovide alternative interventions for the early childhood development, as well as to provide 
opportunities for disadvantaged youth to become productive members of society. To this end, the 
project would support the Government of Honduras  to (i) establish a 
social protection policy 
framework for vulnerable groups, (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity to design, implement 
and evaluate effective interventions for the identified priority groups, and (iii) consolidate and 
scale up successful interventions d
esigned to reduce the social risks of these groups.
The project is envisioned as the initial phase in a concerted effort to improve the country’s social 
safety net. Large scale results are unlikely to be attainable in the short term. The proposed 
project,
 therefore, should be seen as the first phase of the Bank’s longer term involvement in 
improving the country’s safety net.

C.  Project Description
The project would consist of four components: 
(i)
Strengthening the social safety net and its implement
ing institutions (US$ 1.5 
million). 
This component would include technical assistance to improve the effectiveness and 
efficiency of public institutions in providing a safety net and human development opportunities 
for the most vulnerable groups. The respo
nsible government agency is the Ministry of the 
Presidency.  The content and implementation structure of this component, however, will be 
developed as part of the PHRD implementation. 
(ii)
Strengthening and scaling up of the AIN
-
C program (US$ 10.5 milli
on).
 The AIN
-
C 
program was created by the Honduran Ministry of Health in the early 90s, mainly with support 
from USAID. This preventive health and nutrition program is based on community volunteers 
(mothers) that monitor growth of children 0
-
24 months of a
ge, provide mothers with advice on 
how to better take care of their babies and toddlers, and provide curative primary health care 
services (primarily for diarrhea and respiratory problems) to children less than five. Evaluation 
results show that participat
ing mothers are much better informed about good practices and 
improve considerably in their provision of early childhood health care and general childbearing 
practices. Encouraged by these results, the Ministry of Health now intends to expand the 
program f
rom its current coverage of 1,800 communities to all of the communities in the 80 
poorest municipalities. The first step in the expansion will incorporate an additional 2,000, with 
further scaling up of the program to 10,000 communities by 2015, when it wi
ll cover 
approximately 40 percent of all Honduran communities. 
AIN
-
C is now being implemented by a variety of Honduran institutions, including the MoH, 
PRAF and several NGOs. The program has great potential to substantially improve the 
nutritional status 
and early childhood development of poor children, particularly in rural areas. In 
order to more fully exploit its potential, however, the program needs to be strengthened and 
broadened, before it can be scaled up. 
The implementing agency 
for this compone
nt would be the Ministry of Health in its role as the 
normative agency for the country’s nutrition policy and programs, and the supervisor and agency 
in charge of the monitoring and evaluation of the AIN
-
C program. To expand the improved AIN
-
C program, MoH
 intends to increasingly contract NGOs (60% implemented through NGOs, 40% 
implemented by MoH). Emphasis would be given to strengthening the capacity of local health 
facilities to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the AIN
-
C+ program. 
(iii)
Suppor
ting the implementation of the National Plan for Extremely Vulnerable 
Groups (US$ 6 million). 
This component would primarily address youth issues, but it would 
also explore ways of improving early child care, thus complementing the AIN
-
C.

 
Improve opportuni
ties for social inclusion of Youth at Risk.
 Building on the lessons from 
existing (PRAF’s “Bono Juvenil”) and planned (Youth Employability
-
JSDF) programs, 
as well as international experience in dealing with the integration of disadvantaged youth 
into the l
abor market, this component would consolidate and expand the most successful 
existing approaches. It would include a strong focus on monitoring and evaluation. 
Synergies and collaboration with other projects that activities for youth, such as the 
Page  3
Bank’s ur
ban development project, and GTZ’s project for micro
-
enterprise development, 
would be cultivated during project preparation and implementation. 

 
Exploring modalities for community
-
based childcare.
 Mayors, local NGOs and 
community volunteers all highlight t
he need to offer childcare services at the local level, 
particularly for single mothers. During the preparation of the project, options would be 
explored for supporting community
-
based childcare and early stimulation initiatives in 
accordance with local ne
eds and possibilities. The identified modalities would be piloted 
under the proposed project and could be expanded in subsequent operations.
In accordance with the Government’s decision to strengthen PRAF in its function as a major 
social protection implem
enting agency, the youth component of the project would be 
administered by PRAF. Experienced NGOs would be contracted to implement the youth related 
activities financed under the credit.
Since the “childcare” component still needs to be further developed, 
no implementing agency has 
yet to been identified. Experience from other LAC countries suggests that there is an important 
role for municipalities and communities to play in implementing and operating such programs
.
As for central government agencies,  it 
is clear that neither the MoH nor IHNFA would be 
capable of implementing such component.
(iv)
Project management, monitoring and evaluation, as well as audits (US$ 2 million).
This component would include technical assistance to the implementing agencies
 for managing 
the project, including its procurement and financial management. It would cover the initial 
incremental investment costs that MOH and PRAF would incur to  design and expand their 
respective programs. 
Monitoring and Evaluation will be crucial
 elements of the implementation of this project. The 
AIN
-
C program has been evaluated recently. It would therefore be important to evaluate the 
effects and impacts of the additional aspects covered under the new “AIN
-
C+ “ design. As for 
the youth component
, a baseline survey and impact evaluation would be designed with a focus 
on labor market insertion of the participants.
D.  Project location (if known)
The expansion of the AIN
-
C would take place mostly in the 80 municipalities identified as the 
ones with
 the highest incidence of malnutrition. The youth component would be concentrated in 
the large cities. 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity
The Ministry of Health is responsible for the implementation and up
-
scaling of the  AIN
-
C 
program. At present, th
e MoH’s  institutional capacity is weak and needs to be strengthened 
considerably. 
PRAF has been assigned to implement the project’s youth component. The institution has 
experience with implementing credits and grants, but its administrative, monitoring 
and 
evaluation capacity needs to be strengthened considerably.

III.  ACTIONS DURING PROJECT PREPARATION
[Guideline: Refer to sections 5 and 6 of the PCN]
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the part
ies' claims on the 
disputed areas

A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them
?
An IPDP would be established with particular focus on the nutrition component (AIN
-
C). 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed?
Indigenous populations will be included by the project through the improvement and up scaling 
of the AIN
-
C program. Consultations will be held on how to adapt the AIN
-
C to the specific 
needs of indigenous communities and how to better include them in the AIN
-
C activities. The 
result of the consultation process will feed into the new AIN
-
C’s operati
onal manual. 
As for the youth component, indigenous youth is not expected to be part of the beneficiary group 
since large cities are targeted.
