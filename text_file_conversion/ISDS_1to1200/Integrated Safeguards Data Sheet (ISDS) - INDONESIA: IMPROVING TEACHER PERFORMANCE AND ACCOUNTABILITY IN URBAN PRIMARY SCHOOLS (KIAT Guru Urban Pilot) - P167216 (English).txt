                           C. Project Description
                           A key principle to the intervention design of KIAT Guru Urban pilot is the scalability of the mechanism for
                           nation-wide policy implementation. In addition, MoEC wants to utilize the KIAT Guru Urban pilot to test a
                           new teacher performance evaluation. In line with the Civil Servant Law, MoEC needs to align the way
                           teachers have been evaluated, from using the Penilaian Kinerja Guru (Teacher Performance Evaluation/ PKG),
                           which mainly focuses on teacher competence, to using the Penilaian Prestasi Kerja (Work Performance

                           Evaluation/ PPK), which covers performance indicators of teachers as civil servants. In line with the
                           Government Regulation 19/ 2017 on Teachers, the PPK needs to include five key domain activities (hereafter
                           5M): planning, implementing, training and guiding, evaluating, and conducting additional assignments (such
                           as being a vice principal, librarian, counselor, etc.).

                           Consultations with MoEC, BAPPENAS, and MoF have narrowed down the formula to tie payment of TPG with
                           teacher performance that directly contribute to student learning. The teacher performance indicators
                           selected for the KIAT Guru Urban pilot will be derived from a long list of the PKG list of indicators and the
                           KIAT Guru Remote pilot score card indicators for evaluation teacher service performance. This long list of
                           indicators was suggested and approved by the MoEC. Through technical workshops to be hosted by the
                           MoEC and involving teacher representatives in April and June 2018, the PKG and KIAT Guru Remote
                           indicators will be mapped against the 5M, and shortlisted based on teacher activities and behaviors that are
                           directly supportive of studentsâ€™ learning. In addition to mapping out the specific indicators, the evaluators

                           need to be agreed upon as well, including supervisors, principals, other teachers, and School Committee
                           members (including parents).

                           The KIAT Guru Urban pilot will test three intervention groups (see table below) to identify the most effective
                           way to evaluate teacher performance in primary schools in urban settings. The first intervention group
                           represents a classical top-down approach from the national level to the local level in which all relevant
                           parameters are set at the national level. This intervention group will be the easiest for a national scale-up
                           since it involves an implementation mechanism that is highly standardized. The second and third intervention
                           groups consider local (school-level) approaches to setting evaluation standards. While the second
                           intervention group has evaluation standards being determined by education providers (principal, teachers)
                           alone, the third intervention group involves in addition the local school committee to ensure the
                           participation of and monitoring by education users. The three intervention groups were developed based on
                           extensive consultations with MoEC, and were approved on November 21st, 2017.

                           schools where the government policies are implemented as usual. Changes in student learning outcomes
                           between baseline and endline constitutes the main outcome indicator to assess whether and which
                           intervention group has shown the best results. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of each intervention arm
                           will be evaluated. The World Bank will conduct an Analytical Services and Advisory (ASA) that accompanies
                           the pilot (P167281), which aims to provide advice for pilot intervention and evaluation designs, to evaluate
                           the impact of the pilot interventions, and to provide policy recommendations to GoI. Further information on
                           this ASA and its link to this project is provided in the attached draft Integrated Project Concept Note (PCN).

                           The implementation of the intervention groups will be conducted as much as possible using the government
                           system within the education sector. This project will implement the three intervention groups. The Grant
                           Recipient will: (a) provide the district/ municipality governments with technical assistance to coordinate the
                           socialization and closing events; (b) provide by-demand technical assistance to district/ municipality

                           governments and schools on the administration of the teacher performance assessment and the payment of
                           TPG based on performance evaluation; (c) conduct qualitative documentation and spot-check monitoring of
                           randomly selected pilot schools throughout the duration of the project implementation timeline; and (d)
                           provide on-demand supports on the utilization of the project's Management Information System
                           and complaint handling and redress mechanism by the stakeholders. In addition, the Grant Recipient will
                           administer the payment of grant for the 210 pilot schools to conduct socialization and evaluation meetings,
                           and administer the teacher performance scores in schools.

                           The Project Components consist of:

                          The project will be implemented in 210 urban primary schools in three districts/municipalities. This project is
                          part of a Technical Assistance (TA) provided to the MoEC. The project will not finance any physical
                          investments, population displacement or land acquisition. All TA activities, recommendations and advice
                          provided through the support from this project are not expected to generate environmental and social
                          implications. In areas where there are communities with Indigenous Peoples (IPs) characteristics as required
