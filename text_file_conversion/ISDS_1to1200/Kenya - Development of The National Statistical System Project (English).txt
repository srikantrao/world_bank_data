A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overarching goal of the project is to improve the quality, timeliness, relevance, and 
availability of statistical information in Kenya and to encourage its use.  The project will 
achieve this objective by (a) supporting improvements in the policy, legislative, 
regulatory and institutional framework governing the generation and dissemination of 
statistic; (b) supporting the development of statistical infrastructure; (c) encouraging 
statistical cooperation and collaboration between the NSS, research, and academic 
institutions; and (4) upgrading and developing statistical operations and procedures.  This 
project will ensure a steady supply of reliable and timely social and economic statistics 
needed for policy making , monitoring and evaluation of the MDGs and performance 
indicators outlined in the IP-ERS.  The Kenya CAS presented to the Board in June 2004 
has identified strengthening the 
country’s statistical system as a key priority for the next 
four years and has included the proposed project in the lending program for fiscal 2005.  
It will also provide key indicators to be used in monitoring and evaluation of the Medium 
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) Budget.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
i.Lending instrument 
 
The project will be financed with a specific investment loan, under the umbrella of the Statistical Capacity 
Building (STATCAP) Program Adaptable Program Credit.  The STATCAP is a facility that aims to 
improve statistical capacity in a number of countries t
hrough a sectorwide approach, on the basis of a 
Page  2
Statistical Plan prepared and owned by the country.  Subsequent loans or credits obtained by borrowers are 
treated as phases of the APL under the STATCAP approach.  STATCAP is designed to enable countries to 
make significant investments in statistical capacity, to both improve efficiency and effectiveness in the 
future and finance the most urgent current statistical activities.  The STATCAP project for Kenya will 
support a medium to long-term investment program, with the first phase lasting for five years.  If the 
project substantially achieves its phase 1 objectives, and if the government requires further financing to 
implement its longer term strategy, a second phase would be possible. 
 
To be eligible for a credit under STATCAP countries must: (a) have prepared a national statistical 
development strategy and Statistical Plan; (b) have demonstrated strong national commitment and 
leadership; (c) be willing to comply with good statistical practice; (d) have participated in global 
development and monitoring activities; and (e) have established arrangements for the sustainable operation 
of the statistical system.  Countries must also have complied with criteria applying to assistance in general, 
such as being creditworthy and having an agreed PRSP.  
 
Kenya has satisfied the eligibility criteria for STATCAP.  The Government’s commitment to the 
development of an NSS is demonstrated in the Cabinet’s recent (December 2003)endorsement of the SP 
and  the draft Statistics Bill.  The country is participating in the GDDS and its meta data has already been 
placed on the IMF Website.  Its willingness to participate in other global monitoring activities is outlined in 
Annex 1. 
 
ii.Project development objective and key indicators. 
 
The project’s development objective is to create an efficient and effective national statistical system to 
provide reliable, timely, and accurate data in line with international good practice and frameworks and 
needs of users.  The specific objectives of the proposed project are to support the government’s efforts to: 
 
·
Develop a robust, coordinated, effective and demand driven national statistical system, and 
provide services that are accountable to multiple users.  
·
Produce impartial, credible, consistent and accessible statistical data and information in a timely 
and cost-effective manner. 
·
Encourage data producers to build partnerships with data users such as research and academic 
institutions with a view to building of a sustainable data and information sharing system. 
·
Create synergy through the establishment of both vertical and horizontal linkages among data 
producers in the country. 
·
Harness new developments in information and communication technology to improve the methods 
of data collection, processing, packaging, and dissemination to users.  
 
The project will consolidate and complement the efforts previously undertaken by the 
Kenya government and bilateral and multilateral organizations and support actions that 
are specified in the Strategic Plan. 
 
Key performance indicators include: 
·
Satisfaction of users of statistical information increases compared with a baseline. 
·
Significant progress is made in establishing a robust annual process of monitoring 
the IP-ERS. 
·
Use of statistical information clearly increases through, for example, reference to 
statistics in government’s sector plans.  
Kenya’s statistical system increasingly conforms to the standard of the IMF’s GDDS, 
with regular updating and publication of the GDDS metadata in line with its 
Page  3
recommendations.   
 
iii.Project components  
 
The project comprises six components: (a) organizational development (b) human 
resource development; (c) development of statistical infrastructure; (d) data development; 
(e) physical infrastructure and equipment; and (f) project management.  A brief 
description of each of the components is present below To ensure participation and 
collaboration of the line ministries and agencies within the NSS, the SMP has been 
designed to include the development and strengthening of statistical units of producers of 
official statistics outside the CBS.   
 
(a)  
Organizational Development.  
This component will ensure that institutional 
capacity supports the formulation, coordination, and implementation of appropriate 
statistical policies and programs geared to the needs of the Kenyan economy.  It will 
support the development of an organizational culture that reflects modern principles of 
management that is results oriented and focuses on teamwork, and that optimize the use 
of human resources, networking, and communication throughout the organization.  The 
component will support development of new statistical legislation and regulations 
Expected outputs include new statistical legislation and regulations that promotes the 
effective production and use of data while guaranteeing the confidentiality of individual 
records.  It will also support measures to strengthen mechanisms for coordination of 
statistical activities between line ministries, and between the center and the districts.  
Finally, it will support establishment of mechanisms for dialogue among data producers, 
users (including research and academic institutions), and respondents (providers).   
 
(b)  
Human Resource Development.
 
This component will support training and 
education to strengthen professional skills of producers, suppliers, and users of data.  The 
staff of CBS, line ministries, departments, agencies and others will be trained to use new 
statistics standards and methodologies, and to employ new managerial skills.  This will 
require that comprehensive training is undertaken, not on an ad hoc and intermittent basis 
as is currently the case, but on an ongoing and strategic basis.   
 
This component will also support measures to strengthen ties between the CBS and a 
selected university to improve the learning and teaching of applied statistics and to 
reduce duplication of data collection by CBS, other NSS agencies, and research institutes.  
As a first step, CBS and a university will jointly develop a syllabus for the teaching of 
applied statistics at the college and university levels.     
 
(c) 
Development of Statistical Infrastructure.
 
This component will provide the 
necessary infrastructure including computer processing equipment and software to 
strengthen data collection, processing, and analysis.  It will also support the compilation 
and maintenance of (a) an updated central business register of establishments; (b) a 
sampling frame for household based censuses and surveys; (c) compendiums of concepts, 
definitions, and methodologies for application in statistical analysis; and (d) economic 
and social classifications.  This will require all statistical and regulatory agencies to agree 
Page  4
to cooperate and make joint efforts to build compatible statistical infrastructure.   
 
(d) Data 
Development
.
This component will finance the adaptation by the main 
statistical agencies of internationally accepted standards and methodologies in data 
collection, compilation, and validation.  It will also support the further development of 
sectoral statistics on issues such as demography, civil registration, health, education, 
poverty and living standards, national accounts, employment, judicial actions, agriculture, 
tourism, and transportation.   
 
Information will be collected through both surveys and censuses and routine data systems 
(also known as administrative data sources, because most are part of the government’s 
administration).  The program of surveys and censuses has been prioritized according to 
the already existing data gaps, the need to monitor the achievement of the national goals, 
and the availability of funds to finance the proposed activities, most of which will be 
provided by development partners.  Routine data systems (including coordination and 
integration) will be strengthened in the ministries of planning, education, health, transport 
and communication; departments of judiciary, police, prisons, probation, and civil 
registration; and the Kenya Revenue Authority and the Central Bank of Kenya.  It is 
anticipated that the improved routine data systems will provide regular information on 
economic output, school enrolments, vaccination coverage and the like that can be used 
to understand trends in economic growth, poverty, and human development. 
 
This component will also support measures to raise awareness of statistics among 
potential users and the development of a data dissemination policy that will facilitate 
access of users to data.  This will include support for development of procedures and 
presentations that reflect not only international standards and best practices, but also the 
continuous feedback from decisionmakers, analysts, and researchers. 
 
Finally, this component will support the development by the CBS of project performance 
agreements (PPA) to be signed between the CBS and individual line ministries, 
departments, and other agencies that produce and disseminate official statistics.   
 
(e)   
Physical Infrastructure and Equipment.
 
This component will provide computers 
and networking equipment, vehicles, survey equipment and accessories, and office 
furniture and supplies for CBS and line ministries.  This will require the commitment of 
government to provide flexibility on the choice and use of technology and equipment for 
statistical purposes.   
 
(f) Project Management
.
This component will finance project management and 
monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the project.  It will finance technical 
assistance, expertise, consultant services, operating costs, logistical support, and 
equipment needed to operate the project management unit (PMU), to be housed within 
the CBS.
