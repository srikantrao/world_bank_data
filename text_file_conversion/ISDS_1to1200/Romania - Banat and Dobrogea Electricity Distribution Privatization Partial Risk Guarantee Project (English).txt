Guarantee Amount:   Euro 60 million
Financing amounts by source: 
Private Investor:  Euro 112 million
B.  Project Objectives
The objectiv
e of the proposed partial risk guarantee is to support Romania’s energy sector 
privatization program by enabling the Government and the private investor reach privatization 
agreement on Banat and Dobrogea electricity distribution company privatization tran
sactions and 
implement the privatization and the new regulatory framework for electricity distribution.  
C.  Project Description
The PRG would provide a guarantee to the Banat and Dobrogea distribution companies 
(discoms) for the recovery of a loss of r
evenue caused by a change or a repeal by the 
Government or ANRE of, or a non
-
compliance by ANRE with, the provisions of the regulatory 
framework relating to the (i) distribution tariff formula and (ii) the pass
-
through of the electricity 
costs, which resul
ts in a loss of revenue to the discoms.  These would be defined as the 
Guaranteed Events.   
Page  2
The validity period of the PRG would be the later of (i) the end of the second year of the second 
regulatory period and (ii) the end of the fifth year starting fr
om the closing date of the 
privatization transactions.  It is expected that the transactions would close by December 2004 
and then the guarantee would remain in effect until the end of 2009.   In case the closing slips to 
2005, the validity period of the 5
-
year guarantee would shift accordingly.  
D.  Project location (if known)
Romania’s electricity distribution is carried out by eight geographically organized discoms.  
They are all subsidiaries of Electrica,  a government
-
owned company created in the re
structuring 
process of 1998
-
2000 when the national power company Renel was corporatized and unbundled.  
Electrica Banat operates  in the south
-
western part of
 the country, namely in Timi
\01
, Arad, 
Hunedoara and Cara
\01
 Severin counties.   Its 32,034
km
2
 service area covers about 13% of 
Romania.  
Electrica Dobrogea operates in the south
-
eastern part of the country, namely in Constanta, 
Calarasi, Slobozia and Tulce
a counties.  Its 25,100 km
2
 service area covers about 11% of 
Romania.  
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
Electrica’s environmental management system is documented in Environmental Management 
Manual, Environmental System Proced
ures, and Nomenclature of Environmental Protection 
Works.  These have been disseminated to all eight discoms including Banat and Dobrogea.  
Electrica in general, including the two discoms that are being privatized, comply with the present 
Romanian legislat
ion regarding the environment.   They will have to comply with any future 
adjustment made in Romanian legislation, 
inter alia
 reflecting European Union requirements, 
regarding their activities.  Revisions and audits of conformity are performed periodically
.  
Romania’s environmental protection agency has local offices at county level, which establish the 
requirements for the issuing of permits for the company’s facilities (depots, offices and 
substations).   Electrica discoms similarly have at their branch (
country) level one person is 
assigned with responsibility to coordinate with the agency and to manage and implement the 
environmental policy emanating from the head office 
-
  Environmental policy for each county 
branch is developed centrally by Electrica. 
 Electrica’s Quality Management System is one of the 
means to achieving its objectives also in the environment.  Electrica’s  Quality Management 
System was certified in 2003 to be in compliance with the EN ISO 9001:2000 requirements for 
the entire corporat
e structure, namely: (a) electricity distribution (b) electricity supply; (c) 
electricity purchasing; (d) maintenance and operational services; and (e) support services and 
related activities.   This certification covers all eight discoms including Banat a
nd Dobrogea.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A.
Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD
-
stage ISDS 
would be prepared.   July 15, 2004
B.
Time frame for launching and comple
ting the safeguard
-
related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
1
 should be specified in the PAD
-
stage ISDS.   
There are no safeguards issues and no new studies are envisioned.    
Note:  It is possible that Enel 
-
 the priva
te investor 
–
 would give an mandate to IFC to assist with 
the financing of its takeover of the two discoms and the implementation of their initial 
investment programs.  Should IFC get the mandate from Enel, the Bank PRG and the IFC 
investment be processed 
jointly, with the Bank covering sectoral, regulatory and PRG aspects, 
and the IFC covering due diligence of the two discoms, including financial and environmental 
aspects of the discoms including their investment programs.   
*
By supporting the propose
d project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' claims on the 
disputed areas

Reminder: The Bank's Disclosure Policy requires that safeguard
-
related documents be disclosed before appraisal (i) at the 
InfoShop and (
ii) in
-
country, at publicly accessible locations and in a form and language that are accessible to potentially affected 
persons.
