A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project development objectives are to improve efficiency in the allocation and 
management of resources, improve the quality of the education services offered, and reduce 
the inequities in the provision of these services. In order to achieve these objectives, the 
proposed Project will pursue a three-fold agenda of action.  1) it builds the capacity of  the 
Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education to prepare the system for decentralization, in 
particular providing support to the Regional Departments of Education (RDE) to develop and 
monitor regional education plans, and strengthen their capacity to provide support to the 
school system; 2) it provides support to the improvement of quality of education services 
offered by  providing direct support to schools, through the implementation of a National 
School Improvement Program; and 3) provides support to increase equity in the provision of 
services, by providing free textbooks, allocating resources based on a per capita formula, 
focusing rehabilitation efforts in underserved areas, and providing support to out of school 
youth and excluded population such as pygmies. 
 
The outcome indicators of the project will be: 
a)  Improvement of the quality of the education services offered in primary 
and lower secondary measured by 
·
Increased primary and lower secondary completion  rates  
·
Decreased repetition and/dropout rates for primary and lower 
secondary 
 
b)  Improvement of the Management Capacity of the MEPSA measured by
·
Readiness for decentralization of management- Capacity of RDEs to 
develop and monitor education plans 
·
Decreased in teacher/student ratio;  
·
Increased in the Teachers to non teachers ratio in the schools 
 
Page  2
Results indicators by component are as follows: 
a)  the regional department education offices  improve their 
performance on three main aspects: 1)Develop and Monitor 
Regional Education Plans; 2) Provide Pedagogical Support to 
Schools, (in-service teacher training, textbooks and teaching and 
learning materials) and 3) Manage Human Resources in an 
efficient way reducing the ratio of administrative/teaching staff. 
At the central level, the project will provide technical assistance 
to the Ministries of Education, to enable the preparation of a 
sector-wide program, that will provide a coherent vision of the 
sector, and will state the short-, medium- and long-term goals 
for each of the sub-sectors.  
b)  Rehabilitation of School infrastructure: (i) 400 classrooms will 
be rehabilitated and equipped by the end of the project ; (ii) the 
ratio pupils to table will decrease from 5 to 1  to 2 to 1 in 
selected schools, at the end of the project; (iii) training of 1,700 
school management committees in charge of developing  school 
improvement plans by the end of the project. 
c)  Support  to the improvement of quality of education: (i) training 
of 240 training staff by the end of the project ; (ii) training of 
2,600 school principals by the end of the project; (iii) training of 
6,000 teachers by the end of the project; (iv) 2 million school 
textbooks produced and distributed by the end of the project. 
d)  Support to out of school youth and children in special needs ( 
pygmies): number of out of school youth that participated in the 
alphabetization program by the end of project ; (ii) increase  the 
number of alphabetized pygmies, (iii) development of a national 
policy for social inclusion of youth at risk and pygmy children. 
 
The Education sector project contributes to the higher level objectives of the TSS.  A key element  in the 
consolidation of the country’s economic diversification needed to boost economic growth and mitigation of  
the existing high social risks is building human capital. The provision of a better quality of education is a 
strategic action for generating a skilled labor force, a condition for economic growth.  
The project will 
assist Congo in the mitigation of the current post-conflict crisis in the education sector, and 
at the same time will provide the building blocks for the solid development of a medium- and 
long-term sector program.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
Page  3
1) Capacity-building of the MEPSA
.
(Estimated cost including operating 
costs: US$ 2.5 M).   
The objective of this component will be to prepare the system for a successful 
decentralization of management of primary and secondary education. To do 
this, the central level will receive technical assistance to improve its capacity 
to define and manage sound policy planning and implementation and 
monitoring of these policies, aimed at improving the internal efficiency of the 
sector. An important set of reforms will be introduced, namely the provision 
of free education services,  budget reform, and personnel reform. The project 
will support the introduction of these policies, and will provide technical 
assistance to the Ministries of Education, Finance, Civil Service, for the 
consensus building and set of actions needed to put in place and enforce the 
new policies. The mechanisms and the objectives pursued by these reforms 
will prepare the Government for its eligibility to HIPIC relief.  
 
The project will also support  the Planning Unit of the MEPSA (DEP) to establish and 
manage an Education Management Information System (EMIS), at the central, 
department and inspection level that will help to develop a coherent and efficient 
Education Sector Program with a medium- and long-term vision. 
The initial 
organizational and functional analyses conducted during preparation will be 
conducted in depth and completed by  the end of 2005,  and will lead to  the 
elaboration of the action plan for the re-organization (central and 
decentralized) of the MEPSA.
 
Capacity building action plans at all school administration levels will be 
developed and implemented. These actions plans will be focused on the 
preparation, implementation and monitoring of regional education plans. 
RDEs will be  trained on information management, use of information data 
basis for education planning, budgeting and will receive assistance on the 
preparation of their annual education plans. They will be provided with IT 
equipment and when needed staffed with accounting and procurement 
specialists, in order to prepare them for decentralized management of 
financial resources. School Inspections will be trained on providing 
pedagogical support to schools, which will include the use of the new 
curriculum, and the use of child centered pedagogy. 
 
2) Rehabilitation of the School Infrastructure
.
(Estimated cost:  US$ 8.5 
M) 
The objective of this Component is twofold, it will be to rehabilitate the school 
buildings that  were damaged during the war, and/or have deteriorated  due 
to lack of maintenance, and  provide school furniture to those schools where 
the needs are more pronounced.  In addition it would build the capacity of  
existing school management infrastructures,  community-based 
organizations, and the local level of administration. To a
chieve its objectives, 
Page  4
this component will be implemented following  a demand-driven approach, 
and will be managed in a decentralized set up.  The rehabilitation of the 
schools will be based on School Plans prepared by the School Management 
Committees (SMCs). In addition, SMCs will manage budget allocations for 
school maintenance and, will be responsible for monitoring completion of 
rehabilitation works. It is estimated that about 405 classrooms will be 
rehabilitated, and 1,700 SMCs will be provided with training on the 
preparation of school plans, that should be the basis for public budget 
allocations to schools.  Regional Departments of Education will be responsible 
for assisting schools in the preparation of School Plans, and in the decision 
making of resource allocation to schools, and supervision and monitoring of 
school construction, under guidance from regional UNDP offices. Gradually 
they will be responsible for financial and procurement management, and at 
the end of the project their capacity should be such to enable them to take on 
these tasks. 
 
3) Support to the improvement of quality of education
 (Estimated 
cost: US$ 7 M) 
This Component will consolidate the in-service training program initiated by 
MEPSA, and INRAP with support from the French Cooperation . This in-
service program has been developed following a cascade approach, in which 
trainers have been selected and trained in all departments. This effort has 
been done with the idea of creating  
regional networks of pedagogic advisors and 
trainers, and in line with the capacity building and reinforcing the pedagogical support 
that inspections should play.
 The goal of the project is to promote the 
establishment of clusters of schools with the inspection as a hub. The Project 
will provide support by i) training the teachers currently in primary and 
junior secondary schools in teaching assignments, ii) training of school 
Directors, and iii) equipment and training for trainers and school inspections 
in order to facilitate their support role to schools. The project will also 
support the adaptation/production of the textbooks and teaching guides for 
primary and junior secondary schools, and will provide support to guarantee 
access to textbooks in the three core subjects (French, Math and Civic 
Instruction/education for peace building) for all students enrolled in primary 
and junior secondary. This component  will also fund the curriculum 
assessment for secondary education, and the preparation of relevant learning 
materials, and in-service secondary education teacher training programs. In 
addition, t
his component will provide support to the ENIS, for the revision and 
elaboration of new teacher training curriculum, and piloting of new training programs for 
teachers. 
 
4) Support to out of school youth, and
 
pygmies
(Estimated costs: US$ 2 
M) 
The objective of this Component will be to pilot experiences on the provision of formal and 
non
-
formal education and training opportunities to young aged 14
-
18 who have not been to 
Page  5
school; and to underserved populations such as the pygmies. This component will provide 
support for the expansion of programs that have been initiated by the Division of 
Alphabetization of MEPSA with support from the French Cooperation and UNICEF, and 
initiatives supported by the Ministry of Professional, Technical and Vocational Education, 
and other initiatives such as those initiated by IPHD, Agri-Congo and others that have 
demonstrated to be successful. Based on the initial assessment of what constitute key 
elements of  success, the mechanisms for a demand-driven expansion of these programs will 
be put in place. For the pygmy population, the project will provide support to the programs 
developed by UNICEF, UNESCO, PAM and IPHD that have rehabilitated schools in villages 
where the pygmy population has been established. These programs provide support to the 
pygmy population by providing teaching and learning materials, paying for their school fees, 
uniforms and providing school feeding programs for all children enrolled in the program. 
This approach is based on the idea of integrating the pygmy population with the Bantu 
population in the same school. The project will also explore the possibility of setting up 
programs that are designed specifically to address the needs of pygmy children, including 
literacy programs for their parents. All these experiences will be closely monitored, in order 
to continue the identification of elements of success with the aim of developing a national 
strategy for youth at risk and pygmy children at the end of the project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Environment 
Key safeguard issues relate to the rehabilitation of schools; these activities are likely to have environmental 
impacts such as soil erosion, soil and water pollution and loss of vegetation, as well as social impacts such 
as loss of livelihoods, air pollution and health impacts due to improper asbestos disposal. 
 
2. A Social Assessment Study was conducted to assess the impact of the education 
project, in particular to look at potential social impacts of proposed project activities, and 
the motivation that communities would have to participate in the implementation of the 
project. The study was aimed at identifying measures that could be taken in order to 
enhance community participation. Four target populations were surveyed: children ages 
6-16 (attending school, dropped out and never gone to school); primary and secondary 
teachers and school principals, community leaders and parents. In total, 482 people were 
surveyed, in three geographical areas, Brazzaville, Ngo and Djambala. The study found 
that 34% of children currently in school come from single parent families, 48% from 
families where both parents are present, and 7% are with guardians (grand-parents, or 
uncles/ants), and all of them pay school fees. The majority of the children (98%) enjoy 
going to school.  
 
The teachers surveyed were 46 males and 44 females, the women with an age range of 35-44, and men 45-
55. Forty seven percent of them have been in the profession for more than 15 years. Ninety percent of them 
are not satisfied with their labor conditions, mainly- 80% - due to lack of resources and bad conditions of 
buildings and furniture found at the schools. Sixty two percent noted the low and irregular payment of 
salaries, and 66% observed the poor learning environment and overcrowded classrooms. 
The main findings of the study corroborate what previous analysis have showed, mainly 
that there are serious equity issues concerning the provision of schooling, and that one of 
the main constraints for access are school fees. Also the poor conditions of the school 
buildings, the lack of learning materials, and the poor management of human resources 
which have been pointed out in other studies carried on during the preparation of this 
project were confirmed in the social assessment. 
 
3. Indigenous People 
In preparation of activities to be carried out in component 4 of the project, an 
assessment of the current situation of pygmies in Congo was conducted. From 
the legal point of view the IPs (in total around 30.000 to 40 0000
1
individuals 
gathered throughout Congo) are citizens equal to all other people born in 
Congo, but they have neither the same political influence, legal status, 
organizational, technical or economic capacity as the Bantus, the main ethnic 
group in Congo. 
The Pygmies were the first settlers in central Africa and in Congo.  
The educational situation of pygmies children is very alarming.  Most Pygmies children 
remain outside the educational system. Available data (2000) indicate that only 80.5% of 
surveyed pygmies who are more than 10 years old, have never been to school.  68.5%    
of pygmies who are between 6 and 14 years old (therefore of school age) are not enrolled 
in any education
al institution.   Moreover, pygmies girls have less access to school than 
1
Estimates from UNICEF and the NGO « La coopérative Haie Vie ».  
Page  8
pygmies boys- 71.2% of girls do not attend schools versus 66.2% of boys.   
 
There are many factors which affect the lack of schooling of pygmies children:  
·
Current school calendars d
o
not
fit with the migratory lifestyle of the pygmies.  
The Pygmies and their children move deep in the forest for harvest or ritual 
initiations at specific times of the year.  
·
Pygmies social organizations confer adult responsibilities at a relatively early age. 
Pygmies children as early as 10 years old are considered as active family 
members and bear some responsibility in the feeding of the family.  
·
The extreme poverty, prevalent in pygmies communities means that most families 
are unable to pay for school fees, school uniforms or school supplies.   
·
The pygmies are not always aware of the advantages of having their children 
attend school 
·
There are very few schools to cater to the pygmies population.  Pygmies children 
have very often to travel to far away areas to attend schools.   Indeed, almost all 
public schools are built for the Bantus and pygmies children are de facto  guests 
of
the Bantus. 
·
Pygmies children are severely discriminated against by the Bantus.   The Pygmies 
relatively lax personal hygiene often worsen the already strained relationship 
between the two communities. 
·
Pygmies suffer from a deeply rooted inferiority complex 
·
The Congolese government has never devised  an educational policy specifically 
for the pygmies. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
Indirect and/or long term impacts due to future activities are not anticipated.  The 
rehabilitation of schools might have negative impact specially when dealing with scrap 
metals, nails, cement blocks, paintings, installation of doors and locks, if appropriate 
measures are not taken can have negative impacts.  However, these impacts are so minor 
that they cannot justify any cancellation of the rehabilitation effort. Also, the project 
might have to displaced squatters and encroachers occupying the school land /premises 
for residence or agricultural purposes. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
A
discussion of alternatives to the planned rehabilitation of schools was not relevant. 
The preparation of the school plans must follow the guidelines proposed for meeting the environment 
safeguards, and the screening, evaluation and monitoring process that has been set up for the decentralized 
management of component 2, takes into account at each of its steps, the meeting of the environmental 
guidelines. An environmental report has been prepared, and disclosed among the main authorities and 
Page  9
stakeholders in Congo. 
 
The project designed has taken into consideration actions to address all of the social 
aspects noted. 
To address the equity issues the project is taking the following measures: 
·
Introduction of free education 
·
Provision of free textbooks 
·
Priority for support to schools in deprived areas 
2.To address the poor conditions of the schools the project will rehabilitate and equip at 
least 400 classrooms 
3.To address the poor conditions of work noted by the teachers the project is supporting 
the following: 
·
Redeployment of teachers to change the 1/92 teacher student ratio, to 1/50 at the 
end of the project 
·
Improvement of financial management that will help regularize payments of all 
teachers on a monthly basis 
·
Revision of teacher development policy and practices 
3.  To improve the learning environment the project will support: 
·
Provision of textbooks for math, French and civic and peace education to all 
children enrolled in schools 
·
In-service teacher training for all teachers currently assigned to teaching in 
the classroom 
·
Provision of pedagogical and learning materials to all schools 
4. 
To improve management in the schools 
·
School Management Committees will be trained and assisted to ensure that their members are 
elected 
·
School Management Committees will be trained on the preparation of School Improvement Plans, 
which will constitute the basis for allocation for rehabilitation funds.  
5.  To promote community participation 
·
School Management Committees will be responsible for management of funds up 
to US $ 20,000.  
·
School Management Committees will be responsible for monitoring completion 
of civil works, and other school improvement activities. 
 
In light of increasing education of this vulnerable population, the project has designed a 
component that will carry out the following activities addressed to meeting the education 
needs of the pygmy population. A budget of US$ 1 million has been allocated, and below 
is a summary description. For details, please see Component 4, detailed project 
description.  
·
Activity 1: Assessment of  (national/sub-regional) projects which focus on the 
pygmy communities: This activity consists of analyzing the projects already 
carried out and/or in progress in order to better identify factors of success and 
constraints in education programs for pygmies.  During this phase, data gathering 
on
the pygmies situation will be undertaken.    
·
Activity 2: Analysis of projects being prepared by UN agencies and NGOs that 
are meeting education needs of pygmy populatins:  Projects of UN agencies, 
notably UNICEF and  NGOs such as IPHD and others that have been d
eveloping 
Page  10
programs to integrate pygmy children in schools will be assessed and based on 
positive results, funding for their expansion will be available.  Based on Activity 
1,
they will be modified and adapted  to optimize their impact.  
Activity 3: Set up of guidelines for provision and expansion of education programs for 
pygmy children and literacy programs for their parents, to be funded under the same 
funding arrangements set up in the project for the support to school improvement plans. 
NGOs and local communities will assist pygmy communities in the preparation of their 
funding proposals. 
·
Activity 4: Follow-up and evaluation of  implemented projects supported during 
project implementation. 
·
Activity 5:    A national education policy for the pygmy will be devised by 
MEPSA by the end of the project. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. A 
National education policy to address the education needs of the pygmies will be 
developed based on the project findings. The government has shown commitment and 
ownership regarding the guidelines for the preparation of school improvement plans, and 
the safeguards included for keeping a healthy and safe environment for teachers and 
children. 
An ESMF has been prepared by the Borrower to ensure that the rehabilitation activities 
under the project are carried out in an environmentally and socially sustainable manner.  
A
Resettlement Policy Framework will guide the principles and procedures to address 
potential cases of displacement of encroachers and squatters from the school premises. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The people consulted in the studies carried out during preparation comprise, teachers, 
school principals, students currently in schools, children ages 6-16 not in school, pygmies 
population, parents and teachers associations, local leaders, teacher unions, local NGOS, 
national federation of NGOS, school management committees, Regional Department 
Education Staff, School Inspection Staff. The people interviewed and surveyed were 
from the regions of Pool, Plateaux, Cuvette, Brazzaville and Pointe Noire. 
 
The safeguard documents required for this project, Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF), Resettlment Policy Framework (RPF), Indigenous 
People Development Plan (IPDP) were disclosed prior to Project Appraisal in Congo at 
World Bank Resident Mission, UNDP, UNICEF, Ministry of Primary and Secondary 
Education, Ministry of Technical and Vocation Training, Ministry of Environment, 
General Direction of Environment, NGOS working with pygmies populations such as
