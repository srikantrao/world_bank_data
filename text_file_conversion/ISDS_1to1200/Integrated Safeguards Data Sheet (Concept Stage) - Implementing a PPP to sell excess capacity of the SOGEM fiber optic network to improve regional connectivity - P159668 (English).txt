                           The proposed development objective of this activity is to support SOGEM in designing and
                           implementing an innovative PPP model with a private wholesale operator under a concession
                           contract to sell excess capacity of the SOGEM fibre optic network to improve regional integration
                           through enhanced connectivity between Mali-Mauritania-Senegal.
                           C. Project Description
                           The advisers with legal, financial and techno-economical PPP expertise funded by PPIAF will
                           support SOGEM in designing a new concession (the ➢❨ PPP Concession opÃ©rateur de gros➢❨ )
                           structure and process, drafting the associated documents (draft tender documents, draft concession
                           contract, draft wholesale operator authorization in the three countries), assisting in selecting the
                           private wholesale operator through an international open competitive bidding procedure, and finally
                           supporting SOGEM in launching the related operations.

                           More specifically, the assignment will be undertaken in three components:
                         Component I- Preparation of international tender documents for the open access PPP model for the
                         resale of excess capacity on the OPGW network (Setting up the environment for the PPP

                         The proposed activity leveraging an existing regional electricity infrastructure grid by selling excess
                         fibre capacity through a suitable business model where the private sector would invest in the active
                         equipment required to transmit telecommunications services on the fibre (➢❨ lit➢❨ the fibre) would
                         become a pioneering project for other countries not only in West Africa where other energy utilities

                         are owning excess dark fibre capacity and are looking for private sector financing of the equipment
                         required to light the fibres as a means to have a stronger impact on the broadband market
                         development compared to simply ➢❨ auctioning off➢❨ the existing excess dark fibre (see strategic
                         study Phase I). The excess capacity on the SOGEM grid presents three distinctive features of a
                         pioneering project: the existence of regional fibre excess capacity that can be made readily available,
                         an open access connection to international submarine connectivity in Nouakchott (Mauritania) and a
                         major bottleneck in the provision of competitive international connectivity in landlocked Mali. The
                         proposed activity would be a particularly important reference for the other regional electricity
                         regional organization OMVG. Under the OMVG Interconnection Project (P146830) financed by the
                         Bank, one of the ground wires will be equipped with a fibre optic cable (24 pairs) and excess fiber
                         communications capacity will be available for renting to telecoms operators and service providers). It
                         will be also relevant for the OMVS - Hydropower and Energy Infrastructure development project
                         (P147921) under preparation that will interconnect OMVS and OMVG regional networks. Finally
                         the proposed activity will also provide a key building block to inform the WAPP secretariat
                         endeavors to foster the emergence of a regional fiber optic network. Following a PPIAF-funded
                         study conducted in 2007 - which assessed the technical and financial viability of utilizing excess and
                         redundant optic fibre capacity on existing and planned extra-high voltage power transmission Lines
                         of the West African Power Pool (WAPP) for commercial use, the WAPP Secretariat and ECOWAS
                         Commission commissioned between 2008 and 2010 several feasibility studies to identify the
                         communications infrastructure requirements of the Power Pool Companies and to ascertain to what
                         extent fibre on power lines could be leveraged into an international fiber network for
                         telecommunication purposes in the ECOWAS region. More recently, the ECOWAS Commission
                         submitted an application for PPIAF financing aiming at supporting the ECOWAS Commission to
                         improve the framework to enable the private sector to invest in the expansion of communications
                         infrastructures and services in the region. This activity would aim to create greater capacities within

                         regional institutions (ECOWAS, West Africa Telecommunications Regulatory Assembly and
                         WAPP) to improve delivery of regional PPP ICT projects and consolidate regional successes gained
                         so far by individual countries. Besides a regional approach to easing cross-border communications
                         through regulating cross-border/international roaming rates and interconnection arrangements,
                         specific outputs of this activity include developing and adopting an accompanying policy on the use
                         of alternative infrastructure (i.e. power grid, gas pipes, roads and railways) for provision of
                         broadband service.

                         Partnerships:
                         - GEEDR : Knowledge dissemination with GEEDR to include fibre optic excess capacity when
                         expanding energy networks and to provide technical assistance to utilities to unleash infrastructure
                         synergies.
                         - IFC: IFC is seeking to fund alternative private sector business models that are rolling out access to
                         broadband along electricity lines on a wholesale, operator independent/ vendor neutral basis. An
                         example of one of such IFC➢❨ s investee companies is ITXPar in Brazil. ITXPar➢❨ s network is an
                         alternative to telecom operators looking to optimize costs and reduce investment requirements by
                         acquiring a network right instead of building proprietary networks. In the right hands, with the right
                         structure the fiber optic along regional utilities such as SOGEM is considered as having the potential
                         to transform the adaption of broadband in the ECOWAS region. Some private companies bidding to
                         be selected as the private wholesale operator of the SOGEM fiber optic excess capacity and invest in
                           the active equipment and the operations of the network are therefore expected to approach IFC for
                           financing.
