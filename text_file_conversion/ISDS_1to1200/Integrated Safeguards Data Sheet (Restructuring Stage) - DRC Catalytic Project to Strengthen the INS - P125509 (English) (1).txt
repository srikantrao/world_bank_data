2. Current Project Development Objectives


Proposed New PDO (from Restructuring Paper)


3. Project Description
The project will be financed by a Statistics for Results-Catalytic Fund grant of $11.8 million and will consist
of three components, including contingency ($0.68m), with:

Component A for Increasing INS technical capacity for $1.25m: the objective of this component is to
increase the proportion of the professional staff with formal degrees or on-the-job training in areas related to

                                                       Page 1 of 6
statistics, demography, economics, and information technology (particularly programming). Two approaches
will be used to support this objective: study abroad in degree-granting institutions that are supported by
international quality assurance standards and on-the-job training for existing staff whose training is not in
core fields.

Component B to Improve the non-technical environment for $6.79m: the component will support
management and fiduciary training, office furnishings, computer hardware, and software for INS staff. The
objective is for INS to develop and implement annual work plans relying upon a strengthened fiduciary team
with appropriate technology and with a staff skill mix that is, in conjunction with the outputs of Component
A, evolving towards what is needed for a statistical office.
The buildings used by INS technical departments in the Limete neighborhood of Kinshasa are dilapidated,
unsafe, and inadequate for computer-based work. To address this, the project will demolish and reconstruct
one building on the site. This will be done through two project-financed activities. In its first year, the
project will finance an architectural site evaluation to explore rehabilitation options. Once a choice is made,
the project will finance the demolition and reconstruction of the selected building. This complements the
focus by UNFPA and AFDB on provincial INS offices and does not overlap with UNFPA's work on office
space for the Census Bureau. The site is officially assigned to INS and the documentation is in the project
file. In order to provide locals for the BCR and the INS departments affected by the reconstruction, the
project will support rental and operation costing for a building where these units will temporarily move for
three years. This component also covers project management costs including USD 0.1 million for potential
costs related to safeguard activities.

Component C to support the statistical production and dissemination for $3.76m: this component will support
the development of critical statistical data that meet the following criteria: broad impact, currently severely
outdated, and infrequent in nature. It will also provide for the development and implementation of archiving
and dissemination policies for statistical information in order to increase access, use, and quality of the
information produced. It will focus on the Mapping phase of the Population and Housing Census; the
Enterprise census and cover activities to Improving access to statistical information.
4. Project location and Salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if
known)
The project will primarily be undertaken in Kinshasa. Data collection financed under the project will affect
the entire country. Training financed under the project will affect primarily Kinshasa-based staff, although
provincial staff will also benefit from training.
Safeguards aspects are limited to the INS compound in Limete, a neighborhood of Kinshasa. More details are
in Section II.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
Project impacts are not expected to be large scale, significant or irreversible; potentially adverse impacts will
be minor and site specific. Impacts will be limited to the demolition and reconstruction of one single-story
building inside a walled property (estimated at 125m x 100m), a compound owned and used by INS as
offices. An architectural evaluation was undertaken with project funds to define the scope of work, which is
expected to cost about USD 4.560,000. The environmental screening has been disclosed in-country (20 June
2012) and at the InfoShop (3 July 2012).
The project will not finance (i) land acquisition, (ii) involuntary resettlement, or (iii) restriction of access to
resources or livelihoods and will provide no financing for any activity that would result in (i) land
acquisition, (ii) involuntary resettlement, or (iii) restriction of access to resources or livelihoods. The planned
works will be done within an enclosed site that is owned by government with no claims or encroachments on
the land.

The social safeguards risks of the project are generic and not location specific. The risks are related to the
potential exclusion of some segments of the population during the census mapping operation; that preclusion
could potentially induce social disturbances. To mitigate potential exclusion risks, the methodology of the
census is designed to be all inclusive with a mechanism for addressing attrition; to ensure the statistical
representation of the entire population of DRC; irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, religion or civil status.
Indigenous people as well as vulnerable groups will be incorporated into the census roster, and the project
includes a communication plan to inform the entire population including IPs and other vulnerable groups to
ensure they understand and participate in the census.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area:
No major impacts are anticipated. The project is rehabilitating office space for the INS, which should not
lead to significantly increased future activities in the area or long term impact. However, an increase of small
business is expected due the presence of employee for the construction. After rehabilitation, INS will go
about its normal business which is collecting, processing and analyzing statistical data.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
Not relevant.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An environmental screening of the project has been carried out, including an environmental management
plan with a snag list. The snag list will be part of the contract document. Potential needs for supervision, if
any, will be ensured by the supervision consultant. The Ministry of Environment, through the Agence
Congolaise pour lâ€™Environnement (ACE) has the capacity to address potential safeguards issues encountered
by the project. The ACE ensures safeguards compliance for all investments in DRC. The project is not
expected to induce any major environmental impacts that would trigger a full environmental impact
assessment (EIA), beyond a screening. The project has also hired a consultant to update the Environmental
and Social Management Plan.
To mitigate potential exclusion risks during census mapping, the methodology of the census is designed to be
all inclusive, and it will establish a mechanism for addressing attrition; to ensure the statistical representation
of the entire population of DRC; irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, religion or civil status. Indigenous
people as well as vulnerable groups will be incorporated into the census roster. Cartography agents will be
specifically trained to locate and interview small population groups in sensitive areas and in the forest. For
this, the Government will receive assistance from UNFPA and its experts.
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The project will not negatively affect other properties or people. The environmental impacts are expected to
be limited by the compound wall, which is unbroken (aside from the entrance doors) and rises to some 10
feet. However, small businesses surrounding the compound may be affected with noises and dust as a result
of activities implementation. The environmental screening, including the environmental management plan
and the snag list, will be disclosed in country and at the Bank prior to Appraisal.
