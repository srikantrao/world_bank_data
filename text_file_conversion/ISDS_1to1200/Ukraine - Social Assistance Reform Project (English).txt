I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project development objective is to help the Government of Ukraine to develop the efficient
administration of social safety net programs, minimizing client burden, strengthening public information,
and improving program monitoring to support policy reforms to effectively target the poor.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project will provide technical assistance and information technology support to improve the
administration of social welfare offices and support government policy reforms. It also will provide
technical assistance and information technology support so that policymakers can evaluate and monitor
outcomes in social benefit programs to complete the ongoing process of reform.

The project would include three components:

(1) Administrative Improvements: This component will put in place a targeted, efficient and client-friendly
delivery of social benefits with reduced fraud and abuse. This would include changes in business practices,
supporting software, and an integrated hardware platform. The system would provide management
information and program evaluation data to the center for effective monitoring and assessment.

(2) Poverty Monitoring and Communication: This component will provide technical assistance to enable
effective policy and administrative management of the social assistance system by the MLSP. It would
include support of regional data development and training in policy analysis using survey and
administrative data. It would also support the development of ongoing public information for both clients
and civil society.

(3) Project Administration: This component will provide support for project management.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The project would reconfigure social welfare offices throughout Ukraine. It would not affect protected areas,
sites or critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas as it affects existing offices
run by local authorities. While the population is affected by social program reforms, these reforms are
consistent across the population and are targeted to improve the living conditions of the poor.


B. Check Environmental Classification: C (Not Required)

Comments: The project is to reform the business practices of local social welfare offices and support those
administrative reforms with information technology. These reforms are not enviornmentally sesnsitive. The
Loan will not pay for any civil works.
