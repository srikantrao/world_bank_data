                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The overall objective of the proposed project is to further improve the capacity of statistical system
                           of Armenia and technical capacity of the staff at NSS to produce and disseminate relevant, reliable
                           and timely statistics in a cost-effective manner that are in line with international standards and will be
                           responsive to user needs.
                           C. Project Description
                           The NSSRA has been open to reforms and follows international good practices such as the
                           preparation of a three-year work program guiding strategic and priority capacity building activities.
                           The strategic directions of the work program are reflected in the annual program adopted by the State
                           Council on Statistics.
                           The NSSRA was one of the first subscribers to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standards
                           among the CIS countries. The NSSRA makes data available through the website (www.armdevinfo.
                           am) that offers user-friendly ways to submit database queries, create tables, charts and maps. The

                           technical assistance and financial support provided by various international organizations and donors,
                           such as the World Bank, the IMF, European Union, UNSD, UNFPA, and SIDA, have resulted in
                           substantial progress in the development and improvement of the statistical system, and
                           modernization of statistical methodologies in different areas.
                           Yet there remain several areas for further improvement. In 2009, an assessment led by the European
                           Commission (Eurostat), UNECE, and European Free Trade Agreement, identified strengths as well
                           as areas where further work was needed. These shortcomings will be addressed through advisory
                           services, training, and Trust funded technical assistance from the World Bank, the EU Twining
                           Facility, UNDP and other partners.
                           i.        Institutional environment: The assessment found that the NSSRA has a strong and clear
                           mandate for collecting and disseminating administrative and sample survey data. Two challenges
                           identified were a) lack of a quality management and training system, and insufficient resources in the
                           regional offices, and b) limited development and renewal of the IT equipment, despite good staffing,
                           which in turn reduces staff efficiency.
                           ii.       Coverage and quality of statistical thematic areas: The assessment noted the large number of
                           statistics produced in a timely manner using both administrative and survey approaches. The
                           assessment also noted that the NSSRA broadly follows international classification systems.
                           However, the statistics in the following areas need further work to be consistent with international
                           systems: demographic outcomes, labor markets, education and health, environment, transport,
                           business registry, national accounts, and prices indices.
                           iii.      Overall recommendations: The assessment concluded that within the national statistical
                           system, the NSSRA has a strong coordinating role, especially since the management of the NSSRA
                           also acts as the State Council on Statistics with specific legislative power. The agency also has
                           regular contacts with data users and other stakeholders. The assessment recommended that the
                           NSSRA could further strengthen consultations with users, respondents, and other stakeholders.
                           Another finding was that the agency was fragmented and organized in a multiplicity of very small

                           units. This was viewed as a major challenge to managing human resources in the organization. The
                           assessment also recommended that the NSSRA do its part to promote evidence-based decision
                           making and trust in state statistics by undertaking activities that increase statistical literacy among
                           data users.
