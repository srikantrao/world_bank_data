                         analysis (if known)
                         The project will be implemented in seven counties and districts of the Ya??an Municipality (Lushan
                         County, Baoxing County, Tianquan County, Yingjing County, Shimian County, Yucheng District,
                         and Mingshan District) and Qionglai City, Chengdu Municipality. The project areas are located in
                         western Sichuan Province. Qionglai City is located in the west of Chengdu Plain and borders Ya??an
                         to the southwest. While Qionglai's topography transitions from plain to mountains from east to west,
                         Ya??an is mostly mountainous. The project area has a long history of human development, with
                         agricultural production as the predominant economic activity. The population is concentrated in
                         small towns that are mostly located in valleys or small plains in the mountainous area. Given its
                         natural conditions, the project areas are in good ecological condition, with extensive and robust
                         surface vegetation. For example, Ya??an has a surface vegetation of 63 percent.

                         The Lushan Region of Sichuan Province is one of the world??s most geologically and
                         meteorologically active regions. Located between Chengdu Plain and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the
                         Project Region sits on an intersection where three seismic fault zones (Longmen Mountain, Xianshui
                         River, Anning River) meet. Topographically, the area is covered with high and steep mountains, deep
                         valleys and fragmented rock formations. It is affected by earthquakes, landslides, flow-slides,
                         rockfalls, rockslides, floods, flash floods, reservoir, etc. Earthquake risk is particularly high in a
                         number of areas, with some of the largest historical events having occurred in densely populated
                         locations. Many powerful earthquakes have struck in the past, and according to official records, more
                         than 283 events exceeding magnitude 5.5 occurred since 1970. Flooding poses also a challenge,

                         which is likely to increase due to increased built up areas and climate change. The project area
                         experiences strong monsoonal influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer,
                         classified as a humid subtropical climate with long, hot, humid summers and short, mild to cool, dry
                         and cloudy winters. Water resources are abundant. Annual average temperatures range from
                         14.1~17.9 degrees Celsius, while annual average precipitation is about 1,800mm.

                         house demolition, with resettlement in 13 towns in 6
                         counties and districts. Out of this, 215 households (869
                         people) will be affected by both land acquisition and
                         house demolition. It will require permanent acquisition of
                         about 1,311 mu (87 ha) of land, including 745 mu (50 ha)
                         arable land. In total, the project will impact 905
                         households (about 3,151 people) affected by economic
                         resettlement due to loss of some land. Of which, 63
                         households with 242 people will end up losing more than
                         20 percent of their arable land. Furthermore, the land
                         acquisition will result in 1,059 landless farmers whose
                         arable land will meet the threshold of less than 0.3 mu.
                         These farmers will require social security resettlement
                         that will be paid by 60 percent from the Government
                         budget as pension premium, and 40 percent will be paid
                         by the farmers themselves. The affected farmers will have
                         to transfer from rural hukou to urban hukou to take
                         advantage of the social welfare benefits. The significance
                         of land loss and land-related income loss is marginal as all
                         the affected farmers will lose less than 10 percent of their
                         existing land and less than 4 percent of land-related
                         income. The project may also need to acquire additional
                         land during project implementation. Furthermore, the
                         project will remove 40 graves and a number of trees and
                         some other special facilities like power lines and poles.

                         require some 170 mu of land for temporary occupation in
                         Qionglai, Tianquan and Yingjing counties. The project
                         will remove 44 graves and a number of trees. Close to 336
                         households (about 1,403 people) are affected by physical
                         resettlement due to house demolition. Under Component

                          OP4.01 Environmental Assessment. The project is anticipated to result in environmental and
                          social benefits through improving infrastructure services and enhancing disaster reduction
                          capacity. The project is assigned Category B for environmental purpose, as the potential
                          environmental and social impacts are of limited scale and intensity. Three environmental
                          safeguards policies are applicable to the project, including OP4.01 Environmental Assessment,
                          OP4.04 Natural Habitats, and OP4.11Physical Cultural Resources. Applicable World Bank Group
                          Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines have been taken into account in the EA as well. The
                          project EA Reports include: (i) EIA and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for Component
                          1; (ii) EIA and EMP for Component 2.

                          Given the nature and scale of the construction and operational activities, the project has the
                          potential to cause environmental and social impacts, which have been appropriately assessed by
                          accredited EA consultant during project preparation. These documents have been reviewed by the
                          Bank team and considered satisfactory to Bank safeguards requirements. A comprehensive social
                          assessment (SA) has been undertaken separately for the rural roads and urban infrastructure
                          components to identify and address social impacts and risks. Key environmental issues addressed
                          include: (i) impacts related to river water quality, soil erosion, vegetation clearance, disturbance
                          due to earthworks during construction; (ii) other construction impacts and social disturbance
                          associated with wastewater, traffic blockage and safety concerns, noise, dust and solid wastes; (iii)
                          operational impacts such as noise, dust, air emissions, wastewater discharge, waste management
                          associated with road transportation and water treatment; and (iv) operational risks associated with
                          the water treatment plant. The impacts can be adequately avoided, minimized and/or mitigated

                          through measures developed either in the project design or in the project EMP, the Resettlement
                          Action Plan (RAP).

                          Per OP4.01, the EA included not only Bank financed activities but also linked infrastructure
                          investment financed solely by local government. Under Component 1, the 5.6km Ying-Lu Road
                          financed by the project is identified to link to two road sections at both ends. The two road
                          sections are covered the project EIA and EMP. In addition, special attention was given the
                          assessment and development of mitigation measures for two relatively sensitive activities, i.e. the
                          2,500 m3/d water treatment plant in Baoxing County and the bridge over the Dadu River in
                          Shimian County.

                          OP4.04 Natural Habitats. There is no critical habitats such as nature reserve, endangered or rare
                          fauna and flora identified in the project area of influence. The project will support construction of
                          several bridges under component 1 and 2. Some roads construction and rehabilitation work will be
                          located in the vicinity of rivers. In Baoxing County, a small scale water treatment plant will be
                          built as well. If not well-managed, the construction activities will potential have impacts on the
                          river ecosystem. Ecological surveys and consultation were conducted. Impact assessment were
                          conducted and considered limited and temporary. Mitigation measures were included in the EMP.
                          The project will not result in significant conversion or degradation of natural habitats.

                         the S211 road will be located in the vicinity of Xinmian Hanging Bridge. The hanging bridge was
                         built in 1930??s and classified as city level Cultural Relics Protection Unit in 2011. Consultation

                         with local cultural relics authority was conducted during the project preparation. Potential impacts
                         on the hanging bridge will be very limited provided careful construction management, training and
                         mitigation measures, which have been incorporated in the EMP. The project will also result in
                         relocation of tombs, which will be properly addressed, as documented in the project RAP. In
                         addition, chance-finds procedure is included in the EMP as well.

                         Social

                         Negative impacts include risks associated with land acquisition, tomb relocation, house
                         demolition, dust and noise pollution, temporary and partial roads blockage, and traffic jams during
                         project construction. Positive impacts include improved road accessibility and safety,
                         transportation efficiency, better public emergency facilities including evacuation paths and
                         emergency shelters, as well as new opportunities of employment and income for local people to
                         involve in project construction. The project will have civil works construction under Component 1
                         and Component 2. This construction includes 34.6 km of rural roads, 24.9 km of urban roads with
                         associated water supply, storm water and sewerage pipeline, 4 bridges, 4.9 km of embankment,
                         3.2km of floodway, 1 water supply plant (WTP), and 12 emergency shelters.

                         The project will lead to about 1,241 households (close to 4,554 people) being affected by land
                         acquisition and house demolition, with resettlement in 13 towns in 6 counties and districts. Out of
                         this, 215 households (869 people) will be affected by both land acquisition and house demolition.
                         It will require permanent acquisition of about 1,311 mu (87 ha) of land, including 745 mu (50 ha)
                         arable land. In total, the project will impact 905 households (about 3151 people) affected by
                         economic resettlement due to loss of some land. Of which, 63 households with 242 people will
                         end up losing more than 20 pecent of their arable land. Furthermore, the land acquisition will
                         result in 1,059 landless farmers whose arable land will meet the threshold of less than 0.3 mu.

                         These farmers will require social security resettlement that will be paid by 60 percent from the
                         Government budget as pension premium, and 40 percent will be paid by the farmers themselves.
                         The affected farmers will have to transfer from rural hukou to urban hukou to take advantage of
                         the social welfare benefits. The significance of land loss and land-related income loss is marginal
                         as all the affected farmers will lose less than 10 percent of their existing land and less than 4
                         percent of land-related income. The project may also need to acquire additional land during project
                         implementation. Furthermore, the project will remove 40 graves and a number of trees and some
                         other special facilities like power lines and poles. The scale of the proposed land acquisition and
                         resettlement are manageable and negative impacts will be mitigated.

                         The project will result in house demolition of 85,503 sqm, demolition of 1,165 sqm of simple
                         workshop shelters of two private firms in Tianquan and Shimian counties, and demolition of
                         14,668 sqm of other structures such as fence walls and auxiliary facilities. In addition, the project
                         will require some 170 mu of land for temporary occupation in Qionglai, Tianquan and Yingjing
                         counties. The project will remove 44 graves and a number of trees. Close to 336 households (about
                         1403 people) are affected by physical resettlement due to house demolition. Under Component 2,
                         286 households will be resettled in 6 resettlement sites in related project counties and districts.
                         Under Component 1, 50 households have opted to take cash compensation. Most of the
                         resettlement sites have commenced construction and will be ready for the resettled people to move
                         in by 2016. Most of the resettlement sites commenced construction and will be ready for the

                           requirements. There are only two legacy issues that has to follow the schedule of the Government
                           resettlement??s process. These issues are i) ensure social security scheme for landless farmers
                           affected by the construction of the four resettlement sites. ii) ensure displaced households to move
                           to resettlement houses after their completion in 2017. The two legacy issues have been included as
                           part of the monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement process during implementation. The
                           monitoring and evaluation report of the project shall cover these pending issues until they are fully
                           resolved.

                           been identified as linked activities which will be carried out under two local government projects.
                           These linked sections will permanently acquire about 225 mu of land and 93 mu for temporary
                           use. The sections will affect about 109 households (about 327 people), of which only 7 households
                           with 24 affected people will lose more than 20 percent land. The road sections does not require
                           any demolition of residential houses, however 4 graves will be removed from the project sites. The
                           land acquisition and resettlement under these linked activities are included in the RAP and will be
                           addressed and monitored during project implementation.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           For component 1, alternative analysis was carried out for the alignment, scale and engineering
                           aspects of the three rural roads, taken into account environmental and social, technical, geological
                           risks and cost considerations. In general, selected options will have less land acquisition, provide
                           better access to local communities and result in less disturbance to local ecosystems and
                           communities compared with other options considered.

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           Environment

                           Environment Assessment Reports were prepared by accredited EA consultant in accordance with
                           national requirements and the World Bank??s OP 4.01. The EA Reports include: (i) EIA and
                           Environmental Management Plan (EMP) for Component 1; (ii) EIA and EMPfor Component 2.
                           Applicable World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines have been
                           incorporated into the EA. These documents have been reviewed by the Bank team and considered
                           satisfactory to Bank safeguards requirements.

                           The EMPs were prepared based on the findings of the EIA. The EMP outlines measures to avoid,
                           minimize, and mitigate potential environmental and social impacts as well as a budget for the
                           implementation of EMP activities. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of pertinent
                           organizations and institutions. The EMP incorporates plans for training, monitoring and
                           evaluation, and budget estimates. The EMP will be incorporated into bidding documents and
                           contracts. The EMP also includes mitigation measures and a comprehensive capacity building plan
                           for the local environmental authority.

                           The project owners at county/district level have limited or no prior experiences in managing Bank-

                           financed project. The EMPs have included a clear institutional arrangement that defines the
                           environmental management responsibilities, supervision and reporting duties. Independent
                           environmental monitoring consultants will be hired to assist in the two PPMOs in managing

                           environmental safeguards compliance during project implementation.

                           Social

                           To address social impacts and risks of the project, a consolidated Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
                           has been prepared separately under the implementation of two separate provincial PPMOs for their
                           respective project part. Each of the PPMOs has hired an experienced professional consulting team
                           to address issues of land acquisition, compensation and livelihood restoration, resettlement for
                           project-affected people and communities. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) is also
                           prepared to address the future possible new land acquisition and resettlement. A due diligence
                           report was done for resettlement sites. The RAPs and RPF have set up standards and procedures
                           for compensating affected people and communities and grievance redress mechanisms. Monitoring
                           and evaluation of the implementation of these social safeguards instruments are clearly stated in
                           the safeguards and project documents.

                           The above safeguards documents have been reviewed by the Bank team and considered
                           satisfactory to Bank safeguards requirements.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Environment

                           Two rounds of public consultations have been carried out during project preparation. Public
                           consultations were undertaken in the form of questionnaires, focus group discussions, and public
                           meetings. Information disclosure on EA preparation was advertised through public bulletins, local
                           newspapers, and the internet. The draft full EA documents were disclosed locally on January 27,

                           2016 and the final EA documents were disclosed on April 12, 2016. Pubic concerns raised during
                           these consultations have been incorporated into the project design, the EMP and RAP.

                           Social

                           The RAPs and RPF for the project have been prepared and deemed satisfactory to the Bank
                           requirements. The RAPs and RPF were disclosed in villages locally on January 21, 2016 and made
                           accessible to general public on January 26, 2016 and disclosed in the Bank InfoShop on January
                           27, 2016. The final documents were disclosed on March 21, 2016.

                           Grievance Redress. A mechanism has been established for grievance redress for the affected
                           people. Grievances can be filed both orally and in writing. Starting at the village and neighborhood
                           committee level, grievances can be elevated to county/district/city/provincial level if they are not
                           satisfied with the resolution at the lower level. The affected people could also file their cases in
                           court if they are not happy with the resolution by the project authority. All grievances and their
                           resolution will be recorded. This mechanism has been disclosed to the local population and will be
                           further disseminated through the Resettlement Information Booklet.
