A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Development Objective of the 
project, which will remain unchanged with the additional 
financing is to strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of health and pension insurance 
systems by the provision of high quality technical assistance and training to help implement 
existing reforms and to help design options for future social insurance reforms.  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed additional credit would help finance the costs associated with the 
financing gap due to 
scaled-up activities to enhance the impact of a well-performing project.
 
In particular, this would 
enable the provision of technical assistan
ce needed to: (i) perform external audits of cantonal level 
health insurance funds and large hospitals, (ii) prepare new rulebooks to determine the level of 
disability needed for obtaining disability pensions, (iii) audit the status of war veterans as a ba
sis for 
the provision of social protection benefits, and (iv) support the joint inter-
entity pension reform 
working group.  These activities would contribute to further strengthening the effectiveness and 
efficiency of the health and pension insurance systems. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis:

The proposed additional activities would not alter the environmental category of the project (C) or
