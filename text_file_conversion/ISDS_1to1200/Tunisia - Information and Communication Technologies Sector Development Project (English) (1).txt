B.  Project Objectives 
The project’s development objectives are to: (i) improve the performance of the ICT sector 
through fostering institutional reforms in telecommunications and electronic services (e
-
agenda), 
and (ii) accelerate the utili
zation of ICT through development and promotion of applications.  
The project would also contribute to the development of a more open policy and regulatory 
regime which is critical to the evolving multi
-
operator environment.  
On the institutional side, t
he project is expected to: (i) strengthen GoT’s ability to regulate the 
ICT industry and enable private sector participation, (ii) strengthen the security of critical 
databases and information systems against system failures and preserve them in cases of d
isaster, 
and (iii) simplify procedures and achieve efficiency gains in the delivery of selected government 
services to citizens over the Internet or other electronic means.  Realistic targets and performance 
indicators will be defined during project prepar
ation.

C.  Project Description
The project would include the following four components:
(a)
Increasing private sector participation and competition in the ICT sector
:  
Studies and pilots supported by the project would guide the GoT on opening of the 
ICT
 sector to private participation and competition.  In particular, the project would 
support:  (i) developing an ICT policy implementation plan, including analytical 
tools to assist the Government in the introduction of competition in several 
segments of th
e telecommunications market, (ii) developing a broadband policy, 
(iii) implementing pilots using new technologies (e.g., broadband over power lines) 
to increase ICT access in rural areas through private participation, (iv) diffusing 
modern wireless access 
technologies (e.g. WiFi, WiMax, CDMA
-
450) through 
private sector provision, and (v) identifying and removing main bottlenecks to 
innovation and to marketing of new products for domestic and regional 
consumption. 
(b)
Strengthening regulatory framework and capa
city
:  Assistance to the Tunisian 
ICT regulatory agencies INT, ANF, and ATI through advisory services, training, 
and software tools to strengthen their capacity to address priority regulatory issues. 
These issues include: (i) interconnection, (ii) spectrum
 management, (iii) 
broadband, (iv) new technologies (especially broadband wireless access to the 
Internet), and (v) ICT development.  This component would also include a review 
of the regulatory framework, with recommendations for the ICT sector. 
(c)
Developi
ng an e
-
agenda
:  Assistance to the GoT to  articulate an agenda for the 
development of electronic services in Tunisia. Specifically, the project would 
support (i) formulating an e
-
government strategy and developing e
-
government 
applications in up to five m
inistries, (ii) developing an e
-
security program, 
including establishing a data backup center and technical assistance in the area of 
disaster management, and (iii) delivering technical training in the area of e
-
security.
(d)
Strengthening Capacity for Sector 
Policy and Project Implementation
: This 
component will assure effective implementation of the activities under the project. 
It will include: (i) assistance to the Government on communications activities 
related to the GoT ICT sector strategy, (ii) support 
to establish an economics and 
statistics unit for ICT within the Ministry of Communication Technologies and 
Transport, (iii) support to develop and track monitoring & evaluation (M&E) 
indicators and an ex
-
post development impact assessment methodology for 
the 
project, (iv) a general studies activity, and (v) funding for the Project Management 
Unit.
