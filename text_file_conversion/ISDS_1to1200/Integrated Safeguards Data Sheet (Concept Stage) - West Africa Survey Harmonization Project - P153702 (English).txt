B. Project Objectives
The objective of the project is to support the WAEMU Commission at strengthening the capacity of
its member countries to conduct living conditions surveys that meet harmonized, regional standards
and approaches and that use computer assisted interview technologies and to make the collected
micro-data publicly available
C. Project Description


﻿The project will strengthen regional integration in West Africa by harmonizing living conditions
information and by strengthening the capacity at the WAEMU Commission and the national
statistical agencies of all WAEMU member states to regularly produce and to publicly disseminate
high quality, living conditions information that are comparable over time and across countries. The
project provides assistance in ways that reflect differing country needs and capacities. A regional
approach has several advantages. By working through the WAEMU Commission the demand for
quality statistics is sustained. A regional approach also brings efficiency gains, as it allows setting
common methodological standards, and enhances data comparability and data dissemination. A
*       regional approach unlocks new opportunities for financial sustainability and, finally, facilitates
south-south learning and peer review.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
This is a regional statistical project coordinated by the WAEMU Commission in Burkina Faso. It
concerns the harmonization of living conditions surveys (instruments; methodology; manuals; core
statistics) and data collection methods (CAPI). Field work will be carried out by each of the eight
WAEMU member countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, C6te d'Ivoire, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger,
Senegal and Togo. The activities to be funded by the project are limited to capacity building and data
production and dissemination and use. It will not fund any civil works that could have adverse
environmental or social impacts. The social impact is expected to be positive because by making
quality data publicly available it will nurture public debate on matters of economic, financial, and
social concern, facilitate public accountability and a better targeting of public policies and use of
public resources.
