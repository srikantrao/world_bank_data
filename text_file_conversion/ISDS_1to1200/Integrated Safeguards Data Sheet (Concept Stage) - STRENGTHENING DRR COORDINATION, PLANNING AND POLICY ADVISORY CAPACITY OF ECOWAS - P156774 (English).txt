                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective is to strengthen the disaster resilience of West African states through
                           regional collaboration and improved coordination, planning, policy advisory and knowledge
                           dissemination capacity of ECOWAS.
                           The project will accelerate the effective implementation of an African Comprehensive disaster risk
                           reduction and risk management framework in the ECOWAS region.
                           C. Project Description
                           The program for strengthening the DRR capacity of ECOWAS will be implemented in a combination
                           of Bank Executed (BE) and Recipient Executed (RE) projects in three phases. This project paper
                           describes the Recipient Executed activities of phase 1. ECOWAS implemented (RE) activities will
                           allow ECOWAS to hire additional consultants for implementing the DRR program in West Africa as
                           well as deepening the engagement on flood forecasting, policy implementation and post disaster
                           recovery planning. RE implementation will also allow ECOWAS to acquire some of the urgently
                           required equipment, such as network servers.
                         The project will consist of four components:
                         i. Strengthen DRM policies and institutions at national and regional level. The project will support
                         ECOWAS and its member states in the first year to validate and adopt the Plan of Action 2015 –

                         2020 for DRR through a regional consultation workshop, which will translate lessons learnt from the
                         WCDRR in Sendai in March 2015 to the ECOWAS context. This component will furthermore
                         provide support for developing a strategy and institutional framework for national disaster
                         management agencies and test the framework in at least two member countries.
                         Intermediate results indicators for this component include:
                         -        The ECOWAS DRR Strategy and Plan of Action (2015 – 2030) is consulted, validated and
                         adopted by member states;
                         -        A regional common, operational framework for national disaster management / civil
                         protection organizations is drafted and tested in at least two member states;
                         ii. Strengthen regional flood management capacity. This component will support identifying a
                         harmonized framework for flood forecasting in West Africa over the entire four-year period of the
                         project. In the first phase the project will review and update the 2010 study on impacts of
                         transnational floods in West Africa and initiate the consultation with RBOs, technical and scientific
                         institutions as well as NGO. In the second year a feasibility study on a regional flood forecasting
                         mechanism will be launched, while piloting it in the second phase. It will help thinking through the
                         necessary institutional arrangements, ensure stakeholder participation in the process and mainstream
                         the results in sector policies.
                         The intermediate results indicators for this component include:
                         –        The institutional and policy framework for flood management in West Africa is formulated
                         and consulted with member states and stakeholder;
                         –        A feasibility study for a regional flood forecasting mechanism is drafted and reviewed;
                         –        A regional flood forecasting mechanism is tested in at least one trans boundary basin;
                         –        The institutional capacity of ECOWAS to receive, process and disseminate flood and other
                         disaster related information is strengthened;
                         iii. Enhance regional post disaster recovery planning. The project will provide comprehensive
                         support to ECOWAS for better managing post disaster needs assessments and recovery planning,

                         investing in capacity building, building regional (ECOWAS) guidance notes on recovery planning
                         and assisting member states in establishing base line data for economic impact assessments and
                         recovery planning.
                         The intermediate results indicators for this component include:
                         -        At least two regional trainings (in English and French) on post disaster needs assessments are
                         conducted;
                         -        A roster of recovery experts is established;
                         iv. Capacity strengthening and coordination. The project will support ECOWAS with two technical
                         specialists / project officers providing guidance and support to ECOWAS on disaster risk reduction.
                         The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be supported with (i) Office running costs and local
                         travel; (iii) Procurement and financial management software and training; (iii) Project assistant; (iv)
                         Launch workshop; (v) Completion report and dissemination workshop; (vi) Specialized consultants
                         and (vii) Renovating office space.
                         The intermediate results indicators for this component include:
                         -        At least two senior DRM specialists are hired during the project implementation period;
                         D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The project is a technical assistance activity and will be implemented at and through the secretariat of
                         the ECOWAS Commission. Certain activities, such as the proposed study on trans-boundary effects
                           of floods in West Africa will address issues, such as flooding in the 15 member states of ECOWAS.
                           These studies will however remain at the level of detail of “pre-feasibility” studies. Besides office
                           space renovations and the installation of servers inside the buildings of the ECOWAS secretariat in

                           Abuja no activities will be implemented, which have any physical impact on any site.
                           E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           ECOWAS has already implemented already a number of World Bank financed projects in the
                           previous years. Nevertheless, ECOWAS’ capacity to address and manage environmental and social
                           safeguard related issues remains limited. Specifically, the Humanitarian Affairs Directorate of
                           ECOWAS has not yet managed a World Bank financed project. The project will therefore establish a
                           small Project Implementation Unit (PIU) to support the implementation of the project. If deemed
                           necessary the PIU could be strengthened with specialists to take care of safeguard relevant issues
                           during project implementation.
