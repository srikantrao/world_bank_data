A.2. Project Objectives 
The project development objective is to support the access of young rural 
sujetos agrarios
1
with 
entrepreneurial potential to land and other productive assets within selected states, through the 
establishment of a beneficiary-driven, efficient land transaction model, while at the same time facilitating 
the access of senior landholders to social welfare schemes. 
To achieve this, the project will support the GOM in piloting mechanisms that will: 
(i) on the one hand, allow landless young rural entrepreneurs to receive training and technical assistance, to 
acquire or rent underutilized and potentially more productive land, and implement productive and 
environmentally sustainable on- and off-farm investment projects that significantly increase their income 
and welfare, and 
(ii) on the other hand, help older 
ejidatarios
 or 
comuneros
 who transfer their lands to access social welfare 
schemes. 
A.3. Project Description 
The project has 3 components: 1) Capacity Building of Young Rural Entrepreneurs and Assistance to 
Senior Landholders; 2) Land Transactions and Productive Projects; and 3) Project management and 
monitoring and evaluation (M&E).

Ejidatarios, Avecindados, Posesionarios
 and 
Comuneros, 
including indigenous peoples, as described in 
Footnote 1, Paragraph A 1. 
Page  2
Component 1 will provide the beneficiaries with the knowledge and abilities including 
financial management skills required to elaborate and carry out a productive project in 
relation to land. At the same time, it will promote their participation in a demonstration 
productive project and disseminate information and provide technical assistance for 
access to social welfare schemes to senior landholders. 
 
Component 2 will promote the secure and sustainable access to land by qualified young 
rural entrepreneurs who will implement a productive project to sustainably raise their 
income. The support will be given in form of a combination of credits and grants and will 
include technical assistance. At the same time it will promote the inclusion of senior 
landholders in social welfare programs offered by the GOM 
 
Component 3 will include day-to-day project management but will specifically focus on 
three issues. First, the project will pay attention to inter-institutional coordination so as to 
improve synergies with other related programs targeted to the social sector. Second, 
given the pilot nature of the project, specific attention will be paid to the Monitoring & 
Evaluation system so as to develop a results-based improvement mechanism. Third, 
project management will develop mentoring mechanisms to better accompany the JERs 
in the identification and implementation of their productive projects and to ensure their 
participation.  
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
The project area initially includes 
ejidos
 and 
comunidades
 within the following states: 
San Luis Potosi, Guerrero, Michoacan, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, Sinaoloa, Oaxaca, 
Sonora, Zacatecas, and Yucatan.  The Project has been initially implemented by SRA 
(without Bank support) in eight of the ten states included in the current Project area. To 
date, activities have included only training (
Proyecto Escuela); 
the installation of 
productive projects has not yet occurred.  
It should be noted that given the demand-drive nature of the productive project phase, it 
is impossible to know 
a
priori
 the specific types of productive projects and the specific 
parcels on which they will be installed. The total scope of activities financed through the 
project is quite limited, representing, on average, 0.025% of the area in each pilot state. 
Most productive investments will be carried on individual crop-land parcels, the average 
size of which is 3 to 5ha. 
For each state supporting project activities, all sensitive areas will be identified and 
located on maps. This information will be collected by the SRA prior to project initiation. 
These maps will be at an appropriate scale to facilitate subproject screening. The maps 
will include and differentiate the following types of areas: 1) Critical Areas (national 
parks, state and local parks, proposed protected areas, areas under international 
protection, culturally important areas, private or communal protected areas, aquifer 
recharge zones, natural forests lacking official management plans, other areas of known 
conservation value); 2) Fragile Areas (buffer zones, natural forests, steep slopes, zones 
with religious importance, areas at risk of natural disasters, riparian zones); and 3) Areas 
with Min
or Environmental Risks
(i
rrigation districts
,
agricultural lands, pastures and 
Page  3
prairies, urban or peri-urban areas). Site sensitivity will be defined by consulting the map 
of sensitive areas to determine whether the subproject location is within any critical or 
fragile areas. Results of this assessment will be used to determine initial subproject 
eligibility.  
The project area is home to members of indigenous groups, which account for about 40% 
of total indigenous peoples in the country.  The Indigenous Peoples Development Plan 
(IPDP) developed during project preparation provides detailed description of the location, 
and socio-economic and land tenancy characteristics of indigenous peoples who will be 
benefited through the project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The EA was done in two phases. First, in order to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the 
Training Phase, the EA evaluated a select subsample of training activities. Second, so as to assess the 
environmental impacts of the installation of productive projects (which has not yet been undertaken 
through the pilot phase), the EA undertook an analysis of the potential impacts of projects likely to be 
supported.
 
Potential Impacts of Training Phase/
Proyecto Escuela
 
The EA evaluated a select number of training projects in three states: Guerrero, Sinaloa and Sonora. Within 
each of these three states, the EA chose eight to ten projects that appeared to be the most environmental 
risky, based on the types of activities being supported and the types of lands on which they were being 
undertaken. Specifically, the EA evaluated high risk activities, such as raising of cattle, sheep, and pigs, 
greenhouse production, and agriculture, in lands that were considered sensitive, such as priority 
conservation areas, slopes, protected areas (or their buffer zones), on or near important aquifers, wetland, 
coastal or mangrove systems, and/or on or near culturally important sites. 
The absence of an Environmental Management Plan or, for that matter, any environmental considerations 
in the selection of the activities supporting during training, as well as the sensitivity of the lands on which 
they were conducted, made possible the creation of unintended environmental impacts. Specifically, the EA 
found that the Training Phase had led to a number of unintended environmental consequences, including:  
Conversion of Natural Habitats
:
Several projects were installed in sensitive areas (
agostodero, tierras de 
uso comun
,
protected areas, priority conservation areas wetlands) without consideration of the potential 
impacts.  
Changes in Quality of Water, Air, and Soil: 
The training projects included construction of small-scale 
infrastructure and installation of productive activities, many of which could lead to deterioration in water, 
air and soil quality over the short- to long-term. Specifically, the heavy emphasis on cattle raising is likely 
to lead to water, soil and air quality impacts unless implemented on appropriate soils/locations with training 
in best practices to minimize the impact of effluent and erosion. Likewise, installation of crops (either in or 
out of greenhouses) is likely to lead to environmental degradation unless training is provided as to how to 
minimize soil loss and agrochemical usage (see below).  
Intensification of Agrochemical Use: 
Several of the training projects installed (especially greenhouses) 
resulted in an increase in the use of agrochemicals. If not managed appropriately, the use of these products 
can, in turn, lead to deterioration in quality of water, soil and air, as well as increased pest resistance and 
human health effects. 
Potential Impacts of Productive Projects: 
As no productive projects have yet been proposed nor installed, the specific make-up of these activities is 
not yet known. Consequently, the EA assessed the impacts of productive projects that are most likely to be 
proposed and funded through the Project. These identified potential impacts included:
 
Conversion of Natural Habitats
:
The installation of productive projects could directly and/or indirectly 
result in conversion of natural habitats, including forests, prairies, and wetlands. Of particular concern is 
the cumulative conversion impact of multiple, small-scale agricultural works.  
Changes in Quality of Water, Air, and Soil: 
If productive activities are not implemented with attention to 
environmental management, unintended degradation in water, soil and air resources could occur. 
Page  5
Specifically, inadequate attention to agricultural activities could lead to: soil degradation through erosion or 
loss of fertility; natural surface and sub-surface hydrology changes through modification in topography, 
water management or extraction; water quality changes through inputs of fertilizers/pesticides, animal 
effluent, and/or soil run-off; air quality changes due to poor management of soil, agrochemicals, water or 
livestock.  
Intensification of Agrochemical Use:
The project could lead to an increase in the use of agrochemicals, 
either through intensification of application due to increased access to resources, or through increased area 
under production.  
It should be noted that the environmental management activities that will be supported through the Project 
represent a significant environmental improvement relative to both the status quo and to the pilot project, as 
currently implemented by the SRA (without Bank support). Specifically, the Environmental Management 
Plan takes specific action to change current practices, such as heavy reliance on agrochemicals, and the 
lack of environmental screening. 
SOCIAL: 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20):
The social assessment (SA) prepared by the Borrower 
confirmed that the project would positively affect indigenous peoples, thereby triggering 
OD 4.20. Working with indigenous communities in the project area, the Borrower 
prepared an IPDP which describes culturally compatible mechanisms for assuring that 
those communities are benefited by the project. The IPDP includes specific activities, 
timeline, budget and responsibilities for ensuring these benefits are realized.  
 
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12): 
The SA
 evaluated the project’s potential to trigger 
OP 4.12, as the policy requires that people who are forced to lose their land or land-based 
assets, or who lose access to livelihoods as a result of land acquisition, be entitled to 
compensation and assistance. The SA determined that the project did not trigger OP 4.12 
as the policy requires action only when land transfer/take is involuntary; in the case of the 
project, transfer of land (through rental or purchase) from old to young farmers is 
voluntary.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Given the multiple small-scale investments in portions of ten states, the project could 
potentially result in cumulative impacts affecting natural habitats. For this reason, the 
project’s M&E plan includes specific activities to capture and offset any important 
cumulative impacts. Specifically, at the time of the projects’ Mid Term Review, all 
subprojects will be specifically evaluated to determine if cumulative impacts to 
ecosystems are occurring and to mitigate them, through cessation of specific subproject 
intervention types in any sensitive areas.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Page  6
The EA includes a proposed Environmental Management Plan (EMP), including procedures for 
identifying, minimizing and mitigating the Project’s potential environmental impacts. This EMP will be 
included within the M
anual de Procedimientos
 being developed by SRA and FIFONAFE, and will be 
reflected in the updated official project operational rules.  All Project activities, including Training 
activities (
Proyecto Escuela) 
and Installation of Productive Projects, as well as ongoing Technical 
A
ssistance will be subject to the following environmental procedures:  
·
Development of key instruments to enable identification of potential environmental impacts; 
·
Subproject screening and classification based on potential environmental impacts of the project 
type and site sensitivity; 
·
Definition of required environmental work; 
·
Environmental monitoring; 
·
Technical assistance/capacity building; and 
·
Institutional arrangements 
These elements are described in the EA and the Safeguard Annex to the PAD.  Similarly, 
as described above in Section D.1, the SA and the IPDP prepared by the Borrower 
describe the mechanisms to e
nsure project compliance with the Bank’s (social) safeguard 
policies.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The EA, which was made publicly available in-country and in the Bank’s InfoShop prior 
to appraisal, was consulted on March 17, 2005 in Oaxaca and in April 22, 2005 in 
Mexico City. In addition, an electronic consultation was carried out before negotiations. 
These events, which were organized by SRA, included a variety of environmental 
professionals representing academia, private sector organizations (including NGOs), and 
government. Furthermore, a national workshop will be organized in July/August 2005. 
An updated version of the EA including conclusions of the e-consultation and the 
workshop will be posted on SRA’s website and the Bank’s InfoShop in Washington. 
 
The IPDP, which was disclosed prior to the initiation of project appraisal both locally and 
through the Bank’s InfoShop, was publicly consulted in Mexico City on April 22, 2005. 
Following the consultation, the final IPDP was publicly disclosed in Mexico and 
Washington.
