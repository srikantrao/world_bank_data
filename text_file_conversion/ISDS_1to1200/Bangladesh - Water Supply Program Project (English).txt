A.2. Project Objectives 
 
 
The development objectives of the proposed project are to contribute to Bangladesh’s 
efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in water supply and 
sanitation by 2015. Specifically, the project will pilot innovative measures to scale up the 
provision of safe water supply free from arsenic and pathogens in rural areas and small 
towns.  
 
This will take place by (i) promoting rural piped water supply with private-sector 
participation, (ii) promoting private-sector participation in water supply in municipalities 
(pourashavas), (iii) implementing arsenic mitigation measures in arsenic-affected 
villages, (iv) supporting development of adequate regulations, monitoring, capacity 
building and training, (v) supporting the development of a local credit market for village 
piped water supply, and (vi) implementing a monitoring and evaluation system for the 
project.  
 
Key Indicators: 
 
Gfi
At least 450 villages provided with functioning piped water supply schemes. 
Gfi
At least 3 pourashavas provided with improved and functioning water supply 
systems operated through private sector participation. 
Gfi
At least 200 villages (approximately 2,000 point sources) provided with 
sustainable alternative water supply options at sufficiently high service levels 
where arsenic mitigation through piped water supply is not feasible.  
Gfi

A.3. Project Description 
 
Component 1: Piped water supply in villages and growth centers – US$25 million 
 
This component would expand the experience of pilot water supply schemes undertaken by 
various NGOs and other organizations, and the pilots supported by BAMWSP and the Social 
Development Foundation. In this component, sponsors (entrepreneurs, cooperatives, CBOs, 
and/or NGOs), in close collaboration with communities and local governments, would develop 
village piped water supply schemes. The project would, on a grant basis, provide technical 
assistance and financial support. The grant will cover only a portion of the total cost. The 
remainder will be provided by the sponsor and the community through contributions or loans. An 
affordability assessment was undertaken during preparation to ensure that the private operator 
would provide safe water service to the poor members of the community. Three different options 
have been developed to ensure that all segments of the village will be able to afford clean water  
(piped supply with multiple house connections for wealthier households; yard standpipe for 
middle-income households; and shared standpipes for poor households). The Government, 
through DPHE and other institutions, will regulate key aspects of the operation such as water 
quality, technical standards and service levels.  
 
Component 2: Water and Sanitation Services in medium-size cities – US$13 million 
 
 
2.a) Pourashavas and private-sector involvement in piped water supply
  
 
Water service levels in Bangladesh’s medium-size cities are very poor with levels of coverage of 
only 30-60%, 3-12 hours of service, and the presence of arsenic in some of the water systems. 
The experience of a pilot currently under preparation with BAMWSP support in the city of 
Chapai Nawabganj would be replicated in other medium-size cities. In Nawabganj a private 
sector operator will be invited to restructure and upgrade the system, change the water sources to 
provide arsenic-free water, and manage the water utility under a design-build-operate contract. 
The proposed component will support similar reforms in water service delivery in self-selected 
municipalities (or groups of municipalities) willing to undertake reform of their water supply 
services. Two interested municipalities have been formally identified and six others have 
informally expressed their interest. A total of 3 to 5 pourashavas would be selected to participate 
in this component.  
 
Private sector participation options also include management contracts and public-private 
partnerships to provide the services.  The component will also provide technical assistance to 
central and local governments in the design, supervision and monitoring of contracts with the 
private sector. 
 
2.b) Urban sanitation 
 
The project will finance pre-feasibility studies for urban sanitation. These may include: 
 
o
Preparation of alternative sanitation options (condominial sewer systems, individual 
house units – latrines). 
o
Definition of institutional options and financial arrangements to operate and maintain 
public sanitation systems. 
 
 
Page  4
 
 
Component 3: Non-piped arsenic mitigation activities for villages – US$ 4 million 
 
In small villages of less than 200 households piped water supply is not viable and non-piped 
arsenic mitigation options are necessary. Based on the experience from BAMWSP and other 
GOB and donor initiatives, three options present themselves. These are (i) deep tubewells, (ii) 
dugwells, and (iii) pond sandfilters.  This component is designed to address the situation in small 
villages located in arsenic-affected Hot Spot Upazilas (to be defined by appraisal) and to provide 
complementary service in fringe areas of those villages where piped water supply will be 
supplied, but where it will not be feasible, for technical reasons, to cover all households.  
 
Component 4: Regulations, capacity building and training – US$ 3 million 
 
4. a) Capacity Building and Training 
 
The success of the national program will depend on a limited number of support components 
focused on developing and strengthening the capacity of stakeholders to implement mitigation 
measures. These components include support to:  
 
Gfi
Sponsors - for management of community systems, financial management,  and treatment 
technologies. 
Gfi
Local private sector for the design, build and operate urban water supply systems 
Gfi
Local and central government officials - for the promotion, support, design and contract 
regulation of piped water supply systems operated by the private sector;  
Gfi
DPHE and pourashavas– for technical and economic regulatory capacity.  This includes 
benchmarking of operations and investments in urban water supply systems 
Gfi
 and support to employees willing to set up private companies to develop rural piped 
systems; and 
Gfi
Communities and contractors - in areas needed to fulfill their roles. 
 
A capacity assessment was undertaken during preparation to address the different needs of these 
various entities.  
 
4. b) Regulatory Frameworks  
 
The project will provide Technical Assistance to the development/strengthening of regulatory 
frameworks in two key areas: (i) involvement of the private sector (cooperatives, NGOs and 
private companies) in rural and urban piped water supply with community participation; and (ii) 
groundwater management and administration.  
 
4. c) Water Monitoring  
 
This component will seek to strengthen water quality monitoring and capacity at national 
(DPHE), union parishad and pourashava levels. Parallel financing by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) as well as DFID is expected. 
In additon, this sub component will focus on monitoring and assist DPHE in the characterization 
and monitoring of safe groundwater resources, as groundwater will continue to be one of the 
country’s main sources of supply. 
 
Component 5: Development of Local Credit Market for Village Piped Water Supply – US$5 
million 
 
Page  5
 
 
At present there is no local credit market for rural piped water supply in Bangladesh. This 
component seeks to help develop such a market as an essential long-term requirement for 
successful scaling up of rural piped water provision. With local banks in Bangladesh 
generally unable to provide loans with long-term maturity – a crucial element in keeping 
water tariffs charged by private sponsors affordable – and lacking experience in financing 
rural piped water supply schemes, this component will make funding available to eligible 
sponsors. The chief objective of the component is to illustrate to private banks that 
private piped water supply schemes constitute a viable market and that it is worthwhile 
for them to offer appropriate lending instruments. The primary mechanism to be 
developed would be a Partial Credit Guarantee for private banks interested in lending for 
village piped water supply. If this mechanism should not be taken up by local banks, 
funds could then be made available directly to sponsors through loans administered by 
IDCOL. In either case, these would be short-term financing mechanisms until the credit 
market for piped water supply is developed more broadly and banks would offer direct 
lending to private sponsors.  
 
The above is currently being developed under the Private Sector Infrastructure 
Development Project (PSIDP). It is anticipated that the project component would be 
activated under this proposed project only if sufficient resources were not available 
through PSIDP.  
 
Component 6: Monitoring and Evaluation – US$ 1 million 
 
Project design is purposefully flexible to encourage a variety of approaches and actors. Given the 
large number of villages in Bangladesh and the huge task of scaling up safe water supply in the 
country, project design will need to allow for rapid learning and replication. By encouraging 
participation of different private-sector entities, and given the entrepreneurial spirit in the country, 
it is hoped that the successful experiences will draw in increasingly more investors and that new 
schemes will increase. At the same time, it is important to learn as systematically as possible from 
these interventions. The M&E component is being designed accordingly. An M&E framework is 
currently under development and will be included in the Operational Manual of the project. In a 
first phase, it is expected that the framework will require intensive monitoring by the M&E 
group, but as the pilot phase progresses towards a scaled-up program, the M&E framework 
should focus on key information and avoid excessive and costly data collection. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis[w8]: 
 
As the project will promote demand-driven sustainable water supply with direct involvement of 
the private sponsors, sub-projects, which will be identified on a rolling basis, will be implemented 
almost throughout the country. This sub-project areas may include flood plains, coastal area, 
small towns and any other hinterlands in Bangladesh.  While the coastal region will have saline 
intrusion in groundwater as a key environmental concern, water supply sub-project location in 
flood plains would require complex environmental management strategy. According to available 
information, one-third of  Bangladesh gets submerged during regular floods and two-thirds of the 
area tends to get submerged during severe floods. Under such a scenario, the location of the 
project is not only driven by the availability of  freshwater sources (ground or surface) but also by 
the mean height and frequency of floodwater. Thus, making the water supply project more 
vulnerable towards bacteriological contamination.

sanitation activities are ongoing, such as the hill tracts and the coastal belt. The project will also 
keep out of the naturally protected areas like the World Heritage Site - largest single mangrove 
forests of the Sundarbans Reserve Forest (SRF) and the country’s biggest freshwater wetlands 
‘Tangur Haor’ areas. 
 
B. Check Environmental Category 
A [], B [X ], C [ ], FI [ ] 
 
One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are technically and 
institutionally manageable as detailed below.
 
Comments:  
Owing to the small-scale individual interventions, the project will not have significant irreversible 
or long-term environmental impacts. The potential adverse environmental impacts, primarily 
related to the quality of water supplied, or related to small and local environmental degradation 
are manageable. These issues will addressed by the effective implementation of the 
environmental management framework prepared by the project.  
 
The piped water systems will be built on public land, so land acquisition is not required. The 
resettlement policy, therefore, does not apply. Proper registration will be required if land is 
donated.  
 
The majority of the tribal population resides in the hilly remote areas in a scattered manner and 
groundwater in these areas is not contaminated by arsenic. Therefore it is not anticipated that the 
project would finance activities for the tribal population. Nevertheless, these communities might 
opt for piped water supply schemes under Component 1. For this reason, an appropriate 
framework will be developed within the Social Framework that will address specific issues for 
the tribal population if such villages were to select participate in the project.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP
/BP
 4.01): 
Given the small scale of project interventions, 
no large-scale, significant and/or irreversible environmental impacts are anticipated in this 
project. The potential environmental impacts primarily relate to [a] water source quality 
protection (including protection against arsenic, bacteriological and other toxic contamination), 
[b] ensuring adequate drainage and avoiding local construction-related impacts, and [c] disposal 
of arsenic sludge if and when arsenic removal plants were to be implemented.  
 
Managing and ensuring the quality of water supplied will be the major challenge in the project. 
Although, groundwater in Bangladesh is characterized by low total dissolved solids except in the 
coastal regions and a few pockets of inland saline/brackish groundwater, there are issues over and 
above arsenic contamination. These include (i) occurrence of  high levels of chloride in the deep 
wells in the coastal and some saline/brackish water pockets inland, (ii) localized occurrence of an 
excessive amount of dissolved iron, manganese, ammonium, and sodium in many deep wells, (iii) 
heavy metals such as barium and boron, and (limited) uranium both in shallow and deep 
groundwater, (iv) secondary microbial contamination in some occasions. Surface water in 
Bangladesh has poor microbial water quality. The issues include (i) high levels of  fecal coliform 
and total coliform and (ii) presence of cynobacteria.  
 
An Environment Assessment has been carried out by the Borrower; relevant environmental issues 
and the processes to manage or mitigate the environmental have been identified. 
 
Indigenous Peoples (
OD 4.20
):
 
 
As mentioned above, it is unlikely that the project will be active in areas where tribal people live, 
given that those are not arsenic-affected. Therefore the policy is not triggered. For the event that a 
request for piped water systems should be received from such areas, a mechanism is being 
devised in the social framework of the project that would ensure the full inclusion of tribal 
people, as per OD 4.20. The main issue related to the tribal population would include to ensure 
access to any piped water supply system service if a village where tribal population resides 
decides to participate in Component 1. The social framework, to be finalized during appraisal, 
will address this issue and any other issues that may arise.  
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area.   
 
As deep tubewells become more and more popular owing to the relative advantages regarding 
arsenic and bacteriological contamination, indiscriminate drilling without understanding the local 
aquifer dynamics will be a long-term indirect risk. The groundwater monitoring component of the 
project seeks to address this long-term risk by continuing to support the GoB in increasing the 
knowledge base regarding the deep/old aquifer. 
 
The absence of efficient sewage treatment plant in the towns covered in the project is also a 
matter of concern, where there would be possibilities of additional pollution of surface and 
ground water resources. No other long-term impact is anticipated. 
 
Page  8
 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)  
 
In the discussion of alternative designs, a continuation of the BAMWSP approach, which focuses 
on shared community wells as an arsenic mitigation measure, was considered. This alternative 
was discarded due to the fact that (i) investment needs for provision of safe water are far greater 
than the government alone could provide in a reasonable period of time so that additional sources 
of funding would have needed to be mobilized, (ii) most rural households are used to individual 
hand pumps and therefore willing to pay for piped water supply to maintain the level of  
convenience to which they are accustomed, (iii) piped water supply will have significant 
additional health effects, not only related to avoidance of arsenic intake, especially when coupled 
with the sanitation component. Thus, as compared to the shared well model, the development 
impact of the proposed design is expected to be greater.  
 
It was also discussed to include sanitation interventions in the rural components. However, given 
the parallel development of a Local Government Project, which will specifically include a Total 
Sanitation Approach in villages, it was decided to not include such a component in this project, so 
as to avoid duplication and to not make a complex project even more complex.  
 
Regarding the urban component, it was decided to take into account possible increased sanitation 
needs (due to higher water throughput with expanded access to piped water) by financing 
assessments and prefeasibility studies in the piloted pourashavas. Considering the timeframe of 
the project and the expected implementation time for the improved water supply, sanitation 
investments would have to be undertaken as a follow-up.  
 
Another alternative considered was to exclude the urban pilot component. However, given the 
current window of opportunity to introduce an innovative approach to the urban water sector in 
Bangladesh, and given major needs in the face of arsenic contamination of private tubewells in 
urban areas, it was decided to include this pilot as an input to the GOB’s strategy of developing a 
programmatic approach to water supply in the country. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.  
 
OD 4.01: Environmental Assessment
: The GOB has prepared an EA Report, which identifies 
the probable environmental issues in the project; describes the overall plan and framework to 
address the environmental issues; and the arrangements of implementing and monitoring to 
ensure that the environmental issues are mainstreamed in the planning and implementation of the 
programme.  
 
For sub-projects using groundwater
, the project will ensure to tap those deep aquifers free from 
arsenic and bacteriological contamination. The project will also incorporate the lessons learned in 
the BAMWSP implementation process. At the sub-project level, quality of water will be ensured 
through testing during feasibility studies and implementation (testing will include all parameters 
notified for GOB for drinking water). Although the aim would be to avoid problematic sources, 
by exploring and tapping safe sources (by location), adequate arsenic removal plants/technologies 
and conventional water treatment will be used, wherever required. Adequate assessment will be 
undertaken to understand the aquifer thickness, hydraulic gradient and its recharge capacity prior 
to the installation of deep tube wells. Safe drilling techniques will be employed following a 
protocol specifically being developed for the project. Besides, the project will establish a 
partnership with Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) for comprehensive monitoring 
of arsenic-free groundwater. 
 
Page  9
 
 
Under Project Component 2 and 3, the project will explore various locally accepted arsenic free 
water harvesting technologies, including dugwells, pond-sand filters and surface water infiltration 
systems. These sub-projects will implement adequate environmental measures for source 
protection, managing bacteriological contamination and restricting pesticides and fertilizer 
residues entering into the ponds and dug-wells as run off. For sub-projects using surface water
, 
the project will make provisions for regular bacteriological surveillance, adequate management of 
sludge and chemical from water treatment facilities.    
 
Mitigation of construction related impacts
: Given the small size of the operation, the project may 
not have serious adverse environmental impacts during the construction. However, the project 
will take adequate precautionary measures to avoid degradation in local environment. The 
construction work for both installation and distribution network of piped water supply system will 
be monitored for adequate materials management, including transportation, storage and disposal 
of construction materials; damage to local ponds and water bodies, or local flora. 
  
Mitigation of project operation-related issues
: Each sub-project will be screened to ensure that 
issues such as environmental sanitation, lack of proper drainage around public stand post or water 
distribution points, are minimized. Depending upon the withdrawal capacity and the demand, 
each public stand post will have a concrete platform at the distribution point. The project will 
collaborate with the proposed Local Government Project, which will specifically include a Total 
Sanitation Approach in villages to promote better hygiene and environmental sanitation practices 
in the project area. The project will have adequate provision to mobilize users for ensuring quality 
control measures during the installation and operation of the sub-projects. 
 
The project will develop specific protocol for arsenic sludge disposal
 and other waste treatment 
likely to be generated while removing arsenic from groundwater. The protocol will be developed 
in compliance with GoB (Notification: July 20, 2002). 
 
Other specific strategies are to include environmental parameters in appraisal and review of the 
project proposals, and in the periodic review of program implementation. Additionally the sub-
projects will be subject to periodic Independent Third-Party Environmental Audits, which will 
examine the implementation of the environmental management measures on a sample of sub-
projects, for Project Components 1, 2, and 3; and covering all geographical divisions of 
Bangladesh. 
 
Borrower Capacity: 
The GOB has been implementing the Bank-supported BAMWSP since 
1998. During implementation of the BAMWSP and several other projects financed by bilateral 
agencies, considerable expertise has been gained by the implemting agencies, especially with 
regard to managing the water quality issues including arsenic and microbial contamination. This 
project builds on the experience of BAMWSP and other similar projects undertaken by the GOB. 
The Borrower has demonstrated institutional capacity to manage the project, including planning 
and implementation of actions to meet social and environmental needs and safeguards. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.  
 
The project design seeks to build partnerships with the private sector, including NGOs, and 
community user groups in financing, operating and maintaining facilities. Specifically for the 
groundwater monitoring component, the project will partner with the IAEA and with its local 
counterpart, the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) and DFID.  
Page  10
 
 
 
In this project, community consultation is an integral part. The planning approach is bottom-up, 
where communities, local level institutions including the Union Parishads are involved in 
identification, planning, design, implementation, operation and maintenance of the project 
interventions. The project is based on 2001/2 assessment people’s perceptions of the extent of the 
arsenic problem and possible solutions. It examined people’s willingness to pay for arsenic-free 
safe drinking water options in rural Bangladesh, and the preferences for various 
household/community-based arsenic mitigation technologies. During preparation of this project, 
the communities, CBO/water users body, local NGO, local government bodies, local DPHE 
officials, and implementing agencies were consulted in detail to identify the key issues related to 
community mobilization, schemes design, procurement and construction, operation and 
maintenance. Civil society consultations were held in different levels to discuss issues such as 
quality of water and the required intervention to ensure sustainability of sub-projects. 
Consultations with all stakeholders – communities, experts, NGOs and private sector sponsors 
will continue throughout the implementation period.  
 
Project design specifically emphasizes an approach to provision of service that will ensure 
affordability of safe water to the poor, both in the urban and rural settings. 
 
 
The environmental assessment reports (the EA Report, and Summary of the EA Report in 
Bangla), along with the other project documents, will be disclosed in-country latest 30 days 
before appraisal of the project. The draft EA Summary has been uploaded in the GoBN/DPHE 
website. There were advertisements in the newspapers of countrywide circulation, including 
vernacular newspaper, by 17 March 2004 that interested persons might access the reports from 
the website. The advertisements and the webpage described how the interested people might send 
their feedback/comments.
