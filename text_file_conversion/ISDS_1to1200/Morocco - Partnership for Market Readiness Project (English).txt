   2. Current Project Development Objectives
   The objective of the Project is to assist the Government of Morocco in designing and piloting a
   Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system in one or more targeted sectors, and
   establishing core technical components needed for the design of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   reduction crediting mechanism.
   For the purposes of the PDO, “core technical components? includes: (i) analysis of appropriate
   mitigation instruments and MBI governance; (ii) establishing a baseline for each of the three sectors;

                                              Page 1 of 7
    and (iii) evaluation of the mitigation potential in the three sectors. These correspond to the
    completion of activities 1, 7 and 8 from Morocco’s Market Readiness Proposal.
    3. Project Description
Morocco’s proposed PMR activities:

Morocco submitted its Expression of Interest (EoI) and Organizational Framework (OF) to join the PMR
respectively in May 2011 and March 2013, and was subsequently confirmed a PMR implementing
country. The extraordinary meeting of the PMR Partnership Assembly (PA) held on 14 March 2012 in
Shenzhen, China approved the allocation of the preparation phase funding in the amount of $315,000 to
Morocco to prepare its MRP. The Government of Morocco requested the PMR Partnership Assembly to
approve the World Bank (WB) as its Delivery Partner in preparing its MRP. The MRP was prepared and
presented to the PA in May 2014 for final approval of the requested US$ 3.00 million implementation
grant.

An inter-ministerial task force was set up to coordinate the project preparation and implementation
phases. The Ministry of General Affairs and Governance (MAGG) and the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) and the Delegated Ministry of the Environment (MDE) within the Ministry of Energy,
Mines, Water and the Environment (MEMEE) form the PMR Steering Committee. The inclusion of the
Ministry of Finance within the Steering Committee aims to lend support to enhancing the country’s
preparedness to grasp the future climate finance opportunities and to ensure consistency and adequate
monitoring of project funding. MAGG will be responsible for the neede d stakeholders’ coordination.
Finally, the MDE will assume the lead role in technical implementation.

Morocco’s PMR project has three components, as follows:

Component 1: MRV System and Supporting Analysis: This component contains the bulk of the technical
assistance activities of this project, related to the following activities:

    1. Analysis and recommendations on which carbon pricing instruments to implement, and a
       proposal for an appropriate governance framework;
    2. Design of an institutional framework and operational requirements for an MRV system (general
       and sector-wide);
    3. Piloting of the MRV system;
    4. Establishment of a baseline for each of the targeted sectors (electricity, cement, phosphates);
    5. Evaluation of the mitigation potential in the targeted sectors; and
    6. Support for the establishment of a regulatory framework for mitigation measures in the three
       targeted sectors.

Component 2: Capacity-building: A critical component of technical assistance, this project will invest in
building the capacity of the government and the private sector to monitor, report and verify emissions and
changes in emissions levels. A capacity-building plan will be prepared which will propose a combination
of practical and participative workshops, meetings for participants to share knowledge during piloting
activities, study trips, tools and logistics, and knowledge products.

Component 3: Project management: The third component includes the establishment and operation of the
PMU to be set up within the MDE to implement and manage PMR activities and to coordinate with
related programs and initiatives. The PMU is also expected to support the preparation of an institutional
framework for carbon markets in Morocco in the period following the PMR project. This component also
includes funding for a mid-term review to be conducted by an external third party.

  4. Project Location and Salient Physical Characteristics Relevant to the Safeguards Analysis
      (if known)
  The project will only finance technical assistance activities limited to studies, assessments, training
  programs, consultations aimed at helping Morocco enhance its capacities to set up carbon crediting
  mechanisms and benefit from opportunities to engage in post-CDM regime. The activities will
  principally take the form of consulting services, with some acquisition of office supplies, and no
  physical works to be funded. As such the project will not have any direct adverse impacts on the
  environment and society. By helping Morocco develop its capacities for carbon crediting, the project
  aims to support the Government’s low carbon growth objectives.

  Delivery of the technical assistance activities, including training, capacity building, assessments, may
  be carried out in various locations throughout Morocco, but primarily in Rabat and Casablanca.
