  C. Project Description
  The proposed activities are classified into three components as follows:

  Component 1: Implementing cost-effective and high quality surveys [$270,817]

  This trust fund will support pre-collection activities (training and the pilot survey), technical support, equipment, and
  data quality monitoring for the ENIGH-2018 with the aim of identifying and implementing cost-effective approaches
  that enhance quality. Strengthened institutional capacity, including new equipment, included in this component are
  expected to benefit other surveys collected by the CBH and INE. This support will complement the technical assistance
  being provided by the World Bank supporting sampling, questionnaire, and survey design. This technical
  assistance includes the improvement of employment measurements, especially with regards to female rural economic

  activity. The following activities are included in this component:

        1. Pilot survey: The pilot survey is an opportunity to test alternative approaches to improve the cost-
             effectiveness and quality of the survey. These include testing of alternative visit lengths, distribution and order
             of modules, and collection methodologies (such as online vs paper recall diaries) since the ENIGH 2018 requires
             multiple visits to each household over the course of a week. In addition, some questions in the questionnaire
             will be tested, including labor questions that may potentially undercount informal female economic activity.
             Finally, the use of tablets rather than paper questionnaires will be tested.
        2.   Training of field staff: Proper training of enumerators and supervisors is integral to a successful survey. The
             trust fund will support costs associated with these trainings.
        3.   Principal consultant: The principal consultant will provide overall logistical and technical support and is
             expected to visit the project team and assess progress at least three times throughout the survey. As with the
             other consultancies supported by this TF, the terms of reference for this consultancy will include reports
             identifying quality and efficiency gains made for the ENIGH 2018, the extent to which these can be replicated in
             other official surveys, and specific suggestions for further enhancements.
        4.   Survey collection and data processing equipment: All surveys collected by INE and the CBH use paper
             questionnaires. However, using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) techniques has been shown to
             increase quality of data collection in a cost-effective manner by increasing monitoring and facilitating
             consistency checks. The ENIGH team has agreed to test the use of CAPI instruments during the pilot to evaluate
             its possible use for the ENIGH. If the authorities decide to use CAPI for the collection of the ENIGH, this TF will
             support the necessary programming and purchase of equipment. If the decision is to use paper questionnaires,
             this TF will support on-field data entry, the development of a data entry program implementing automatic
             checks, and reporting quality statistics to headquarters (when internet access is available) allowing for
             improved monitoring. Since the survey will be collected during repeated visits, on-field data entry will help
             identify inconsistencies that can be addressed by the survey team in already-planned follow-up interviews.
             Previous surveys have relied on on-field visual inspection by a designated team member. The TF will also
             support the purchase of Stata and SPSS licenses for INE to improve data processing of the ENIGH and other
             surveys.
        5.   Data quality supervision and testing: Quality control supervisors will be on the field throughout the period of
             survey collection. The per diem costs associated with this field supervision comprise a significant portion of the
             support provided by this TF. This TF will also support the hiring of a programmer to help the ENIGH team
             develop comprehensive data quality tests, to validate data entry and identify responses that may require
             follow-up investigation. If the ENIGH is collected using CAPI, this consultant will support the codification of the
             survey to CAPI.

  Component 2: Supporting inclusion through measurement [$172,800]

  This trust fund will cover the costs of including in the survey two isolated departments primarily populated by ethnic
  minorities that are excluded from all poverty and CPI measurements: Gracias a Dios, an underdeveloped region
  populated primarily by Indigenous Peoples (IP), and Islas de la Bah√≠a, tourist destination islands populated primarily by
  Afro-Hondurans. Because of the high costs of transportation to these areas and the difficulty of traveling within Gracias
  a Dios, there are no recent representative socioeconomic data for these two regions beyond the 2013 population
  census. While it is cost-prohibitive to survey these departments annually, including them in the ENIGH would provide
  key indicators every five years. In particular, the 2018 ENIGH would allow for analysis on the appropriateness of the CPI
  and official poverty basket methodology (based on the rest of the country) for these regions. This information is

  particularly important for identifying the challenges faced by IP and Afro-Hondurans, groups overrepresented in these
  regions.

  The TF will also support hiring local translators for the inclusion of non-Spanish speaking IP households. It will also
  support consultations with national IP and Afro-Honduran organizations to review the questionnaire and interview
  strategies.

  Component 3: Supporting a culture of data transparency [$47,060]

  To encourage a culture of transparency and accountability, as well as to increase public knowledge about the survey
  and its results, funds will be used to support pre-survey outreach efforts, post-survey analysis, a financial audit of the
  project, and the publication and dissemination of results from this survey. This support will include the development of
  a data transparency and dissemination guideline including components of an SDSS assessment, a dissemination
  timeline and methods to increase access to data, such as anonymization. The TF will support the hiring of an
  international consultant to assist INE and CBH on the data analysis and tabulation of the results from the survey,
  culminating in a training workshop on data analysis and report writing. This component will also support the
  production of metadata and documentation meeting international standards




  SAFEGUARDS


 D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
 analysis (if known)
 This grant will finance several components of this nationally-representative survey, including improving methodologies
 for survey design and data collection. Component 2 supports efforts to include the remote areas of Gracias a Dios and
 Islas de la Bahia within the survey sample. According to the 2013 census, 8.6 of the population is Indigenous (IP) or
 Afro-descendant (Afro). The large majority, or 80 percent, of the Indigenous population live in their traditional lands in
 rural areas whereas it is estimated that 20 percent live in urban areas. The levels of preservation of cultural practices
 and use of traditional languages and governance systems varies among the different IP groups. There are nine ethnic
 groups or peoples that including the following: the Lenca (453,672) that live primarily in the departments of Intibuc√°,
 La Paz, Lempira, Ocotepeque y Santa B√°rbara;the Maya Chort√≠ (population: 33,256) that live in Cop√°n and Ocotopeque;
 the Tolup√°n (population: 19,033) that live in Yoro and Francisco Moraz√°n; the Garifuna (population: 43,111) that live in
 Cort√©s and Gracias a Dios; the Nahua (population: 6,339) that live in Olancho; the Pech (population: 6,024) that live in
 Col√≥n, Olancho and Gracias a Dios; the Tawahka (population: 2,690) that live in Olancho, Col√≥n and Gracias a Dios; the
 Miskito (population: 80,007) that live in Gracias a Dios; and Afro-descendants who speak English (negro de habla
 inglesa) (population: 12,337) that live in Islas de la Bahia, Cort√©s, Atl√°ntida, and Col√≥n. Each Indigenous people or

 group are represented by one or more federations or organizations at local, regional and national levels. Given the
 grant‚Äôs national scope, as well as the targeted efforts to reach Gracias a Dios home to IP population meeting the four
 criteria of OP/BP 4.10, the Project triggers the Indigenous peoples‚Äô policy. Given the lack of socioeconomic information
 for this part of the country, this grant is highly relevant for IP populations as it could serve to improve the reliability and
 visibility of IP and Afro populations in national policy making, public investments, and planning processes. The grant
 will support methodologies critical to reach and effectively collect data from IP and Afro populations, including those
 living in remote areas and with cultural, organizational, and linguistic variances from the non-indigenous Honduran
 population.




 E. Borrower‚Äôs Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
 This is a Statistical Capacity Building project coordinated with the Central Bank of Honduras and National Institute of
 Statistics. Potential environmental impacts are limited due to the scope of activities. The activity to be funded by the
 project are limited to capacity building, data production, and dissemination. It will not fund any civil work that could
 have environmental impacts. In regards to capacity for engaging with and collecting data with IP and Afro
 communities, INE undertook consultations with national organizations representing Honduran IP and AD communities
 in the context of designing and collecting the 2013 population census. The grant will finance technical assistance aimed
 directly at improving the capacity of the Institute to effectively reach and capture the realities of IP and Afro
 communities in its scope of activities. It will do this both through establishing tailored methodologies that are designed
 together with IP and Afro organizations and will be documented in the operations manual, and through partnering
 with IP and Afro organizations to facilitate the local field work of surveyors.
