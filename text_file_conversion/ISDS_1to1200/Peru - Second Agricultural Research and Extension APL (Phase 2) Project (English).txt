B.  Project Objectives  
 
Program Development Objective: 
Increase the productivity and competitiveness of the agricultural 
sector through the adoption of environmentally sound technologies generated and disseminated by a 
private sector-led and decentralized innovation system.   
 
Project Development Objective (Phase II 2005-2008): 
Expand and strengthen the demand-driven rural 
agricultural innovation system that is pluralistic, decentralized, and led by the private sector. 
 
 
C.  Project Description  
 
In the design of the program, consideration was given to supporting a centralized, public system, as in the 
past, or providing all support through the private sector. In line with stakeholder views in Peru, and 
consistent with evolving international experiences, it was decided to support the development of a 
decentralized, and demand-driven system, that would be co-financed by users and private partners. The 
first phase of the project which was concentrated in three regions, and expanded to five, has shown that 
development of an innovation system with these characteristics is feasible in Peru and that there is 
sufficient supply and demand for the types of services being financed by the project.  The proposed 
second phase project would continue to pursue the objective of the program, but expand its scope to all 
regions in Peru, and give greater attention to targeting disadvantaged groups, including indigenous people 
and women.

b. What lending instrument is proposed and why, or what alternative instruments are being considered?
  
The selection of the APL over a specific investment loan (SIL) was made at the initiation of the program 
for several reasons.  First, institutional development of innovation systems, and agricultural R&D itself, 
are long-term processes that require stable support over many years. Institutions require time to develop 
strategies, capacities, and alliances and financing must adapt to institutional needs as they evolve. Second, 
decentralized provision of demand-driven and co-financed services represents a fundamental change in 
Peruvian agricultural technology programs and requires a period of learning and adjustment of program 
strategies as they are developed.  The experience from the first phase has shown that implementation 
strategies and institutional needs do change over time and financing has to be sufficiently flexible to 
respond adequately to these changes. 
 
c. What project components are being considered? Can indicative costs be identified?  
 
The APL phase 2 would finance the following components: 
Component 1. Strengthening the market for innovation services
 The aim of this component is to 
advance the development of a decentralized market for professional services for agricultural innovation.  
This would result in the strengthening of producer organizations as demanders of services, as well as 
improved entrepreneurial capacity of private service providers. This would result in a more efficient 
market for services such as advisory and business services, technical information and training.  Special 
emphasis would be given to the development of instruments that would ensure the adequate participation 
of organized indigenous and women groups and those in disadvantaged regions.  To realize this objective 
the component would finance a Competitive Fund that would co-finance subprojects in adaptive research 
and extension based on a business plan that reflects producer demands.  This component would also co-
finance internships, training workshops, and participatory 
fora
 to support capacity development of service 
providers and producer organizations. 
Component 2
. 
Strengthening the national agricultural research and development system
 The aim of 
this component is to strengthen agricultural research and development in strategic areas of national 
importance.  The component would support centers of excellence in emerging areas of science and 
technology that are critical to increasing competitiveness of the agricultural sector.  This component 
would finance: a) a Competitive Fund for strategic national and international alliances in capacity 
building and research initially in three priority areas: conservation and use of genetic resources, 
biotechnology, and integrated protection of plants and animals, and which would later include natural 
resource management (soils and land management, irrigation and water management, agro-forestry), post-
harvest handling and processing, and sustainable agriculture, and b) regional competitive projects to 
strengthen training and information programs for extension service providers.  
Component 3. Policy formulation for innovation 
The aim of this component is to develop institutional 
capacity to formulate and implement agricultural innovation policy and regulate quality of the innovation 
system.  The activities to be financed would be the following:  a) definition of policies to assist in the 
effective formulation and implementation in critical areas, such as public investment, intellectual property 
rights, genetic resources, and public-private partnerships, b) establishment and maintenance of a database 
of service providers and innovations that would be disseminated publicly, c) identification and scaling up 
of successful innovations to achieve wider impacts, and (d) studies on potential innovations for three new 
strategic areas and incentives for quality enhancement in the innovation system.  
Component 4. Program/Project Implementation 
The aim of this component is to finance the present 
Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which would continue to be the implementing agency for the second 
phase of this Program and contribute to reforming the Peruvian agricultural innovation system. The main 
responsibilities of PIU would be to:  a) implement and monitor the project at the national level, b) be the 
principal contact with the World Bank in project supervision, and c) guide the evolution of PIU as 
outlined in the Policy Letter towards the establishment of a permanent entity that would have 
responsibility for the implementation of public programs in innovation for the agriculture and rural 
sectors.  It is envisaged that the end of the project would institutionalize this unit as a permanent part of 
the Peruvian innovation system.

D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The first phase of the program operated in  five regions of  the country. The second phase will 
expand its activities in all regions of the country. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
The Project Unit successfully 
implemented the first phase of the program and developed the capacity to screen subprojects in 
line with the Safeguard policies of the Bank.
