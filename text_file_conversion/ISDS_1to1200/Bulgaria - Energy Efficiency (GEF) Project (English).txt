A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the proposed project is to support a large increase in energy efficiency 
(EE) investment in Bulgaria through development of a self-sustaining, market-based 
financing mechanism.  The project is focused on the development and implementation of 
financially profitable EE projects, which can provide sustainable and increasing 
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project supports the establishment and operation of the Bulgarian Energy Efficiency Fund (BEEF) in a 
public-private partnership.  BEEF combines both technical project development capacity and financial 
structuring capacity into one entity, thereby addressing the current weak capacity to develop bankable EE 
projects.  It  will be a flexible design, offering financial products demanded by the evolving EE finance 
market.  It is expected that the BEEF would consist of three components: 
 
·
Partial Credit Guarantees: to share in the credit risk of EE finance transactions.  
·
Loan Financing: to co-finance bankable EE projects on a profit-oriented commercial lending basis. 
·
Technical Assistance: to initially finance on a grant basis a portion of EE project development and 
set-up and operating costs of BEEF in the early years. 
Designed as a demand-driven facility, BEEF would make available both loans and partial credit guarantees 
for EE projects.  The Fund Manager of BEEF is expected to make rational choices about the appropriate 
financing tool based on specific project circumstances and overall project portfolio management

considerations. 
 
On May 19, 2004, the GEF Council approved the project for work program inclusion.  
A.4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The subprojects supported by BEEF will be implemented countrywide in Bulgaria.  
Geographic location, information about key environmental and social characteristics of 
the area, and population likely to be affected, proximity to protected areas, etc., will be 
dealt with in the process of environmental assessment of the individual subprojects.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
No significant negative environmental impacts will be caused by the project, which is 
specifically designed to mitigate GHG emissions through energy savings.  Only those 
projects are eligible for BEEF support for which at least half of the financial benefits 
come from measurable energy savings.  Environmental benefits associated with these 
savings will be systematically monitored and reported by BEEF.  Likely subproject 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  3
candidates are: street lighting improvements, installation of heat exchangers and 
automatic temperature control and metering in DH systems, improved thermal insulation 
of buildings, replacement of network pipes, fuel switching, power factor correction, 
reconstruction of boilers, economizers, steam traps and fuel switching.  Typically, the 
subprojects are expected to be relatively small.  With investment costs generally not 
higher than US$1 million, none of them will have any adverse large-scale, significant 
and/or irreversible environmental impacts.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
N/A 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
As described in the Environmental Chapter of the OM, compliance with Bulgarian 
environmental law, policies and procedures will be, in most cases, a necessary and 
sufficient condition for the Bank’s endorsement of financing of subprojects under BEEF.  
The Fund Manager of BEEF will include at least one staff appointed to deal with the EIA 
and environmental management aspects of the subprojects supported by BEEF.  Under 
the environmental chapter of the OM, every subproject proposal should contain a 
questionnaire completed by the developer/sponsor, which allows to determine the 
applicable course of action. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key project stakeholder groups are as follows: (i) SMEs mostly in the industrial and the 
service sector, municipalities and housing cooperatives/associations as potential 
subproject clients (project sponsors); (ii) equipment/materials manufacturers, building 
design and retrofit contractors, ESCOs and EE consultancies as business partners; (iii) 
companies in the financial sector, particularly banks, mortgage and leasing companies as 
co-financiers; and (iv) local environmental and EE advocacy groups and NGOs.   
 
During project preparation, most of these stakeholders were consulted to seek their views 
on the objectives and design of BE
EF and to generate larger public interest in the facility.  
In June 2002, the project concept was presented to the NGO community in a special 
workshop.  Further outreach actions, including an investors’ workshop, are envisaged 
during further stages of project preparation.  Broad-based participation and public 
involvement are incorporated in the project design.  Organized outreach and public 
information campaigns are included in the TA component.  Primarily, the Fund Manager 
will be in charge of these  activities.  In addition, during the EE market assessment 
(funded from the GEF PDF-B project preparation grant), top management and energy 
managers of companies in the industrial, service and municipal sectors as well ESCOs 
will be engaged with the purpose of both information dissemination and initial project 
pipeline development.
