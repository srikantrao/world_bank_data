B. Project Objectives
The development objective of this proposed project is to establish a comprehensive, transparent and
efficient fiscal system.
To achieve this objective the overall approach in this proposed operation would include the following


﻿activities:
a. facilitate formulation, design and implementation of policies, institutional modifications and a
legal framework required to support a modem fiscal system in China with due consideration to
O
U       changing economic structures domestically and internationally;
b. develop a pool of skilled management talent and broaden international knowledge exchange and
dialogue on fiscal issues based on generally accepted international rules to facilitate reform
implementation;
c. develop an integrated and shared management information system (MIS) for the social security
fund management to manage social insurance fund balance sheet and optimize fiscal risk
management associated with social security liabilities.
C. Project Description
Project activities are structured in three interrelated thematic components:
Component 1: Strengthening key elements of China's public finance system: financing consultancies,
supporting policy research, designing analytical tools, implementation support and capacity building
activities in (i) establishing the basic framework of a modem public finance system, (ii) developing a
modem budget management system, (iii) developing a road map for tax policy reforms, (iv)
conforming inter-governmental fiscal relationships, (v) implementing accrual-based financial
reporting, including developing central government and state balance sheets, (vii) formulating
appropriate legal framework for China??s fiscal and tax laws.
Component 2: Fostering Sustainable Development: financing consultancies, undertaking policy
research, designing analytical tools and capacity building activities in (i) facilitating a transition
towards a green growth strategy, (ii) unlocking technological innovation as a driver for growth, (iii)
analyzing medium and long-term economic growth prospects, (iv) creating business climate for small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), (v) China's rights, obligations and development strategies in
the system of global economic governance, (vi) collecting information on bilateral and multilateral
rules on investment, trade, finance, taxation, environmental protection and human development.
Component 3: Strengthening sustainability and fiscal risk management of China's social security
system: financing consultancies, undertaking policy research, designing analytical tools and capacity
building activities related to strengthening fiscal sustainability of China's social system covering
pension insurance system, medical insurance and medical services system, and social assistance
system while prioritized the analysis of the pension insurance system at the beginning. In addition,
the thematic component will support provision of IT hardware and software systems to develop MIS
for the social insurance fund management to improve budget management, information flow and
oversight.
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The proposed project is a fiscal TA project to be implemented by MOF.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The implementation agency for this project is MOF. General speaking, MOF is familiar with Bank's
safeguard policies and requirements. Before this project, there have been series of similar TA
