I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
IDA's proposed Water Sector Restructuring Project, is designed to increase urban water availability,
extend distribution networks (especially to low income consumers) and to assist the sector to establish a
sustainable financial foundation. The proposed IDA Project would also support the introduction of the
private sector into management and operation of the systems under either a management contract and/or
lease arrangement. Key performance indicators for any private sector arrangement would relate to
improvement in the financial self-sufficiency of the sector, improvement in the standard of service to
customers, and increase in service to low-income areas.

I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The Project would have three components, with the vast majority of the funding being used to support civil
works. A brief description of the components follows:

1.       Physical Works. The physical works component includes: (i) new production and transmission
facilities; (ii) rehabilitation of existing production and transmission facilities; and (iii) network (including
meters and house connections) rehabilitation and extension, including extensions to low income and
peri-urban areas.

2.       Restructuring. The restructuring component includes: (i) technical and financial support for the
Ghana Water Company Limited, including assisting it with the monitoring of the private operators and
asset management; and (ii) support for staff retrenchment program.

3.       Institutional Development and Support. This component will: (i) strengthen institutional capacity
of the Ghana Water Company Ltd.; (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Public Utilities
Regulatory Commission (PURC); and (iii) support the MWH.


I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)

The project will be scattered nationwide with a rolling work program. Specific works will deal with water
and will be carried out in urban areas only. The first year work program will include updating existing
assets and extensions.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts are expected. The first year of civil works will
be upgrades or extensions to water transmission and distribution lines in urban areas, largely in or along
existing roads and rights of way, plus some new boreholes and reservoir dredging. Later year civil works will
be the same, plus possible small increases in existing surface water reservoirs. Thus, environmental
safeguards issues will be largely confined to managing construction impacts, and to determining and
minimizing the potential effects of increased water supply on waste water drainage. Social safeguards will be
concerned with compensating land owners/users for construction disturbances, and perhaps some
resettlements.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
None are expected.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
None are expected.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
Alternate routings of water transmission and distribution lines will be considered as and when appropriate.

                                                                                                           ISDS




II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
An Environmental Assessment and Management Plan (EAMP) will be prepared for the first year of civil
works, approved by the Bank and the Ghana EPA, and disclosed prior to project appraisal. EAMPs will be
prepared, approved and disclosed for the civil works programs in subsequent years as they are defined. A
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) will be similarly prepared and disclosed for the overall project, as
well as Resettlement Action Plan(s) (RAPs) as needed for the first year civil works program. Since many
urban water supply systems depend on surface water sources, a Dam Safety Report (DSR) will be
prepared prior to appraisal.


II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The key stakeholders are the Ministry of Works and Housing, the Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL),
and the municipalities and their residents the water supply systems serve and benefit. GWCL is launching a
communications and consultation program on all aspects of the project, including environmental and social
safeguards issues. Safeguards documents (EAMPs, RPF, RAPs, and DSR) will be disclosed according to
Bank policy through the InfoShop, World Bank headquarters, Washington, D.C., and in Ghana, both centrally
and in the municipalities, and provisions will be made within the communications program to receive
stakeholder comments on them.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
