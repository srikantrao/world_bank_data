Project Objectives .  
The project’s objective is to improve accessibility to markets for poor rural producers in selected sub-
regions of the country.  To achieve this, the project will (i) promote productive alliances between different 
economic players at the local level, (ii) empower rural producers through the strengthening of self-managed 
grass-root organizations, (iii) increase access to productive assets and technology, and (iv) promote more 
effective, responsive  and accountable service organizations at the local level. 
 
Key development indicators include: (i) income of rural producers, (ii) income by worked 
day, (iii) # of new employments generated, (iv) volume (quantity and price) traded by 
producer, (v) sale price of product.  
 
The proposed project contributes to the overarching rural poverty reduction objectives of 
the 
Nation’s and bank’s strategic documents.  First, the project reproduces the 
overarching objective of Bolivia’s National Rural Development Strategy (ENDAR), and 
contributes primarily to four of its seven prioritized
policies: (a) market development,  
enhanced productivity and competitiveness, (b) non farm income opportunities, (c) 
improvement of productive infrastructure, and (d) development and employment 
generation for peasants, indigenous groups and women. Second, the project is also 
aligned with the objectives of rural poverty reduction, rural growth and increase in rural 
income of the CAS, by  promoting and supporting opportunities for income generation 
and  improved market access for the poor. Third, the project also reflects the importance 
of addressing regional disparities, as it is based on a spatially differentiated approach 
reflecting regional differences in economic conditions and potential outcomes.

Project Description 
 
The project will finance the following three components: (a) Institutional support, (b) 
Implementation of rural productive alliances, and (c) Project management.  
 
Component 1: Institutional Support. (US 5 mill) 
T
his component will finance technical 
assistance and training to provide the institutional and organizational support needed for the creation of 
productive alliances  at the local level. The component will give a particular focus to the development of 
the institutional capacity of small producers to become partners in new marketing arrangements with the 
private sector. T
he component’s main output will be the formation of rural productive alliances and the 
preparation of viable alliance plans. To realize this objective, the component will (a) support the 
implementation of a project dissemination campaign, (b) support collective action and empower groups of 
rural poor producers (c) support the process of call for proposals, the preparation of pre-feasibility and 
feasibility studies and their evaluation and approval, and (d) assist with the organizational arrangements for 
the formalization of the alliances  
The objective of the dissemination subcomponent is to inform potential stakeholders 
about the scope and rules of the game of the project. It is expected that poor producers, as 
a
result of these activities, would become aware of the opportunities presented by the 
project and apply to it with realistic expectations. The objective of the empowerment 
subcomponent is to enhance the institutional capacity of producers groups to (i) prepare 
alliance plans, (ii) improve their marketing and business skills, and (iii) strengthen their 
negotiating power with other members of the alliance. The mobilization, preparation and 
evaluation subcomponent aims to (i) generate expressions of interest from potential 
productive partnership participants and subsequently screen these by using an agreed set 
of eligibility criteria specified in the Operational Manual, (ii) support the preparation of 
pre-feasibility and/or feasibility studies for the profiles eligible from the previous activity, 
and (iii) facilitate the evaluation of alliance proposals, assisted by external evaluators 
with relevant qualifications and independence to ensure that the allocation of project 
resources is done in an objective manner, and following evaluation pre-agreed evaluation 
criteria, also established in the Operational Manual. As the process of preparation of 
alliance plans is considered a process of learning by doing, the component includes the 
provision of training poor producers in critical areas such as farm management, 
administration and accounting, price calculation, sustainable natural resource 
management, quality control, conflict resolution and others with might be deemed 
necessary. Finally, the objective of the organizational arrangement subcomponent is to 
establish (or fortify) links with partners and potential financiers of the alliance (so that 
they can be implemented successfully) and the promotion of legal recognition for 
producer groups.  
 
Component 2: Implementation of rural productive alliances (US$ 17.5 mill)
 The aim 
of this component is to provide support for the implementation of the rural alliances 
prepared under component 1.  T
he
component’s main outputs are (i) to have producers 
and their marketing partners working together efficiently and effectively in long term 
relations,  (ii) an improved production by the rural poor producers to meet their new 
market requirements,  (iii) adapted systems in the markets to work with the alliances’ 
small 
producers

providers and local governments.  To achieve these outputs, the project will finance, 
through differentiated mechanisms one or more of the potential alliance members
1
.
This 
assistance will be made available for one or more of the following: 
(a) to co-finance the 
implementation of producer
’s subprojects up to storage, 
(b) to facilitate access to cretit  to 
producers for the implementation of subprojects which include transformation and 
processing, (c) to co-finance local governments which decide to become alliance 
members in design and construction of public infrastructure aimed at supporting a local 
alliance in its productive goals, and (d) to provide facilitate access to credit to market 
partners to compensate for the incremental cost and risks to enter into marketing 
arrangements with small rural producers.  
 
The support provided by this component to the rural poor will be managed by the 
beneficiaries themselves and will be for a range of purposes that they themselves 
consider most critical for accessing the new market opportunities provided by the 
alliance. These might include: (i) on farm infrastructure such as minor irrigation canals, 
storage facilities, community centers for product processing and water harvesting 
structures, (ii) soil conservation measures such as terracing, land leveling and watershed 
treatments, (iii) goods such as equipment, tools, machinery, vet supplies, seeds and other 
vegetative material and agriculture inputs, and (iv) services and technical assistance such 
as studies in market and marketing, IT, surveys, laboratory tests, publicity and other 
technical productive services.  
Component 3:  Project Management. (US$ 2.5 mill) 
This component outputs are the 
efficient and effective coordination of the project and a M&E system which can measure 
the improved access to markets by poor producers, and the enhancement in rural 
incomes.  The component will achieve this through the provision of technical assistance, 
goods, equipment incremental operating costs which will support the establishment and 
operation of a Project Coordinating Team in MACA, the setting up and operation of a 
management information system, the implementation of monitoring, evaluation and 
learning arrangements, and the completion of technical studies. The component will also 
ensure that effective fiduciary arrangements are in place during implementation.  
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis:  
The proposed project is a pilot that will operate in three geographical areas (one for each 
major eco-region of the country) : (a) the northern expansion zone of Santa Cruz, (b) the 
Cochabamba valleys, and (c) the area around the Uyuni Salt Lake in Oruro and Potosi. 
Protected areas are not included as part of the project area.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project involves the following safeguard policy issues: 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01).
In accordance with the Category B environmental 
assessment, an Environmental Assessment (EA) report has been  produced and will be 
sent to the World Bank’s InfoShop prior to appraisal.  Copies of the report will also be 
made available to interested members of the public in the national  office in La Paz, and 
at the regional level once the offices are opened.  In addition to the potential impacts on 
forests and other natural habitats, pest management, and cultural property (all discussed 
separately below), the principal environmental issues addressed by the EA report include 
soil conservation, irrigation water management, water pollution (from agro-processing), 
crop genetic diversity, and possible over-exploitation of wild products.  
 
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Forests (OP 4.36)
.
In the Santa Cruz and Cochabamba 
project areas, the expansion of croplands or pastures—possibly induced by the rural 
alliances or other project effects—could result in deforestation (of humid or dry forests).  
In the highlands around the Uyuni Salt Lake, project-induced cropland expansion or 
pasture intensification could convert or degrade 
puna
 grasslands and adjacent wetlands.  
On the other hand, some types of rural alliances (such as eco-tourism and gathering of 
non-timber forest products) could effectively promote natural habitat conservation by 
rural producers. 
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09).
Some project-supported agricultural activities are likely to 
involve pest management and pesticide safety issues, although pesticides will not be 
procured under the project. 
 
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03).
Some rural alliances involving tourism could benefit 
from, and perhaps help protect or restore, important archaeological, historical, or other 
cultural property.  Conversely, poorly-managed tourism could damage fragile sites or 
objects of cultural interest.  Civil works such as roads and irrigation canals could possibly 
uncover significant cultural property. 
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20).
As part of the social assessment for the project, particular 
attention has been paid to the situation of various indigenous groups.  A majority of the 
likely beneficiary population is indigenous, and the project as a whole is therefore being 
designed in compliance both with the existing Operational Directive 4.20 and the draft 
Operational Policy 4.10.  No separate IPDP will be prepared.  This avoids parallelism and 
contributes to better integration of indigenous groups’ needs and concerns in the overall 
project design. . In addition to indigenous groups, studies and consultation processes with 
corresponding project activities or mechanisms for involvement or targeting are also done 
in relation to other groups such as women, non
-
indigenous peasants and producers, 
Page  6
merchants and intermediaries, as well as organized interest groups such as transport 
workers, NGOs, and government agencies.  Gender aspects are being systematically 
considered and addressed, but are not the focus of this summary on safeguard issues.
 
Involuntary Resettlement:  (OP/BP 4.12) 
The project will not finance activities that may lead to physical or 
economic displacement.  This is being incorporated into the project plans and explicitly stated in the 
eligibility criteria for financing of specific activities. Therefore, OP/BP 4.12 is not applicable 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 The project is designed to avoid adverse impacts on local populations and communities, 
In addition, the EA report addresses the expected induced environmental impacts of 
forming productive rural alliances, as well as from civil works such as road 
repairs/upgradation and canals.    
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not relevant 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.   
 
Environment.  
The EA report specifies the measures by which the project would address environmental 
safeguard issues.  These measures include (i) a negative list 
(Lista de Exclusion)
 of
environmentally sensitive investments which would be ineligible for project support, 
including subprojects involving significant deforestation, dams 10 meters or higher, 
reservoirs exceeding 100 hectares, new irrigation command areas exceeding 200 hectares, 
new roads, road improvements in forested and protected areas, etc.; (ii) subproject 
eligibility and prioritization criteria which favor environmentally benign or positive 
activities; (iii) environmental screening checklist; (v) environmental management 
recommendations by sub-sector; (vi) Environmental Mitigation Plan (when needed); (vii) 
detailed environmental management procedures for subprojects (including specific 
institutional responsibilities); (vii) environmental supervision, monitoring, and evaluation 
procedures, along with recommended indicators; (viii) management plans for non-timber 
forest products and other biological resources (to help prevent depletion or degradation); 
and (ix) a Pest Management Plan which promotes integrated pest management and 
restricts which substances could be financed or promoted under the project, consistent 
with the requirements of OP 4.09.  
 
Social.   
A
social assessment has been produced . The assessment identifies the measures through 
which the design of the project is avoiding adverse impacts on the local population.  
These include (i) the completion of a detailed stakeholder analysis identifying vulnerable 
groups, their particular interests and stake in the project,. (ii) a detailed consultation phase 
to ensure that project design reflects the priorities and views of potential beneficiaries, 
(iii) an identification of potential social risks and preparation of a risk mitigation plan, to 
ensure that mitigation measures have been incorporated in the design . [The social risks 
identified in the assessment include the poor capacity on business and management of the 
producers, local confli
cts among groups, lack of internal governance rules in producer 
Page  7
groups and conflicts due to insufficient transparency in financial transactions]. (iv) 
subproject eligibility and prioritization criteria which favors assistance to particularly 
vulnerable and poor groups, and (vi) social supervision, monitoring and evaluation 
procedures ( a set of quantitative and qualitative social indicators have been developed to 
include in the project’s M&E system).   
 
The project is unable and unlikely to directly benefit the absolute poorest or most 
vulnerable. Instead, other projects will complement this effort with activities more 
appropriate for the poorest.  
 
Borrower’s capacity. 
The Borrower’s capacity to address environmental and social 
issues appears to be adequate, in terms of the written criteria and procedures in the EA 
report  and Social Assessment .  The  project operational manual includes the necessary 
arrangements for staffing, consultants, and training to enhance MACA and collaborating 
entities’ capacities to perform their functions adequately in accordance with the 
environmental and social criteria and procedures established. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Extensive stakeholder consultation took place during project preparation, and will 
continue through implementation. Particularly vulnerable groups, such as women and 
indigenous people, were specifically targeted.   This included six consultation workshops 
held in all the three regions (Salar de Uyuni, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba/Coroico) , 
which comprised two stages: (i) three workshops focused on discussing the project 
concept, its development objectives and eliciting suggestions, and (ii)  three other 
workshops were held to present the proposed project components and discuss how best to 
implement and develop partnerships, as well as potential risks and how to avoid or 
mitigate them. A comprehensive set of recommendations was gathered from 
stakeholders’ feedback (detailed information is in the Social Assessment Annex of the 
PAD).   Workshops were conducted in Spanish and local languages. These were held 
between December 2004 and January 2005 and a total of 198 participants were consulted. 
A
set of baseline studies done through structured interview questionnaires collected and 
analyzed socio-economic data as an input to the social and environmental assessments.  
In addition, secondary sources and existing studies, project reports etc. are being 
reviewed to ensure appropriate design and targeting in terms of indigenous groups’ needs 
and priorities, and mitigation of environmental impacts.  Finally,  project consultations 
are coordinated with the national process related to Bolivia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy, 
in particular the “Dialogo Nacional Bolivia Productiva”. 
 
The following documentation will be disclosed to the InfoShop and within Bolivia at 
appraisal stage: the EA, the Pest Management Plan, and a summary of the social 
assessment, including aspects related to indigenous groups.
