B.  Project Objectives 
The development objective for the project is:  to improve public confidence in tenure security, 
and lower transaction costs by 
building more effective land registration and cadastre systems in 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, contributing to the development of efficient real 
property markets.  The focus of the project will be on establishing the real estate cadastre (REC) 
ac
ross the territory of FYR Macedonia in an accelerated timeframe in order to clarify ownership 
and promote tenure security.  The project would also seek to improve the processes and 
procedures of the State Authority for Geodetic Works (SAGW) to provide effi
cient registration 
services through the establishment, implementation and monitoring of minimum service 
standards of property registration transactions.  Business process improvement, records 
management, automation and IT will all contribute to improved se
rvice delivery and legal 
security for all property owners.  Other beneficiaries would be real estate professionals, notaries, 
lawyers, surveyors, bankers and others involved in the property market. The project will also 
improve transparency and accountabil
ity in real estate cadastre.

C.  Project Description 
The proposed project includes five possible components:
a)
Establishing the REC
    This component would support SAGW in completing the REC 
throughout the territory of FYR Macedonia.  
b)
Operational Deve
lopment and Support
This component would support the on
-
going 
operations of the REC and registration functions of SAGW and the delivery of quality 
services to all constituencies.  It would modernize the REC system, focusing on improving 
the ongoing real
 property registration system with quality customer service. 
c)
Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening
   This component would provide 
institutional development and capacity building to SAGW and other relevant 
groups/institutions.  
d)
Development of 
Land Policy and Regulatory Framework
  This component will assist the 
government to undertake policy analysis and studies in land policy issues related to land 
administration and management which are affecting the implementation of the project and 
the devel
opment of efficient land markets. 
e)
Agricultural Land Use Monitoring
    This component, to be managed by Ministry of 
Agriculture (MOA), would develop a system for agricultural land use monitoring using 
available cadastre and other data 
-
 including data from
 SAGW 
-
 that could be further 
enhanced as FYR Macedonia moves toward EU accession.
D.  Project location (if known)
As the goal of the project is to complete the real estate cadastre across the country, it is expected 
that the project will cover selected
 urban and rural areas throughout FYR Macedonia.  However, 
there may be areas of priority that will be the focus of the project support and this will be 
determined during preparation.
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
The proj
ect will be implemented through the State Authority for Geodetic Works (SAGW) the 
main cadastre and registration agency.  It is clear that SAGW has little capacity for safeguards, 
however both the PHRD funds for project preparation and the proposed SIDA fu
nding for 
training of SAGW staff should help to mitigate this low institutional capacity.

Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01)
Though most of ECA land administration projects have historically been rated as 
category C and no environmental impact assessment was required, a brief 
Page  3
environmental assessment will be done 
under the preparation PHRD grant. The 
principle environmentally issue would be associated with the  potential 
construction of small office buildings. This will be assessed during project 
preparation and would be discussed during the QER.

UARD PREPARATION PLAN
A.
Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD

stage ISDS 
would be prepared.   The target date for the QER is September/October 2004.
B.
For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for 
preparing the PAD

ISDS.
C.
Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard

related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing

The limited environmental assessment will be prepar
ed as part of the overall project preparation 
and should be completed by October 2004.  As part of the EA, standard environmental 
guidelines will be prepared on how to address and mitigate the potential negative impacts and 
disturbance associated with the 
project activities (refurbishment/renovation of buildings).  
A social assessment and customer survey will be performed under the preparation PHRD grant to 
determine both benefits to and unintended consequences of the project, particularly in light of the
difficult ethnic balance maintained in FYR Macedonia.
