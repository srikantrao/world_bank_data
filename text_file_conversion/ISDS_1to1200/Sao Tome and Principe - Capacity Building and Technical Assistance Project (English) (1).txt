B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The two main development objectives of the proposed project are:  (i)  to strengthen economic 
(financial and budgetary ) management and build up institutional and legal infrastructure in key 
sectors (such as natural resources and environment, finance and judiciary) to cope with a more 
complex economic and social environment arising from the onset of petroleum era and the 
nascent market economy (ii) to strengthen the corresponding human capacity of the civil service 
to improve the efficient management of public resources.   
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project is  a three year technical assistance credit (TAC).  It will  support the 
Government technical assistance and capacity building needs.   Without the support of such a 
project, progress by the authorities in better managing public resources, and the expected 
progress in economic modernization would be constrained.   
 
The Government of São Tomé and Príncipe will use this proposed credit to secure continued 
technical assistance in two or three focused priorities, including:

(i) 
public finance management (commitment control, cash control, accounting, and 
procurement)  as a precursor to preparing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework 
(MTEF); 
 
(ii) 
petroleum sector:  to create a legal, regulatory and policy framework for the 
petroleum sector- including a sectoral strategy and a framework for a Fund for the 
Future- and develop institutional and human capacity for policy analysis and 
supervision. This institutional and capacity building effort will include a component 
addressing sectoral environmental issues, their supervision and regulation. This effort 
will be coordinated with the UNDP.    
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
São Tomé and Príncipe . No specific location is identified.   
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies   
 
The borrower’s general institutional capacity is weak.  This includes capacity related to 
Safeguard Policies.

Safeguard policies do not apply as this a TA credit.  Although the petroleum exploration 
activities will not take place before 2008 and then in deep offshore blocs, the proposed project 
includes a component to ensure that the Government is sensitive to possible environmental issues 
related to petroleum operations.   Recommendations will be included in the policy dialogue with 
the Government; TA will be provided for environmental assessment,  regulation and supervision 
capacity building and monitored during the implementation period.  Within the Petroleum 
Agency structure to be created, it is suggested that the Technical Branch monitor sector specific 
protection of the bio-diversity and environmental resources of the country.  This will need to be 
further discussed during the pre-appraisal mission.  We will coordinate with UNDP to ensure 
appropriate coverage of issues in this sector.   
 
III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

would be prepared.   
 
Early February 2004 (during the week of  02/05/04 to 02/12/04).  
 
B. 
For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage 
ISDS
 
 
C.  Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.  
The specific studies and their timing
