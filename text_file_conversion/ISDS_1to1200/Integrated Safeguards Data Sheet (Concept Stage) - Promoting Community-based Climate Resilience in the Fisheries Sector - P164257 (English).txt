                           C. Project Description
                                1. Component 1: Strengthening the Fisheries Policy and Regulatory Framework (PPCR financing of US$0.573
                                   million). Declining performance of the fisheries sector is directly related to its vulnerability to climate change
                                   impacts coupled with anthropogenic threats such as overfishing and pollution. One effective way to build
                                   resilience to climate change in this sector is to strengthen and improve the overall health of marine and coastal
                                   ecosystems. This component would support strengthening the enabling environment and measures to
                                   promote sustainable fisheries and aquaculture management. Specifically, this component would support (1.1)
                                   developing the policy and regulatory framework for climate resilient fisheries and aquaculture management,
                                   including developing a strategy and action for the draft national Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy, developing
                                   protocol and guidelines for the fisheries and aquaculture productions to incorporate climate considerations,
                                   and drafting regulations for community-led fisheries management including monitoring, control, and
                                   surveillance (MCS); and (1.2) strengthening the community-led fisheries management framework, including
                                   establishing partnerships with community-based organizations for sustainable fisheries management and MCS,

                                   developing the management plans to this effect including water quality monitoring, and providing training and
                                   equipment for MCS.
                                2. Component 2: Diversification and Fisheries-based Alternative Livelihoods (PPCR financing of US$2.68 million).
                                   Given declining wild fish stocks due to anthropogenic and climate impacts and the rising demand for fish and
                                   fish products on the domestic and global markets, aquaculture, coastal mariculture/polyculture, and offshore
                                   pelagic fisheries have potential business opportunities that can be harnessed to meet those demands.
                                   Aquaculture and coastal mariculture/polyculture, in particular, are a means of reducing dependency on wild
                                   fish stocks and, hence, reducing their vulnerabilities to climate impacts. This component would support (2.1)
                                   promoting freshwater aquaculture and coastal mari-culture/poly-culture among fishing communities, including
                                   developing a demonstration aquaculture farm; developing climate-smart aquaculture sub-projects for new and
                                   existing fish farmers; developing a demonstration coastal mariculture/polyculture operation; developing
                                   climate-smart mari-culture/poly-culture and alternative livelihoods sub-projects; and refurbishing and
                                   upgrading the existing seed stock production and expanding local feed production; (2.2) exploring artisanal
                                   longline fishing[1] for offshore pelagics as fisheries-based alternative livelihood opportunity. This would include
                                   conducting a baseline stock assessment; developing the sustainable management strategy; and providing skill-
                                   based training and equipment.
                                3. Component 3: Capacity Building and Awareness Raising (PPCR financing of US$0.97 million). This component
                                   would support capacity building and awareness raising of the community-based organizations, fishery
                                   industries, and the relevant government personnel to promote climate considerations in fisheries and
                                   alternative livelihoods. The proposed activities include (3.1) expanding the knowledge base on climate change
                                   impacts on the fisheries sector to give stakeholders the information and skills needed to advance climate-smart
                                   livelihood activities, such as a targeted socio-economic assessment including gender and youth dynamics in the
                                   fisheries sector; climate projection for inland aquaculture, coastal mari-culture/poly-culture, and pelagics
                                   fisheries; and agro-meteorological information services for inland aquaculture and coastal mari-culture/poly-
                                   culture operations; (3.2) awareness building and behavior change, including a Knowledge Attitudes and
                                   Perceptions assessment, and development and implementation of a behavior change strategy; and (3.3)
                                   Capacity building and knowledge sharing for fisheries organizations and the Fisheries Division, including
                                   support for the formalization of selected informal community-based organizations and strengthening of
                                   existing community-based organizations; building capacity in technical skills and business management;
                                   implementing targeted community-to-community learning and knowledge exchange; developing the Fisheries
                                   Information Management System at the Fisheries Division; and strengthening capacity of the Fisheries Division

                                    million). The Project would fulfill the monitoring and reporting requirements of the World Bank, as well as the
                                    PPCR in coordination with the PIOJ which acts as the PPCR Country Focal Point. The M&E would also
                                    incorporate targeted knowledge management activities aimed at capturing and sharing overall lessons within
                                    Jamaica and across countries under the PPCR Caribbean regional track. This component would support (4.1)

                           SAFEGUARDS


                          D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                          analysis (if known)
                          The Project activities will be country-wide, including inland areas for aquaculture (e.g. Spanish Town west of Kingston
                          where existing facilities are located) as well as coastal areas for a variety of subprojects in and near fishing
                          communities. Upgrades to existing inland aquaculture facilities near Spanish Town will include improvements to
                          prevent river flooding. Changes in facility design will be evaluated to ensure sound environmental management of
                          wastewater discharges, to optimize water sourcing, to minimize potential release of cultured species, and to build in
                          the best international environmental management practices for aquaculture projects. Coastal projects may affect a
                          variety of environments and communities, including some with major tourist developments, sensitive environments,
                          and protected areas near the shoreline. There are several Marine Parks in Jamaican waters and along the north coast
                          (near Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and Port Antonio) and the west coast (at Negril), and projects on the south coast may
                          affect the Protected Areas of Portland Bight or the Palisadoes. Specific areas for intervention will be prioritized during
                          project preparation, and may include Portland Cottage and Alligator Pond on the south coast for aquaculture,
                          mariculture, or polyculture activities. Community-based monitoring, compliance, and surveillance (MCS) of reef-related
                          fisheries may yield associated benefits of ecosystem restoration and preservation of high biodiversity critical natural
                          habitats, as well as enhanced function of ecosystem services such as coastal erosion protection and tourism value.
                          Small patch reefs and seagrass meadows occur along many of the islandâ€™s coastlines and support local fishing activity,
                          and efforts will be explored to integrate the conservation of reefs and seagrass in concert with the project, to generate
                          additional project environmental benefits. An Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) has been
                          prepared to guide the evaluation and screening of ecologic and economic aspects of projects in reefs and coastal areas,
                          the challenges of species selection and control of invasives, the feasibility of artisanal long-line fishing improvements,

                          The Recipient has developed an ESMF and will include it in the Operations Manual to address the safeguards issues.
                          The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Agriculture and Fisheries (MICAF) has not implemented Bank-supported projects.
                          However, the Planning Institute of Jamaica (PIOJ) will be closely working with the MICAF to develop, disclose and
                          implement the instruments. The PIOJ has direct recent experience with development of ESMFs for another PPCR
                          project (Climate Data and Information Management Project) as well as other World Bank projects, and understands
