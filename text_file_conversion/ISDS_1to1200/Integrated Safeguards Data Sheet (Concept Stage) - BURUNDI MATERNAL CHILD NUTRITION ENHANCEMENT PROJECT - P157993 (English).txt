                           The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to nutrition services among selected
                           persons in Gihofi and Makamba, in the southern region of Burundi.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will promote improved nutrition through increased year-round production and
                           consumption of micronutrient-rich foods among smallholder households and increased utilization of
                           community-based nutrition services in project areas targeted to children 0-23 months of age and their
                           mothers or caregivers. Two Lead Mothers (LMs) will be selected from each village and trained with
                           Agriculture Extentionistas for each hill within the selected health districts. The LMs will lead Mother
                           Support Groups (MSGs), which will act as centers for LM-managed kitchen garden demonstration
                           sites and high iron bean multiplication sites to promote improved practices in production, harvest and
                           post-harvest management, and marketing. MSGs will also act as distribution points for packages of
                           agriculture inputs to mothers with children 0-23 months of age. To build community demand for
                           micronutrient-rich foods, strengthened community health workers will deliver community-based
                           nutrition promotion activities, including growth monitoring and promotion for 0-23 month old
                           children and malnourished children will be referred to Positive Deviance/Hearth (PDH) to be

                           rehabilitated. In the targeted districts, the project will strengthen the technical skills of the relevant
                           line ministry extension and outreach services, including the Ministere de l'agriculture et de l'elevage
                           (MINAGRIE) and Ministere de la Sante Publique et de la Lutte contre le SIDA (MSPLS), to support
                           the community-based agriculture, health and nutrition activities. The project will also support an
                           impact evaluation and knowledge translation, and will enhance capacity for advocacy to scale up
                           effective interventions to reach vulnerable children under-two and caregivers of children 0-23
                           months of age.
