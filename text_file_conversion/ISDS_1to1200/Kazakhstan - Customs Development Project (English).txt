B. Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN]
The development objective of the proposed project is to reform and modernize the Customs
administration of Kazakhstan, with a view to: (i) promote internationally acceptable practices for
processing of international trade flows by Customs, (ii) improve revenue collection, (iii) and
reduce potential for corruption. The project will facilitate Kazakhstan's accession to the World
Trade Organization.

C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]
The proposed project would be executed under overall oversight by a steering committee
comprising representatives of Customs, other public sector stakeholders, and private sector
representatives of both local and international business communities; and a dedicated
coordination unit provided by the Project Management component reporting directly to the
chairman of the Customs Control Committee (CCC). The Project would consist of four basic
components, the implementation of which would be possibly managed by different units of the
CCC.
  1.    An Institutional Development component that would deal with inter-agency arrangements
(interaction between Customs and other agencies involved in external trade control to avoid
duplication and overlap), management and organization issues, attempt to fine-tune the
headquarters and field organizations to match new operational requirements, develop further the
legal and regulatory framework, improve human resource management and training, develop a
strong focus on integrity, and include any policy related matters that might require attention;
  2.    An Operational Development component that would attempt to improve the processing
and clearance of cargo, facilitate trade, and improve enforcement activities. It would include
piloting of innovative approaches to Customs operations and later deploy these approaches to
priority areas of the country or countrywide depending on the Governmentâ€™s views on
project scope and timing;
  3.    An IT and Infrastructure Development component that would attempt to provide the
application systems, computer, telecommunications, and other technological infrastructure
necessary to create an efficient and effective environment for Customs operations and
management; and
  4.    A Project Management component that would manage the overall change that would take
place in the Customs Administration, ensure the timely and efficient allocation of resources,
carry out procurement and financial management activities of the project, and interact with all
local and international entities involved in project execution.

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
   would be prepared: N/A

B. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage
   ISDS: 08/15/2006

C. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timing1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS.
   The project will not have any civil works or land acquisition, only minor refurbishment of
   rooms for IT connections to support information technology. Should any additional needs be
   identified during project preparation the project team will contact the safeguards team for
   possible reclassification.
