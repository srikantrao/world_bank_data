A.2. Project Objectives

The objective of the project is to support municipal development in a sustainable manner.
To this end the project will:

    ·   support the development of municipal infrastructure to provide quality local
        services.

        The results indicator for the provision of quality service will depend on the findings of the
        feasibility studies and will be submitted as part of the sub-project package for Bank's approval for
        financing. The indicators will indicate the benefit of the project such as: reduction in water losses,
        increased volume of wastewater treated, increased water and sewerage connections etc.; and

    ·   support the institutional strengthening of Iller Bank (IB), which is a source of
        financing for municipalities.

The results indicator on the institutional strengthening of IB will be the progress made in
implementing the Action Plan. A strengthened IB will provide the opportunity for

Turkey to provide good quality municipal services.

A.3. Project Description

The project will have the following three components:

Component 1: Iller Bank Institutional Strengthening - Eligible expenditures under
this category will include technical assistance to Iller Bank to: (i) implement the Iller
Bank Strategy; and (ii) implement the Action Plan under the project. The expenditures
will be financed by IB's own resources and the Bank loan.

Component 2: Municipal Development - Eligible expenditures under this category
would be for: (a) the water, wastewater, and solid waste sectors. This will also include
co-financing of projects to be financed by the EU; and (b) public priority investments,
requested by State Planning Organization or Treasury. The expenditures will be financed
through sub-loan proceeds from IB to the municipalities and municipal resources.

Component 3: Technical Assistance - Eligible expenditures under this category will be
for municipalities for the following purposes: (a) feasibility studies; (b) urban planning;
(c) preparation of design and bidding documents; (d) water/wastewater utility
improvements related to institutional, technical and financial matters. This could include
water leak detection and reduction techniques and other efficiency improvement
programs. All sub-projects will have a institutional component; and (e) construction
supervision. The expenditures will be financed through sub-loan proceeds from IB to the
municipalities and municipal resources.

A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis:

A pipeline of investments is currently being developed through a PHRD grant and municipal own
resources. Potential projects are mentioned below. It is possible that other projects may be included during
the implementation phase of this project. Some of the key activities related to the development of the
project pipeline are:


-   IB has signed Memorandum of Understandings (MoU) with 16 municipalities
    through which an agreement has been reached that the PHRD grant will finance rapid
    feasibility studies that will help define the investment program (the list is shown
    below; and a map is attached to the document). The locations are shown in the
    attached map.
-   Ten municipalities around the Bodrum area have shown an interest to be included in
    the project and have started a common feasibility study. Other municipalities ­ like
    Izmit - have approached IB to use the loan funds to prepare feasibility studies.
-   The EU is preparing 6 municipal projects for financing under its Heavy Investment
    Program. Project preparation has not yet completed and the financing plan for these
    projects is expected to be in place by May 2005. The Bank loan will be a potential
    source of financing, along with the EU grants. The potential investments will be for
    the water and wastewater sectors.

Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The project will trigger the Bank's polices on Environmental Assessment and Involuntary
Resettlement (land acquisition only since the project will not support investments that
require resettlement). To this end, an Environmental Framework Agreement and a Land
Acquisition Framework Agreement have been prepared which will be implemented by IB.
These agreements are currently being discussed with project stakeholders and once the
public consultation is over, IB will authorize the Bank to send these agreements to the
Infoshop and also publish the frameworks in its web-site. This will be done prior to
Project Appraisal, scheduled for December 15, 2004.

D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area.

There are no long term negative impacts expected due to the project.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

Not applicable
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

The Borrower has prepared the Environmental Framework Agreement and Land
Acquisition Framework Agreement to address safeguard concerns. The Borrower has
adequate capacity to implement these frameworks.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Iller Bank has sought comments from the various municipalities on the two frameworks.
The municipalities were also requested to seek views from local Non-Governmental
Organizations. Iller Bank will meet with stakeholders in Ankara to seek feedback on the
framework agreements ­ related authorities and Non-Governmental Organizations. In
addition, Iller Bank will set up the framework agreements in its web-site, seeking
comments. The public consultation is expected to be over by December 1. 2004.
