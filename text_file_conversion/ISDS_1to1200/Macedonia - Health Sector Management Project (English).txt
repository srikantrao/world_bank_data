A.2. Project Objectives 
The objectives of this project are: (i) to improve the efficiency and governance of health services delivery, 
(ii) improve the efficiency and targeting of health insurance, including improved administration of benefits; 
and (iii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the MOH (policy formulation and implementation, budget 
formulation) and HIF (financial management, contracting). 
 
A.3. Project Description 
Component 1: Policy Development and Strengthening Implementation (US$1.35 million) 
This component will assist the MOH in implementing critical functions such as policy formulation, 
evaluation of health reform nad public information and communication.  The component includes three 
sub-components: (i) support to overall health policy and strategy development, (ii) public relations and 
communications, and (iii) improving MOH management and business processes. 
 
Component 2: Strengthening HIF Governance and Management (US$2.30 million) 
This component aims to improve the governance and management of the HIF, as the organization 
responsible for purchasing health care services for its beneficiaries under the compulsory health insurance 
scheme.  The component includes three sub-components: (i) eligibility criteria and revenue collection, (ii) 
HIF management, and (iii) purchasing functions. 
 
Component 3: Improving Service Delivery (US$6.95 million) 
This component would improve the quality and efficiency of health care providers by supporting 
development of staff skills, introduction of new management methods and instruments and essential 
upgrades of units selected to implement well defined sub-projects.  The component has two sub-
components: (i) Hospital Management and Primary Care, and (ii) Grant Facility for Improving Service 
Quality and Efficiency. 
 
Component 4: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$0.70 million) 
This component would ensure effective administration and implementation of the project by supporting the 
operation of a Project Implementation Network (PIN) which would be responsible for all the day-to-day 
project implementation activities on behalf of the MOH and HIF.  This component would also support in 
part the operation of a separate Project Implementation Unit (PIU) housed within the Ministry of Finance 
(MOF) which would provide procurement, disbursement and accounting functions for the project.
