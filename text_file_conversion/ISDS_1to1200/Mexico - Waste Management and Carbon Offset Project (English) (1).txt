I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):
    The project development objective is to reduce the greenhouse impact of the methane released during
    land-filling of solid waste in Mexico either through its capture and use as a fuel for power generation
    or through its flaring. The project is expected to displace an estimated 4 million metric tons of carbon
    dioxide equivalent (mtCO2e) up to 2012. The project will support a voluntary offset program for the
    C02 from combustion, through forest plantations using native species in protected, yet denuded areas,
    using local labor. This will contribute to generate local employment and to the restoration of soil
    cover. The project will also support a local social program at each site, designed to address priority
    welfare issues of local communities.


Components:

      a) Renewable energy production: The project would support the development of about 6 landfill
      gas facilities, primarily for the generation of electricity, with a combined rated capacity of about 20
      Mw. The process of renewable energy production consists in extracting the landfill gas methane from
      the landfills using pipes and vacuum pumps. The landfill gas is forced into gas cleaning devices and
      burned in gas engines that use the chemical energy of the landfill gas (methane) to move a generator.
      The electricity is transformed to the grid voltage and transmitted to the final users. The 6 plants are
      expected to be in operation by 2005 (3), 2006 (2) and 2008 (1). Financial sSupport will be provided
      through the purchase of ghg emission credits.

      b) Environment program. The environmental program is designed to offset the C02 from the
      oxidation of CH4 in the renewable energy production. It consists of activities that support habitat
      restoration using native species in protected and buffer zones. These activities will be developed in
      consultation with local communities "ejidatarios" (e.g., reforestation, organic and conservation
      agriculture) targeted to improve environmental management in the target areas.

      c) Social program. The social program includes specific activities attending social welfare priorities
      for local communities, such as health programs, neighborhoods improvements, etc. (the details of the
      social program will be developed as part of project appraisal). The social program will be supported

      with 10% of the net revenues from the sale of GHG reductions.




I.A.3. Project Description (From PDS):
The project uses landfill gas as fuel for power generation. It , basically consists of an extraction and
collection system using wells connected to vacuum pumps and the power units. The biogas landfill gas
serves as combustible to operate the engines that move the generators and produce the electricity.This
process will serve as a elimination media of the actual biogas uncontrollable emissions in the sanitary
landfill, at the same time the using response to the alternative ways to produce energy and utilize the solid
waste as a renewal energy source
This process will eliminate uncontrolled emissions of landfill gas, as well as; it represents an alternative to
produce energy and utilize solid waste as a renewal energy source. Landfill gas is created during the
anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in the waste. It is a mix of methane (CH4), carbon dioxide
(CO2) and nitrogen (N2). Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 21 times
that of CO2.
With a calorific value of approximately 5 kWh/Nm³, landfill gas also constitutes a valuable fuel and can
therefore be used for the generation of energy.




Technology: The process includes the following steps:
·        The gas is extracted and collected from the landfill via gas wells, located through a modeling
process and vacuum pumps.
·        The gas goes through a cleaning process that dewaters the gas via cooling and filters the gas to
guarantee a clean gas phase. There are three independent cleaning systems.
·        The clean gas is sent either to internal combustion gas engines (Jenbacher-GE), rated at 1.06 MW
or alternatively to flares rated to burn maximum estimated gas production.
·        The gas engines are fitted with air and water coolants designed to operate at the maximum ambient
summer temperature in Monterrey and are auto-regulated.
·        The electricity is generated at 480 volts and 60 Hz. A triphasic transformer station takes the
potential to 34,500 volts, for delivery to the transmission line.
·        A remote station provides information on power on line, voltage delivered and frequency to CFE,
according to regulations.
An on line sensor delivers information of methane burned, equivalent CO2 abated and electricity generated
to the plant site.

 Location of the Project. The projects are located in 6 different cities in the following states: Baja
California, Nuevo León, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Coahuila, Guanajuato. The cities are large a medium size and
meet basic conditions for methane capture and use at their sites. Some have problems with the air quality,
based in the impact of the transport, economic activities and landfill gas emissions. The municipal
authorities are willing partners in these projects. Possible social impacts will be identified during
preparation and addressed through the proposed social program.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
        This project will invest in six large-scale LFG capture plant at sites of existing secure landfills.
        The net environmental impacts are expected to be positive, since methane gas will be captured and
        utilized as a renewable energy source, displacing fossil fuels form the energy mix of the power
        sector.

        Some negative impacts are expected during construction of the plants (access road construction,
        increased traffic, disposal of construction materials, noise, etc.), but these will be mitigated by
        good construction practices; these practices were already in place during the construction of the
        Monterrey Plant (A GEF-supported project, and have been successfully tested) .

        Noise: As the proposed sites of the plants are not adjacent to neighbors, noise from the engines is
        expected to be only an occupational safety problem for the workers at the plant. To mitigate effects
        of noise on employees will be required to use proper ear protection and the engine house will be
        located away form neighbors and constructed to reduce noise outside the building.

        En environmental management plan will be in place prior to start up of the units. This plan will
        use the successful experience and lessons learned from the Monterrey Plant and will cover at least
        the following topics: Monitoring of emissions from power plant; disposal of engine waste oil,
        landfill gas condensate; monitoring of groundwater, disposal and recycling of spent engine coolant,
        methane migration, occupational health and safety issues. An annual environmental summary will
        be available for each plant on the implementation of the plan. Corrective actions would be tracked
        on an annual basis.

         Natural Habitats. The project will not intersect either natural parks, fauna and flora sanctuaries,
         civil forest sanctuaries or sensitive zones, as the areas proposed for the plants are not vegetated. In
         its environmental program the project will support habitat restoration using native species in
         protected and buffer zones.

         Resettlement: The project won't imply any resettlement.

         A social framework for the adoption of the social plans at each location will be developed in
         consultation with the local communities and adopted prior to start up of construction.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.
     None anticipated

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
     No adverse impacts are expected as a direct consequence of the project. On the other hand,
     the project does support an social and environmental program benefiting the local
     communities and the global environment on a long term basis.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
     The long term positive impact will be enhanced through the implementation of the social and
         environmental programs.

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
     Compliance with the provisions of the EIA and EMP will be reviewed as part of the
     monitoring and validation protocol.
     SEISA will manage directly the implementation of the social and environmental programs.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
     A public consultation will be undertaken at each site prior to start up of construction.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
          management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
          technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
          projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
          issues.
