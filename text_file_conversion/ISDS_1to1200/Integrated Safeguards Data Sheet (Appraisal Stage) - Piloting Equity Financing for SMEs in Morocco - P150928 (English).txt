                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              This project is categorized as financial intermediary (FI) under the World Bank➢❨ s Involuntary

                              Resettlement policy OP 4.12 and the World Bank➢❨ s Indigenous Peoples policy OP 4.01. The
                              World Bank financed loan will be channeled through the CCG, an intermediary institution for
                              providing equities to selected SMEs. The project is expected to mainly finance small enterprises in
                              the services or technology sphere that will have limited environmental or social risks associated
                              with them. The assessment indicates that the activities financed by the project will not involve any
                              works that would require land acquisition. No indigenous peoples are likely to be present in, or
                              have collective attachment to, areas where the project activities are located. A resettlement or an
                              indigenous people➢❨ s framework is not required. An Environmental and Social Management
                              Framework (ESMF) that provides a list of ineligible sub-activities, a screening mechanism, and
                              monitoring and reporting system has been prepared and will be included in the project OM to
                              handle potential environmental and social risks. The CCG and all Project Financial Intermediaries
                              (PFIs) will be responsible for screening investments in angel/seed and early-stage/VC companies
                              through their own environmental and social screening and management system and report to the
                              CCG in accordance with the project ESMF. The screening will ensure activities funded will not
                              involve involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples.

                             This project is classified under the category ➢❨ financial intermediary➢❨ in accordance with the
                             World Bank➢❨ s Operational Policy OP 4.01. The activities do not involve pure real estate and
                             construction (establishment of offices and purchase of construction plant and equipment).
                             However, it is recognized that there may be some business activities in which the environmental


                                                                        Page 4 of 7
                           and social risks and impacts may be triggered (although the scale will be limited due to the size of
                           the SMEs) and require assessment and management, for example, labor and working standards,
                           inappropriate disposal of wastes, or unhealthy or hazardous working conditions in some

                           government priority sectors that might receive investments, such as automotive, aerospace, food,
                           textiles, pharmaceuticals, and business processing. The PFIs and the CCG are exposed to some
                           level of environmental and social risk through the activities of their investees; therefore, an ESMF
                           that provides a list of ineligible sub-activities, a screening mechanism, and monitoring and
                           reporting system has been prepared and will be included in the project OM to handle potential
                           environmental and social risks. The OM should be adopted by the CCG before effectiveness of the
                           proposed loan.

                           In addition, the following environmental safeguards policies are triggered: OP 4.04 - Natural
                           Habitats, and OP 4.36 - Forests. Since sub-activities (investments in SMEs) are not known, the
                           screening process described in the ESMF will identify potential risks for natural habitats, and
                           forests.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           The project is expected to mainly finance small enterprises in the services or technology sphere
                           that will have limited environmental or social risks associated with them. The activities do not
                           involve pure real estate and construction (establishment of offices and purchase of construction
                           plant and equipment). However, since sub-activities are not known at this stage, potential indirect
                           impacts and long term impacts, if any, will be assessed during the screening process and
                           appropriate measures will be taken. Investments in cleantech and improvements in access or
                           delivery of essential goods and services e.g. clean water, or lower cost healthcare are expected to
                           have a positive impact.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           The sub-activity screening process will allow the FI to identify the risks on environment and social

                           and to screen out high risk sub-activities. It will also allow the FI to come up with the measures to
                           manage those risks in case such sub-activities are selected.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The CCG has experience through an ongoing World Bank financed project (MSME Development
                           Project [P129326]) and has an environmental and social management safeguards system (ESMS)
                           in place. The CCG has a designated social and environmental coordinator tasked with screening
                           sub-projects financed by banks under the MSME Development Project and categorizing activities
                           according to risk. All CCG operational staff including the environmental coordinator have
                           received training on World Bank safeguards. The CCG has been performing safeguards screening
                           at a satisfactory level and has properly excluded ineligible sub-projects such as Category A
                           projects, projects leading to involuntary resettlement, activities falling under IFC➢❨ s exclusion
                           list, and additional selected activities that are expected to have a significant negative
                           environmental and/or social impact. To date, no issue has been raised on the management of
                           safeguards aspects at the CCG. Therefore, the project will utilize the same ESMS to implement the
                           ESMF. The CCG, with assistance from the World Bank, will continue to enhance its capacity on
                           the management of environmental and social risks, which includes the screening of projects and
                           their classification into different risk types, as well as building up knowledge about Morocco➢❨ s
                           environmental and social laws and the World Bank's environmental and social norms. In addition


                                                                      Page 5 of 7
                           to reviewing safeguards reports, the CCG will evaluate the safeguards capacity and ESMS of the
                           Project Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). The World Bank will provide safeguards training to the
                           CCG and all PFIs.

                           In addition to reviewing safeguards reports, the CCG will evaluate the safeguards capacity and
                           ESMS of the PFIs and provide them with training when necessary. PFIs will be responsible for
                           establishing their own environmental and social screening and management system and report to
                           the CCG in accordance with the project ESMF. The CCG, supported by the World Bank, will
                           provide training for PFIs on ESMS. The PFIs will hire/assign their own environmental
                           coordinator. The environmental coordinators for the PFIs are in charge of conducting screening of
                           sub-projects, supervising sub-projects to ensure compliance, and submitting annual environmental
                           performance reports based on the annual performance reports prepared by the beneficiary SMEs.
                           The CCG➢❨ s safeguards specialist is responsible for verifying the screening results and
                           monitoring compliance with the ESMF and national laws on environment, health, safety, and
                           social issues and standards. The CCG➢❨ s safeguards specialist will prepare the annual
                           environmental performance report, based on the annual performance report prepared by all PFIs.
                           The PM at the PMU and the manager at each PFI will oversee environmental and social issues,
                           ensure resources are made available for environmental management, and sign the company's
                           annual environmental performance report.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The key stakeholders are CCG, Angel/seed and early stage VC fund managers, participating
                           beneficiary SMEs and their employees, and ecosystem support providers. The ESMF has been
                           cleared by the World Bank and will be disclosed on the website of the CCG. The ESMF will be
                           explained to Angel/Seed and early stage VC fund managers, and the ecosystem support providers
                           when the request for proposals is issued.
