B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
The project will improve access to high quality diagnosis for HIV/AIDS, STDs and opportunistic 
infections and contribute to build a regional surveillance system for these health problems. It will 
also contribute to the cross fertilization of best practices among countries, and support 
comprehensive bi/multinational subprojects to prevent HIV/AIDS and STDs in mobile 
populations.  It will help the countries move from ad hoc, sporadic activity in these key areas to 
institutionalized, sustainable activities. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
A
project of US$ 8 million is proposed with four components over a five-year period. The costs 
and activities presented below are indicative and will be prioritized and refined in the process of 
project preparation.    
 
Component 1
.
Support to a Reference Diagnostic Center and Laboratory Training (US$ 5 
million)
.
This component will support the development of a regional reference diagnostic center 
to carry out highly-specialized functions that, because of economies of scale, make most sense to 
be done at a regional center.  These include:  (a) confirmatory HIV tests (in the case of 
conflicting previous tests); (b) specialized diagnostics in the areas of HIV, STIs, and 
Page  2
opportunistic infections, such as drug-resistant TB; (c) quality control for national labs; and (d) 
regional trainings for lab workers.  Depending on the results of a detailed assessment to be 
carried out as part of project preparation, the reference lab may be not just one site but may 
include the development of two to three “centers of excellence” each serving different purposes.  
The assessment will identify what services are needed to serve scaled up HIV/AIDS programs 
that are best done, in terms of costs and quality, at a regional reference center(s).   As countries 
scale up their national programs, the demand for confirmatory HIV tests, other specialized 
diagnostics, and training of lab workers is expected to soar.  In terms of quality control, currently 
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is playing the role of quality assurance of national 
labs, on demand.  The CDC would like to see their role, which is sporadic at best, devolved to a 
regional lab that can help do quality control of national labs on a more systematic basis.   
Lessons from the CAREC (Caribbean Epidemiology Centre) will be examined as part of an 
assessment to consider how the long run recurrent costs of the reference lab would be funded.  
CAREC derives its funding from annual contributions from member states, as well as from 
donors for specific projects.  The reference lab could be public or a public/private partnership.    
 
Component 2. Support for epidemiological surveillance (US$ 1.5 million)
.
This component 
will finance: (a) regional training and the design of coordinated surveillance systems; (b) 
regional information dissemination (e.g. internet based dissemination of statistics); (c) regionally 
coordinated sentinel surveys such as the recent multicentric study that has yielded so much 
useful information on the evolution of the epidemic in high-risk groups across Central America.  
Standardization of case definitions, surveillance strategies, and indicators is key to monitoring 
the epidemic in the region.  PAHO and CDC have been trying to replace outdated surveillance 
approaches with “second generation” surveillance (including periodic HIV surveillance in high-
risk groups and behavioral risk factor surveillance) and the project will support these efforts.    
 
Component 3. Strengthening response capacity (US$ 0.5 million). 
This component will 
support the sharing of best practice on prevention and comprehensive care from health sector, 
non-health sector government and civil society organizations initiatives, and will explore ways to 
pool procurement of some supplies and pharmaceutical products. Recent workshops carried out 
in four Central American countries to analyze cost-effective interventions have concluded that 
only 25% of all primary and secondary infections can be prevented if we do not find new 
strategies to reach population groups that are at highest risk.  The component will also focus in 
the dissemination of “not successful stories” that are draining limited resources.    
 
Component 4. Prevention in mobile/migrant populations (US$ 1 million)
.
Mobile 
populations can be especially vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted infections 
(STIs) and be a factor in the epidemic’s spread.  Some of these populations include truckers, 
seasonal migrant workers, and commercial sex workers.  Sometimes women have transactional 
sex related to crossing borders, putting them at great risk.  Prevention programs focusing on 
these populations are still few and work at a small scale.  The Project will support the 
development of a regional framework for mobile/migrant policies and regulations and through 
subprojects, this component will also finance the scaling up of some successful projects and new 
bi or multinational projects developing new strategies to protect these populations.

Under IDA13, IDA grant financing is available for regional HIV/AIDS projects where the 
project benefits accrue to the region and are indivisible.  For regional projects, the financing 
needs to flow through a regional organization.  In this case, the Central American Bank for 
Economic Integration (CABEI), headquartered in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is a strong candidate.  
While Panama is not a member of CABEI, CABEI is exploring how it can find a window to 
work with Panama as well as the other Central American countries.  CABEI is already playing a 
regional role in a regional condom social marketing project supported by KfW and wishes to 
increase its activity in the area of HIV/AIDS.  As the administrative agent, CABEI would 
transfer funding to groups to execute specific project tasks.  It would play an financial oversight 
role.  As CABEI does not have the needed technical expertise in HIV/AIDS, various mechanisms 
for technical coordination and oversight of the project will be explored.  Possibilities include 
creating a technical unit under COMISCA. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The Project will cover six countries in Central America:  Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala 
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.  Specific location where the regional reference diagnostic 
center(s) will be located has not been defined at this point.  
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
To date the location of the Regional Reference Diagnostic Center has not been determined, but it 
is likely to be implemented only on one site, which in any case will be within public property 
and on public land. Therefore, involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12) will not be needed. Likewise,  
the Cultural Property safeguard (OPN 11.03) will not apply. Once the site is selected, stand-
alone EA will be prepared. The constructor capacity will be evaluated by the time of the 
appraisal mission in November 14, 2004.

Environmental Assessment
(
OP
/
BP
4.01) 
The construction of the Regional Reference Diagnostic Center is expected to 
have an increase on the production of Health Care Waste and some impacts 
during new construction or renovation of existing facilities. Once existing 
regulations and local capacity is assessed, the project will develop a set of 
environmental guidelines to cover topics such as, sorting, storage, handling , 
treatment , transportation, disposal, and monitoring of health care waste 
produced at the selected location.  A construction manual will be developed 
for this project for construction activities to be carried out under the project. 
The Bank will monitor the implementation if these guidelines as well as the 
projects compliance with Bank’s safeguards.

The project is not expected to have substantial adverse environmental effects. The risks of this 
operation are related to potential environmental impacts of health care waste generation and 
handling and potential environmental impacts of construction activities. This project is 
recommended to be Category “B”. Correspondingly, a stand-alone EA will be prepared for this 
project, which takes the following elements into account:  (i) preparation of adequate screening 
criteria for  site selection to ensure that selected site does not include historically or culturally 
significant sites, critical natural habitats, or require involuntary resettlement, (ii) Guidelines for 
handling health care waste, (iii) preparation of a construction manual that should be included in 
bidding documents for contractors; (iv) environmental guidelines for management of 
construction activities; and (v) a construction supervision plan, which will include activities to 
monitor compliance with the environmental guidelines designed for the project. Compliance with 
the construction manual as well as the environmental guidelines will be linked to fees and 
penalties included in the construction contracts.
