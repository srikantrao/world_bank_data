Project Objectives 
The overall objective of the 
Sustainable Forest Management
 Project would be to  
improve plantation production and management, reduce rural poverty and enhance the 
environmental values of plantation fore
stry in Argentina. This it would do by improving the 
policy framework,  strengthening institutional capacity at the local level, improving information 
delivery services, improving the supply of improved genetic material, establishing a framework 
for forest
 certification, facilitating the involvement of small and medium
-
scale farmers, land 
owners and producers in plantation and agro forestry, improving the efficiency of small wood 
using plants, by institutionalizing environmental safeguards and best practice
 into plantation 
management and by encouraging more private sector involvement in service provision.
 Project efforts would focus on (i) the rural poor, whose livelihoods depend on agriculture; (ii) 
medium
-
 and small
-
scale producers in the forest sector, w
ith limited access to technology needed 
for improving productivity; and (iii) innovative medium
-
scale farmers working in silvo
-
pastoral 
systems. In addition, the project would aim to bolster the technical capacity and outreach of 
public organizations worki
ng in plantation forestry to provide technical, policy and regulatory 
leadership within the sector.

Project Description
The project will focus in the main plantation areas of the country and in areas where 
rehabilitation planting of natural degraded 
forest can satisfy the twin objectives of conservation 
and poverty alleviation through employment. It would incorporate the three thematic areas 
identified during the course of the first project and through a series of regional workshops, 
namely:
a)
Small
 Holder Forestry. 
To help alleviate rural poverty and stimulate rural growth, the 
project would provide technical assistance and grants for the establishment of 3000 to 
4000 ha of new plantations and agro forestry systems for no less than 2000 small farmer
s. 
It would also aim to upgrade select harvesting operations and improve the efficiency of 
around 100 small plantation based sawmills. Training of beneficiaries would be carried 
out by extensionists, and upgraded training institutes. Peer learning (produce
r-
to
-
producer) would also be encouraged at the local level. A preliminary phase would carry 
out siting studies, establish extension nodes and identify best practices for the proposed 
systems. Training of provincial personnel would also be included to ensur
e sustainability 
after project closure. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation would help to track and 
demonstrate sustainability of the component’s activities.
b)
Forest Information.
 The aim of this component would be to facilitate decision making 
by improving
 the quality and access of up
-
to
-
date information on plantation resources 
and utilization. This would include support to improved systems of data capture, analysis, 
storage, retrieval and publication. Information to be gathered would include that on the 
re
source base, its processing and marketing. It would also include, inter alia, the 
incidence of pest outbreak, other threats, and recommended systems of control. The 
information would be generated and managed at both the national and provincial levels 
throu
gh the creation of an expanded MIS, together with personnel trained in its use and 
dissemination. Institutional responsibilities between provinces and the federal 
government agencies would also be streamlined. Policy work would be conducted  in 
order to im
prove implementation of existing federal legislation and to work out proposals 
for legislation at the sub national level on a province
-
by
-
province basis.
c)
Research and Technology Transfer
 To raise plantation productivity and reduce 
harvesting and process
ing losses, a ‘demand driven’ applied forestry research program 
would be supported, along with the development of a sustainable forestry extension 
program (including forest certification). Priority research needs would be identified with 
end users and gran
ts made available for collaborative implementation. They would 
potentially include, inter alia, genetic improvement programs, silviculture of native 
species, experimental management techniques, and pest control. The component would 
promote partnerships wit
h the private sector and provincial institutions.  To get the ‘best 
practice’ message out, government certified private forestry extension services would be 
nurtured for large producers, with a similar system being promoted on a cost sharing 
basis for medi
um and small 
-
scale producers. The aim would be to shift the fiscal burden 
for research and extension to the beneficiaries, that is, the private sector, with the state 
acting as regulator.

d)
Project Implementation and Monitoring/Evaluation. 
This component w
ould support a 
project implementation unit within SAGPyA and some of the decentralized operations in 
the field. Emphasis would be placed not only on project execution but also on 
transferring responsibilities from federal to provincial authorities and the 
private sector to 
ensure sustainability after closure. A fully funded monitoring and evaluation 
subcomponent would track project progress and impacts, and provide feedback for 
project improvement throughout its tenure.
The Associated GEF Project
Environ
mental interventions would be funded under an Associated GEF project which 
would focus in the main plantation areas and in areas where degraded natural forest is becoming 
an environmental concern. The GEF project would aim to mainstream/integrate environme
ntal 
work into every day management practice and cover incremental costs of measures to achieve 
agreed global environmental benefits in the areas of land degradation and biological diversity. It 
would include an awareness campaign, the preparation of manua
ls of best practice, training, and 
incentives for the adoption of best practice. These might include biodiversity corridors, 
rehabilitation planting of degraded forest with native species, biodiversity mosaics, adjusted 
forest management practice to encour
age biodiversity, habitat creation and tree planting for 
conservation swaps.
D.  Project location (if known)
The primary target areas would be those most suitable for plantation forestry and include the 
provinces of 
Misiones, Corrientes, Entre Rios, Buen
os Aires and Santa Fe, as well as the 
provinces of Neuquen, Rio Negro and Salta/Jujuy. Activities with small farmers would be 
carried out in Misiones, Neuquen, Salta, Chaco, Santa Fe (North), and Santiago del Estero. Other 
areas may be considered during pr
eparation.
E.
 Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies 
There are no significant issues related to institutional capacity. The proposed project is a follow
-
on to a successful, existing project. It will build on the institutional capacity al
ready developed. 
The existing project is presently developing best management practices for silvicultural activities 
in the various provinces, and has been training provincial authorities for several years on 
environmental impact assessments relating to fo
restry.

If Applicable, How Might It Apply?
[X ]
Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01)
No large
-
scale i
mpacts are expected given the limited, small
-
holder based actions 
envisioned at conceptualization. However, an EA will be done as part of project 
preparation to identify the project’s potential impacts, to develop appropriate 
mitigation measures for negati
ve impacts, and to recommend enhancement 
Page  4
measures for positive impacts, as needed or required. These mitigation and 
enhancement measures will be summarized in an Environmental Management 
Plan (EMP) that will include screening criteria and environmental pro
cedures. 
The EA will also evaluate whether other environmental safeguards are triggered, 
and develop appropriate procedures, if necessary.
[X ]
Natural Habitats
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.04)
The project will support environmentally sustainable forestry activities designed 
to integrate into national development without adverse impacts to natural habitats. 
The EA for the project will ensure that 
proposed actions are consistent with the 
policy and specifically address the issue of natural habitats, and be used to guide 
the final project design in the use of best practices.
[X]
Pest Management
 (
OP 4.09
)
During preparation it will be determined if a pe
st
-
management subcomponent is 
needed in order to deal with the emerging forest pest, Platypus mutatus, and an 
EA developed accordingly if required.

[X ]
Forests
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.36
)
The project conforms to this safeguard. Forest plantations will be established only 
on small
-
holder lands with an estimated average size of 3.5 hectares, with direct 
beneficiaries being the rural poor. About 4000 ha of land are estimated to be 
forested
. No industrial
-
scale commercial planting or harvesting is planned under 
the project. The EA will specifically address the issue of forests, and ensure that 
the project is consistent with this concept.
