    B. Project Development Objective(s)
    There is no change to the original Project Development Objective, which is to improve the resilience of
    Kiribati to the impacts of climate change on freshwater supply and coastal infrastructure.
    C. Project Description
    The activities proposed for additional financing will enable the Government of Kiribati to expand the
    work already being undertaken to support key government priorities, as captured in the Kiribati
    Adaptation Program's (KAP III) development objective and components. The Government will be able
    to take advantage of the existing KAPIII mechanisms, and allow the project to increase the sustainability
    of the outcomes envisaged under the original KAP III design. Specifically, support is proposed for the
    following activities:

    Component 1. Improve water resource use and management

    Expansion of the Improved Water Supply Pilot Zones. This would respond to the Government’s request
    to complete the technical design for additional sites in the population centers of Betio and Bairiki, South
    Tarawa. The project has built upon the existing Tarawa Water Master Plan (2010) and the Water and
    Sanitation Roadmap 2011 – 2030 to develop a Roadmap for an Expanded Program of Leak Detection /


                                                  Page 1 of 3
Water Network Improvements. The latter roadmap operationalizes the earlier strategies, while
highlighting the need for the pilot interventions to be executed in an integrated and scalable manner that
ensures the sustainability of the entire network. Cabinet has approved improvement of nine zones in
three villages (Tanaea, Tebikenikora/Eita, and Nanikai) and the corresponding trial of a “user pays” cost
recovery method. Increasing the number of sites included in the pilot will provide several benefits: a
greater proportion of the population will receive more reliable access to potable water and protect
against the impacts of climate change on water supply, while the larger pilot will help prove the
effectiveness of the overall Water Network Roadmap. If implemented under KAPIII, the Government of
Kiribati will be able to bundle the design services, minimizing the costs of mobilizing international
consultants.

Component 2. Increase coastal resilience
No additional activities proposed

Component 3. Strengthen the Capacity to Manage the Effects of Climate Change and Natural Hazards

a. Development of a Long-Term Coastal Security Strategy (LTCSS). Under KAP III, a baseline study
and a draft coastal management framework and policy have been completed. Subsequently, short- to
medium-term toolkits and detailed guidelines for better managing the country’s coastal areas were to
have been developed. However the newly-elected government requested support in August 2016 for an
expanded Long-Term Coastal Security Strategy that focuses on measures to ensure long term viability
and climate-adaptive development. The envisaged strategy will respond to this request by building on
the completed coastal management framework and policy, providing appropriate short- and long-term
solutions to minimize existing and future projected vulnerabilities, and to ensure that the atolls of
Kiribati are suitable and livable for human habitation for as long as possible.

b. Resilience Fund scale-up. This will enable a larger number of eligible communities in the outer
islands to receive grants for small-scale climate adaptation and disaster risk management projects. The
initial call for proposals received over 300 applications (mostly for projects to improve access to potable
water), of which 35 projects across 12 islands can be supported under the existing funding envelope,
despite many more applications being found to be technically sound. In accordance with the President’s
Policy Statement (2016), the Government is strongly committed to maximizing outer island
development, which will need to be underpinned by greater resilience of outer island communities.
Additional funds for this activity would allow for an increase in the number of projects that could be
financed, including an expansion of the call for proposals to additional islands in the Line and Phoenix
groups, utilizing the mechanism now in place for delivery of these grants.

c. Extension of the Office of the President's Building. This will enhance KAP III's support to the Office
of the President's Strategic Risk Management Unit, to better undertake its role with respect to climate
change coordination, integration and policy harmonization.
