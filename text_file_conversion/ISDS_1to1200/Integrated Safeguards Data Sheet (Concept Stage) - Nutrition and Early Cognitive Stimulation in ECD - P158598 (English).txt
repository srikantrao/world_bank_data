                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project aims to improve nutrition and early cognitive stimulation awareness outcomes among
                           parents/caregivers whose children attend ECD programs in the most deprived areas in Afghanistan.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project aims to build capacity and awareness of sound nutritional and early cognitive stimulation
                           practices among caregivers (teachers and parents) for children in early childhood development
                           programs. The project will focus on the following components:

                           1.       The development of teaching aids and materials for nutrition teaching and early cognitive
                           stimulation practices to parents through existing ECD facilities. Training and materials will include
                           attention to food, how to grow own food, nutrition, health, sanitation, hygiene and early stimulation
                           and interaction. Materials will be user-friendly and pertinent to nutrition needs in the country.
                           2.       Building capacity of ECD teachers/facilitators to provide nutrition training as well as early
                           cognitive stimulation. These facilities will reach out to parents/mothers of young children who have
                           children under 6 in the catchment area.
                           3.       Micronutrient supplements provision to most deprived areas through existing ECD facilities
                           4.       Building evidence for impact of interventions on outcomes.
