2. Project Objectives 
The development objective of the project is to facilitate infrastructure investments that 
have strategic importance and/or special complexity by ensuring that proper feasibility 
work is carried out in a timely manner in order to enable the government to make sound 
investment decisions, and where appropriate, to proceed expeditiously with further 
preparatory steps and mobilize adequate financing for implementation.  The considered 
areas include energy and transport, consistent with Governments investment priorities 
and CPS objectives.  Specifically, the project will finance technical assistance (TA) to 
ensure feasibility (or otherwise) and effectiveness of considered investments through 
preparation work including technical and sectoral studies, engineering design, and 
analysis of economic, financial and environmental feasibility, as well as financial and 
legal advisory services, where required. The facility will support the delivery of these 
outcomes with details to be worked out on a case-by-case basis.   
 
3. Project Description 
The IPF Project has two major components: Component 1 will finance TA for Khudoni 
Hydropower Project preparation; Component 2, with two sub-components, will finance 
preparation of Transit Corridor projects.  While Components 1 and 2.A. are clearly 
Page  2
defined, the scope of the sub-Component 2.B. is broadly determined for transit corridor 
projects and depends upon the availability of funds remaining after funding needs for 
Component 1 and 2.A. are satisfied.   
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Component 1 of the project plans to undertake a feasibility study and develop detailed 
designs and specification for the possible Khudoni Hydropower Plant project, which 
would be located more than 90km upstream of the Enguri River discharge point into the 
Black Sea. 
 
Component 2 of the project envisages TA for prepration of the upgrading of Red 
Bridge-Tbilisi-Poti transit road section from Agaiani to Seveneti (approximately Km 46 
mark to Km 80 mark).

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The IPF Project is limited to the provision of technical assistance for the preparation of 
follow-on investment, and no negative impact on the environment or society, therefore, is 
expected from the implementation of the proposed TA project.  Since the follow-on 
investments under the umbrella of the IPF Project include components that would be at 
least Category B and possibly Category A, however, the IPF Project is classed as 
Category B.  
 
Normally Category B projects require the preparation of an Environmental (Safeguard) 
Assessment and an associated Environmental Management Plan (EMP) as a condition of 
Page  3
appraisal.  These investment-specific due diligence instruments are not relevant to a 
technical assistance facility.  A Safeguard Framework (SF), however, is a new approach 
to due diligence on TA loans and has been prepared to meet the Bank’s safeguard 
requirements.  The SF approach has been assessed by the Regional Safeguards 
Coordinator (ECSSD) and other relevant experts and has been found to be in compliance 
with the Bank policy requirements.  The SF summarizes the approach to safeguards to be 
taken during the implementation of the IPF Project, which will include the preparation of 
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Social Impact Assessments (SIAs) for the 
follow-on investments.  The assessment process will be conducted in accordance with 
World Bank policies and guidelines.  The discussion in the SF covers the both the power 
and transport sector components.  The SF has been reviewed by the Regional Safeguards 
Coordinator.  
 
Disclosure to the public of assessment documents and public feedback is an essential 
part of the safeguard process.  In this case the SF itself has been disclosed in country and 
through the World Bank INFOShop. The SF outlines the disclosure process to be 
followed for the respective components during the implementation of the IPF Project and 
identifies the documentation to be produced during implementation of the IPF Project.  
The SF is to be part of Project Operational Manuals to be followed during project 
implementation.  
 
The Khudoni component of the IPF Project triggers the World Bank's safeguard policy 
on International Waterways (OP 7.50)because the river on which the hydropower plant 
and dam would be located flows into the Black Sea, which is an international waterway 
under the Bank policy.  The proposed plant is expected to have no impact on the quality 
of the water discharged into the Balck Sea and no impact on sediments brought into the 
Black Sea.   
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area: 
The EIAs and SIAs to be prepared under the project would identify the potential indirect 
and/or long term terms impacts of the anticipated future activities.  The Khudoni project 
would be a category A project since it involves the completion of a major high dam and 
reservoir complex. Transit Corridor projects would most likely be category B unless there 
would be major new alignments or other risks identified in the EIAs.  
 
Although the IPF Project provides only for technical assistance, the follow-on projects 
would potentially include impacts that would trigger the safeguard policies for 
resettlement and/or land acquisition.  The technical studies for Component 1 would 
include the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan for Khudoni, and under 
Component 2 similar plans would be prepared for those segments identified as triggering 
this requirement.  Since the Enguri River, on which a possible future Khudoni 
hydropower plant would be located, flows into the Black Sea, the International 
Waterways Safeguard (OP 7.50) has been triggered. The project is not expected to cause 
appreciable harm to the other riparians.

3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
N/A for the current project, but project alternatives will be considered for the follow-on 
works.   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide 
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
The borrower has prepared the Safeguard Framework and will prepare TORs for the 
EIAs and the SIAs for all components of the project, as well as facilitate the local 
disclosure process.  These documents will meet both Georgian and World Bank 
requirements. The SF has been disclosed in country and is to be part of Project 
Operational Manuals to be followed during project implementation.   
 
On behalf of the Government of Georgia on December 22, 2005 the Bank has notified 
the Commission for the “Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea 
AgainstPollution” of the planned feasibility study and (if a viable project) the subsequent 
detailed design and specification work for the Khudoni project and its triggering of Bank 
Policy OP 7.50.  Comments from the Commission are expected by February 1, 2006.  
The Bank does not expect to receive any objections to proceed with the technical 
assistance to assess Khudoni feasibility.  
 
Despite the fact that the proposed Khudoni project is expected to have no impact on the 
quality of the water discharged into the Black Sea and no impact on sediments brought 
into the Black Sea, in the frame of the project the consultants undertaking the feasibility 
study would assess what impact, if any, a Khudoni hydropower plant would have on 
water flow from the Enguri River into the Black Sea.   
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Key Stakeholders include: Ministry of Finance, Ministry of the Economic Development, 
Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, 
Ministry of Health and Social Services, Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Refugees and 
Resettlement, Regional and Local Governments, and various environmental and social 
NGOs at the national and local level.  The Safeguard Framework has been prepared and 
disseminated to enable such groups to understand the framework and processes to be 
followed for safeguard protection.  The Safeguard Framework outlines the overall 
consultation process to be followed. 
 
The Commission for the “Convention on the Protection of the Black Sea Against 
Pollution” has been notified and comments from the Commission are expected by 
February 1, 2006.
