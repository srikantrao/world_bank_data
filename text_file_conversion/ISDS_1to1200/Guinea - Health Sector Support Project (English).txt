B. Project Objectives 
 
The project is the second phase of an APL.  The PPSG, which closed on December 31, 2003, constituted the first  
phase.  The objectives of  the current project (HSSP) is to improve access and coverage of health services by the 
poor and to prepare the MOH for Phase III, which will consist of budget support.  Specific objectives are:  
 
\01fi
Enhancing  knowledge and skills to prevent and manage communicable diseases, nutrition and reproductive 
health at household level, with special attention to the poor.
fi
\01fi
Increasing access and utilization of basic health care services for the management of communicable 
diseases, childhood illnesses, malnutrition, and maternal health. 
\01fi
Strengthening  the referral system by enhancing the capacity of the secondary level of care to effectively 
support the primary care level. 
 
C.  Project Description 
The Sector Wide Approach (SWAP) is selected as the best suited instrument to achieve the above objectives. This 
approach will facilitate movement away from the project approach, previously used in Guinea, to a budgetary 
support approach, will strengthen the sector in preparation for the PRSC, and will reduce the need for a PCU. The 
SWAP will ensure that the following issues are addressed in the yearly MOH programs.  The SWAP will finance 
activities which will be integrated into the PRSC as this instrument becomes available. 
 
For a sector or thematic program:  since this is a sector-wide project and the World Bank positions itself as lender of 
last resort, investments will be agreed upon on a yearly basis with all the donors.  The major elements of the 
program will include strategies to build increasingly sustained financing of public health interventions for the poor, 
strategies to increase the efficiency of the provision of essential interventions, and strategies to ensure the provision 
of a package of essential interventions to the poor. 
 
D.  Project location  
 
Project activities will take place at health facilities (hospitals, clinics, centers) throughout the country, with 
particular attention to those serving the poorest populations.  No particular region will be targeted, and both urban 
and rural zones will be covered.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
In 2002, MOH developed a National Plan for Medical Waste Management which, when submitted in the context of 
the MAP project, was found satisfactory to the IDA ISG group.  Government has started implementing this plan, 
notably in the Conakry hospitals with the help of the E.U.  The MAP will also contribute to the financing of parts of 
the Plan.  It has requested help from GTZ and the French Cooperation who have sent technical assistance to Guinea.

Environmental Assessment Category:
    
[ ] A   [ ] B   [] C   [ ] FI   [X ] TBD (to be determined) 
 
The final EA category will be determined by whether or not any small construction will be undertaken and if so, the 
nature and location of such construction.  These minor decisions will be made during the pre-appraisal work done in 
February 2004.  The RPF, if needed, will be submitted to the PIC and disclosed in the country prior to Appraisal in 
March 2004.
