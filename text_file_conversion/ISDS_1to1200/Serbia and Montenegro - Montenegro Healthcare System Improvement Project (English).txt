A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The proposed Health System Improvement Project would put in place the first steps towards a reformed 
health system, including priority elements of reform to begin stabilizing health financing and improving 
primary care service delivery.  Specifically, the project would support the MOH and HIF to (i) improve 
quality, efficiency and access to primary health care services, including prescription drugs;  (ii) begin 
improvement in financial sustainability of the health care system by strengthening institutional capacity and 
information systems  for health policy, planning, regulation and management in the MOH and HIF; and 
(iii) improve services for the elderly and people with long term mental illness and disabilities in primary 
care, and foster improved coordination between primary care and social care for these patients. 
 
The following key indicators would be used to assess project performance:  
(i)  drug prices and growth in the drugs bill are reduced by (target to be agreed);  
(ii)  HIF annual deficit reduced to (target to be agreed) by end of project; 
(iii) (target percentage to be agreed) of PHC doctors/nurses trained and using evidence-based protocols of 
care; 
(iv) adoption of bylaws and administrative documents under the new framework laws currently under 
development covering health insurance, health care, and pharmaceuticals, to implement the priority 
elements of the Government’s reform strategy (to be specified); 
(v)  operational health information systems in HIF, primary health care providers and pharmaceutical 
supply chain, to provide timely, accurate data on key elements of performance (expenditure, service 
utilization, referral, health status indicators, service quality indicators). 
 
The Bank's strategic program with SAM, outlined in the draft TSS Update for FY04, due to be presented to 
the Board in January 2004, includes the proposed Montenegro Healthcare System Improvement Project 
(HSIP) in the planned lending program for FY04. The draft TSS Update for FY04 explicitly notes the 
expected contribution of the health investment project to two of its four development objectives:  
improving the social well-being of the most vulnerable, and building human capacity and improving 
governance and building effective institutions.   The Project also aims to contribute to a third development 
objective - to restore macroeconomic stability - through support for development of policies to improve the 
fiscal sustainability of the Montenegro health system.

This component would be directed at helping the government to identify best practice in health 
policy, financing and selected areas of service delivery.  There would be two sub-components: (i) 
policy development and capacity building for the MOH and HIF, focused on issues which the 
Government has decided are highest priority for Bank support; and (ii) concrete investments in 
additional modules for the information system already under development, to improve data 
contracting, monitoring and management of primary health care, and related services.   
 
B. 
Phased implementation of primary health care development, beginning in Podgorica  
This component would support phased implementation of policy and plans to develop primary 
health-care (developed under Component A).   This component will have three sub-components, 
(i) a first phase of implementation in Podgorica which would be used to develop the reform model 
and learn lessons before scaling up reforms to other parts of Montenegro; key elements of the 
reform model include patient choice of and registration with a primary care doctor; reorganization 
of these “chosen doctors” into group practices, alongside consolidation of specialized primary-
care-based services into a Primary Care Reference Center (including diagnostics, specialized 
primary care clinics, day services for the elderly and mentally ill, and teaching facilities);  
implementation of a new contract with these doctors to improve staff motivation based on a re-
defined benefits package and a new payments model; improvement in the organization of services 
to reduce waiting and crowding and give medical staff more effective time with patients.  These 
activities will be coordinated with information systems development under Component A to 
support these changes, and with training of staff in evidence-based protocols of care under sub-
component B(ii), so as to improve the value-added by primary care and reduce inappropriate use 
of medicines and inappropriate referral to hospitals; (ii) support for development of specialization 
training of primary health care professionals and continuing professional development for all 
categories of primary care medical staff; and (iii) support for phased implementation of key 
elements of the reform in the rest of Montenegro.  The key areas to be scaled up first include: 
implementation of patient choice of and registration with a primary care doctor; implementation of 
a new contract with these doctors based on a re-defined benefits package and a new payments 
model; information systems to support these changes.  Medical staff from outside Podgorica will 
also participate in training under sub-component B(ii).  Mobilization of additional resources from 
local and donor sources will be necessary to fully implement all aspects of the primary care 
development strategy, extending beyond the life of the Project.  
 
C. 
Project management, monitoring and evaluation
  The Ministry of Health will be the implementing 
agency for the Project.  This component would have two sub-components: (i) support for a Project 
Management Network in the health sector organizations involved in the project activities, led by a 
Project Coordinator in the MOH; and (ii) a central Technical Services Unit providing 
procurement, financial management and disbursement services for the health project and for other 
upcoming Bank-financed projects. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
The Podgorica primary care development sites are envisaged to involve civil works consisting of internal 
remodeling of existing buildings used for primary health care in an urban context.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
In the Safeguards Review Meeting conducted at the Project Concept Stage, it was agreed that the project is 
"C" environmental safeguards category as it does not raise concerns of major health or environmental 
impacts. However, the some ssues will need to be addressed during project preparation in the PAD and 
other implementation documents, and are summarized below. 
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
The Podgorica primary care development sub-component will involve internal remodeling and 
rehabilitation of a Primary Health Care Center and will  require specific safeguards provisions. These are 
for proper handling of construction debris and safe management of sharps (needs , syringes, chemical 
packages, used sanitary materials) from the primary health care practice.    
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Waste from civil works:
  Rehabilitation of the buildings ( remodeling and refurbishing) does not include 
major structural changes and therefore minor quantities of debris will be generated.  The project documents 
must guide the implementing agency  on  workers safety, dust and noise pollution, proper handling, 
transportation and disposal of construction waste materials.  
Health care waste
: The project documents must have provisions for and guide on the safeguards for 
preventing health impacts from direct and indirect exposure of humans to health care waste during 
implementation. The Bank team will monitor that such provisions are in place in the bidding documents 
and follow up contracts. In addition training on medical waste management, protection of staff from 
occupational injury and safety, and health hazards will be provided to workers in the primary health care 
facility through the project training sub-component.
  
 
 
Borrower capacity is supported by building into the project plans and cost tables provision for necessary 
technical assistance and training, to cover the above issues. 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders affected by applicable safeguards issues are the management, staff and patients of the 
primary health care services in Podgorica, the responsible Ministry of Health, construction contractors 
under the Project, and the municipality of Podgorica.  An environmental management plan and disclosure 
of the same are not required.  Consultation and advice on health care waste issues have commenced during 
project preparation and will be built into management of implementation of the civil works and of 
management and staff training activities during project implementation.
