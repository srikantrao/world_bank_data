2. Project Development Objective(s)



                                              1
The proposed development objective is to improve student outcomes in secondary education and
the effectiveness of the secondary education system.

3. Project Description

The proposed operation consists of two components: (i) a Program for Results (PforR)
component to support the government’s harmonized secondary education sector program; (ii) a
Technical Assistance Facility component that aims to strengthen the capacity of Ministry of
Education (MOE) and other implementing agencies and provide support facility for achieving
the results in the priority areas. The Government’s Secondary Education Development Program
(SEDP) will be implemented over the course of five years from the financial year (FY) 2017/18
to FY 2021/22, and it will cover Grades 6-12, annually supporting more than 12 million students
and 357,000 teachers from more than 20,300 general schools, 9,400 madrasahs and 1,190 school-
based vocational/technical institutions across the country. SEDP spans the entire activities of
MOE excluding those for higher education (post Grade 12), technical and vocational education
and training under the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) and Bangladesh Technical
Education Board (BTEB). The following preliminary Results Areas have been identified for this
component:

Result Area 1: Enhanced quality of secondary education
Result Area 2: Increased equitable access and retention
Result Area 3: Strengthened Governance and Management


This Integrated Safeguards Datasheet (ISDS) pertains to the Technical Assistance (TA)
component of the program which will be supported through an Investment Project Financing
(IPF) instrument. A total amount of US$20 million (US$10 million from IDA and US$10
mission from GFF) will be allocated towards the TA component.

4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis (if
known)

The project is expected to be spread all over the country. Technical Assistance Facility would
primarily include provision and utilization of services, skills, knowledge and technology in the
form of short-term and long-term advisors and consultants, consulting firms and non-consulting
agencies to support and strengthen the capacity of the program implementation and deliver
results. Therefore no significant, long term adverse environment or social impacts are
anticipated from the interventions/activities of TA.
On the social front, no lands are to be secured as the interventions are exclusively ‘services’
oriented and devoid of civil works. However, the project is spread across the country and the
interventions could take place in the tribal areas. While no adverse impacts on tribal people is
expected, project interventions have been designed such as to ensure ‘inclusion’ of tribal
communities.

6. Safeguard Policies            Triggered?   Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment OP/BP   Yes           This policy is triggered because OP
4.01                                          4.10 has been triggered. The TA
                                              component covers consultancy
                                              services to support the Secondary
                                              Education Sector Program under the
                                              PforR component. TA activities do
                                              not include any physical facilities and
                                              any positive or negative
                                              environmental or social impacts.
                                              However, in accordance with the
                                              World Bank policy, Environmental

                                              different beneficiaries. To ensure that
                                              TA activities do not adversely affect
                                              one or more populations groups, this
                                              is triggered. Appropriate measures
                                              will be taken to have TA activities
                                              benefit the TP communities. A Tribal

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management

A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project.
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
TA activities do not include any construction of physical facilities and infrastructure
development. No potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible negative impacts are
envisaged. Since the activities will trigger OP/BP 4.10, as the umbrella policy OP/BO 4.01 is
also triggered. The project will be “Category B?.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future
activities in the project area:
There will be no long term adverse impacts due to activities associated with the TA. The
capacity of Ministry of Education (MoE)/Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education and
other implementing agencies will be enhanced which will enable the project management to
provide support facility for achieving the results in the priority areas in an effective manner.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize
adverse impacts.
Not relevant for the TA component of the program
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide
an assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
The TA component covers consultancy services to support the Secondary Education Sector
Program under the PforR component. Therefore, for the TA component there is no relevant
measures to address environmental safeguard policy issues. However, the capacity of the
borrower to plan and implement the safeguard measures related to the SEDP has been assessed
through an ESSA which includes the assessment of the current SEQAEP and SESIP projects,
lessons learnt and recommendations for improvement of the systems. For compliance with the
social safeguards, the SEQEAP project prepared a Social Management Framework (SMF)
including a Tribal People Policy Framework (TPPF). ESSA has documented the lessons learnt
and capacity of the borrower to comply with the World Bank’s social safeguard policies. A

                                                4
TPPF has been prepared as an annex to the ESSA. The borrower will follow the TPPF in
project implementation (TA component).
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The MoE, implementing agency officials and Project Management Unit are the main
stakeholders. During TA program implementation, as and whenever applicable, the
stakeholders should be sensitized about the environmental and social issues of the program
and need for regular environmental/social monitoring.
