A.2. Project Objectives: 
In line with the federal government’s goal to significantly strengthen governance and accountability, 
reduce corruption and enable it deliver services more effectively, the objectives of this project are two 
fold: (i) to improve the federal government’s economic and financial management systems and 
processes; and (ii) to firmly establish a reform process of the federal civil service to improve 
professionalism and the government’s ability to deliver services.  Progress towards the achievement of 
these objectives will be measured by: (a) adoption of more transparent and modern  economic and 
financial management systems and processes that are less prone to corruption;  and  (b) 
implementation of restructuring plans in pilot Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and 
initiation of reforms in other MDAs. 
A.3.  The project has four broad areas of support:  (i) public resource management and targeted anti-corruption initiatives; 
(ii) civil service reforms system wide and in five pilot ministries/agencies; (iii) implementation of pensions reforms; and 
(iv) strengthening of statistics and statistical capacity; Activities in these four areas will build a broad framework to help 
achieve both some immediate gains in the quest for good governance and the fight against corruption as well as significant 
reduction in corruption over time through system-wide structura
l
changes.  It will put the Federal Government’s finances 
on a path of fiscal sustainability and enhance efficiency in use of government resources.  An unallocated amount is also 
provided.

ublic Resource Management and Targeted Anti-Corruption Initiatives
 
This component will support reforms of the financial management and  procurement policies and processes in parallel with 
institutional strengthening of the key public resource management and procurement agencies. On the revenue side it will 
support the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and the Nigeria Customs (NCS) in further defining certain aspects of 
their administrative reforms and capacity building.  The component will:  (i) ) modernize financial management and 
accountability arrangements; (ii) streamline and modernize public sector procurement procedures; (iii) address inefficiency 
weak capacity and corruption in domestic revenue collection.  The Federal Government is already strengthening fiscal 
policy including through implementation of an oil price based fiscal rule.  It has also initiated development of a Medium 
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).  Separately, activities are underway, funded by USAID and by the Government’s 
own resources, to strengthen the capacity of the budget office. Both sets of activities will complement each other in 
strengthening overall public resource management.  The component will also include support for the targeted anti-
corruption efforts of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).  
Activities to improve Government Financial Management System include: 
·
Progressively introducing a Government Integrated Financial Management Information 
System (GIFMIS).  This will include strengthening the OAGF’s IT capacity, acquisition 
and deployment of integrated PFM software, and development and implementation of 
additional ICT infrastructure (WAN to link OAGF HQ and line ministries/agencies/ federal 
pay offices); 
·
Improved cash management by strengthening the institutional framework and capacity for 
cash management and through utilization of the GIFMIS cash planning system; 
·
Improved financial reporting through: (a) adoption of the cash model of International 
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSASs); and (b) design and implementation of 
departmental financial performance reporting systems; 
·
Review and modernization of internal audit arrangements; and 
·
Capacity building in financial management for relevant staff including through support for 
the Federal Treasury Training Academy. 
 
Activities to Strengthen External audit will include: 
i) 
Restructuring of the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation (OAuGF) in line with 
a
new audit law; 
ii)  Reviewing and modernizing audit approaches; and  
iii) Capacity building for staff of the OAuGF and strengthening of its IT capacity. 
 
Activities to strengthen Financial Reporting will include: 
i).  Full adoption and dissemination of international standards relating to financial reporting, 
including IFRS/IAS, IPSAS and ISA;  
ii).  Review of the 2003 NASB Act to create a Financial Reporting Council and to address 
current institutional weaknesses in regulation, compliance and enforcement of standards;  
iii).  Strengthening of the technical and professional capabilities of the NASB and SEC; and 
iv).  Improving business ethics, and international accounting and auditing standards contents of 
higher institutions’ accounting curriculum. 
 
Procurement Reforms will focus on: 
i)  Preparation of regulations in line with the new Procurement Law and translation of Law and regulations into 
the three national languages to allow wide dissemination; 
ii) Support for setting up and effective take-off of the Public Procurement Bureau as the procurement regulatory 
body; 
iii) Procurement training and capacity building in the public sector including strengthened oversight capacity, and 
public enlightenment; and 
iv) Preparation of National Standard Bidding Documents. 
 
Page  3
Support for addressing inefficiency  and corruption in revenue collection will include: 
i) 
Development of FIRS institutional capacity through preparation and implementation of detailed HR reform 
and training plan, and a change management strategy; 
ii) 
Revised tax administration procedures for FIRS; and  
iii)  Development of medium term information systems road map for tax administration and for NCS.

i) 
support for take off of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU); 
ii) 
strengthening the capacity of investigators; 
iii)  upgrading of IT capacity; and  
iv)  effective communication and publicity campaign against economic and financial crimes. 
 
Civil Service Administrative Reforms.  
This component will support a progressive transformation of the federal civil service through a combination of initial 
systemic reforms and the restructuring, including downsizing of key agencies as pilots for a later broadening of refor
ms.  
The pilot agencies are the Federal Ministry of Finance, the National
 
Planning Commission (NPC),
 
State House, the 
Ministry of the Federal Capital Territory (MFCT) and the Ministry of Information. 
Specific activities to be funded include: 
(i)  Designing and implementing an integrated personnel and payroll system to improve the management of 
human resources and eliminate fraud 
(ii)  Reforming  the pilot MDAs through restructuring, rightsizing and capacity building, including for preparing, 
executing and monitoring outcomes of their budgets.  
(iii) Strengthening the newly established Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) to lead and coordinate the 
system wide reforms.   
(iv) Carrying out diagnostic studies and dialogue on key service wide reforms to build broader support for the 
reforms service-wide and inform preparation of detailed plans to extend the reform process to other MDAs.   
(v)  Designing and implementing a Performance Improvement Fund to support innovative capacity building and 
business process pilots in reforming MDAs 
 
Strengthening Pension Management and Accountability 
 
The Government is reforming pensions and undertaking measures to improve management and accountability.  In July 
2004, a new Pensions Bill was passed establishing a contributory scheme for both public and private sectors. Government 
intends to implement the bill in a phased manner, starting initially with the public service and then moving on to 
implementation in the private sector.  Many of the institution-building measures required to implement the recently 
adopted Pension Act are generic requirements applicable to any effort to strengthen the pension system.  This component 
will therefore support measures to improve the management and accountability of the public service pension system as 
well as provide the analytical tools to evaluate the implementation of the Act for the private sector.  Support will include: 
 
i) 
Establishment of a regulatory and supervisory framework for the Civil Service pension system;
ii)  Capacity building for the recently established National Pensions Commission;  
iii) Development of an IT strategy and the procurement of software applications and hardware; 
iv) Conducting a full scale audit, reconciliation and actuarial valuation of pension entitlements for 
Federal Government employees and retirees, and development of a benefit arrears reduction 
strategy; and 
v)  Public education on pension reform measures to improve management and accountability. 
 
Strengthening of Statistics and Statistical Capacity
 
The Federal Government has recently completed a Masterplan for the National Statistical System with key objective of 
strengthening the capacity of the national statistical system to generate reliable, timely and relevant statistical data to 
support policy making and monitoring achievement of Nigeria’s development objectives.  The following elements of the 
masterplan will be funded under this component:  
‰\03
Organizational and institutional development of the National Statistical System including review and 
Page  4
modernization of legislation and regulations.  
‰\03
Training and re-professionalization of staff.
