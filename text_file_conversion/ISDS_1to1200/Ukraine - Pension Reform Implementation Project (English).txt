B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The objective of the project is to develop the capacity required to create a fiscally 
sustainable and efficient pension system. To achieve this objective, the project will 
strengthen the capacity to implement a fundamental pension reform in existing and 
recently formed agencies managing different parts of the pension system and to achieve the 
synergies  in agencies that manage other social insurance schemes. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Ukraine’s transition towards independence and market economy in the 1990s exacerbated 
problems in the PAYG DB system and ultimately led to its financial collapse. Although a 
comprehensive three-pillar reform was initiated in 1998, Ukraine accomplished initial legislative 
phase by adopting two basic pension laws, Law on Mandatory State Pension Insurance and the 
Law on Non-State Voluntary Pension Funds only in 2003. Implementation of the reform began 
in 2004 with an overhaul of PAYG parameters, including shifting to a German-style points 
system, tightening the link between contributions and benefits, reducing replacement rates and 
changing pension-indexation formulas. While the PAYG reform and introduction of the 
Page  2
voluntary pension system started in 2004, introduction of the second mandatory fully funded 
pillar is conditioned upon a set of macroeconomic and operative conditions which prevent its 
premature launch in the unfavorable macroeconomic framework.  
 
Sector work has included several studies among which a report on Pension reform in Ukraine 
(2000) providing analysis of policy options regarding the new pension system design and 
advising on the major challenges of pension reform to be met. Since the pension reform outline 
underwent changes in terms of adjustment to government policies and decisions, further 
implications have been reflected in Ukrainian CEM Pension Note covering the major 
accomplishments and weaknesses of pension system to be implemented. In addition, the Bank 
has been involved in the pension reform efforts by the PAL operations which supported both 
institutional and policy changes. The studies of the pension reform concept and legal framework 
brought to light the following issues which will require special attention : (a) retirement age 
increase, particularly for Ukrainian women; (b) pension indexation flexibility of "price plus at 
least 20 percent of real wages" will have to be eliminated; (c) privileged pension schemes need 
to be reconsidered along the lines of the funded system; (d) second pillar introduction trigger 
linking it with minimum benefit level in first pillar would need to be removed; (e) recalculation 
of benefits boosts pension deficit and should be at least spread over a time horizon if not 
reconsidered and reduced. For the voluntary pension system to be introduced in 2004, the 
following issues require special attention: (a) development of supervision capacity for voluntary 
pension funds; (b) transition of existing non-regulated pension institutions to pension companies 
complying with the law should be vigorously supervised and enforced; (c) alternative non-
pension framework for Kyivmiskbud-Arkada has to be developed and its reference to pension 
fund should be abolished; (d) introducing more individual choice within second pillar, envisaged 
in the future by the law, could be done sooner. 
 
In addition to pension insurance, a number of other social insurance schemes have been 
established in Ukraine. All insurance systems have been developed on their own, with different 
administration/management structures and not enough analysis of the impact of cumulative 
contribution rate burden on labor costs and the economy. Unification of the current social 
revenue collection structure within a common collection agency is an important reform, which is 
under consideration in Ukraine. Although a decision has not yet been made regarding the final 
structure of the agency (it could be a separate agency providing an independent service for each 
of the funds or it could be placed within one of the existing funds), the Government has set up 
triggers into its annual action plan for 2004 to support the reform through introduction of single 
social insurance contribution and single registry of insured individuals. 
 
To modernize the whole social insurance administration system and create capacities to support 
functioning and supervision of the funded pensions the Government has requested from the WB 
to prepare an investment project. PRIP is envisaged as a comprehensive investment project that 
would address all segments supporting the introduction of the new pension system, prudently 
operated funded pension pillars and establishment of a modern and efficient social insurance 
administration system. For project preparation, the Government requested a PHRD grant fund 
which was approved  for $881,700 and signed on October 14, 2003. PHRD Grant has been under 
implementation in accordance with the program.

2.  Proposed project development objective(s) 
 
The objective of the project is to develop the capacity required to create a fiscally 
sustainable and efficient pension system. To achieve this objective, the project will 
strengthen the capacity to implement a fundamental pension reform in existing and 
recently formed agencies managing different parts of the pension system and to achieve the 
synergies  in agencies that manage other social insurance schemes. 
 
3.  Preliminary project description 
 
Based on the dialogue so far, the Government intends to address the administrative and policy 
issues in the following four areas: (i) integration of social insurance administration, (ii) pension 
fund modernization, (iii) supervision capacity development, and (iv) pension policy analysis, 
monitoring and evaluation and public information provision.   
 
Description of project components: 
Component 1: Integration of Social Insurance Administration
.
This component should 
provide investment for consolidation of common functions of four extrabudgetary funds and 
future health insurance, and create a framework for individual accounts. Common functions 
include registration of insured individuals and contribution payers (employers), maintenance of 
databases, reporting by employers on a personified basis for the employees, collection of 
contributions, control of declared and paid contributions, enforcement of contributions, and 
reporting to insured individuals. Depending on the systemic solution for consolidation, 
investment would include equipment and software, consultant and other services, training 
program for the institution in charge of consolidation, communication links between central 
consolidating institution and other social insurance funds, training and retrenchment of the 
institutions that are consolidating common functions. In case the process yields redundancies in 
staff, the project may finance training and severance program. 
Component 2: Pension Fund Modernization.
 Investment program under this component 
depends on the design of the first component and the decision of the Government as far as 
consolidation outline is concerned. If the Pension Fund of Ukraine (PFU) is designated by the 
Government as the central registry and collection institution, investment program under this 
component will be merged with the previous one and would include strengthening and 
improvement in IT capacity, communication technology, education and training program in 
addition to development of the individual account administration capacity, which has to be 
developed in the PFU. In case the PFU does not perform joint collection, control and reporting 
functions, investment program would include development of the individual account 
administration capacity, strengthening core PFU functions of pension determination and 
delivery, and a comprehensive modernization and restructuring program in accord with the 
consolidation process. 
Component 3: Supervision Capacity Development
.
The new supervision agency has been 
created in Ukraine to regulate the non-banking financial institutions, including mandatory and 
voluntary pensions. Since this is an emerging agency, the project will support strengthening its 
institutional capacity including supervision procedures, IT, training and technical assistance to 
management and staff in order to create a transparent and effective regulatory regime for private 
pensions.

Component 4: Pension Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation and Public Information 
Provision
.
To implement the pension reform and to support long-term social insurance policy 
development, capacities in analyzing, monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of policies 
need to be developed. This component of the project would support the development of the 
capacity of the Policy Planning and Evaluation Unit (PPEU) in MLSP and other divisions of 
relevant ministries and agencies in policy analysis, monitoring and evaluation as well as actuarial 
forecasting. To this end some particular efforts have already been made including the 
development of the model for pension policy quantitative analysis with support from PHRD 
Grant for project preparation activities. Consequently, inter alia, the project will assist in revising 
and finalizing the model within a flexible framework as well as in elaborating a training program 
to use the model for pension policy analysis. It will also support the PPEU to working with 
outside research and public policy agencies for the purpose of policy analysis. The output of the 
Unit would consist of regular evaluation reports, well constructed information collection, and 
policy notes analyzing specific policy issues. In addition, this component would support the 
development of the capacity of MLSP in designing and implementing a comprehensive 
information and education strategy regarding pension reform policies. The project will finance 
public opinion research, basic equipment and production of information materials to be 
disseminated to various target groups. Technical assistance and investments will be focused on 
(i) assisting in establishment of a communication unit in the MLSP; (ii) developing and 
implementing a communication strategy; (iii) conducting Public Opinion Research; (iv) 
producing information materials. 
 
Project Coordination and Management. 
 The project will be an investment operation
coordinated 
by Project Coordination Unit (PCU). Operational expenses of the PCU, including staff salaries 
(non-civil servants), project audits and other PCU related expenses will be financed from the 
project.

E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
No safeguard policies
are expected to apply to the proposed project.  However, attention to 
any potential conflicts will be paid during project preparation by the Borrower, key 
counterpart institutions and the end-users of the PRIP project.
