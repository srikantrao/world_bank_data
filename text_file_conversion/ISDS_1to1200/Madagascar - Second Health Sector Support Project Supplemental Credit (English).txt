A.2. Project Objectives 
  
The Second Health Sector Support Project was approved on December 2, 1999 (with the DCA signed on 
February 3, 2000) and became effective on August 25, 200.  The total project cost is US$44.38 million of 
which US$40 million is provided by IDA, and US$4.38 million by the Government.  The development 
objective of the project is to improve the health status of the population through more accessible and better 
quality health services and more specifically to: (i) improve quality of, and access to primary health care 
services with a focus on rural areas; (ii) support priority health programs with emphasis on endemic 
transmissible disease, reproductive health and nutrition; and (iii) strengthen sector management and 
administrative capacity within the Ministry of Health, and at provincial and district levels to enable 
successful decentralization and sector reform.  Specific indicators include increased accessibility to health 
facilities from 65% to 85%, increased outpatient health facility utilization rates from 0.2 contacts per year 
to 0.6 contacts per year, increased district hospital utilization rates from 50% to 80%, increased 
contraceptive prevalence rates from 9.7% to 17%, increased child immunization rates from 40% to 75%, 
reduced hospital fatality rate in malnourished children hospitalized for nutrition rehabilitation from 20% to 
10% (all by 2006), and finally to maintain the HIV prevalence rate in pregnant women below 0.25 per 100. 
 
The achievement of the development objectives became at risk because of three factors unforeseen at the 
time of appraisal: 
\01\02
In 2000, Madagascar was struck by three cyclones over a three month period; more than 1 million 
people were directly affected, resulting in over 200 deaths and almost 300,000 persons in need of 
emergency assistance.  Much of the health infrastructure in two provinces was destroyed. 
\01\02
During the first half of 2002, political turbulence gripped much of the country, contributing to 
serious socio-economic deterioration and disrupting health service delivery.  
\01\02
Following the end of the political crisis, the new government moved very rapidly to ease the 
financial burden of social services on households and to establish a revised strategic framework 
for the delivery of health services.  
 
A
 
mid-term review was carried out in January 2004 involving all the health sector partners.  The revie
w
concluded that the project was well-managed and on track to meet its development objectives, but that actua
project expenditures were occurring faster than anticipated with the resulting need for a supplemental fundin
g
to protect the current health gains.
 
 
 
A.3. Project Description 
Immediately after the cyclones in year 2000, the project started:  
Page  3
 
 
\01\02
Re-habilitating and re-equipping some 250 health centers (two-thirds of which were concentrated 
in the most affected provinces).  At the time, the World Bank team encouraged the administration 
to use the newly approved IDA health credit instead of resorting to an emergency credit.  The 
country team also reassured the government that extra money for the project would be mobilized if 
needed at the end of the project. 
 
At the end of the crisis, the Project was reoriented and focused on: 
\01\02
providing budget support during the crisis for MOH’s operations and to mitigate the effects of the 
Government’s decision to suspend the existing cost recovery system.  In September 2002, in the 
aftermath of the political turmoil, the new Administration requested Bank support to attenuate the 
impact of the crisis on the population’s access to primary health services and the consequent 
serious deterioration of health and poverty indicators.  The project responded by allocating 
significant additional resources to fight the spread of various diseases and the rehabilitation of 
severely malnourished children in all hospitals countrywide.  Project disbursement was further 
accelerated after August 2002, when the Government announced suspension of the cost-recovery 
program and re-introduced free health services.  While free drug distribution and drug re-stocking 
of SALAMA were financed through HIPC resources, the Project supported the preparatory work 
to re-launch the cost recovery system in a manner consistent with the government’s Poverty 
Reduction Strategy Document. 
\01\02
allocating significant resources to implement the principal priorities of the Ministry’s Business 
Plan for 2002-2005.  The improvements and the initiatives taken by the post-crisis administration 
are allowing the project to disburse more money and implement more activities more efficiently, 
including the increasing use of contracting out specific tasks to NGOs.  Since the administration is 
determined to decentralize and allow a substantially stronger role for the districts and 
communities, the district component of the project has been extended.  As a result, the Project is 
providing money directly to the district level to support their activities and programs.  The post-
crisis improvements also encouraged the World Bank to introduce the PRSC funding approach 
after completion of this project.  The Project through its district component will both strengthen 
the technical skills of the districts and build district capacity to plan and manage increased 
financial resources.  
    
The 22 million USD will serve to continue the activities started during the first three years of the project.  
Since the construction and rehabilitation of health centers is now under the responsibility of the Social 
Protection Project (FID), no additional construction or rehabilitation is envisaged. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
Future project’s activities to be financed by the supplemental will be the continuation of established 
activities and will be implemented throughout the country.  More specifically: 
\01\02
The malaria vector control component:  
\01fi
Annual pyrethrinoid insecticide indoors spraying (at the beginning of the rainy season) in 
durable brick houses (which significantly reduces the risk of environmental contamination) is 
limited to the highland margins (100,000 households) where malaria is unstable.  Most of the 
highland water dams are used to irrigate the agricultural land and contain a larvivorous fish 
(Gambusia) that was introduced a long time ago. 
\01fi
The stable endemic areas for malaria (mostly coastal) will benefit from large-scale 
distribution of pyrethrinoid insecticide impregnated bed nets.  
 
\01\02
The plague vector control components:  
\01fi
Insecticide spraying around the house after a plague case was diagnosed in rural areas is 
limited to 34 plague-affected districts out of a total of 111. 
\01fi
Khartmann boxes to kill the rats (a limited amount of carbanate insecticide is combined to 
disethialone poison) are used in two plague-affected cities, the capital city Antananarivo and 
Mahajanga and are carried out when indicated by the surveillance system (increase in the 
number of dead rats).  The boxes enclose the rat poison to prevent accidental poisoning of 
Page  4
 
 
people or non-target animals and environmental contamination.  The rodenticide that will be 
used will nevertheless be cleared by WHO.   
\01\02
The Medical Waste Management Plan (MWMP) for the HIV/AIDS project, (which has already 
been prepared and disclosed for the that project), is applicable to, and will be used by, health 
facilities under this project.   Therefore, the HIV/AIDS MWMP has been disclosed again (for the 
Second Health Supplemental) with a cover note and a modified introduction to reflect it.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The supplemental credit is not expected not have large scale, significant or irreversible impacts. It has a 
potential to have limited adverse impacts due to use of pesticides for malaria and rat control, and disposal 
of medical waste.  
 
Pyrethrinoid insecticide indoor spraying is geographically limited and carried out once a year. 
Insecticide spraying for the plague vector control is carried out when proven necessary in geographically 
restricted areas. 
 
DDT is being replaced with safe pyrethrinoid insecticides to control the malaria vector, according to the 
2000 insecticide devolution plan adopted by the MOH. 
 
Khartman boxes for rat control will be used in two cities when proven necessary. 
Medical waste is being disposed in the rehabilitated centers following the current protocol, including 
incineration. The project will examine non-incineration alternatives to medical waste disposal. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
None. 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
To safely eliminate medical waste, alternatives are currently being examined by the MOH, particularly 
alternatives to incineration.  The findings are to be implemented by the end of this calendar year 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Pest Management. To progressively replace DDT with environmental safe pyrethrinoid insecticide, in 2000 
Madagascar adopted an insecticide devolution plan.  After WHO agreed on a moratorium to continue using 
DDT in developing countries for financial reasons, Madagascar continued to use this insecticide until the 
2003 campaign.  However, under the constant pressure of the World Bank, and also because some 
pyrethrinoid insecticides became affordable, MOH started using and evaluating alpha cypermethrine (one 
ton) and delta methrine (sixty kilograms).  Furthermore, nine tons of alpha cypermethrine are already 
supplied for the next campaign.    
 
For plague control, the MOH in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute (financially supported by the 
Project) developed a rapid field confirmation test for plague cases, significantly reducing the number of 
insecticide spraying in the neighborhood of the confirmed case. To ensure safe and effective application of 
pesticides for rat control, the borrower will prepare a brief pest management plan. 
 
To comply with the PAD, all rehabilitated health centers were equipped with a burner to burn medical 
waste products (needles, cotton balls, etc.)  Since incineration use is now being put into question, the MOH 
is still examining alternatives to safely dispose medical waste: grinding, steam sterilizing. 
 
Borrower capacity – Pest management:  Madagascar has a long history of using DDT to control the malaria 
vector on the highlands, and of other insecticides to control plague vectors (fleas).  The country benefits 
from experienced technicians and a sustainable schedule of training: every two years all chiefs of sector 
(seven) and chiefs of zones (twenty-four to thirty) are trained in safe use of insecticides; in November 
2003, two technicians attended an one month workshop in Accra, Ghana on integrated vector control; 
until1998 Voarisoa, a local NGO su
pp
orted b
y
 the Swiss 
g
overnment, trained MOH technicians in safe 
Page  6
 
 
disposal of insecticides for malaria and plague control;  in 1996, the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar 
organized a one week training on insecticide impregnated materials; between 1988 and 1993 four health 
staff,  who are now working in relevant departments of the MOH, graduated in medical entomology (2 year 
diploma DEA), in Bouake, Ivory Coast.  
 
Medical Waste Management: A waste management plan was prepared, approved, and submitted to the 
Infoshop for the Madagascar HIV/AIDS Project (effective 11/2002).  The Ministry of Health and Family 
Planning will continually revise the waste management plan, taking into consideration technological 
alternatives not presented in the initial one.  Activities under the proposed supplemental credit will follow 
whatever changes are made to the original waste management plan.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
A waste management plan was prepared, approved, and resubmitted to the Infoshop and  disclosed in 
country for the Madagascar HIV/AIDS Project.  This is the EA document for the current project. 
 
The key stakeholders are the Ministry of Health and Family Planning, the Pasteur Institute, and UN 
Agencies. They were consulted during the preparation of the original project for which this supplemental 
credit provides additional funding.  
 
The PMP will be disclosed in all involved institutes in the country and in the Infoshop as soon as it is 
completed.
