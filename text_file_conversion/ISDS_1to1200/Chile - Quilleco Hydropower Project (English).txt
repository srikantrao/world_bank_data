LENDING INSTRUMENTS: Carbon Finance 
STATUS: Lending 
I.A.2. Project Objectives 
The project objective is to reduce Chile’s power sector dependence on coal and natural 
gas, through the construction of a hydroelectric power plant that will reduce carbon 
emissions from the power sector.  The project would also provide local social benefits 
through increased employment in the project’s surrounding villages during project 
construction and operation. The project would result in an estimated 830,000 tCO2-
equivalent in emissions reductions over the period 2007-2012. 
I.A.3. Project Description 
The Quilleco Hydroelectric Project consists of a run-of-river power plant of 70 MW 
capacity that utilizes the hydroelectric potential of the Laja River, with a firm capacity of 
about 50 MW and an average gross generation of 422 GWh/year.  The project is being 
developed by a private company (Empresa Eléctric Colbún Machicura S.A.) with 
extensive experience in similar projects. This plant will be located downstream of an 
operating run-of-river plant called Rucúe (160 MW capacity), owned by the same 
company. The Quilleco project will use the water released by Rucúe, with a 130 m3/s 
design flow. The project involves technologies well proven in Chile and a simple layout 
consisting of a 8 km aqueduct (including a 3,2 km tunnel), which starts at the point where 
water from Rucúe is currently released to the river bed, a penstock, and a powerhouse.  
The Quilleco project will be connected to the Central Interconnected System (SIC) 
through a 300m and 220 kV double circuit line connected to the Charrúa substation.  
Total project cost is estimated at close to US$80 million. The useful life of the project is 
over 50 years.  The carbon emission reductions will result from displacing thermal power 
generation, mainly coal and natural gas.  The project will contribute to the sustainable 
development of Chile because it will use renewable energy, create jobs, and stimulate 
economic activity in the Eighth Region with low environmental impacts and moderate 
social impacts, which are deemed manageable.

I.A.4. Project Location: 
(Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social 
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or 
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
 
The project will be located in the 8
th
 region of Chile, Province of Bío Bío, Commune of Quilleco, 35 km to 
the east of Los Ángeles city, about 600 km to the south of Santiago. The project site can be accessed from 
Carretera Longitudinal Sur, over Route Q-45 (Los Angeles - Antuco) until Canteras and then 13 km to the 
north over Route N-33-Q  (Canteras – Tucapel) until Laja river bed. Two communes of approximately 
10.000 inhabitants each (Quilleco and Tucapel) were considered for environmental and social analysis due 
to their proximity to the project. Between 300 and 500 jobs would be generated for one commune 
(Quilleco) during the construction phase. Due to geographic conditions, this commune uses no resources 
from the river and shows therefore an open support to the project. In the case of Tucapel, landowners show 
some concern, based on impacts on agriculture and stockbreeding activities that they attribute to Rucúe’s 
construction/operation. No protected areas are affected by the project. One small archeological site was 
found, for which suitable protection measures are considered as well as a contingency plan for other 
potential findings. The project will not generate involuntary resettlements and no indigenous people will be 
affected. The project does not require a dam as it uses water released by the Rucúe project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
II.D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not 
available, describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
 
Page  3
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed 
project. Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or 
irreversible impacts. 
Environmental impacts from this run-of-river hydro project are concentrated in a 2 km 
section of the river downstream from the water intake, and are related to decrease of 
natural water levels; construction-related impacts are minimal. Environmental impacts 
were adequately identified and analyzed in the EIA that was completed in March 1999, 
and suitable protection/mitigation/compensation measures were defined to address 
impacts deemed of some significance, including the following main measures: minimum 
ecological flow of 6 M3/s in the first 2 km downstream and expectation of 13m3/s further 
downstream, reforestation and soil addition in areas affected by works, minimization of 
construction of new roads, procedures for disposal of residues and effluents from works, 
dump site guidelines, protection of natural habitats, monitoring and control dispositions 
(periodic environmental audit), risk management measures and contingency plan. The 
EIA was approved by COREMA (the regional environmental agency) in December 2000 
after a participative review process that involved all authorities and stakeholders as 
defined by law. Although the Quilleco community was appropriately consulted, this 
however was not the case for the people from the Tucapel community, who have voiced 
concerns about possible impacts of the Rucúe project on water levels, soil humidity and 
aquatic life, which would have affected their activities on the north bank of the river 
(small scale agriculture, cattle breeding, some fishing, water supply for some families) 
and would be amplified by the Quilleco project; yet, environment experts from the 
University of Concepción – EULA reviewed these aspects as part of Rucúe’s 
environmental monitoring over the period 1999-2001 and dismissed these concerns in 
their report of December 2002 that concluded that established minimal ecological flows 
ensure environmental sustainability in the projects’ influence areas downstream. [Note: 
still, it would seem that water flow in the Laja river was sometimes below the minimum 
ecological flow established by the environment authority; also there has been a decrease 
in population of some fish species].   
 
With respect to cultural property, one archeological site was found in the area of 
influence. Protection measures are well defined for this particular case. Contingency 
measures for other possible findings are already defined  and local authorities are 
officially informed. The National Monument Law apply in case of other findings; 
sponsor must stop works immediately and inform about finding to local authorities, who 
will assess each finding on a case by case basis. The probability of further findings seems 
low. 
 
[Notes: confirm (i) whether natural habitats safeguards is triggered or not; (ii) whether 
impacts of Rucúe upstream hydropower project should be further assessed (downstream, 
others/) and addressed if found of significance, as part of Quilleco’s EMP; (iii) whether 
MEF is sufficient and how to address deficiencies noted in application of Rucúe’s MEF]. 
 
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than 
one safeguard policy or due to multiple project components.

II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area. 
None detected at this point. 
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required) 
n/a. 
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues. 
HGV, the private company that represents the project sponsor in the negotiation of carbon emission 
reductions credits, has experience in complying with World Bank safeguards through similar hydropower 
projects on the Aconcagua river (Chacabuquito and Hornitos). The project sponsor has a good record of 
environmental compliance in the case of the Rucúe project, as established in the above mentioned report by 
University of Concepción – EULA.  
The EIA addresses project impacts in a comprehensive manner, including water flows and balances, 
watershed-level sustainability, archaeological chance findings procedures, and attention to the welfare of 
downstream water users as well as terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora.  A detailed Environmental 
Management Plan has been prepared. It includes schedule of activities (tailored to project construction and 
operation schedules) and institutional responsibilities.  Independent monitoring and control during project 
construction and operation is included in the EMP in compliance with legal and environmental 
requirements.  
Agreements with the sponsor about actions that were not part of the EIA would include the following: (a) 
Appropriate consultation of the Tucapel community should take place; (b) The sponsor should improve its 
communication policy; (c) The social variable should be included in periodic environmental audits. (d)  
Specific measures should be discussed with the Tucapel community and implemented to permanently 
monitor and reduce environment risks for vulnerable river branches and soil humidity downstream from the 
project (possibly though river bed works); (e) increased attention to be paid to slope stabilization and to 
avoiding contamination of river during construction.
 
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for
 
consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The mechanism for stakeholders consultation is included in Chile’s EIA law since 1997 and was applied in 
Quilleco’s EIA. A project abstract was published in local newspapers and a disclosure period of 60 days 
was respected. In addition, the chronology of the EIA is available on internet (
www.conama.cl
)
and all 
documents related to the EIA are available at the local environmental authority (CONAMA VIII Region). 
Additionally, the EIA is available at the World Bank’s Infoshop and the project sponsor has copies of the 
EIA available upon request. 
 
Stakeholders can be divided into public and private. 10 public authorities, including local, regional and 
national, participated in the EIA process and received a copy of EIA approval. Private stakeholders 
included two communities, Quilleco and Tucapel, located in the area of influence at south and north river 
side respectively. Consultation was adequate for the Quilleco community but insufficient for the Tucapel 
community. This will be addressed by the project sponsor. 
E. Safeguards Classification
