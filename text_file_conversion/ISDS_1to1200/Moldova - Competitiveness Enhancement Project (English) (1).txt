B.  Project Objectives  
The proposed Project would contribute to the new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) objective 
to assist Moldova in creating a competitive market environment to maintain macroeconomic 
stability, sustain economic growth and generate employment.  The project would support 
improvements in the business environment, which are used as indicators for triggering the CAS 
high level scenario.   
The project’s objective is to assist Moldova in enhancing competitiveness of enterprises through 
improvements in the business environment and modernization of the MSTQ system. The 
project’s expected outcomes are:
 
·
reduced regulatory compliance costs of enterprises in accordance with the CAS established 
benchmarks in the areas of licensing and inspections;  
·
strengthened Government institutional capacity for carrying forward the business 
environment reform agenda through the introduction of regulatory impact analysis 
methodology; 
·
upgraded national MSTQ system and improved MSTQ services for enterprises; 
·
enhanced access of enterprises to technical advice supporting their modernization, quality 
improvement, and new product development; 
·
improved access of private small and medium enterprises (SMEs), to investment finance.

Primary beneficiaries of the project would be the business sector, especially SMEs. The 
Department of Standardization and Metrology, the Institute for Standardization and Metrology, 
the Accreditation Center, and other institutions of the MSTQ infrastructure are also expected to 
be major beneficiaries. 
C.  Project Description  
The Project will provide technical assistance and investment financing for strengthening the 
competitiveness of Moldovan enterprises through improving the business environment, 
modernization of the MSTQ infrastructure, and support to the enterprises willing to use the 
MSTQ services.  The project envisions four main components: 
(i) 
Improvement of business environment and reduction of barriers for business 
activities (the Business Environment Component, approximately US$0.5 million
). 
The project would further promote business environment reforms by strengthening 
institutional capacity for deregulation of the newly established Commission for 
Regulation of Economic Activity, its Working Group and Secretariat; assisting in 
identification of a medium-term strategy and priorities in deregulation; sharing 
international experience and best practices in this area; facilitating on-going public-
private dialogue on the matters of business concern supporting introduction of the 
regulatory impact assessment in the legislative process in Moldova. 
(ii) 
Modernization of metrology, standards, testing and quality system (the MSTQ 
Component, approximately US$7.5 million)
.
Underinvested and unreformed MSTQ 
system is among major bottlenecks in improving competitiveness of the real sector in 
Moldova. International experience shows that improvement of national MSTQ systems 
produce high returns for the economy with increased exports to high value markets and 
with import substitution. A successful transition to the modern MSTQ system, adequate 
to Moldova’s needs, would require a medium-term strategy, a program of external 
support and investment into necessary equipment and training. This component would 
strengthen, on institutional level, MSTQ services available to the enterprises, thus, 
contributing to Moldova’s compliance with the WTO requirements, harmonization with 
international standards, and improved consumer protection. This component would 
provide TA and investment funding (equipment) for: a) 
standardization and certification
 
by supporting the transition to voluntary standards through assistance in preparation of 
technical regulations and standards, establishment of the national fund for standards, their 
electronic archiving and distribution; b) 
accreditation and conformity assessment 
by 
training of local trainers and assessors, modernization of the accreditation infrastructure, 
especially in the information technologies, and partial financing of international 
accreditation costs for testing laboratories; and c) 
metrology, testing, and inspection 
with 
the priority to modernize the most frequently used national measurement standards, 
calibration and testing laboratories.  
(iii) 
Facilitation of enterprise access to MSTQ services (the Business Development 
Component, approximately US$1.0 million) 
This component would complement the MSTQ 
modernization process through increasing demand for the MSTQ services among SMEs and 
providing them with incentives to use these services.  The Project will facilitate SMEs access to 
Page  3
external expertise in the areas of productivity, quality, ISO certification
1
,
and diversification of 
production using a matching grant scheme successfully piloted by the Moldovan Export 
Promotion Agency within the EU TACIS project.  Special attention would be paid to clusters 
development, in particular through facilitation of business linkages and provision of business 
development services to groups of SMEs.  
(iv) 
Facilitation of access to finance for Moldovan enterprises (the Finance Component, 
approximately US$1.0 million)
.
The insufficient access to finance, especially investment 
finance, is among major constraints for the sustainable growth of competitive exporters.  While 
increased competition among banks encourages trade financing, medium- and long-term 
financing is still scarce.  The longer-term commercial lending is prohibitively expensive for 
Moldovan firms, and virtually all loans with maturities above one year are financed through 
donors’ funds, which are quickly disbursed, leaving behind a large number of potentially 
efficient projects.  Credit lines provided under the Private Sector Development I (PSD I) and 
Rural Investment and Services (RISP) projects proved to be very effective.  Within this 
framework, the proposed Project would continue to facilitate the access to finance for Moldovan 
enterprises through: a) support for loan guarantee mechanism and b) facilitation of credit 
information system development. If the IDA credit amount can be increased, the option of a 
credit line through commercial banks will be considered.
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The proposed project would mainly operate at advisory/capacity building level in existing 
premises in main cities of Moldova – Chisineu (the Capital) and others.
