                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The objective of the Grant is to support the Republic of Cote d'Ivoire with developing additional
                           studies to inform the Forest Investment Plan.

                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           As this is a preparation grant which only finances studies and consultations, and no physical
                           investments are anticipated, it is assigned EA category "C". Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that the
                           outputs of the studies will further inform the Forest Investment Plan and at a later stage the
                           investment projects which are likely to have environmental and social impacts that will need to be
                           addressed during project preparation. The required environmental instruments will then be prepared
                           in line with the safeguards policies triggerred for the investment projects.
