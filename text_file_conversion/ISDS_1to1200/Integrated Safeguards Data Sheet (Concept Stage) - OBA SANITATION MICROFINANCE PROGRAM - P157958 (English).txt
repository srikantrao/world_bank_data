                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project development objective (PDO) is to increase access to hygienic sanitation facilities for
                           low-income households in rural areas of Bangladesh through commercial sanitation loans.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will support local MFIs to provide sanitation loans to poor households through a nation-
                           wide program in rural Bangladesh. Pre-qualified local construction firms (recipients of MFI loans,
                           who will receive extensive training and capacity building support under the WSP intervention) will
                           construct new latrines for targeted households that meet hygienic sanitation standards.

                           The project will be implemented by two MFIs, Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) and
                           Association for Social Advancement (ASA), who will be the grant recipients. Having dual
                           implementing agencies under the program allows for these organizations to maintain autonomy over
                           their individual business practices, and to reach the maximum number of households with the
                           GPOBA subsidy. Additionally, it will allow for faster scale-up while also serving a diversified set of
                           institutions, since ASA has already been offering a sanitation loan product for over a year (and has
                           disbursed more than 23,000 loans), while the MFIs partnering with PKSF will need to first develop
                           and test the sanitation loan product.
                           The components of the projects are as follows:
                           Component 1 (US$ 1.6 million): Subsidies for household sanitation loans managed by ASA. GPOBA

                           will provide a US$ 1.6 million grant to ASA to improve access to on-site sanitation for-
                           approximately 100,000 low-income households, benefitting 500,000 people in rural areas. A 12.5
                           percent subsidy is available for low-cost technologies ranging from US$ 45 - 128, which will reduce
                           the total purchase price for households unable to pay the entire amount in cash by reducing the cost
                           of financing.

                           Component 2 (US$ 1.1 million): Subsidies for household sanitation loans managed by PKSF.
                           GPOBA will provide a US$ 1.1 million grant to PKSF to improve access to on-site sanitation for
                           70,000 low-income households, benefitting 350,000 people in rural areas. The total subsidy amount
                           for PKSF will be 15 percent of the cost of the latrine, including 2.5 percent to cover PKSF’s project
                           management costs. The technology options will be equivalent to those noted under the ASA
                           component. PKSF will administer the subsidy and implement the project through 20 Partner
                           Organizations (POs), mostly NGO’s with microfinance and WASH sector experience.

                           Component 3 (US$ 300,000): Independent verification agent. ASA and PKSF will select an IVA,
                           either a firm or individual consultants to independently verify outputs and recommend release of
                           subsidy funds. The Bank will provide its no objection for the selection of IVAs and the disbursement
                           of funds.

                           Complementary technical assistance activities executed by WSP. From 2009 to 2015, WSP
                           implemented the technical assistance program, ‘Steps for Sustainable Sanitation Services (4S)’ to
                           help poor households in rural Bangladesh access affordable, high-quality hygienic sanitation
                           facilities from small construction firms trained in building a set of standard latrine models. A follow-
                           on program is being launched, and which the proposed GPOBA project will support.

                           The new program will support demand creation and market promotion, provide follow up support to

                           trained entrepreneurs to ensure quality of construction, involve community leaders and local
                           government, and support MFIs to reach the poorest households. By raising awareness of the need to
                           shift from unimproved to hygienic sanitation facilities, local government agencies and NGOs will
                           help build demand for the loan products offered by PKSF partners and ASA, which will subsequently
                           support a scale-up of the approaches tested.
