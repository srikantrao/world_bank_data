B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
The development objectives of the proposed project are to (a) further improve the equity, 
efficiency and effectiveness of Kerala’s health sector; and (b) develop interventions to reduce the 
large and increasing burden of non-communicable diseases and trauma in the state.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
Component 1: Program Support
.
This component would support the development and 
implementation of policy and institutional reforms in the state’s Health and Family Welfare 
(DHFW) program in the next five years.  Preparation of the Program Support component by the 
Government of Kerala would focus on developing key elements for the five-year program.  It is 
expected that the main areas of health sector reform and development in the next five years 
would include: enhancing the stewardship role of the public sector; furthering human resource 
development within the sector; strengthening decentralized planning through capacity building 
and challenge funds; engaging the private sector in the pursuit of agreed health outcomes; 
rationalizing health infrastructure in the public sector; and strengthening cross-sector linkages 
(e.g., with the roads and transport sector. Bank funded project in the transport sector has a road 
safety component and the proposed project would complement health initiatives being 
undertaken in these ongoing projects and avoid duplication). The program support would be 
based on a Letter of Health Sector Development sketching broad directions of reforms from 
Government of Kerala along with a policy matrix laying out specific actions the government 
Page  2
would carryout, a set of key performance indicators that trigger IDA funding for the second half 
of 5 year program, an agreed 5 year expenditure framework of DHFW; and annual budget 
reflecting of DHFW reflecting specific costs of implementing agreed reforms. 
 
Another major area that would be paid attention within the program would be non-
communicable diseases and trauma.  This part of the program would consist of a series of 
developmental activities within the state’s DHFW (and other relevant institutions) that would 
aim to address in a rational manner the challenges of the increasing burden of morbidity and 
mortality that is resulting from the main non-communicable diseases (diabetes, hypertension, 
cardiovascular disease, cancer, etc.) and from accidents/trauma. There would be two broad 
thrusts: (a) developing a program for the prevention of  non-communicable diseases/trauma and 
addressing related risk factors through life-style changes and consumer education; and (b) 
conducting pilots for financial protection of the poor in the face of catastrophic disease/accidents.  
 
Component 2: Program Coordination, M&E, and Technical Assistance: 
 Through this 
component, IDA would provide 100% financing for certain expenditures critical to the success of 
the five-year program.  The provision of 100% and earmarked financing would strengthen the 
incentive for the Government of Kerala to budget for and actually incur such expenditures.  
These critical expenditures would include those related to: (i) general program coordination 
(because there would be a need for a dedicated, full-time group of staff to coordinate and be a 
focal point for the Bank although the program would be implemented through the existing units 
within DHFW); (ii) monitoring and evaluation, in order to provide adequate tracking of the key 
performance indicators and other important aspects of the program; and (iii) technical assistance 
in the form of experienced consultants who will assist with implementation of the more 
innovative aspects of the program, such as those related to non-communicable diseases.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The entire state of Kerala will be covered under the project 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
Borrower capacity to design appropriate measures for environmental management and 
vulnerable communities’ development is weak within the health sector, but is available in other 
institutions in the public and private sectors.  The Government of Kerala is expected to engage 
consultants to carry out the Environmental and Social Assessments and prepare the necessary 
Environmental Management Plan and Vulnerable Communities Development Plan (VDDP).  
During project preparation, the Bank team will assess the availability of personnel within the 
health system and/or in allied systems to implement, monitor and evaluate the plans. It will then 
reach  agreements with the Borrower to ensure that appropriate capacity is available, created 
and/or contracted in to implement the safeguards.

The EA will identify the environmental issues related to the project and 
recommend appropriate measures to address these. The SWAP provides an 
opportunity to review sector-related policies and institutions and to 
recommend appropriate policies and guidelines to address environmental 
concerns in this sector.  Typically, the environmental issues related to health 
project’s such as this would include: 
Biomedical waste
 generated from health 
facilities; these may require appropriate measures to be put in place to prevent 
adverse impacts on the environment and on public health through air, land and 
water pollution; 
Construction waste
:
While no new construction is planned, 
construction is planned, the project envisages renovation and expansion of 
existing facilities. Under this activity, construction related impacts on the 
environment would need to be mitigated. These could be addressed effectively by 
good construction management, including appropriate consideration of national 
guidelines; 
Water Quality
:
Provision of clean, potable water to healthcare 
facilities is desirable. Improving health in the state would require addressing 
problems such as diarrhea and other water-borne diseases that are caused by poor 
environmental conditions;
 Hygiene and Sanitation
:
To improve environmental 
health conditions issues such as improper and indiscriminate disposal of  solid 
waste, blocked drains, stagnant water within and outside health facilities, rats, 
flies and other pests would need to be addressed by ensuring proper and adequate 
drainage, good indoor air quality and ventilation, sanitation facilities and waste 
management, provision of toilets and proper hygiene in the health facilities.

Kerala has a small and dispersed tribal population that would be a focus of the 
program.  They would be foremost among the “difficult to reach” communities 
for whom the project aims to provide improved access and better quality health 
care, and coverage through innovative health financing and other health 
improvement measures.  Hence, the project is expected to provide benefits to 
them, as called for in O.D. 4.20.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
A.  What actions might be needed during project preparation to assess safeguard issues 
and prepare to mitigate them? 
 
O.P. 4.01.
 
During project preparation, the GOK will undertake an assessment of representative 
sample of healthcare facilities to assess practices related to waste management, including 
segregation, treatment and disposal. The assessment will also include an assessment of additional 
environmental issues that could arise from  project related activities. Based on the findings of the 
assessment, an Environment Management Plan, including performance indicators, according to 
the Bank guidelines (OP/ BP/GP 4.01) will be prepared to identify the mitigatory measures 
needed to be put in place to deal with any adverse impacts of the project activities .   
 
O.D. 4.20
.
A
Social Assessment will be carried out during project preparation to help in the 
planning of appropriate efforts for tribal populations and other vulnerable communities, and a 
Vulnerable Communities’ Development Plan will be prepared to ensure that these groups are 
benefited and not harmed by the project. 
 
B.  How might consultation and disclosure requirements be addressed? 
 
Workshops and/or discussion fora will be organized to discuss and review the findings of the 
Environmental Assessment
.
These fora will be attended by relevant stakeholders, including 
representatives from DHFW, healthcare facilities, district officials, local communities, women’s 
self-help groups, Panchayati Raj Institution members, Non-Government Organizations, etc. 
 
Disclosure: The Environmental Assessment and Environmental Management Plan, including 
environmental issues, proposed mitigation measures and performance indicators will be 
summarized and translated into the local language (Malayalam). Copies of these will be shared 
with the various levels of local government (Zilla Parishads, Village Panchayats, etc), and placed 
on the DHFW website and at other prominent public health locations.  Once the project becomes 
effective, special campaigns for creating awareness will be carried out with support from NGOs 
and the private sector.   
 
The 
Social Assessment
 will include consultations and utilize participatory research methods 
with tribal people and other vulnerable communities.  Members of these communities will also 
be involved in discuss and review the findings of the SA and in preparing the VCDP. These 
Page  5
efforts will also involve other relevant stakeholders, including NGOs, local community groups, 
women’s self-help groups, district officials and PRI members, health officials and staff, etc. 
 
Disclosure: The VCDP, including project plans for tribal people and indicators to measure the 
achievement of these plans, will be translated into the local language (Malayalam) and made 
available on the DHFW website, at other prominent public health locations, and to local 
government (Zilla Parishads, Village Panchayats, etc).
