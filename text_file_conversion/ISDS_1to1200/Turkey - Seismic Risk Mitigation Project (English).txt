A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The overall objective of the project is to initiate a process to transform Istanbul within the 
next 20-30 years into a city more resilient to major disasters.  The ISMEP project will 
contribute to the long-term program to save lives and reduce social, economic and 
financial impacts in the event of future earthquakes. This is expected to be achieved 
through: (i) enhancing the institutional and technical capacity for disaster management 
and emergency response; (ii) strengthening critical public facilities, such as hospitals, 
schools, emergency response centers, etc., for better earthquake-resistance; and (iii) 
development of risk assessment methodologies for commercial, industrial and residential 
buildings and to enhance enforcement of building codes 
 
Following are the key indicators of the expected project outcome: 
 
·
Key public facilities are retrofitted to resist a major earthquake;  
·
Skills and technical capacities of the relevant emergency response units are 
strengthened;  
·
Methodologies for vulnerability assessment of commercial, industrial and 
residential buildings are developed. 
In the higher level strategic context, the project contributes to the objective spelled out in 
Section IV of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Declaration which states the 
goal “to intensify our collective efforts to reduce the number and effects of natural and 
Page  2
man-
made disasters”. 
 
In the most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of October 2, 2003 (Report No. 
26756 TU) and covering the planned assistance program for FY04-06, one of the key 
development objectives for that period is to “increase disaster preparedness and minimize 
losses from natural disasters”.    
 
The project-supported assistance is aligned with the CAS program of poverty reduction, 
which aims at, among others, “making the economy more resilient to crises (including 
natural disasters) that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable”. 
 
Moreover, the project will contribute to the governance agenda through more transparent 
processes for building codes enforcement.  The proposed project will support activities 
which will increase the disaster prevention and management capacities of the 
government, particularly at the regional and local level of the greater Istanbul area. 
 
The World Bank ECA region is now promoting the importance of mitigation and 
improvement of governments’ capacities to respond to emergencies. The underlying 
principle of the strategic framework, as reflected in the recently completed ECA Hazard 
Risk Management Strategy, is that both loss of life and economic impact of disasters can 
be reduced by advance planning and investment, that it is cost effective to do so, and that 
this is governmental responsibility.  The ISMEP fully applies this proactive approach by 
introduction of the disaster mitigation activities which address long-term emergency 
preparedness and risk mitigation measures prior to occurrence of a possible major 
disaster.  
 
A.3 Project Description (please insert) 
 
The project consists of the following components and activities:

·
Monitoring and Evaluation
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
All project investments will be located within the boundaries of Istanbul metropolitan 
municipality, home of about 15 million people and one of the most seismically vulnerable 
cities in the world due to its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, and its 
high population and commercial/industrial densities. According to recent assessments the 
probability of a major earthquake affecting Istanbul in the next 30 years is 62% 
±
12%, 
while the likelihood of such devastation in the next decade is 32% 
±
12%. This is roughly 
comparable to the risk faced by Los Angeles and San Francisco, but with a damage 
potential that is much higher because of Istanbul’s greater structural vulnerabilities.  
 
The ISMEP project will support seismic retrofitting works which will be performed on 
buildings that are already in existence.  The use of innovative, minimally intrusive 
technical retrofitting solutions would be promoted.  Only on a very limited scale, a 
demolition might be necessary of the structures which do not qualify for the retrofitting, 
and construction in their place of safe buildings.  Both types of interventions have   
environmental impacts which are minor to moderate in scale, and which are very 
localized in their extent.  Impacts can be readily defined, mitigated and monitored. 
Project activities will take place in areas which do have cultural heritage values protected 
under local and national laws and practices.  New construction (if required) may take 
place in areas with existing populations and uses/values which must be taken into 
account. Retrofitting and new construction has been successfully carried out in the 
Istanbul area in the recent past (mostly with Turkish funding) without significant impacts.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Potential physical impacts are associated with renovation of buildings for retrofitting, in 
addition to replacement of some structures if needed. Emissions of particulate matter/dust 
to the air, sediment to sewerage systems (or nonpoint source runoff), noise pollution, 
proper disposal of demolition debris or wastes present in the buildings will need to be 
mitigated and monitored.  Special precautions for retrofitting hospitals, schools, and other 
critical facilities still in partial use may be needed. In cases of retrofitting work on certain 
public buildings in Istanbul, the safeguard policy on the Cultural Property may be 
triggered, as potentially some of the publicly used facilities, important for emergency 
response activities, may turn out to either have cultural/historical value, be in very close 
proximity to such properties, or may be located in an overall historic area. Irreversible 
impacts are not anticipated given strong local ordinances and practices regarding cultural 
heritage protection. 
The project will not entail land acquisition or resettlement, as the retrofitting or 
reconstruction will take place on existing sites.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
None are anticipated. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
A
range of potential environmental impacts were assessed and an environmental 
management plan (EMP) was developed by the Borrower which includes attention to 
Cultural Property. Draft and final versions were prepared reflecting consultations, site 
visits, experience with previous Bank projects, and experience with retrofitting projects 
carried out by Turkish authorities.  The EMP includes the mitigation plan, (i.e. measures 
to be taken to control potential impacts), and responsible parties for the mitigation and 
monitoring actions.  As part of the formulation of the EMP, the environmental protection 
regulatory framework was analyzed and institutional arrangements for environmental 
management clearly specified.  Recent rapid changes in laws and regulations to more 
closely adhere to the principles of the environmental 
acquis
 of
the European Union were 
taken into account to the extent possible. 
 
In regard to the Cultural Property safeguard policy, the Bank has in the past reviewed the Turkish 
regulations concerning interventions involving cultural property. The EMP includes an updated review of 
current regulations and practice, and incorporates the appropriate mitigation planning. 
Page  6
According to the team’s assessment, the Borrower (both at the national level and specific 
to Istanbul) has sufficient capacity to implement the measures included in the EMP and 
RPF.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
C
onsultations with key stakeholders, i.e. facilities’ managers, served population, government officials, etc., 
were carried out during EMP preparation.   
Revisions to the EMP planned for disclosure will include a summary of consultations that have been held 
on the draft EMP framework.  During project implementation, location-specific consultations are planned.
