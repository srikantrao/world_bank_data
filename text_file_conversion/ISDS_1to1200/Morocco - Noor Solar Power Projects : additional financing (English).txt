      2. Project Objectives:
      The PDO of the parent project (P131256) is being modified, as part of the restructuring, from “increasing (a)
      installed capacity (megawatt), and (b) electricity output (megawatt-hour), especially during peak hours, of
      the Noor-Ouarzazate Solar Power Project” to “increase innovative solar power generation in Morocco”, so
      that the restructured project can cover both the Noor-Ouarzazate and Noor-Midelt (phase 1) Solar Power
      Projects.

      3. Project Description:
       The Additional Financing (AF) supports the development and construction of the next project in Morocco’s
      solar power program. The Noor-Midelt Solar Power Project is located on 4,141 hectares (ha) of land 20 km
      north of the town of Midelt in central Morocco, in the high plains surrounding the Moulouya river, between
      the Middle and High Atlas Mountains. The first phase of Noor-Midelt consists of two separate plants, Noor-
      Midelt I and II, each with 150-190 MW CSP capacity and a minimum of 5 hours of thermal storage. The
      capacity of the PV component, which is expected to provide daytime generation, is left to the bidders’
      discretion but cannot exceed night-time net capacity from CSP by more than 20 percent. The PV component
      of each plant could be approximately 150-210 MW, making the total capacity of each of the proposed plants
      between 300 and 400 MW and the total capacity of this first phase 600-800 MW, with an overall cost of
      about US$2.1 billion.

      The proposed AF will contribute to finance construction of the Noor-Midelt I and II plants through an IBRD
      financing of US$100 million and a CTF loan of US$25 million, in addition to the US$100 million reallocated
      from Component 2 of P131256. The project will be developed through the formation of a partnership between
      MASEN and a competitively-selected private-sector developer.




                                                                                                  January 2018
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the assessment of environmental
and social risks and impacts:

The Noor-Midelt site is administratively located in the Midelt Province and comprises a total surface of 4141
ha. The site is located on the Haute Moulouya Plateau approximately 20 km Northeast from the town of
Midelt. The site is accessible from the Route Nationale RN13, which links Meknes with Midelt.

The plants are expected to be air-cooled, which significantly reduces their water consumption. Nonetheless,
some water use is still needed for cleaning mirrors, sanitation, and other uses during construction and
operations – the project’s Framework Environmental and Social Assessment (FESIA) addresses issues
related to the plants’ water use and related potential impacts on other users of the reservoir. KfW finances a
Water Resources Study analyzing the impacts of Climate Change on the water availability, future water use
trends and its impacts on water users (this study will be available in first quarter of 2018).

The Borrower (MASEN) has gained considerable experience during the implementation of the ESMPs for
the Noor-Ouarzazate I, II and III projects. The Noor-Midelt solar power project is expected to be very similar,
and MASEN has adequate capacity to implement the project in compliance with World Bank Performance
Standards and Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Guidelines of April 2007. In 2017, MASEN obtained
the certifications ISO 14001:2015 and OHSAS 18001:2007 for the Integrated Management System. The
certification applies to all activities of and all sites managed by MASEN Services. All processes and
procedures required by these standards are established and implemented (legal and regulatory monitoring,
risk and impact assessment, control, audit, training, communication and public consultation, emergency
management plans, management review, etc.).

Noor-Ouarzazate III uses similar technologies as those expected to be used in Noor-Midelt. The project
experienced a fatality in 2016 due to improper implementation of EHS procedure by sub-contractors to the
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractors, and inadequate oversight by the EPC
contractor hired by the private sponsors implementing the project. This accident led to revision of the EHS
procedures and significantly increased oversight by both the EPC contractor and the private sponsors. The
new EHS procedures were deemed to meet the Bank’s EHS Guidelines and have, thus far, been implemented
satisfactorily. The Borrower is expected to rely on this experience in the requirements for Noor-Midelt to
avoid similar accidents in the new project.
