                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           To improve the quality and efficiency of public sector audit, thereby strengthening external oversight
                           over the management of public resources in Sierra Leone
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will consist of the following components:
                           Component 1- Strengthening Professional Capacity
                           The objective of this component is to create professional capacity to support strengthening of the
                           financial oversight roles of the ASSL, and submission of timely quality audits to the Public Accounts
                           Committee to ensure transparency and accountability on the use of public funds.
                           Activities that shall be financed under this component include: i) engagement of a consultant to
                           provide ➢❨ hands-on➢❨ training and development for ASSL in revenue audits. Currently,
                           maximization of revenue collection has become a priority area for Government and donors. As such,
                           the audit of government revenue has become a priority audit focus. As ASSL is limited in capacity in
                           conducting this type of audit, the SAI is seeking support to engage a Consultant to provide hands-on
                           training in this revenue audit to equip skills necessary to undertake this specialized audit on their own
                           in the future; and ii) relevant logistical support.
                           Component 2: Enhanced understanding of ASSL audit reports issued.
                           The objective of this component is to make it easier for the public to read and appreciate reports
                           issued by the institution.
                           Activities that shall be financed under this component include; i) engagement of consultants to train
                           and develop ASSL staff to produce simplified versions of ASSL audit reports including developing

                           pictorial and vocal depictions for the benefit of the public to promote understanding of the audit
                           findings
                           Component 3: Project management, M&E, and Audit
                           This component would finance; i) Project Coordinator within the ASSL who would support and
                           facilitate the interaction among different units within ASSL, and interaction with the PMU and
                           overall project monitoring.
