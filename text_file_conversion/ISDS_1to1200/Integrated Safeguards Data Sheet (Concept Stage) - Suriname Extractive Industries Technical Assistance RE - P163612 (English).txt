                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The development objective is to support Suriname's participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
                           (EITI) towards more transparent and efficient management of its mining and oil sectors.

                           C. Project Description
                           The project will include the following activities:

                           1. EITI, Transparency and Accountability

                           The formal application of Suriname to the EITI was submitted in March 2017 and was accepted on May 24, 2017 at the
                           EITI Board Meeting. The formal MSG has been active since Dec 1, 2016 and a Work Plan has been adopted. This Project
                           will provide support to the implementation of this EITI Work Plan, including providing funding of an Independent
                           Administrator for two EITI reconciliation exercises and providing funding outreach and communications on EITI
                           (including brochures, reports, advisory activities as well as logistics for workshops/events).

                           As Suriname was not a client of the World Bank for years, this Grant executed by Government will be a pioneer.
                           Sufficient resources are allocated to mitigate procurement and financial management risks and strengthen fiduciary
                           functions.

                          E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          This Grant is essentially financing support to an initiative that promotes transparency. The work will consist primarily of
                          reports and workshops to produce information and stimulate dialog in accordance with the EITI standard. It will not
                          fund any civil works that could have adverse environmental and social implications or risks No safeguards instruments
                          are likely to be required.
