                           The Proposed Development Objective of the grant is to build the capacity of DBE to manage and
                           coordinate carbon finance activities.
                           C. Project Description
                           This grant supports the implementation of component 3 of the ENREP- Market Development for
                           Renewable Energy and Energy Efficient Products (MDREEEP). Development of stand-alone
                           renewable energy programs such as Solar Home Systems (SHSs), solar lanterns, improved cook-
                           stoves, biogas plants, and similar activities will support the expansion of access to energy services;
                           especially in areas that are not yet connected to the grid. The target beneficiaries for this component
                           will be the households and villages that are outside the reach of the grid as well as those that are in
                           the grid area but are unable to afford the connection and usage fees.

                           The grant funded activities aim to build capacity of DBE in managing and coordinating carbon
                           finance activities. DBE will coordinate with the World Bank as the trustee of Ci-Dev fund to support
                           development of off-grid renewable energy sector in the Ethiopia. Major activities to be carried out by
                           DBE under the grant include the following.
                           For result a), two ERPAs are signed,
                           •        DBE will carry out consultations with key implementing partners including MoWIE and

                           service providers to agree on carbon revenue sharing arrangement;
                           •        DBE will implement operational procedure on eligibility screening, monitoring of carbon
                           revenue sharing so that DBE can perform as the responsible party for eligibility screening and
                           integrate them into the review process of loan proposals.
                           •        DBE will establish disbursement triggers of carbon revenues.
                           For result b), MRV mechanism is established,
                           •        DBE will supervise the development of monitoring software system and its deployment in
                           the field;
                           •        DBE will organize regional training on program implementation and monitoring for relevant
                           stakeholders.
                           •        DBE will cooperate with WB in the preparation of technical documents of two carbon
                           programs.
                           •        DBE will coordinate and participate in the validation/verification site visits of two carbon
                           programs.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           Through building the domestic capacity of the DBE to manage and coordinate carbon finance
                           activities, this project (ENREP-Carbon Finance Programme of Activities) will indirectly help
                           dissemination of off-gird renewable energy products, such as solar lanterns, solar home system as
                           well as biogas digesters under Component 3 of the ENREP-Market Development for Renewable
                           Energy and Energy Efficient Products. The project itself will not result in any significant
                           environmental risks and/or social impacts.
