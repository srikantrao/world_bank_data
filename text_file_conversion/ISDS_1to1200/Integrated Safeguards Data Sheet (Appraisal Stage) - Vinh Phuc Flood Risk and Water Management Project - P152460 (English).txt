                           The development objective of the project (PDO) is to strengthen flood risk management capacity and
                           improve wastewater management in the central catchment of Vinh Phuc Province.
                            3. Project Description


                                                                      Page 1 of 23
                         The Project includes three interlinked components:

                         Component 1 - Flood Risk Management (estimated cost USD117 million)
Public Disclosure Copy




                         �        This component improves flood risk management through structural measures in Basin B
                         (including sub-basins B-1, B-2 and B-3) and Basin C. The measures include (i) construction and
                         rehabilitation of three retention lakes with a total area of 260 hectares to increase regulation capacity;
                         (ii) construction of three drainage pumping stations with total capacity of 145 m3 per second and
                         related canals to divert excessive storm water from Basin B to Pho Day and Red River; (iii) dredging
                         key sections along 31.62 km of the Phan River to increase the discharge capacity; and (iv)
                         construction of two flood control gates with associated embankments to prevent storm water from
                         Basin C from entering Basin B.

                         Component 2 Water Environmental Management (estimated cost USD17 million)

                         �        The long-term objective of this component is to improve the environmental conditions in
                         densely populated small towns and rural communities, as well as the water quality in the Phan River
                         by providing wastewater and drainage services. The measures include the construction and
                         rehabilitation of wastewater collection and treatment facilities in four district towns and 33 rural
                         villages along the Phan River. Given that the source of pollution is mostly from domestic
                         households, this component will focus on intercepting and treating wastewater. Simple and low cost
                         technologies that will not require sophisticated mechanical equipment, high power consumption and
                         complicated operation and maintenance (O&M) will be applied.

                         Component 3 Implementation Support, Technical Assistance and Institutional Strengthening
                         (estimated cost USD16 million)

                         �        This component supports (i) project implementation including detailed engineering designs,

                         construction supervision, safeguard monitoring, Project Management Office (PMO) support and
                         other related activities; (ii) water resource, flood information and early warning systems, including
                         consulting services, works, equipment and other related activities; (iii) O&M for assets to be built
                         under the project, including training, development of operation manuals, and provision of necessary
                         equipment; and (iv) institutional development for river basin management and water related sectors
                         in an integrated manner.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         1.       Vinh Phuc is a land-locked province located in the north of Hanoi. Vinh Phuc is positioned
                         in three main key development regions of Vietnam: the Red River Delta Region, the Hanoi
                         Metropolitan Region, and the Northern Key Economic Region.

                         2.       The project will be developed in two drainage basins in the center and east of Vinh Phuc
                         Province. Due to its low elevation in the Red River floodplain, two thirds of the province is prone to
                         flooding. There is an especially high risk from flooding in the areas of the Phan River basin where
                         the provincial capital city of Vinh Yen and most of foreign direct investment (FDI) zones are located.
                         Frequent floods have caused serious impacts on agriculture in rural areas, the city of Vinh Yen and
                         the industrial zones and enterprises, including significant loss of agricultural and industrial
                         productivity - impacting on livelihoods - and deterioration of infrastructure in both rural and urban
                         areas.


                                                                       Page 2 of 23
                         3.        The Project works include rehabilitation and dredging of the Phan River and three river
                         networks in Binh Xuyen, construction of pumping stations, regulating lakes, inlet and discharging

                         canals, and Waste Water Treatment
                         4.    The Project plans to finance dredging operations for three natural lakes, including Sau Vo Lake
                         (176.5 ha of total 295 ha), Rung Lake (30.9 of total 150 ha), and Nhi Hoang Lake (from 22.5 ha to an
                         total area of 38.5 ha). The total water surface of the project area is over 5000 ha, of which over 3000
                         ha is used for aquaculture. Comparatively, the total project surface area of all the lakes under project
                         financing during the dry season is only 410 ha: Sau Vo 250 ha, Rung 140 ha, Nhi Hoang 20 ha. Of
                         the total water surface area under the Project, it is estimated that 180 ha (44%) is currently used by
                         132 households for aquaculture. There will be some permanent and temporary land acquisition
                         required and dredging activities may also impact current fishery activities. Research undertaken by
                         the ESIA consultant indicates endangered species in Red River are located about 20 km upstream of
                         the Project area. According to information provided by Vinh Phuc DONRE and Department of
                         Agriculture, there are no endangered and rare fish species in the Phan River section within the
                         Project area. No migratory fish species were detected or recorded in the lakes, nor in the Phan, Red,
                         or Ca Lo Rivers.

                         5.    The Project requires dredging of sediments in Phan River, Binh Xuyen river network, Rung
                         Lake, Sau Vo Lake, and Nhi Hoang Lake. In addition, at the construction areas of the proposed
                         pumping stations and Waste Water Treatment Plants (WWTPs), the construction process also
                         requires the removal of surface sediments (sludge) and underlying soil layers. These materials after
                         being dredged will be transported to Kim Xa, and Dong Mong disposal sites. Siting of the disposal
                         sites underwent rigorous alternatives analysis, and sited chosen were located where control capacity
                         is higher, and the construction cost and the number of affected households are lower. The distance
                         from Dong Mong site to the nearest residential area (about three households) is about 500m while the
                         distance from Kim Xa site to the nearest households is about 1km.

                         6. There is a land subsidence risk at the Dong Mong disposal site as it will be 3m higher

                         surrounding area – as such, appropriate construction measures will be adopted to prevent accidents
                         and protect nearby households. There is no land subsidence risk to Kim Xa disposal site as the
                         material is filled in the low land area.

                         7. Three pumping stations under the Project will drain into the Red River, directly from Nguyet
                         Duc and Ngu Kien pumping stations and indirectly from Kim Xa pumping station via Pho Day River.
                         The Red River is recognized as an international waterway with total length of 1,149 km originating
                         from China, running through Vietnam before entering East Sea. As such, OP 7.50 has been triggered,
                         and notification will be made to China.

                         8. The Project also includes construction of five centralized wastewater collection and treatment
                         facilities and some cascade pumping stations which divert water to centralized WWTPs in some
                         towns (two stations in Yen Lac town, one station in Tam Hong town, and two stations in Tho Tang
                         town. For Huong Canh, wastewater will be collected and transported to Quat Luu WWTP).
                         Approximately, each station can serve for 20,000 people. Also included in the Project is construction
                         of 33 small-scaled WWTPs in rural areas, each serving a minimum of 500 people. These WWTPs are
                         distributed along Phan River (within 3 kilometers from the river).

                         9. Accelerated deterioration of water quality has been observed in Phan River catchment,
                         including rivers and lakes around Vinh Yen City. The main water pollution sources are domestic and

                                                                      Page 3 of 23
                         industrial wastewater; organic pollutants are the main source of pollution, especially high level of
                         biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (SS). While industrial zones have their
                         own wastewater treatment facilities, domestic wastewater is discharged without any treatment,

                         especially along the Phan River. In some areas the garbage from the village is thrown on the banks of
                         the rivers and lakes. Surface water quality no longer meets the national Category A standard (for
                         water supply purpose) and, in the dry season, is well below Category B (for irrigation purpose) in
                         some cases.

                         Several key site-specific impacts of the Project have been
                         identified in the ESIA report and mitigation measures,
                         along with ECOPs, are proposed specifically as follows:

                         (a)      Risk of erosion and subsidence of the river and
                         lake banks. Mitigation measures include: Conducting
                         geological and hydraulic surveys prior to construction
                         (b)      Local inundation impacting local populations.
                         The PMU will ensure that detailed design will provide
                         installation of temporary and permanent drainage to avoid
                         potential flooding, and disruption to the irrigation system
                         in the project area during construction and operation.
                         (c)      Impact of dredging process to water quality and
                         aquatic life and downstream users:. (i) The dredging
                         process will be carried out successively in sections, with
                         the application of sheet piles surrounding each section to
                         prevent the impact to other surrounding sections/areas; (ii)
                         Dredging activities shall only be carried out in the dry
                         season; and (iii) Stream diversion will be carried out to
                         ensure that the flow is not being disrupted.
                         (d)      Construction of disposal sites. The key impacts
                         due to the construction of disposal sites include the dust,
                         odor and gases generated dredged sludge; improper

                         disposal of contaminated excavated materials to the
                         designated disposal site; and land subsidence risk at Dong
                         Mong disposal site during construction. Mitigation
                         measures include: (a) The disposal of waste at the
                         disposal sites may generate dust; therefore green trees will
                         be planted around the site to minimize dust into the air.
                         Regular spraying will take place. If the disposed sludge
                         materials still generate odors and gases, spray daily with
                         biological products and sprinkle with lime to prevent
                         odor. (b) To prevent the soil erosion and land subsidence
                         risk at Dong Mong disposal site, the site will be divided
                         into 13 cells and material will be filled in successively in
                         each cell. During the disposal process, the cell will be
                         compacted carefully and soil embankment surrounding
                         each cell to prevent soil erosion.

                         Cumulative Impacts: The ESIA conducted a review of
                         related recently completed and ongoing investments in
                         Vinh Phuc to identify possible linkages and potential

                                                        environment were also evaluated in terms of effects on
                                                        water quality, aquatic biodiversity, the quality of life of
                                                        local communities, and effects on downstream water use.

                                                        Cumulative impacts of the ongoing and proposed projects
                                                        in the Project Area are positive, in that through the
                                                        installation of waste water treatment plants in both
                                                        residential areas and industrial parks, the pollution load of
                                                        untreated waste on the rivers are reduced. Moreover,
                                                        several projects lead to improved flood control, which has
                                                        economic and health and safety benefits to local
                                                        communities. The existence the dredge disposal sites and
                                                        extrajudicial sand extracting activities in the Project Area
                                                        does continue to place pressure on river water quality, and
                                                        it is suggested that Vinh Phuc authorities, in collaboration
                                                        with the Department of Natural Resources and
                                                        Environment (DONRE), prepare a management plan to
                                                        curb and control these activities, and restrict release of
                                                        these materials into the river.
                         Natural Habitats OP/BP   Yes   The Project lies along three rivers. The Phan River
                         4.04                           originates from Tam Dao, flowing through districts of
                                                        Tam Duong, Vinh Tuong, Vinh Yen City, Yen Lac before
                                                        entering Ca Lo River in Huong Canh District and then
                                                        flowing through Me Linh District (Hanoi) to Cau River.

                                                        The average width of the river is from 10 m - 30 m, with
                                                        an average depth of 1.5 m - 3.5 m. The Phan River serves
                                                        as the main drainage system for the region, and is also a
                                                        system of large irrigation supplying water for about 8000
                                                        ha of farming land. The survey showed no aquaculture
                                                        activities in the vicinity of the Project area. There are only
                                                        8 households fishing on the river during off-season
                                                        period.

                                                        The river water quality is now increasingly degraded and
                                                        polluted by waste water from residential areas,
                                                        agricultural areas, some craft villages and service
                                                        businesses. In short, the variety of biodiversity in Phan
                                                        River is assessed as poor. According to the information
                                                        provided from Vinh Phuc DONRE and Department of
                                                        Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD), there is no

                         the project, directly from Nguyet Duc and Ngu Kien
                         pumping stations and indirectly from Kim Xa pumping
                         station via Pho Day River. The river section has an
                         average width of about 1.5 km and depth of 5.0m. The
                         field survey along the river section from Viet Tri (Phu
                         Tho Province) to districts of Vinh Tuong and Yen Lac
                         (Vinh Phuc Province) and Me Linh District (Hanoi)
                         recorded no aquafarming activities while about 50
                         households live on fishing. This is also the only river in
                         Vinh Phuc having waterway transportation of about 20
                         trips a day.

                         According to the biodiversity on the existing condition of
                         Red River (2010), there are some endangered species at
                         the Red River confluence area with Da, Thao, and Lo
                         Rivers - which is about 20 km upstream of the project
                         area at Ngu Kien pumping station. Among 91 recognized
                         species, 12 species belong to six families and four genera
                         in the 2007 List of Threatened Species of Vietnam.
                         However, according to the information provided from
                         Vinh Phuc DONRE and Department of Agriculture, there
                         is no endangered and rare fish species in the Red River
                         section at the project area. No migratory fish
                         catadromous/anadromous species is detected and recorded
                         in the project area of influence.

                         It is estimated that a total of discharge flow of 115 m3/s
                         will be pumped from the two Pumping Stations (PSs) of
                         Ngu Kien and Nguyen Duc to Red River and 30 m3/s
                         from Kim Xa PS to Pho Day River. However, water then
                         flows to Pho Day River to Lo River and back to Red
                         River (17 km upstream of Ngu Kien PS discharging
                         canal). Therefore, the water flow in Red River will be
                         increased by a total of 145 m3/s from the 3 PSs, which is
                         insignificant compared to the maximum drainage capacity
                         of 18,000 m3/s in storm season.

                         Ca Lo River in the Project Area has an average river
                         width of 20 m and depth of 1.7 m. There are no
                         aquafarming activities in the river and about 22
                         households are fishing there during off-season period.

                         Under the project, two control gates, Sat Bridge and Ton
                         Bridge will be constructed. During the flood season, these

                         Lo River. These will result in improved flood control
                         measures.

                         town people committee renewed annually; and a lakeside
                         area of 45 ha which is used for farming in dry season by
                         258 households. The survey found that the fish farmed by
                         local households include barb, tilapia, grass carp and
                         common carp. Other aquatic species are shrimp, crab,
                         goby fish etc.

                         grass carp and common carp. The lake is surrounded by
                         permanent agricultural land.

                         Under the VPFRM, the Nh i Hoang lake will be dredged
                         and rehabilitated to an area about of 38.5 ha, to the depth
                         of 1.8 to 2.0 m, with the capacity of 750,000 m3.

                         Both lakes are currently fish farmed on annual contract
                         basis (and 35 households in Nhi Hoang Lake, 20 ha). Fish
                         raised include barb, tilapia, grass carp and common carp.
                         Other aquatic species are shrimp, crab, goby fish etc. No

                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              Project activities have positive impacts for the control and minimization of floods and for the
                              improvement of the riverine environment through the establishment of WWTPs, all activities
                              aligned with the masterplan of Vinh Phuc urban development until 2030 with vision to 2050.

                             Several key site-specific impacts of the Project have been identified in the ESIA report and
                             mitigation measures, along with ECOPs, are proposed specifically as follows:

                             (a)     Risk of erosion and subsidence of the river and lake banks.
                             (b)     Localized flooding impacting local populations.
                             (c)     Impact of dredging process on water quality and aquatic life and downstream users.
                             (d)     Construction of disposal sites. The key impacts due to the construction of disposal sites
                             include the dust, odor and gases generated dredged sludge; improper disposal of contaminated
                             excavated materials to the designated disposal site; and land subsidence risk at Dong Mong
                             disposal site during construction.

                             Transportation of dredged material to disposal sites, if not properly organized and scheduled, will
                             expose sensitive receptors to noise and dust, and restrict access, This impact is temporary and will
                             occur during the construction period. Sensitive receptors include several schools, one market, one
                             clinic and one pagoda at a distance of 30-70m to the transportation routes. If the transport

                          Due to heavy aquaculture in the three regulatory lakes, and the fact that they do not contain
                          migratory species according to DONRE and DARD, impacts on aqua fauna in the lakes caused by

                          dredging activities will not be significant. A detailed fishery survey of the three lakes, including
                          fish diversity and productivity (open and capture fishery) will be undertaken prior to dredging and
                          impacts of dredging and the project as a whole on fishery be further assessed and ESMP updated
                          based upon this survey/study.

                          A dam safety assessment report has been completed during project preparation for Thanh Lanh
                          and Xa Huong. The calculation results showed that the Project interventions do not directly affect
                          these dams. However, as the dams are located upstream of the project area their safety is likely to
                          have an impact on the project area. The dam safety reports for Xa Huong and Thanh Lanh
                          Reservoirs concluded that Xa Huong Dam is an unsafe dam, which requires major remedial works,
                          and Thanh Lanh Dam is at an acceptable condition, with minor remedial works. Based on the
                          operational rules as mentioned, Xa Huong Reservoir shall be operated at a safe water level with
                          the limit set forth in the operational rules as prepared and approved by the relevant authorities until
                          the major remedial works have been successfully completed. Details of the evaluation and
                          measures to ensure dam safety are described in the safety assessment report for dams of Thanh
                          Lanh and Xa Huong.

                          A Social Assessment (SA) was conducted alongside the Environmental Assessments of the
                          project, and on the basis of the Feasibility Study. The findings indicate that the overall project’s
                          impacts are positive. However, some adverse impacts and permanent are not avoidable. These
                          include: a) permanent loss of land (mostly for agricultural land) to allow construction of small-
                          scale roads, dredging of lake, river) and b) (b) temporary impacts ( in the project area and
                          downstream users), affecting livelihoods and causing income loss due to dredging; and temporary
                          impacts on farming and fishing activities, due to construction operations. Both permanent and
                          temporary impacts (on land and farming activities) will be compensated for - as per project’s RPF.
                          Efforts will be made through considering technical engineering design options, and construction

                          measures, to minimize the adverse impacts.

                          Even though EMs are mainly present in the province mostly upstream, few groups are present and
                          scattered in the project area or downstream. In the subproject of Binh Xuyen 3 rivers system (first-
                          year subproject), the EM groups were consulted and an Ethnic Minority Development Plan
                          (EMDP) was prepared on the basis of the results of a social assessment and consultations. The
                          results of the analysis for the Binh Xuyen 3 rivers system subproject confirmed that the overall
                          impact from this subproject is positive, whereas the anticipated negative impacts could be avoided
                          during construction. Consultations with EMs were conducted in a free, prior and informed manner
                          including the project activities, potential impacts (adverse and beneficial), and soliciting their
                          feedback, views, concerns and recommendations. With the information available and provided to
                          the EMs consulted, they indicated their broad community support for subproject implementation

                           Gender analysis was conducted as part of SA for each subproject, and a gender action and
                           monitoring plan was developed to promote gender equality and community participation.
                         2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                           in the project area:
                           Aquaculture is expected to be limited by expanding urbanization as detailed in the Vinh Phuc
                           strategic planning process. Project interventions may reduce the annual loss on agricultural yield


                                                                     Page 15 of 23
                           caused by flooding but not increase annual crop growth or expand agricultural land, as the focus
                           will be on increased urbanization, which must be sustainably managed to minimize increases in air
                           and water pollution. The ESIA conducted a review of related recently completed and ongoing

                           investments in Vinh Phuc to identify possible linkages and potential cumulative impacts in relation
                           to the proposed Project. In addition to the positive and negative impacts of related infrastructure
                           projects, cumulative impacts of industrial parks, sand extraction and borrow pits on the area’s
                           environment were also evaluated in terms of effects on water quality, aquatic biodiversity, the
                           quality of life of local communities, and effects on downstream water use.

                           Cumulative impacts of the ongoing and proposed projects in the Project Area are positive, in that
                           through the installation of waste water treatment plants in both residential areas and industrial
                           parks, the pollution load of untreated waste on the rivers are reduced. Moreover, several projects
                           lead to improved flood control, which has economic and health and safety benefits to local
                           communities. The existence the dredge disposal sites and extrajudicial sand extracting activities in
                           the Project Area does continue to place pressure on river water quality and it is suggested that
                           Vinh Phuc authorities, in collaboration with the Department of Natural Resources and
                           Environment, prepare a management plan to curb and control these activities, and restrict release
                           of these materials into the river.
                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           A detailed alternatives analysis was conducted, examining scenarios including a without project
                           option, and different technical options for the investment components of the Project.
                           In the absence of the proposed project, the development of residential areas, urban and industrial
                           areas with associated ground clearance is likely to reduce the area of existing lowlands that in turn
                           shrink capacity to regulate regional water flow. The maximum flooding level will likely lead to
                           greater flooding for the project area. In the absence of the WWTPs water pollution in the rivers
                           will worsen.

                           THE ‘WITH PROJECT’ ALTERNATIVE

                           1. Alternatives for scale and capacity of pumping stations

                           With each sub-basin B1, B2 and B3, four alternatives to capacity and scale of construction of
                           pumping stations were considered. Precipitation frequency and design flow of repeating floods
                           were calculated for 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, and 25 years.
                           Scale and capacity of the pumping stations and supporting infrastructure was based on drainage
                           capacity, controlled flood area, and the potential environmental and social impacts.

                           2. Alternatives for siting of pumping stations

                           For each pumping station several alternatives to siting were proposed and considered with its
                           auxiliary construction such as inlet canal, outlet canal, regulating lake in front of the station etc.
                           The consultant preparing the Feasibility Study analyzed social and environmental impacts
                           regarding soil excavation and backfilling volume, acquired land area, geographical conditions and
                           durability of the construction work and possibility of utilizing the existing works. Alternatives to
                           siting were proposed and considered with its auxiliary construction such as inlet canal, outlet
                           canal, regulating lake in front of the station etc.

                          disposal sites proposed for the Project: namely Kim Xa, Vinh Ninh, Dong Mong.

                          �        For Dong Mong site, no alternative was considered. The only option for Dong Mong
                          disposal site is located within the administrative boundary of Huong Canh Town in Binh Xuyen
                          District. The disposal site area is 54.31 ha and of agricultural land without any house or structure
                          built thereon. This conclusion stemmed from consideration of the local environment and technical
                          requirements and was reached in close consultation with local people and authorities

                          �        Kim Xa site is located in the lowlands within Pho Day River alluvial land area with an
                          initial design area of 10.3ha. However, flood drainage of Pho Day River would be affected when
                          flood levels surpass 11.0m elevation. Hence it was recommended that dredged material with heavy
                          metal content not exceeding QCVN 03:2008/BTNMT for agricultural land may be disposed in the
                          site but the elevation of the disposal site should not exceed the surrounding area (+ 11.5m).

                          �        Vinh Ninh disposal site is located outside the secondary dyke of Red River, at the flood
                          plain of the Red River. The disposal site was proposed to be designed average elevation of +15.58
                          m while the elevation of the surrounding floodplain area is only 12.80 m; which leads to the
                          consequence that the Red River flood drainage capacity will be greatly affected. Therefore, the
                          ESIA recommended that Vinh Ninh disposal site be removed from options for consideration.

                          Based on these recommendations, the Kim Xa disposal site area has been redesigned to 3.82ha
                          with an elevation of 11.5m and Vinh Ninh disposal site will not be used for the Project.

                          Alternatives analysis to the types of drainage system for towns and rural areas

                          Three alternatives were considered for wastewater collection and treatment systems proposed for

                          both towns and rural areas, including 1) using existing combined drainage system which has no
                          interceptor, 2) construction of new separated system and 3) using existing combined drainage
                          system. Considering economic costs and environmental and social impacts, the third option was
                          selected, i.e., the efficiency of wastewater treatment and collection are relatively good, the cost is
                          acceptable and it is consistent with the planning.

                          Alternatives to technologies used for the wastewater collection and treatment system

                           Based on projection of population, estimate of water consumption and average wastewater
                           volumes in the rural areas and towns, and the scale of wastewater treatment facilities the proposed
                           option for treatment technology was the choice of a septic tank in combination with ecologically
                           sensitive plant filtration. The process will be wastewater → trash filter → septic tank → plant
                           filtration → recipient source.
                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           Several site-specific impacts of the Project have been identified in the ESIA report and mitigation
                           measures, along with ECOPs, are proposed specifically as follows:

                          Risk of erosion and subsidence of the river and lake banks. Mitigation measures include:


                                                                     Page 17 of 23

                         Localized flooding impacting local populations. Construction sites are mostly located in areas
Public Disclosure Copy




                         adjacent to waterways or in agricultural areas (consisting of in-field irrigation canals). Therefore,
                         the construction activities could have an impact on regional flow regimes and cause local flooding.
                         Mitigation measures are proposed that before construction of each building, the contractor must
                         perform the diversion measures to ensure the local flow and the construction location shall be well
                         fenced to prevent construction materials from entering into surrounding waters. The construction
                         process shall be limited to the dry season. The PMU will ensure that detailed design will provide
                         installation of temporary and permanent drainage to avoid potential flooding, and disruption to the
                         irrigation system in the project area during construction and operation.

                         Impact of dredging process to water quality and aquatic life and downstream users. (i) The
                         dredging process will be carried out successively in sections, with the application of sheet piles
                         surrounding each section to prevent the impact to other surrounding sections/areas; (ii) Dredging
                         activities shall only be carried out in the dry season; and (iii) Stream diversion will be carried out
                         to ensure that the flow is not being disrupted.

                         Construction of disposal sites. The key impacts due to the construction of disposal sites include the
                         dust, odor and gases generated dredged sludge; improper disposal of contaminated excavated
                         materials to the designated disposal site; and land subsidence risk at Dong Mong disposal site
                         during construction. Mitigation measures include: (a) The disposal of waste at the disposal sites
                         may generate dust; therefore green trees will be planted around the site to minimize dust into the
                         air. Regular spraying will take place. If the disposed sludge materials still generate odors and
                         gases, spray daily with biological products and sprinkle with lime to prevent odor. (b) To prevent
                         the soil erosion and land subsidence risk at Dong Mong disposal site, the site will be divided into
                         13 cells and material will be filled in successively in each cell. During the disposal process, the
                         cell will be compacted carefully and soil embankment surrounding each cell to prevent soil
                         erosion.

                         Dam Safety: The project does not involve the construction of any new dam. However, there are
                         dams in the project area and two of them, i.e. Xa Huong Dam and Thanh Lanh Dam, are located
                         upstream of project supported structures. During the project preparation and to comply with the
                         requirements of OP/BP4.37, the Vinh Phuc Province engaged a dam safety review team led by a
                         competent dam safety expert to conduct the dam safety review and two dam safety assessment
                         reports were prepared and submitted to Vinh Phuc Province. Based on the conclusions of these
                         two reports, Xa Huang Dam was classified as an unsafe dam, which requires major remedial
                         works, and Thanh Lanh Dam as a safe dam, which requires only minor remedial works. In
                         addition, proper Operational and Maintenance Manuals, Reservoir Operational Rules and
                         Emergency Preparedness Plans were required to be prepared and put in place for these two dams
                         as immediate actions to be taken, which are detailed in the Report on Dam Safety and the ESIA.

                         Social/resettlement: Since subprojects will be identified during the project implementation phase,
                         a framework approach has been adopted for the project. Vinh Phuc PMO prepared a Resettlement
                         Policy Framework (RPF), and an Ethnic Minority Policy Framework (EMPF) to guide the
                         preparation of RAP and EMDP to ensure where land acquisition (both permanent and temporary)
                         are not avoidable, compensation is provided to the affected households and their livelihoods are
                         not worsened off as a result of the project.

                          Vinh Phuc has limited experience in implementing safeguards instruments of World Bank funded
                          projects. The timely preparation of the three RAPs and the EMDP has demonstrated capacity for
                          the preparation of safeguards documents. During project preparation, a PMO to support project
                          preparation, has been established under the Vinh Phuc Department of Investment and Planning.
                          This PMU will be upgraded to report directly to Vnh Phuc PPC and continue to operate as a focal
                          team responsible for implementation of safeguards documents, as well as for obtaining the
                          necessary approvals, from the World Bank and from provincial Government of the mentioned
                          related safeguards.

                          For project implementation, it is anticipated that the enhanced environment and social safeguards
                          implementation support given the nature of the project and limited counter-part capacity, will be
                          required from the Bank.

                           It is anticipated that PMO will hire the services of a local Environment & Social firm to support
                           the review the safeguards documents and also to support the supervision of the implementation of
                           the ESIA and the social instruments. In addition, an Independent Third Party Monitor will be
                           engaged by PMO to carry out regular, independent monitoring and evaluations of subproject
                           RAPs, EMDP(s), EMPs, and others, to ensure implementation compliance with the approved
                           safeguards instruments, as per de defined Bank’s policies.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           The principal project direct beneficiaries and stakeholders are households in the affected the
                           subproject’s river basins who will benefit from reduced flooding and improved environmental
                           conditions (management of water pollution) as a result of Project interventions.

                           Extensive consultations were conducted at subproject level, with both adversely affected
                           households and beneficiaries. The consultation results were the basis for the preparation of the
                           social safeguards frameworks, the RAPs and EMDP. During consultations, participants expressed
                           their support for investments under the project because of the overall benefit of the sub-projects,
                           and the project as a whole.

                           Participants also expressed their concerns about receiving adequate compensation rates related to
                           land acquisition as well as the need to have the required measures to minimize the impacts during
                           construction phase. All the local concerns and recommendations were incorporated into the
                           instruments prepared (frameworks, RAPs and EMDP).
