B.  Project Objectives  
 
Upon successful completion of the project, residents of the poor communities attended will have 
improved access to reliable basic municipal and social services in a sustainable manner and their 
municipalities will be better equipped to work with other deprived communities to achieve similar results. 
Specific objectives are: (i) increasing access to basic urban services by poor urban households through 
targeted investments; (ii) strengthening human and social capital in poor neighborhoods through 
increasing community participation in the planning, delivery and maintenance of works and services; and 
(iii) improving the capacity of municipal governments to plan and deliver urban services, and to prevent 
crime and violence. Assistance to municipalities will support government’s ongoing efforts to 
decentralize service provision and key regulatory functions to municipalities. 
 
C.  Project Description  
Several options were reviewed during Bank-GOH discussions.  Among these were whether the proposed 
project should have a bottom-up or top-down focus, whether it should be like the Honduras Social Fund 
(FHIS), to what degree it can use existing systems and mechanisms developed by other actors in the 
sector, and whether it should have a nationwide or smaller group of participants.  After lengthy 
consideration of these and other such factors, it was decided that the proposed project will have a 
municipality-community partnership focus with a great deal of decision-making done at the community 
level and it will, to a large degree, use a system of self-selection (under which participants are selected 
based upon certain eligibility criteria).  A basic rationale for this approach is that it could build upon a lot 
of the work already done by many other sector actors (e.g. IDB ongoing TA for decentralization), offers a 
flexible approach in which municipalities can employ the most efficient arrangements for service delivery 
Page  2
 
 
from the diversity of local options (e.g. private provision, community 
juntas, patronato
-municipal 
partnerships, etc.), and could demonstrate simple but effective ways of promoting integrated community 
development while bypassing some of the major obstacles (e.g. the current revenue- sharing system), 
which continue to impede needed sector changes. 
   
The GOH has requested, in parallel, a rural infrastructure project and it has been decided that in view of 
the respective complementarities, and the country’s on-going decentralization efforts, that both operations 
are prepared with coordinated timetables and that implementation arrangements are similar.
 
 
D.  Project location  
 
Mostly intermediate cities in Honduras. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The proposed executing agency, SOPTRAVI, has executed several Bank transport and public works 
projects in the past, and therefore has the capacity to ensure the compliance with safeguard policies. 
Nevertheless, the division that will be in charge of this operation, housing and urbanisms, has been 
recently created and will need TA as well as inter-institutional coordination with the transport and public 
works divisions to assume safeguard compliance responsibilities.
