A.2. Project Objectives
In 2001 the government initiated a consultative process which resulted in Yemen's Basic Education
Development Strategy (BEDS), the objective of which is to achieve universal access to primary education
by 2015. The Basic Education Development Program (BEDP) will support the government's basic
education initiatives and the strategy proposed in the BEDS both of which are consistent with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy. In particular it will support policy and institutional reforms which aim to
expand access to basic education in a sustainable way. The objective of BEDP is to assist the government
in achieving quality basic education for all with special attention to gender equity.

The Bank's current Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen (2002-2005 Report No 24372-YEM),
discussed by the Board of Directors on August 6, 2002, proposed Bank support to Yemen in four major
directions: (i) improving public sector governance; (ii) building human capital, emphasizing girls'
education, health, and capacity building; (iii) ameliorating infrastructure; and (iv) granting social
protection. The current project directly supports the first two objectives and indirectly the two others.
The Government of Yemen's PRSP identifies better human capital and improved governance through
public sector rationalization, and efficiency of public resource use as particularly important in addressing
poverty and inequality. In human capital development, the PRSP emphasizes the need to expand basic
education and to close the gender gap in basic and secondary education. BEDP will directly contribute to
this higher level objective and will develop a better link between basic and secondary education.
A.3. Project Description
BEDP will build on the successes of BEEP. It will be implemented over the entire country over a five year



period. The project will achieve its objective with three components: (i) expansion of access; (ii) quality
improvement; and (iii) institutional change and capacity building of the Ministry of Education MOE.
Expansion of access: Schools construction, rehabilitation, equipment, furniture, technical assistance and
training will be key inputs to achieving the component objective which is to increase the enrolment and
retention of students. The component will include: (i) refining criteria and tools for the selection of school
sites in underserved areas; (ii) developing low cost school building designs for different geographical areas;
(iii) school construction including the provision of facilities for handicapped pupils; (iv) promoting the
efficient use of school facilities including double shifts; (v) promoting efficient and equitable teacher
deployment; (vi) promoting girls education using a range of tools; and (vii) providing incentives to families
for enrolling and keeping girls in school.
Quality Improvement: Teachers training, schools supervision, and technical assistance will be the primary
tools to achieve the component objective of improving the quality of education. The objective will be
achieved by identifying and providing additional resources to deliver quality-focused interventions. The
emphasis will be on improving the curriculum, enhancing provision of educational materials, and
supporting teacher management and training. School and classroom-based reforms will be supported to
enhance the teaching-learning environment to enable children, particularly girls, to acquire basic
competences, understand subject matter better and at the same time to enjoy school.
Institutional change and capacity building of MOE: Supporting efficient management of the system and
building and strengthening the capacity of the MOE is the objective of the third component. Capacity will
be improved at: (i) the central level for policy, strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation,
implementation in curriculum review, and teacher development; and (ii) the governorate and district levels
to implement education programs, manage and account for resources, monitor and evaluate the impact at
school levels, and support schools in their planning and budgeting processes. A school-centered
development pilot will establish holistic approaches to school-based planning, budgeting and general
development with an emphasis on school-cormmunity interaction including community-based literacy
provision. Comimunity participation will also be enhanced by the project through a community
participation function within MOE.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:  
BEDP will be implemented over the entire country over a five year period, using a phased approach|
targeting the most poorly served districts in each governorate first.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
As for BEEP, the three main environment issues relevant to this Project are: (i) Site selection for schools;
(ii) Water availability for hygiene purposes; and (iii) operations and maintenance of schools, including
sanitation facilities; (iv) construction of laboratories and proper waste management; (v) delivery and safe
utilization of chemical materials in schools laboratory; (vi) impacts associated with construction works
(dust, noise, traffic, safety, waste materials, etc.)
The project does not present any particular social safeguards issues since there will be no land
expropriation nor resettlement. All community donation of land is fully and formally documented with
evidence of its voluntary nature.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
N/A
D.3. Describe the treatment of altematives (if relevant)
N/A
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
BEDP is a follow-up and expansion of the Basic Education Expansion Project (BEEP) approved by the
Bank in August 2000. Lessons leamed from BEEP including the implementation of its EMP has been taken
into account in the BEDP Environment Management Plan (EMP) which includes environmental criteria for
site selection, toilet facilities construction, civil works for construction and requirements for the adequate
operation and maintenance of all types of facilities. The EMP will be used as a tool for supervision and
will be upgraded as necessary over the course of the project.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure oni
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The EMP has been disclosed in the World Bank Infoshop, and in English and Arabic in local newspapers,
the MOE website, the Ministry of Environment and public libraries.
