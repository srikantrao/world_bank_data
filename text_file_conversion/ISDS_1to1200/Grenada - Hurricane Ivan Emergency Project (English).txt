A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project will support the recovery efforts of the government of Grenada through the 
financing of critical important and rehabilitation activities in key social sectors.  
Financing is provided on an emergency basis to avoid the usual time lag between the end 
of the relief period and reconstruction.  Due to the catastrophic losses in the education 
and health sectors, and their core importance to Grenadian society, the focus of this 
project will be to rehabilitate infrastructure in these areas.  Specific objectives include: 
 
(1) 
Supporting the Government’s overall reconstruction program through the 
financing of critical import; 
(2) 
Restoring school infrastructure to an operational level and ensure a prompt 
return of children to schools; 
(3)      Supporting the rehabilitation of healthcare infrastructure to ensure adequate       
delivery of health services throughout the island.

A.3. Project Description 
 
This project will consist of four components including:  
 
(I) 
Financing of critical imports; 
(II) 
Assistance to the recovery of the education sector; 
(III) 
Assistance to the recovery of the health sector; 
(IV) 
Support to Project Management and Supervision. 
 
I. 
Financing of critical imports (US$2.0  million)
.
This component will 
finance the import of low sulfur diesel fuel necessary for electricity 
generation and transportation needed to maintain economic activity and to 
the Government’s overall reconstruction effort.  The inclusion of this sole 
import is based on an assessment of Grenada’s monthly import bill and 
review of satisfactory procurement practices. 
 
II. 
Rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools (US$5.0 million)
.
One of the 
most urgent reconstruction priorities of the government is the rebuilding of 
damaged or destroyed schools.  Only 2 of the 75 primary and secondary 
schools on the island are currently in an operational condition.  
Reconstruction will be implemented in two phases; an initial rehabilitation 
phase to make facilities operationally functional where student will be able 
to attend school on a shift system; and full reconstruction phase to 
complete repairs and bring affected schools in line with appropriate 
standards.  This component will finance the technical assistance for the 
design and supervision of the reconstruction, the actual rehabilitation 
works, as well as the purchase of school supplies when these have been 
destroyed or damaged. 
 
III. 
Restoration of St. George’s Hospital and regional health facilities 
(US$2.5 million)
.
The principal hospital on the island suffered roof 
damage resulting in  the loss of its laboratory facility.  As this facility is 
essential to the island health care system it must be restored as soon as 
possible.  In the vicinity of Grenville, on the eastern side of the island, 
Princess Alice Hospital has been virtually destroyed.  Other health care 
facilities around the island have been damaged and are in need of repairs.  
This component will finance the technical assistance necessary to develop 
a
strategy for addressing rehabilitation works, the physical rehabilitation 
of health infrastructure and the purchase of medical supplies and 
equipment when these have been damaged by the Hurricane. 
 
IV. 
Support to Project Management and Supervision (US$ 0.5  million)
.
While the project will be implemented by the same PCU currently 
implementing the ERDMP, ERP, HIV/AIDS and OECS Education 
projects, additional resources will be needed to face the current emergency 
and increased workload in processing and supervising co
ntracts.  This 
Page  3
component will finance limited office equipment and technical assistance 
to support implementation during the first year of the project. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The project will be carried out nationwide with an emphasis on the region most affected 
by Hurricane Ivan, which includes the region south of a line drawn from Grenville to St. 
George’s.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
By its nature the project will have a positive social impact since it is expected to 
reconstruct and rehabilitate damaged schools and health centers in addition to preventing 
environmental degradation through debris management.   
 
Construction of new infrastructure will be limited to the replacement of destroyed 
schools.  Damaged but salvageable schools and health centers will be rehabilitated where 
they stand.  Debris cleanup will be managed in such a way that the problem of saturated 
landfills can be avoided.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The initial assessment of damages in Grenada shows that building structures (housing, 
schools, government buildings, etc.) were particularly affected.  At the same time, 
structures built or retrofitted in recent years under World Bank projects have all survived 
the storm with little or no damage demonstrating the benefits of applying recognized 
Hurricane resistant standards.  The recovery program will ensure that such standards are 
used in rehabilitation and reconstruction to ensure that vulnerabilities are not rebuilt.  The 
Task Team Environmental Specialist will conduct environmental reviews to the works 
that will be completed. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
As the project is expected to bring only positive impacts from the reconstruction of 
damaged public infrastructure, no alternatives were considered 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Under ERDMP, the Government strengthened their environmental management and 
ability to identify areas at risk.  During implementation of the Hurricane Emergency 
Project, the Ministry of Works 
will categorize at risk sites and the Task Team’s 
Environmental Specialist will conduct due diligence to ensure that all environmental 
guidelines are met on areas of proposed new construction. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the citizens of Grenada, with a particular emphasis on teachers, 
students, school administrators and medical employees.  Every citizen will be affected by 
the rehabilitation of the damaged health and destroyed education sectors as students will 
Page  5
be brought off the streets and access to health services will be restored.  The Ministry of 
Health as well as the Ministry of Education will work closely with the PCU under 
Ministry of Finance to ensure that all safeguard policies are adhered to.
