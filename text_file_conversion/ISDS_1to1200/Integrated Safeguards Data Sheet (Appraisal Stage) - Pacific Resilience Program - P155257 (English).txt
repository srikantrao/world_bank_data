                           The objective of the Project is to strengthen the financial protection of the Republic of Marshall
                           Islands.
                            3. Project Description
                           The Republic of Marshall Islands is one of the most geographically isolated countries in the world,

                                                                         Page 1 of 4
                         with a high vulnerability to climate change. Their 370km coastline, which 99% of the population live
                         on, is exposed to regular typhoons and rising sea levels. Despite recent progress in terms of national
                         level plans and policy to respond to disaster and climate risk (i.e. the National Action Plan for

                         Disaster Risk Management, 2008-2018 and the National Climate Change Policy Framework, 2011),
                         translating national climate resilience and DRM policy into sector policies and resilient investments
                         has been a significant challenge. The PREP will complement existing initiatives which aim to
                         minimize the impact of climate change and natural hazards in across the Pacific Region, and in
                         particular, support the continuation and expansion of the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and
                         Financing Initiative (PCRAFI) pilot insurance program, of which RMI is a participant.

                         RMI will participate only in PREP Component 3.1.2, which will finance part of the Governmentâ€™s
                         Insurance Premium for disaster risk financing or transfer products. This will enable the continuation
                         of the Pacific catastrophe risk insurance pilot which provides catastrophe risk insurance coverage for
                         high and medium risk layers to participating PICs (including RMI) through a regional pooling
                         mechanism

                         The Project will assist the Government of RMI to pay the catastrophe insurance premium through
                         IDA after the third year of the ongoing pilot. The estimated cost of the premium for RMI is US
                         $0.5million/year for three years to provide insurance coverage for RMI against tropical cyclones and
                         earthquakes/tsunamis until 31st October 2018. The Government of RMI will provide counterpart
                         funding in the amount of US$40,000 to partially finance the premium for the year commencing
                         November 2015, US$50,000 for the year commencing November 2016, and US$ 60,000 for the year
                         commencing November 2017
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The main office for the project will be on Majuro Atoll, Republic of Marshall Islands. Due to its
                         nature as a financing project, it will have no salient physical characteristics which would be relevant
                         to a safeguards analysis.

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The project will have no potential safeguards issues because it is a financing project only.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              RMI may choose to participate more fully in the PREP in future. Should this eventuate, a separate
                              project will be assessed
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
