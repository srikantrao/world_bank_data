                           B. Project Objectives
                           The proposed project development objective (PDO) is: to establish the building blocks of a national
                           social safety net system for effectively targeting and delivering cash transfers to extreme poor and
                           vulnerable households.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will support the set-up of a National Social Safety Net Program, which will consist of a
                           system for reaching the poor at the federal level that can also be used to target and monitor other
                           safety nets and public programs. The building blocks of the safety net system are a common targeting
                           system, harmonized eligibility criteria, a management information system (MIS), a monitoring and

                           evaluation system (M&E), and a payment mechanism linked to the MIS and M&E systems. The lead
                           intervention for the NSSNP will be a cash transfer program targeted to poor households across
                           Nigeria. Where supply of services is available, the cash transfers will be linked to household
                           utilization of health, nutrition and education services. The project will also include a livelihoods
                           pilot, which will include grants to households to support their livelihoods plan. The plans may
                           involve activities such as improved farming practices, livestock fattening, bee peeping, or non-farm
                           enterprises.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will be managed at the Federal level and the cash transfers will be rolled out gradually
                           across the States.
