                           The objective of the Tertiary Education for Employability Project (TEEP) is to improve the
                           employability of tertiary graduates and strengthen the management of higher education.
                            3. Project Description
                           The project would have two main components: (i) improving employability of graduates and (ii)

                                                                       Page 1 of 5
                         modernizing the management of higher education through technical assistance and capacity building
                         to support the implementation of a comprehensive quality assurance system, increased autonomy of
                         universities and the development of a performance-based steering approach, e.g. through
Public Disclosure Copy




                         performance contracts and a performance-based financing (PBF) mechanism. Supporting effective
                         project management would form part of the second component. More specifically, the components
                         would be described as follows:

                         Component 1: “Improving employability of graduates” would support a competitive grant scheme
                         (that will build on an existing model developed under the recently closed PARES II project)
                         supporting innovation, enhancement of curricula and learning environments, school-to-work
                         transition programs, entrepreneurship and public private partnerships (PPPs). The grant scheme
                         would consist of two types of grants (“PAQ 1” and “PAQ 2”).

                         �        “PAQ 1” grants would support projects related to: (i) university autonomy and reinforcement
                         of their capacity in management (especially for HEIs with an EPST status ) ; (ii) modernization of
                         teaching and learning with a focus on general and specialized skills expected to enter the labor
                         market ; (iii) application of the Bologna Process (in the form of LMD – described earlier); (iv)
                         research and innovation (including for higher education); (v) entrepreneurial university, education
                         and training of self-entrepreneurs ; (vi) ‘young’ universities and HEIs contributing to regional
                         development ; (vii) transition programs and any other activities supporting the transition between
                         secondary and higher education ; (viii) internships and other activities linking higher education to the
                         labor market. The competition would be open to all HEIs, including the ISETs, and would give
                         preference to projects promoting public-private partnerships.

                         �       “PAQ 2 grants” would support the reinforcement of co-constructed programs (prepared in
                         collaboration with employers and HEIs) which were developed and piloted under the PARES II with
                         the aim to align higher education with labor market needs.

                         As under PARES II, PAQ grants could also finance the provision of needed equipment and materials

                         for labs and the renovation of obsolete installations.

                         This component could possibly be opened to vocational training institutions.

                         A total of 50 million US$ would tentatively be allocated to Component 1.

                         Component 2: “Modernizing the management of higher education” would seek – under a sub-
                         component 2.1 of technical assistance and capacity building - to support:

                         (i)     the full implementation of a university internal and external quality assurance system
                         (including a fully-developed Bologna-compatible quality assurance agency and revitalization of
                         university-internal quality assurance units);

                         (ii)    increased autonomy of universities, inter alia through the creation of external advisory
                         boards to reinforce the relationship between employers and other external entities and HEIs and
                         support of legislative measures to allow universities to access the EPST status mentioned above; and

                         (iii)    development of performance-based steering mechanisms for the higher education sector, e.
                         g. through the (re-)introduction of performance contracts and development and piloting of
                         performance-based financing (PBF) mechanisms.

                                                                       Page 2 of 5
                           Sub-component 2.2. “Supporting effective project management” would assist the Coordination Unit
                           (“Unité de Coordination”, UC), which is the implementation agency for previous donor-financed

                           projects, including PARES II, to reinforce its coordinating capacity by recruiting - on a competitive
                           basis – additional qualified and experienced technical staff fully dedicated to project components
                           and/or sub-components. The detailed activities to be financed under this component will be further
                           discussed during project preparation.

                           A total of US$ 20 million would tentatively be allocated to Component 2.
                            4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The Project will benefit all higher education institutions in Tunisia and will mostly focus on technical
                           assistance and training, with - through the PAQ grants - some provision of equipment and potentially
                           minor renovations (such as upgrade of electrical installations, minor repairs to ensure minimum
                           working conditions, etc.). No construction or land acquisition is planned under the project, and such
                           impacts will be screened out. The Project will finance minor renovation works in accordance with
                           the eligibility criteria and environmental and social mitigation measures set forth in the Project
                           operational manuals.
