A.2. Project Objectives
The program objective is to improve the governance, efficiency, user and provider satisfaction, and long-
term fiscal sustainability of the healthcare system in Turkey. Such a transition will be the first step towards
achieving the longer term sectoral goal of narrowing the gap in access to, quality and utilization of health
services between Turkey and other middle-income and EU countries by extending health insurance
coverage to the whole Turkish population and by reducing inequalities in access to health care, especially
for the poor and those living in rural and peri-urban areas.
The objective of Phase I is to enable the Government to strengthen the institutional environment for the
implementation of its Program of Transformation in Health that will improve system stewardship,
streamline financing and service delivery, and build the institutional capacity to extend health insurance
coverage to the whole population in a fiscally sustainable manner. The specific objectives, set in line with
Government's PTH, are to : (i) re-structure MOH for more effective stewardship and policy making; (ii)
establish a universal health insurance fund; (iii) introduce family medicine as the model for the provision of
primary health care services (iv) ensure financial and managerial autonomy for all hospitals irrespective of
ownership; and (v) set up a fully computerized health and social information system. Upon completion of
the program, it is expected that MOH will be a smaller and leaner agency, with a resources and skills mix
in line with its renewed mandate of system stewardship, namely doing "more steering and less rowing",
that is mostly policy setting and regulating with no responsibilities for service provision, except for public
health programs. Similarly, MOLSS is also expected to relieve itself from the function of service
provision, increasingly specializing and building its institutional capacity in essential insurance functions of
balancing revenues and expenditures, thus in risk assessment, actuarial analysis, definition of essential
service package, premium setting, and strategic purchasing from and contracting with providers (Please see
Annex 3 for key indicators).
The most recent CAS, and the Policy Notes, "Turkey: Greater Prosperity with Social Justice" that was
prepared in November 2002 to assist the incoming new government, Government's own UAP, released in
January 2003, and its sectoral spin off, PTH, all concur almost entirely that a fundamental overhaul - as
opposed to piecemeal changes - is needed and that the system would have to be "transformed". There is a
general consensus that the Transition should at least entail: (i) the separation of provision and financing of



health care so as to achieve a more efficient resource allocation and use; (ii) introduction of universal
public health insurance so as to ensure equity and access to health services; (iii) financial and
administrative autonomy for public hospitals in order to improve technical efficiency and strengthen
management; (iv) introduction of family medicine so as to integrate and streamnline delivery of primary
health care with inpatient care and ensure comprehensiveness and continuity in health care; and (v)
increased emphasis on improving maternal and child health.
This program is designed to specifically assist the Government to implement its own PTH and as such its
components are designed and sequenced to correspond and contribute directly to PTH's five main
objectives.
A.3. Project Description
The proposed project has six components:
Component A: Restructuring of the MOHfor Stewardship. This component supports MOH's
institutional Transition from a mainly provider of services to a policy maker and regulator of service
provision, while retaining key public health functions. This component has four sub-components: (i)
restructuring of MOH; (ii) Establishment of a National Pharmaceutical and Medical Equipment Agency;
(iii) Quality Assurance and Accreditation of Health Facilities; and (iv) Establishing Monitoring and
Evaluation Capacity for the PTH.
Component B: Building Institutional Capacity of the Health Insurance Fund. This component supports
the establishment of a single health insurance fund by means of consolidating the four existing health
insurance schemes and expanding its reach to about an additional 22 million citizens who are not fully
covered.
Component C: Reorganizing the delivery of healthcare services. This component has four sub-
components: (i) adoption of family medicine as an organizational model for the provision of outpatient or
primary health care services; (ii) integration and harmonization of MOH and SSK hospitals towards great
autonomy; and (iii) building a new patient referral mechanism to re-enforce system hierarchy. A fourth
sub-component will focus mostly on population health programs, including disease surveillance, maternal
and child health, prevention and control of NCDs. The reorganization will be implemented in a phased
manner, with pilots in large cities. during Phase I, to be rolled out nationwide during the second phase.
Component D: Strengthening Human Resources Capacity aims at developing skills and competence of
health work force, in line with the changing role of the MOH and its affiliated institutions. It has two sub-
components: (i) health workforce policy and planning; and (ii) strengthening the School of Public Health,
to become a center of excellence in advocacy, training and research for the MOH.
Component E: Building Infostructure for Health and Social Security. This component supports the
development of national standards in line with the realignment of institutional roles and responsibilities.
This will be done in a phased manner; first with the development of standards and the establishment of
records and information network in the social security system, and thereafter the establishment of network
and information flows between the social security system and the hospitals. It has two sub-components: (i)
building health information system; and (ii) building social security information system.
Component F: Project Management. This component provides support for project coordination between
the two ministries, overall project governance, with additional support to that of Government's PTH, and
project administration.
The proposed HTP will be designed and irnplemented in parallel with the proposed PPSAL, which will
provide budgetary support for the overhaul and reform of the social security system. The synergies and
inter-linkages between the two projects will provide both investment and budgetary support for the health
reform agenda of the Government.
