B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The proposed project aims to strengthen the government's capacity to encourage safe and sound 
financial intermediation, manage weaknesses and stresses in the financial system, prevent crisis 
contagion effects, and reform payments and securities clearance and settlement system.  The 
proposed project intends to strengthen the institutional capacity to manage and reduce risks, 
increase efficiency, transparency, and accountability of financial activities. It will accomplish 
this goal through technical assistance focused on the BCP to develop institutional capacity and 
improve the financial legal framework, complementing the reforms supported by the FSAL and 
the IMF and IDB programs. In particular, the proposed project seeks to: 
 
\01\02
Strengthen the institutional capacity of the SB and enhance its focus on supervision by 
incorporating a risk-based approach. 
\01\02
Implement a new bank regularization and resolution framework (detailed in Law 2334). 
\01\02
Establish a Deposit Insurance Fund that will operate according to preservation of net 
worth and use funds by least cost resolution, reducing moral hazard.  
\01\02
Modernize the country’s payments and securities settlement systems. 
\01\02
Improve selected aspects of the financial system infrastructure. 
 
The proposed project seeks to strengthen and maintain long-term sustainability and solvency of 
the financial system, through technical assistance to the BCP and the SB.  In this process, the 
BCP and SB will be able to classify financial intermediaries according to risk profiles and thus, 
they will be better positioned to design an action plan to promote the orderly exit of the weakest / 
non-viable banks. The implementation of reforms in bank resolution mechanisms and reforms of 
deposit insurance will particularly impact small depositors, assuring prompt and full repayment 
Page  2
 
 
of their deposits in the event of future bank failures. The medium term effects of a sound and 
stable financial system, achieved through strengthened prudential regulation and risk-based 
supervision, will be channeled through its funding capacity to the support of economic growth in 
all sectors of the economy (with the strongest marginal effects in the agricultural and rural 
sector).  
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
Based on preliminary estimates, the proposed FSTAL is expected to cost US$ 5.6 million (Bank 
share of US$ 4.8 million) and will last about three years starting in September 2004. The project 
components, with initial estimated amounts, are as follows:  
 
Component 1: Strengthening the institutional capacity of the SB
 (US$ 1.90 million - tentative). 
This component will finance activities to: (i) implement risk-based supervisory activities; (ii) 
assist with the implementation of a new process of regularization and resolution of troubled 
banks (complementing activities financed by the FSAL-PHRD grant); (iii) improve prudential 
and accounting norms; (iv) upgrade technological platforms; and (v) overhaul organizational 
structure and human resource and training policies. 
 
Component 2: Establish a Deposit Insurance Fund
 (US$0.20 million - tentative). This component 
will contribute to the establishment of a funded deposit insurance fund, complementing existing 
financing under the FSAL-PHRD grant. 
 
Component 3: Reform of payments and securities settlement system 
(US$ 2.50 million - 
tentative). The objective of this component is to modernize the Paraguayan payments system, 
including the launch of safer and more efficient systems and an improved legal and oversight 
framework. This component will finance: (i) improvement of the legal and regulatory 
framework; (ii) implementation of a new Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS); (iii) 
improvements on the efficiency of clearing systems for small payments; and (iv) establishment of 
an oversight function at the BCP. 
 
Component 4: Financial sector infrastructure 
(US$0.85 million  - tentative). The objective of this 
component is to improve selected aspects of the financial system infrastructure. In particular, the 
proposed project will focus on: (i) the institutional framework for Anti Money Laundering 
Activities & Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), complementing activities financed 
by the MIF-IDB grant; and (ii) studies on economic policy and sectorial issues, including 
drafting a strategy for the medium and long-term development of Paraguay’s financial system, 
determinants of interest rate spread, and assessment of the credit cooperative sector.  
 
Component 5: Project management 
(US$0.15 million  - tentative). This component will finance 
activities to ensure an efficient implementation and adequate monitoring of the different project 
components, as well as compliance with the Bank financial management and procurement 
guidelines.

The location of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) is still being debated. The BCP suggested 
that because most components are related to BCP, it could manage the project within its 
administrative unit. However, the Ministry of Finance created a PCU for the implementation of 
the public bank reform as well as the FSAL-PHRD. This unit seems to be operating very 
smoothly. The team will request a decision on this issue by March 5, 2004. Furthermore, based 
on experience with previous projects in Paraguay, as well as a procurement assessment carried 
out for this project, the team is seeking to use UNDP for handling procurement matters (pending 
approval of the Government and clarification of recent regulatory changes).  
 
Application of safeguard policies and environment categorization
. 
 
Because of the technical assistance nature of the project no safeguard policies apply. The project 
is not expected to have any environmental impact, and the loan is therefore rated as “C” for 
environmental purposes. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
The project will be implemented at the BCP and SB and will have implications at the national level. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
No safeguard policies are triggered by this project.
