                           The project supports methodological and technological innovations for the 2019 Population Census, including (i)
                           transition to computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI); (ii) exploring the feasibility of internet self-interviewing;
                           and (iii) enhancing the usability of spatial information from the Population Census through modern GIS technologies.

                           C. Project Description
                           The project has two main components: (i) preparing the national statistical system for the Population Census;
                           and (ii) ensuring access to the non-confidential Population Census data and indicators. Activities for each of
                           the 2 project components are described below.
