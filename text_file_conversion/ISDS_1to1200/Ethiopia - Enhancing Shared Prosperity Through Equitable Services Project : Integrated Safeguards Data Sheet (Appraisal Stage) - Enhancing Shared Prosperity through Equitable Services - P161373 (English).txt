3. Project Description
ESPES supports Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program (woreda block grant system) which
provides funding to close to one thousand woredas all over the country which are responsible for delivering
basic services in health, education, agriculture, water and rural roads. The block grant program is a decentralized
system of governance that supports flows of information, resources and accountability between different levels
of government and between service providers and citizens. This system has been found to be effective in
improving equitable access to services as indicated in the Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Poverty
Assessment and the technical assessment undertaken as part of the preparation of the ESPES. Government
ownership and commitment to the program also continues to be very strong.

This proposed additional financing is sought to help finance the expenditures associated with the Government of
Ethiopia’s Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfer Program which provides block grants to region and woreda levels
for delivering Basic Social Services such as health care, education, agriculture services, rural roads, and water
and sanitation. The additional financing would (a) scale up existing Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs)
DLR targets; and (b) introduce new DLIs especially in the areas of citizen engagement and fiduciary
management. Alongside the AF, the operation is also being restructured into a hybrid PforR to include an
investment component to provide capacity building support for citizen engagement, fiduciary management,
environmental and social safeguards management systems (ESMS), improved data production and
dissemination, and program management. Performance of the operation has been satisfactory over the last 12
months. The closing date will also need to be extended from May 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022 to cover the
implementation of the new DLIs and the capacity building component.

The objective of the system strengthening and capacity building Investment Project Financing (IPF) Component
is to improve the Government’s federal, regional and woreda level administrative systems for implementing and
monitoring the block grant program, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the country in
delivering basic services to all woredas. For instance, the safeguards capacity building element is relevant to all
sectors because the woredas are responsible for implementing resettlement, compensation and grievance redress
for all infrastructure projects implemented in their respective woredas. These projects will benefit greatly from
enhanced local-level capacity citizen engagement, fiduciary management, environmental and social
management, and data production and dissemination.

The proposed AF includes an allocation of US$100 million for the IPF component which aims at
complementing the PforR by providing technical assistance and capacity building for service delivery system
performance. The IPF component is made up of 3 sub-components which are described below.

• Sub-component 1: Strengthening Systems and Sectors (US$30 million): This component provides support to
the service delivery systems at the federal, regional and Woreda levels. Support to sectors is closely tied to the
availability of quality data to monitor sectoral outputs and outcomes (including monitoring ESPES DLIs). The
component will finance key activities such as (a) strengthening sectoral MIS for Education, Health, Agriculture
and WASH, (b) providing finance and TA to the SARA health survey , and (c) costs related to undertaking
behavioral change campaigns for improving human development outcomes in the bottom 20 percent of
Woredas. The component will also finance activities that strengthen the procurement, financial management,
governance, and social and environmental systems at decentralized levels.
• Sub-component 2: Citizens Engagement (US$30 million): This component will finance three key areas of CE,
namely (a) Financial Transparency and Accountability (US$5 million), (b) Grievance Redress Mechanisms
(US$5 million), and (c) Social Accountability (US$20 million). In FTA, the activities include support to budget
literacy, media campaigns, support for audit and procurement information disclosure, related training assessing
the effectiveness of FTA, strengthening FTA/GRM/SA linkages; capacity building support to the EIO and


                                                 Page 2 of 5
support to grievance management GRM offices. With regard to Social Accountability, to inform the
implementation of the social accountability activities, the government is undertaking a study to determine the
best institutional arrangement. It would involve that the government hires a national consultancy firm to manage
the individual social accountability implementers. The choice will depend on technical expertise and capacity as
well as independence to undertake social accountability activities. Overall, the technical design of the on-the-
ground implementation of social accountability in the ESPES program will be informed by the ongoing design
on the ESAP II successor program provided that those design details are agreed within the timeline of the
preparation schedule of the ESPES AF.
• Sub-component 3: Capacity building and M&E (US$40 million): The objective of the support is to strengthen
the capacity of the Central Statistics Agency to produce and disseminate timely and reliable statistics to monitor
progress under the second Growth and Transformation Plan. Some support will also be provided to VERA to
improve vital statistics and especially the interface with CSA. The capacity building support for CSA and
VERA will focus on 1) data production and dissemination, and 2) organizational and soft statistical
infrastructure and capacity building; and 3) improving the quality of vital statistics. This component will also
support M&E, management and operational costs including (a) incremental staffing costs, (b) operational costs
including audits and program monitoring and evaluation, and (c) costs incurred by the DLI verification agencies.
4. Project location and Salient physical characteristics                 relevant to the safeguard analysis
(if known)
The physical setting is not relevant for safeguard analysis as the IPF component does not involve any capital
investment or civil works and will strengthen the system by (a) enhancing citizens’ engagement, environmental
and social risk management capacity; (b)deepening fiduciary aspects of basic service delivery; and (c) ensuring
quality data access and results. There will be no land acquisition or restriction of access in this IPF component.
The ESPES AF will be implemented throughout the country. The objective of the system strengthening and
capacity building IPF component is to improve the government’s federal, regional and woreda level
administrative systems for implementing and monitoring the block grant program and for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of the country in delivering basic services to all woredas in environmentally and
socially sustainable manner. For instance, the safeguards local capacity building element is relevant to all
sectors because the woredas are responsible for implementing community consultation, land acquisition and
resettlement, including compensation enforcement and oversight of grievance redress mechanism, etc. for
infrastructure development such as rural roads project regardless of funding sources. These projects will benefit
greatly from enhanced local-level capacity in safeguards, especially in relation to social impacts and aspects,
which are typically weaker than biophysical aspects, at woreda level.

    II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
    A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
    1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
    any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
    There will not be any large scale and significant and/or irreversible impacts associated with this project. It will
    actually enhance local capacity in safeguards, which will be beneficial not only to basic sectors but also to all
    sectors implementing projects in woredas.
    2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
    project area:
    The long term impacts of the project activities are positive in terms of environmental and social management.
    The safeguards capacity building at local level will contribute towards improved environmental and social
    management in project design, implementation and monitoring in both the public and private sectors.
    3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
    Not applicable
    4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of
    borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
    A series of legal proclamations form the basis for the environmental and social assessment and management
    framework in Ethiopia: The Proclamation on the Establishment of Environmental Protection Organs (No.
    295/2002); the Proclamation on Environmental Impact Assessment (No. 299/2002); and the Proclamation on
    Environmental Pollution Control (No. 300/2002).

    As part of the Management Action Plan, in response to the PBS 3 Inspection Panel investigation, (a) the
    Government has developed Environmental and Social Management Operational Manual, and (b) a screening
    tool to manage the interface between Bank-financed projects and Commune Centers, was developed, and it is
    being rolled out. An Incremental ESSA was carried out as part of the preparation of the ESPES AF. It identified
    changes or improvement to the systems in place for environmental and social management at all levels,
    including taking stock of implementation capacity and performance at woreda level and the identification of any
    areas for improvement, based on the review of the original ESSA and any developments since then. This has
    informed the preparation of the safeguards IPF component with regard to local capacity building. The
    safeguards capacity building includes training of local staff based on the training modules which were developed
    along with the Environmental and Social Management System Operational Manual. The training/capacity
    building is consistent with the Bank’s Safeguards Policies. Furthermore, the training/ capacity building on
    safeguards under this program will have a transformational impact on addressing environmental and social
    effects of projects and programs at local level regardless of funding sources.
    5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on

   safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
   The key stakeholders are the MoFEC, MoEFCC, basic sector ministries, BoFEDs and regional environmental
   agencies and basic sector bureaus. Consultation on the Incremental ESSA will be held, and it will be disclosed
   on the infoshop and in-country before appraisal.
