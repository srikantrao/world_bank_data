A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The objective of the project is to (i) maintain basic social and economic infrastructure  to 
prevent a deterioration in living conditions of a significant number of disadvantaged 
communities and specific vulnerable groups; and (ii) build the basic capacity of 
communities and local actors to conduct a local development process.  
 
The success of the outcome of the project in terms of maintaining basic social and 
economic services will be measured by demonstration of an increase in the (i) number of 
admissions to the first grade; (ii) net enrollment rate of girls at the primary level; (iii) 
number of children vaccinated and followed-up; (iv) number of prenatal visits; (v) 
percentage of population with access to a source of water within one kilometer; and (vi) 
number of isolated communities that have experienced a reduction in price of transport 
and basic commodities. With respect to building capacity, the project will measure (i) the 
number of communities with development plans established through participatory 
process; (ii) the number of communities with sub-project community monitoring plans 
successfully implemented; (iii) the number of communities who can contract directly 
with local enterprises; and (iv) the increase in local contracting market. 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed credit will support financing for:  
1) 
Community based activities
: this component would continue to finance small-scale 
social and economic sub-projects identified by communities, with an expanded menu of 
services to include social protection programs and capacity building initiatives. Support 
to community health services will also be financed. Direct community financing will also 
be piloted and scaled up based on lessons learned. By the end of the project, it is expected 
that targeted communities would have developed and implemented community based 
development plans through participatory planning process.

2) 
Urban water supply and periodic road maintenance 
on Anjouan and Moheli: these 
activities were already identified under the IWE project and include 
rehabilitation/maintenance of 184 kilometers of existing national roads, and 
rehabilitation/extension of water supply in three towns in Anjouan and the capital in 
Moheli. This component would also finance capacity building of water management 
committees and Information and Education Campaigns (IEC) campaigns on water 
management, the environment and hygiene.  
 
 
3) 
Support to Rural Development through Income-Generating Activities
: this 
component would finance demand-driven income-generating sub-projects to finance 
small productive infrastructure with beneficiary contribution of at least 20 percent of the 
total sub-project cost. Eligible beneficiaries would be producer organizations and rural 
communities. Productive infrastructure and off-farm activities would be financed along 
with support services needed for the identification and implementation of the sub-
projects.. Finally this component would provide extension and training services, capacity 
building for the relevant stakeholders, and technical assistance to local financial 
institutions. A technical audit of the micro-finance activities under the existing project 
will be carried out and will determine whether the new project will include these 
activities.   
 
4) 
Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) and Project Management
: this component would 
support M&E activities, including moving beyond monitoring of project outputs to 
undertake an impact assessment of the activities of the community based activities over 
the life of the project. FADC operating costs and key technical assistance are also 
included under this component.  It is expected that the project will be successfully 
implemented in a cost effective and decentralized manner. Furthermore, the project will 
emphasize the participatory monitoring and evaluation approach by involving beneficiary 
communities throughout the project cycle; and use external monitors to build strong 
transparency in the management of project components. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Project implementation will take place on all three islands of the Comoros: Grand Comore, Anjouan and 
Mohéli. Under component 1, some sub-projects have been identified and will be undertaken in known 
locations. However, since the project is somewhat demand-driven, and will depend on the needs of the 
communities, many sub-project locations are unknown.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
In terms of safeguard policies, the Environmental Assessment will be triggered since the 
project will support construction and rehabilitation community based infrastructure 
through a participatory project with the potential of localized environmental and social 
impacts albeit minor. Additionally, resettlement may be triggered if land acquisition is 
involved.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
N.A 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N.A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
Actions undertaken during preparation of the Transitional Support Investment Credit 
included the preparation of (a) an Environmental and Social Management Framework 
(ESMF) and (b) a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).  For the urban water supply 
and road maintenance sub-component, separate Environmental Analysis (EA) will be 
prepared as part of the sub-project cycle.  
 
Although the Government of Comoros has limited institutional capacity, the executing 
agency, the Fonds d’Appui au Developpement Communautaire (FADC) has a proven 
track record in management of the previous social fund project and thus should have no 
problem in preparing and implementing the next phase. Measures nonetheless are being 
included in the project to strengthen FADC’s technical capacity, particularly for road 
maintenance and water supply, and specifically in environmental assessment of potential 
impacts.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Workshops and consultations were held on each island during pre-appraisal to discuss the 
potential environmental and social impacts and to outline the importance of the project 
incorporating mitigating measures into sub-project design. Both frameworks and their 
screening processes will be incorporated in the project’s manual of procedures and will 
be disclosed at the Bank's Information Center.  They will also be disseminated in 
Comoros through a series of workshops on each island and be permanently located in
