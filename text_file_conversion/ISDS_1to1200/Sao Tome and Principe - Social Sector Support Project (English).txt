A.2. Project Objectives
The development objective of the proposed Social Sector Support Project (PASS) is to contribute to
improving the delivery of basic health and education services, which implies a focus on better
equitable access, better quality, and improved local governance of services.
A.3. Project Description
The project includes the following 4 components: (i) Improved delivery of basic education services;
(ii) Improved delivery of basic health services; (iii) Addressing cross-cutting issues: HIV/AIDS and
Malaria; and (iv) Project Management and Coordination. For improved service delivery, the project
combines top-down and bottom-up approaches which incorporate supply-side enhancement and
actions to more closely attune service provision with local preferences and demand. The capacity
building activities are integrated into the components. These activities will aim at improving basic
systems and capacity to operate a light decentralized system, including improving fundamental
strategic planning, management, and monitoring and accountability procedures in the health and
education sectors. They target the key organization and staff of the Ministries at the central and
district levels. Given the extremely weak planning and management capacities and the overly
centralized administration, limited but critical new competencies for the administration units at the
central and district levels will be introduced gradually over the project life.
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
Project will not undertake any activities that may require involuntary resettlement.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
D. 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
There are no potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. The safeguard issues and
impacts associated with the proposed project involve medical waste. Current practices in health
care waste management and contaminated health care waste handling, storage and disposal, in
particular, raises environmental and social concerns. Health related activities produce considerable
amount of waste on a daily basis, as a result of preventive and curative service delivery. The
composition of waste produced is in the form of sharps (needles, syringes, etc.), non- sharp materials,
such as blood and other body fluids that could be infected, chemicals, expired pharmaceuticals and
other medical devises needing proper handling and disposal. There is potential for health workers,
waste handlers, users of health facilities and the general public to be exposed to and become infected
by health care related waste, as a result of poor HCW management practices.
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the
project area.
None anticipated.
D.3. Describe the treatment of altematives (if relevant)
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. Regarding medical waste a Medical
Waste Plan (MWP) was prepared and costed. The plan and costs will be applied only to those
activities financed under the project that entail medical waste. While no major environmental
impact nor involuntary resettlement is anticipated with the project, an Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared and
disclosed as protective measures, incase at any time during the project's life an activity would trigger
it.
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders are the Ministries of Education and Health at the central and district level, in
addition to the Federation of Non-Governmental Organizations (FONG) as well as Community-
based Organizations (CBOs) and communities. The ESMF, MWP and RPF has been disclosed in
country within the government offices, in FONG, at the UN information center as well as in the main
library in Sao Tome and at the InfoShop.
