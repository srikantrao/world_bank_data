B.  Project Objective 
The development objective of the Project (i.e., Phase II of the Program) is to further improve the management of 
health resources and the quality of health services (particularly at the district and community level) through sector 
reforms and institutional capacity building. 
 
C.  Project Description 
The Project will support the implementation of the Plan of Work associated with the Second Health 
Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP) which was reviewed and endorsed by Partners in May 2003.  
The previous 
POW (1999–2002) focused on initiating reforms within the health sector and putting systems in place, in particular 
those related to decentralization.  Focusing more on health service delivery and quality, the Second Health Sector 
Strategic Plan and POW builds on progress achieved. 
At District Level
 
\01\02
Quality of health services will be addressed through integrating HIV/AIDS activities at all levels, improving 
service agreements (contracts) with non-governmental providers, employing incentives to increase staff 
motivation, increasing accountability by publishing annual district health budgets and performance data, using 
client satisfaction tools to assess quality of service delivery, developing in-service training plans, implementing 
the health care waste management plan, and ensuring that adequate technical and support capacity is available 
to councils. 
\01\02
Necessary household and community-based actions will be addressed through scaling-up to nation-wide level 
and institutionalizing preventive actions such as ITN promotion, Vitamin A supplementation, community-based 
growth promotion, promotion of exclusive breast-feeding and the seventeen community IMCI practices.   
\01\02
The financing gap in the health sector will be reduced through strengthening the management of user fees, 
community health funds, the drug revolving fund, and health insurance. 
\01\02
Equity of access to health services will be improved through addressing the exemption system for the poor and 
vulnerable; monitoring the impact of fees on the poor; and devising new resource allocation formulas for block 
grants to districts.

At Secondary and Tertiary Hospital Level
 
\01\02
Hospital management will be improved by developing a hospital manager cadre, mandating Hospital Strategic 
Plans and operational plans, establishing Hospital Boards, and strengthening hospital financial and 
management. 
\01\02
Quality will be improved through repairs to facilities and preventive maintenance; and enhanced performance 
audits including monitoring of service delivery outputs. 
\01\02
The impact of HIV/AIDS epidemic on hospital staff will be mitigated through human resource development 
strategies and integrating AIDS care at all levels.  
At the Regional Level 
 
\01\02
Quality will be improved through the provision of managerial and technical support to districts; strengthening 
the inspectorate function; performance audits, introducing a quality assurance program (including client 
satisfaction assessment); supporting districts in data collection, data management and decision-making; 
strengthening district capacity for supportive supervision; and intensifying inter district exchange of 
experiences. 
At the Central Ministries
   
\01\02
Health financing will be improved through improved  budgeting and advocating for increased government 
allocation for health; pooling external finances; improving contract management and enhancing community 
voice and ownership in cost sharing/CHF/insurance. 
\01\02
The Human Resource crisis will be addressed through long-term manpower planning; innovations to address 
distribution, motivation and retention of staff; and the more strategic use of Zonal Training Centers. 
\01\02
Quality will be improved through Medical and Clinical Audits; harmonizing technical management guidelines; 
standards for service agreement and contracting; accreditation of health institutions (public and private); 
consultations/collaboration with civil society; and the development of comprehensive integrated sustainable 
quality assurance schemes at health delivery points 
\01\02
The consequences of HIV/AIDS on skilled human resources will be addressed through the integration 
HIV/AIDS into existing services; and the introduction and/or strengthening of PMTCT and HAART. 
\01\02
Monitoring and evaluation will be strengthened through investing in minimum information package at district 
and facility levels and assessing health sector performance based on PRS indicators and health sector 
performance profile indicators. 
 
The plan is designed to highlight the:  (i) greater integration of health services; (ii) importance of human resources;   
(iii) importance of the Public Sector Reform process and the role of Civil Service Department focusing on issues of 
pay reform and staffing levels; (iv) the role of PORALG in overseeing the proper functioning of the Regional and 
district hospitals, district health centers, dispensaries and community level health services. 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
This Sector-wide program covers the Tanzania mainland.  Per the descriptions above, implementation will be within 
the Central Ministry, at referral and district hospitals, at district offices, at health centers and at the community level. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity 
 
The emphasis in Phase 1 has been on institutional capacity building, and the GOT has achieved all of the 
performance targets for moving to Phase II (see attachment).  The health indicators for the program will not be 
assessed at the end of each phase, but routine data collection and surveys show progress between 1996 and 2001 in 
total fertility (from 5.8 to 5.6 average births per woman), DPT coverage (from 71% to 77% of children under 2 have 
been fully immunized against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), and in contraceptive prevalence (from 16% to 22% 
of women in union who use a modern form of contraception). 
 
At district level, human resource shortages (in both numbers and skills) are a constraint to services delivery.  Greater 
coordination between the relevant government offices who manage human resources for health, and innovation will 
be required to stem the loss of staff, motivate staff who remain and deploy human resources appropriately.  HMIS 
improvements are critical to monitoring the impact of reform strategies, but efforts to date have not produced 
desired results.  Phase II recognizes that at district level there is need for priority information which is collected to 
be used for local planning and decision-making.  Referral systems remain weak, in part due to poor progress in 
Page  3
 
 
hospital reforms.  Insufficient advocacy of the health sector reforms has resulted in a poor understanding of the 
reform process outside of the central Ministry of Health.  Limited capacity of the Regional level to provide support 
to districts according to their new roles and functions has been recognized as a constraint, and identified as a priority 
for Phase II.  Significant progress has been made in expanding the health sector’s response to HIV/AIDS, but further 
efforts related to staff and hospital reforms are required to cope with increased demand for services.
