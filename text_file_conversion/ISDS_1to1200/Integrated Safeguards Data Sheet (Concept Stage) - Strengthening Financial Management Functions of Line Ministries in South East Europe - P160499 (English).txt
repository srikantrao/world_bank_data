                           To assist line ministries strengthen capacities for effective delivery of their financial management
                           functions.
                           C. Project Description
                           The 2-year project provides a comprehensive learning package for finance officials in line ministries,
                           promoting their capacity development in PFM. The important role of PFM in the economic
                           governance of project beneficiaries is increasingly recognized. PFM continues to receive significant
                           attention in SEE countries' dialogue with the EU, in particular in the context of their annual ERP, as
                           well as in the management of sector budget support under the EUs second IPA.
                           Through the project, line ministries' finance officials will strengthen their proactive role in
                           knowledge exchange and shaping their own learning priorities. In addition, senior officials of line
                           ministries will be encouraged to reflect on their role in effective financial management.
