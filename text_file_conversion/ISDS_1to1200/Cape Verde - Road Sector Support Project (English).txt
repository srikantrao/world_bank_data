B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
If the project is successful, populations on targeted islands will travel via a continuous, reliable 
and well-maintained road network, facilitating national integration, and providing access to 
markets, administrative, health and education services, and income generating opportunities. 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
a.  Within the context of the Government’s overall Strategic Programme and current 
commitments, the project would support critical road transport infrastructure needs 
through all or a combination of the following approaches: (i) improving access roads 
linking villages and rural areas to main roads; (ii) filling critical gaps to establish a 
minimum continuous network within an island with the construction of a short section of 
new road (8-10 km. on St. Nicolau Island); and (iii) filling a major gap in an island 
network, through the construction of  bridges or providing access to a chronically poor 
access zone.  
b.  In addition to priority investments in road infrastructure, the project would support the 
Strategic Programme’s proposed support for institutional assistance, principally focusing 
on achieving road sector reforms and capacity building, but in order to deepen and 
Page  2
 
 
sustaining these, also on broad reform and capacity support to the Ministry of 
Infrastructure and Transport at large. To this end, a study on road maintenance needs, 
institutional reform, and road fund design will be launched promptly under a PPF. 
Additionally, the Ministry is considering moving towards Performance-based 
Management and Maintenance of Road Networks and is requesting to be included in a 
multi-country upcoming trust fund application supporting its preparation for piloting the 
approach. 
c.  Given the sectoral focus of the operation, it would seem this should be a sector lending 
operation. 
d. The following main components, with indicative activities and costs, are being 
considered: 
 
Institutional Support 
$3.0 M
 
Support to sector reform, capacity building and intermittent technical assistance to the 
Road Institute and Road Fund;  Assistance/mentoring in transport sector and 
organization of Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. 
 
Road Infrastructure 
$22.0 M
 
Targeted priority improvements identified in Programme, from among the options 
described above. 
 Discussions during identification revealed that the investments are 
likely to be concentrated in 5 islands and to include:

e.  The proposed project would aim to take a leadership role among donors in supporting 
sector reforms, particularly in road management, while supplementing commitments by 
other donors so as to ensure coherent and continuous road networks.  
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
a)  Proposed investments are mainly in rural areas in five islands. The road segments are 
identified in the section above. Of the 12 identified and proposed civil works locations, 
all but approximately 8-10 kilometers are on existing alignments. New road construction 
Page  3
 
 
– mainly in S. Nicolau - is limited to scarcely populated mountain area and is unlikely to 
result in involuntary resettlement. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
It is expected that the majority of the works will be carried out and supervised through the 
private sector contracting arrangements as has been the case in the recently completed transport 
project. Due to limited institutional capacity, the Ministry will commission consultants to prepare 
a limited environmental analysis with a mitigation plan for road and bridge construction and 
stone quarry related impacts which are anticipated to be minor.

III.  SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN 
 
a)  Target date for the Quality at Enhancement Review (QER) at which time the PAD-stage 
ISDS would be prepared: March 17, 2003. 
b)  For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-
stage ISDS. N/A.  
c)  A limited environmental analysis with a mitigation plan for the construction (roads and       
bridges) and stone quarry related impacts will be prepared. Both sets of impacts are 
anticipated to be minor since most of the road works will take place on existing 
alignments and the stones used come from the same sites that will be rehabilitated. The 
environmental analysis will be carried out, approved and disclosed prior to appraisal in 
Cape Verde and at the Bank’s Info shop.  Limited Environmental Assessment resulting in 
Environmental Management Plan or Guidelines will be built into design studies for the 
proposed investments.
