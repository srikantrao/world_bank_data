A.2. Project Objectives
The project objective is to provide Yerevan with safe, continuous water supply while reducing
environmental pollution.

A.3. Project Description
The project will have two components: YWWP Fund Component and Technical Assistance Component, as
well as refinancing the Project Preparation Facility.

Component 1--YWWP Fund
Specific investments to be undertaken will be identified by the operator during implementation, but
generally they will fall into three categories:

Energy savings:
Significant further reduction of energy cost is planned. System components consuming high amounts of
energy require capital investment to divert water production from pumped to gravity water resources and to
phase out old, inefficient pumping plants.


Reliability in the provision of water supply and in operational control:
Water abstraction is very high in comparison to consumption levels. Most YWSC water facilities are old,
have been poorly maintained and have received minimal investment for many years. Capital investment in
village supply lines, distribution networks, block service connections and daily regulating water reservoirs
are required to reduce losses and provide continuous water supply.


Reduction of environmental pollution:
Investment is required in sewage collection and small pumping stations. Sewage currently is discharged
directly into watercourses, in some cases in recreational areas of central Yerevan. The existing wastewater
treatment plant (WWTP) has fallen into dereliction. Its complete reconstruction or replacement is not
currently affordable; therefore, donor funding is sought for WWTP rehabilitation and these amounts are not
included in the Investment Fund.


Component 2--Technical Assistance will fund the interim operational management of YWSC, project
financial and technical audits and PMU incremental operating expenses.

Refinancing of Project Preparation Facility.


A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis:
The project will focus on the capital city area (about 33 percent of the national population) served by the
Yerevan Water and Sanitation Company.

 Section II ­ Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
 D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues.
 D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
 and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
 The project triggers OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment. No major environmental issues are anticipated,
 because the Investment Fund primarily will finance rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and only environmental
 category B or C investments. Certain investments however may require special mitigation measures to protect the
 environment and enhance health safety. The project will not present land acquisition or resettlement issues because
 all works will be on property owned by YWSC, or on municipal land or rights-of-way assigned to municipal
 infrastructure. During project preparation an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) framework has been prepared
 that identifies procedures to be followed during implementation to address environmental concerns. The EMP also
 provides guidelines on anticipated impacts on the environment and human health given the nature of the works
 expected to be supported by the project, and includes prevention and mitigation measures for possible impacts, and
 identifies authorities responsible for supervision and monitoring and the implementation schedule.


 Because the project will finance excavation works, the project also triggers draft OP 4.11 on
 Cultural Heritage. Because of Yerevan's antiquity, chance finds of cultural or historical assets
 during construction are possible, in which case appropriate mitigation measures will be
 implemented; no adverse impact is expected. Specific clauses will be incorporated into civil
 works contracts.

 Yerevan discharges to the Hrazdan River, which flows south to join the Araks, Armenia's largest
 and longest river. The Araks originates from the Anatolia Plateau and flows generally eastward,
 following Armenia's border until it turns north to join the Kura River. The operation will focus
 on rehabilitation of existing water and wastewater infrastructure, and will not involve
 investments in new construction, thus these investments will not adversely affect quality and
 quantity of water flows to other riparians. On the contrary, planned wastewater treatment
 investments will improve the quality of water flows to other riparians. Yerevan's water supply is
 taken from ground water and will not be adversely affected by other riparians' possible water
 use.

 D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
 in the project area.

 Potential positive or beneficial impacts:
  -Reduction of leakages around spring intake structures;
  -Prevention of pollution and contamination around springs by establishment and enforcement of sanitary
    protection zones in headwork area;
  -Provision of high quality drinking water leading to health improvement of the population;
  -Prevention and exclusion of infectious disease bacilluses from drinking water;
  -Providing population with 24-hour water supply;
-   Energy saving from better operation of existing pump stations and conversion to gravity schemes;
  -Water savings from reduced wastage and improved service;
  -Reduction of major service interruptions.


 Negative impacts
 The environmental assessment identified the following potential negative impacts of the project: (i) inappropriate
 disposal of excavated materials, construction debris, and small quantities of hazardous wastes related to
 construction activities (although no hazardous wastes have yet been identified and are unlikely to occur); (ii)
 inappropriate use and potential pollution of water sources; (iii) environmental damages caused by contractors
 during construction activities; and (iv) environmental damages caused by water operators during the implementation
 phase.


 D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant)

Not applicable


D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
An environmental screening will be undertaken to determine the importance and category of environmental
assessment (EA). Because Armenian environmental legislation does not establish classification of projects by
categories according to the importance and rate of their potential environmental impacts, the project's annual
investment program will be classified by EA categories specified in WB OP 4.01.


The project will be implemented by the unit currently implementing the Municipal Development Project (MDP),
which has ample experience in implementing World Bank projects and are well-versed in national requirements for
environmental protection.

The Project Monitoring Unit (PMU) will screen proposed investment programs, assign environmental categories and
inform the YWSC operator about the type and scope of environmental documentation--environmental assessment
and/or environmental management plan (EMP)--that needs to be prepared, the consultation and disclosure
requirements, and any other requirements under Armenian law. The YWSC operator will be responsible for
carrying out the appropriate EA/EMP for the annual investment program, fulfilling the environmental requirements
and obtaining all necessary permits. The implementation unit, through its own environmental specialist trained in
environmental assessment work and familiar with Bank OP 4.01 and Armenian environmental legislation, will
review environmental reports prepared by the YWSC operator and ensure proposed mitigation measures are
adequate. The implementation unit will submit to the Bank annual environmental screening assessments that
include analysis justifying the category assigned to each subproject. An annual EA/EMP will be sent to the Bank
for review and approval.


The EA/EMP will include mitigation, monitoring and institutional arrangements. The EA/EMP will identify
environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures for all works financed under the project.


If during construction, cultural or historical assets are found, works must be stopped and
Armenia's agency for preservation of cultural heritage must be notified. Works will resume only
after permit from the respective authorities has been issued.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Armenian environmental law regulating public consultation and information disclosure include:
·    "The Fundamentals of the RA legislation on Nature Protection" ensure citizens rights to request and receive
     timely and complete information concerning environmental issues;
·    The Law "On Environmental Impact Assessment" sets forth the process of assessment of environmental
     impacts;
·    The new Water Code also addresses public participation principles.


In accordance with Armenian legislation and World Bank guidelines, during elaboration of the EA/EMP framework,
the implementation unit consulted interested parties and local NGOs about the project's environmental aspects and
has considered their views. Two public hearings were held to introduce the YWWP and present and discuss the
EA/EMP framework. The first public hearing was April 10, 2004 in the REC Caucasus Armenian office in
Yerevan, and the second was May 8, 2004 in the implementation unit's premises in Yerevan.

Annual EA/EMP reports will be made available to local NGOs, any-affected groups and all other interested parties.

then has this been cleared with the Legal Department, and the memo to the          X
RVP prepared and sent?
What are the reasons for the exception?
    Please explain: The precise nature of investments to be financed during
    the project will be decided by YWSC's private operator and therefore
    cannot be determined ex-ante. The investments however will be limited to
    rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and they will not adversely affect
    the quality or quantity of water flows to other riparians. The criteria for
    selection of sub-projects will make it clear that such sub-projects will only
    deal with rehabilitation of existing schemes. Bank staff have considered
    the international aspects of the project and in their assessment, the project
    will not cause appreciable harm to the other riparians, and will not be
    appreciably harmed by other riparians' possible water use. As such, the
    proposed project was determined to fall under the exception to the
    notification requirements of paragraph 7(a) of Bank OP 7.50. The
    exception was approved by ECA's Regional Vice President on 14
    December 2004.
