3. Project Description
The project development objective is to assist Ukraine in implementing its EITI agenda towards a successful
validation process in line with the EITI Global Standard. Main component/activities include:

• Component A: EITI Implementation Support. This component will support the activities essential to EITI
implementation and meeting Ukraine's obligations as an EITI candidate country to reach compliance, such as
recruitment of an Independent Administrator (IA) in charge of the preparation of EITI reports, legal support
for the finalization of the draft EITI law, Extractives Legal and Regulatory Review and other relevant

activities.

• Component B: Capacity Building Activities. Building on lessons learnt from the preparation of the first
report, it will be important to help operators and state agencies better understand the EITI requirements.
Under this Component, the project will thus support advisory services for state agencies and companies
operating in the extractives industries to comply with EITI requirements.

• Component C: Communication and Outreach. This component will support the implementation of the
Ukraine EITI Communication Strategy for the first year of project implementation and will include the
activities such as print and visual media outreach campaigns, organization of awareness raising events,
Internet and social media activities.

• Component D: Project Management. This component will support the costs of the EITI National Secretariat
staff (National Coordinator of the Secretariat, Financial, Procurement and Public Relations Consultants) and
provide support for the operating costs of day to day activities carried out by the EITI Secretariat, under the
oversight of the MSG.
