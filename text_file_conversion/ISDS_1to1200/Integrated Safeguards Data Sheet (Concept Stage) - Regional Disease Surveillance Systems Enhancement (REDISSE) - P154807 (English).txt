B. Project Objectives
The project's development objective (PDO) is to strengthen cross-sectoral and regional capacity for
collaborative disease surveillance and response in West Africa.
C. Project Description
The PDO seeks to address systemic weaknesses within the animal and human health systems that
hinder effective diseases surveillance and response by: (i) strengthening the capacity of selected


﻿ECOWAS member countries to fulfill their respective and/or mutual obligations under the WHO
IHR (2005) and the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code; (ii) reinforcing sustainable and effective
regional collaboration and collective action to detect and respond promptly to priority infectious
diseases threats in Western Africa including zoonotic diseases; and (iii) establishing an efficient
O
Q)      linkage of country health systems to regional laboratory, surveillance and response networks.
Ultimately, the project will contribute towards significantly reducing the burdens of diseases
particularly among the poor and vulnerable populations most of whom are women, youth, elderly and
disabled persons, mitigating the public health and economic risks posed by infectious diseases in
humans and animals, and decreasing the threats of future diseases outbreaks thereby promoting
global health safety and security.
Project Components
The project will potentially comprise five components defined/described as follows:
Component 1: Surveillance and Information Systems for Early Detection and Analysis (US$50
Million)
A key component of the project will involve the strengthening of country surveillance, information
systems, including the establishment of a regional platform to promote collective action and cross-
border collaboration for early detection and analysis. Such platform will enable swift response to
emerging infectious diseases threats, particularly zoonosis, both within countries and regionally. The
project also seeks to strengthen the linkages of surveillance and response processes at the local
(community), sub-national and national levels of the health system to ensure the rapid detection of
new cases and potential disease outbreaks within high-risk communities via early reporting to local/
district health structures in real-time; and laboratory confirmation and classification of collected
samples, supported by a regional network. The linkages along these different levels and steps within
an animal health epidemiology and surveillance system shall be analyzed, optimized and formalized.
Some potential activities under this component include:
Country Level
Review and establishment of national priorities for infectious diseases affecting humans and animals;
Implementation of operational research such as the use of sentinel surveillance approaches that
complement community based and routine health facility based surveillance/reporting activities; an
o       approach to be included under this component is the set-up of pilot sites in already existing
government facilities for mortality assessment in line with the Child Health and Mortality Prevention
Surveillance (CHAMPS) sites funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The exact topics
will be identified through consultative and participatory processes.
Partnership with the private sector for the development of a state-of-the-art surveillance data
management, reporting and communication IT system.
Training of health workers as well as community members at different levels for early warning, case
detection, rapid reporting, and data analysis
Development of a system to ensure the adequate territorial meshing for surveillance activities, from
field to central level
Regional Level
Establishment of a regional information and communications technology (ICT) platform for efficient
e-surveillance and incident management, and the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to
study disease patterns;
Training of National Focal Points in participatory surveillance and early warning and reporting of


﻿notifiable diseases constituting PHEICs;
Strengthen technical and operational capacity of all actors involved in disease surveillance and
response including on cross-border cooperation for animal movement control, and rapid information
sharing within the region;
O
Q)      Development of harmonized technical procedures related to disease surveillance and information
sharing;
Improve efficiency and coordination of animal health epidemiological networks with human health
and other relevant network(s);
Development and supporting operational research, such as development of an incentives-based
mechanism to encourage early reporting of events as defined by the WHO and OIE; and
compensation mechanisms for animal culling (a process of removing animals from a breeding stock
based on selected criteria) in the event of an outbreak. The topics for regional level OR will be
decided through a consultative process;
Design of an impact evaluation study to inform the prioritization of diseases, and to assess the value
of an incentive-based approach to improving the functionality and effectiveness of a collaborative
RDSR platform.
Component 2: Strengthened Laboratory Capacity (US$90 Million)
This component will involve the identification and networking of existing public and private sector
laboratories at the regional and country levels. Some laboratories may be re-equipped or renovated.
New construction is not anticipated. Up to three laboratories, yet to be identified, may be upgraded
from BSL level 2 to BSL level 3. Adapting some lessons learned from the EAPHLN project, the
regional laboratory network will greatly contribute towards strengthening the capacities of national
veterinary and health laboratories and public health institutes, most notably in the areas of
surveillance, pathology for the earlier identification and diagnosis of priority infectious disease
pathogens, and AMR and insecticide resistance monitoring and mapping.
Potential activities under this component include:
Country Level
Development/strengthening of national quality assurance programs
Enhancing laboratory systems with the capacities for real time bio-surveillance of infectious diseases
in humans and animals;
Strengthen laboratory data management system and its interoperability with the surveillance
o       information systems;
Innovative use of ICTs to improve laboratory confirmation including investments in rapid diagnostic
tests (RDTs).
Regional level
Identification and strengthening of existing regional reference laboratories (internal renovations and
potential upgrading) for priority infectious diseases;
Application of the WHO-AFRO Five-Step Accreditation process to accredit all laboratories in the
proposed network to progressively meet the international certification with clearly defined
parameters for turnaround time, quality, and proficiency;
Partnership building with the private sector to support specific laboratory functions such as the
establishment of a specimen transporting network to facilitate the shipping of specimen within the
region and internationally (to global reference laboratories);
Implementation of a regional quality assurance program and the development of common standards
for country laboratories.
Component 3: Preparedness and Emergency Response (US$70 Million)


﻿This component will improve local, national and regional capacities of structures to prepare for
impending epidemics and respond effectively to disease outbreak threats including the resulting
mortality risks posed by infectious diseases. Key activities for consideration under this component
will include:
0

building via twinning with centers of one health excellence around the world and support operational
research through competitive mechanism.
Facilitate the establishment of a contingency emergency response funding mechanism for swift
mobilization and deployment of resources in response to major infectious disease outbreaks (refer to
Box 3)
Box 3: Contingency Emergency Response Fund (US$0)
When a major outbreak affects the livelihoods of project beneficiaries in the project areas,
governments may request the World Bank to reallocate project funds to support mitigation, response


﻿and recovery. This activity will draw resources from unallocated funds and/or allow countries to
request the World Bank to reallocate financing from other project components to partially cover the
costs of emergency response and recovery. Detailed operational guidelines acceptable to the World
Bank for implementing the REDISSE contingency emergency response activity will be prepared at
O
the regional level during the first year of the project's implementation. All expenditures under this
activity will be in accordance with paragraph 12 of World Bank OP 10.00 (Investment Project
Financing) and will be appraised, reviewed, and found to be acceptable to the World Bank before any
disbursement is made. Disbursements will be made against an approved list of goods, works, and
services required to support crisis mitigation, response and recovery.
Component 4: Retention of Trained Healthcare Workforce for Surveillance, epidemiological
intelligence, Laboratory functions, and Infection Prevention and Control (US$80 Million)
The fourth component will leverage on existing programs in the region such as the FETP, FELTPs,
V-FETP, and other workforce training programs that address critical public health areas such as
support to laboratory functions and IPC. Viable options will be explored to ensure a centrally
coordinated and efficient process for the retention of a skilled health workforce available for routine
surveillance and rapid deployment for case detection, laboratory confirmation of suspected cases,
vaccine distribution logistics, and for the delivery of primary healthcare needs for common illnesses
as part of outbreak response.
Under this component, potential activities include:
Country Level
Provide training, technical support, supervision and other incentives-based mechanisms for
community agents engaged in community-based surveillance and response for both public health and
veterinary health
Establishment of positions for field epidemiologists and laboratory specialists at the district level
Strengthen essential human resources for health (HRH) capacities for surveillance and response, and
improve practices for the assignment and retention of skilled health personnel by strengthening
capacities for HR management in line ministries
Regional Level
Training of district and national level health workers in core skillsets including training in data
o       management, epidemiology and laboratory practices, risk analysis (including risk assessment, risk
communication and risk management), IPC, and case management/containment of infectious patients
and livestock
Identification of pools of experts in the region to support regional institutions including the
ECOWAS-WAHO and the RAHC for planning and coordinating regional activities;
Support the staffing of one health centers in the region with highly qualified personnel.
Component 5: Institutional Capacity Building and Project Management (US$20 Million)
This component will provide support to national implementing agencies and regional institutions to
perform core functions in order to effectively implement, monitor and evaluate the project. Key
activities under this component will include:
Strengthen the capacities of national and regional institutions to efficiently perform core project
management functions including financial management of funds and procurement arrangements in
accordance with WB guidelines and procedures;
Enhance monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems including routine health management and


﻿information systems (HMIS) and other data sources;
Improve operational research capacity (availability of trained staff and usage of analytical methods
for informed decision-making) of national and regional institutions including to monitor and evaluate
the impact of project interventions and the effectiveness/efficiency of different implementation
O
U       approaches;
Coordinate the roles of existing national institutions to better support the planned project activities;
Recruitment and training of essential staff to complement existing teams at national and regional
levels in the areas of procurement, financial management, M&E, and social and environmental
safeguards management, including medical waste and supply chain management..
Due to the anticipated high level of community engagement, an overarching component of the
project will focus on capacity building geared towards improving inter-personal relationships,
building trust and mutual support between health personnel, at each level of the health system, and
members of the community to ensure appropriate understanding of local context, greater ownership
of project actions and full acceptance of project interventions within recipient communities; which
ultimately are expected to foster more sustainability
D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
analysis (if known)
The project will be delivered in 10 countries in Western Africa (Senegal, Guinea, Guinea Bissau,
Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire and Benin). However, the exact details of
the physical locations of the proposed project activities in each of the selected 10 participating
countries are not known at this point in time, and will likely not be known before project appraisal.
E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
The respective Borrowers have each and collectively benefitted from other (past and ongoing) IDA
projects which provided/are providing relatively sufficient capacity for understanding and applying
safeguard policies. In addition, borrowing countries globally, have adequate institutional and legal
frameworks that are expected to ensure satisfactory compliance with World Bank operational
safeguard Policies. Moreover, the Bank's involvement in the health sector has been significant and
the clients have overtime shown relatively sufficient capacity and good will in implementing World
Bank funded projects. Nonetheless, to ensure timely and successful processing and implementation
0
of this regional operation, the World Bank Group social and environmental safeguards specialists
will undertake an in-depth institutional assessment during project preparation and prior to appraisal
to determine the level and amount of additional technical capacity building each individual
participating country institutions, including the respective national environmental (and social)
agencies, may need to further strengthen their safeguards capacity to tangibly deliver this project.

II. SAFEGUARD POLICIES THAT MIGHT APPLY


﻿Safeguard Policies           Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
Environmental Assessment     Yes         The proposed project has been classified as a
OP/BP 4.01                               category B since its foreseen net social and
environmental risks and impacts of the proposed
project are expected to be positive and mostly site
specific since it will generate environmentally and
socially sound laboratory technologies and safe and
secure disposal of its generated waste. At this point
in time the exact nature, scope and physical footprint
of the proposed project activities' locations are not
known in sufficient details; Since the project will be
processed through OP/BP 10.00 paragraph 12 that
authorizes the deferral of the preparation of social
and environmental assessment documents till
implementation; therefore, the proponent will
prepare both a regional Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and a regional
generic Waste Management Plan (WMP) before
project implementation. During implementation,
when the quantity, composition, type and location
are known, country/ site specific waste management
plan would be prepared, consulted upon and
disclosed as well as implemented. The regional
ESMF will (i) outline the specific steps and
procedures that will be followed for preparing site
specific environmental and social safeguards
instruments such as Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP) as soon as the exact
locations and scope of sub-project activities are
known. (ii) This ESMF will also examine the
existing and potential environmental and social risks
and impacts associated with the proposed project
activities and propose appropriate mitigation
measures. Likewise, the regional BWMP will
provide specific guidelines as to how to properly
handle biomedical waste, from collection, transport,
storage and disposal. This regional ESMF will
greatly build on the previous ESMFs and related
selected EAs documents developed for the ongoing
Bank funded operations in the participating
countries, as well as on the lessons learned and
missed opportunities from experience in
implementing these ESMFs. Once the exact
characteristics of the physical locations and details
(nature, type, scope and scale) specific activities of
the selected research and training centers have been
identified, each country will then develop its site


﻿specific ESMPs to capture local specificities. The
regional ESMF and BWMP, together with the other
related safeguards documents (regional Pest and
Pesticide Management Plan and Resettlement Policy
Framework) will be consulted upon and publicly
disclosed both in the websites of the implementing
agency (ECOWAS/WAHO and in participating
countries thereafter) and at the InfoShop within three
month of project implementation.
Natural Habitats OP/BP 4.04  TBD         At this point in time it is not sufficiently clear that
the project activities and sub-projects would impact
Natural Habitats. This would be determine during
project preparation when the locations of such
activities would be clearer.
Forests OP/BP 4.36          TBD         At this point in time it is not sufficiently clear that
the project activities and sub-projects would impact
Forests. This would be determine during project
preparation when the locations of such activities
would be clearer.
Pest Management OP 4.09     Yes         The surveillance, monitoring and containment of
diseases including zoonosis could lead to increased
use of chemicals, reagents, and pesticides with
potential negative impacts and risks on the
environment and human health. Given the situation-
driven nature of the project, the extent of such an
increased use cannot be known in advance,
borrowers will prepare a regional generic Integrated
Pest/Vector and Pesticide Management Plan (IPMP/
IVMP) to identify the potential risks and ways to
adequately mitigate them. As with the regional
ESMF and WMP, this document will greatly build
on existing PMPs and/or IVMPs developed for the
Bank-funded projects in the respective beneficiary
countries. Since project will proceed under OP/PB
10.00 -para. 12 guidelines that allows deferral for the
preparation of social and environmental assessments;
borrowers will consult stakeholders and publicly
disclose the regional PMP in the regional
implementing agency (ECOWAS/WAHO) websites
(and thereafter in each individual participating
countries) and at InfoShop within three month of
project implementation.
Physical Cultural Resources  TBD        At this point in time it is not clear that the project
OP/BP 4.11                              activities and sub-projects would infringe or impact
any social and cultural artifacts in the respective
countries. This would be determined during project


﻿preparation when the physical footprints of the
locations of such activities would be made clearer.
Nevertheless, to ensure adequate measures are taken
on due course, chance-finds procedures will be
embedded as an annex to the regional ESMF and the
follow site specific ESMPs.
Indigenous Peoples OP/BP    No           There are no Indigenous Peoples in the participating
a       4.10                                      9 countries as defined by OP/BP 4.10.
Involuntary Resettlement OP/  Yes        Though it has been stated that the project activities
BP 4.12                                  will be in already existing government owned
facilities; the matter fact remains that in the event of
diseases outbreak the acquisition of land outside
government own facilities for curling, burial and
incineration of carcass cannot be ruled out. Erring on
the side of caution, OP/BP 4.12 is triggered because
of the expected land acquisition, loss of assets or loss
of access to livelihoods support means upon which
local beneficiary communities depend., the
Borrowers will prepare a standalone regional
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to set forth
the basic principles and prerogatives to be followed
during project implementation once the details
footprints of project intervention areas are known.
The project interventions will avoid where possible
adverse impacts on people, land and other economic
resources and livelihoods. In situations where this
cannot be avoided, and footprints of project
intervention areas are known, each participating
country will prepare site specific Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) to address the needs of people
who will be affected by loss of economic activities,
access to resources, land acquisition and/or
involuntary resettlement. he RAPs (and ARAPs) will
be consulted upon and publicly disclosed both in the
regional implementing agency (ECOWAS/WAHO)
websites (and thereafter in each individual
participating countries) and at the World Bank
InfoShop within three month of project
implementation.
Safety of Dams OP/BP 4.37   No           The implementation of the project will not entail the
construction of new dams neither will any of the
project activities rely on the performance of an
existing dam or a dam under construction.
Projects on International   No           TThis project will not involve extraction of water
Waterways OP/BP 7.50                     from any international waterways (any river, canal,
lake, pond or similar body of water that forms a


﻿boundary between, or any river or body of surface
water that flows through, two or more states, whether
Bank members or not). In addition, the REDISSE
project will not impact any tributary or other body of
surface water that is a component of any waterway
O                                                described above.
Projects in Disputed Areas OP/ No        The REDISSE project will not be located in Disputed
a       BP 7.60                                  Areas as defined by OP/BP 7.60.
III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN
A. Tentative target date for preparing the PAD Stage ISDS: 30-Jan-2016
B. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
The specific studies and their timingi should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
It was agreed that the project will be processed through OP/BP 10.00 paragraph 12 that authorizes
the deferral of the preparation of social and environmental assessment documents till
implementation. The framework approach will be applied in this project as the scope (nature, type
and amplitude) and exact physical locations of all project activities in either participating
countries, are not known enough at this time and will not be known before appraisal, and certainly
at the dawn of the implementation phase; accordingly, standalone regional Biomedical Waste
Management Plan (BWMP), Pest Management Plan (PMP) as well as Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) depicting the
procedures and process that would be followed in preparing site specific safeguard instruments
(ESMPs and RAPs) as soon as the exact locations and scope of sub-project activities will be
prepared, amply consulted upon and publicly disclosed both in the regional implementing agency
(ECOWAS/WAHO) websites (and then in each individual participating countries) and at the
InfoShop during project implementation.
At this point in time both the characteristics (nature, type and scale/scope) and exact physical
locations of project activities are not known in sufficient details, and will not be known before
appraisal, and certainly at the very dawn of the implementation phase the proponents will prepare
fours standalone regional safeguards instruments, namely the Environmental and Social
Management Framework (ESMF), Waste Management Plan (WMP), Integrated Pest Management
Plan (IPMP) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). The two frameworks (ESMF and RPF)
will each outline the specific steps and procedures that will be followed for preparing site specific
environmental and social safeguard instruments such as Environmental Management Plans
(EMPs), and Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) as maybe needed once the characteristics and
physical footprints of project activities are clearly known during project implementation. The
ESMP, RAP, IPMP/IVMP and WMP will be consulted upon and publicly disclosed in the regional
implementing agency (ECOWAS/WAHO) websites (and thereafter in each individual
participating countries) and at the InfoShop within three month of project implementation.
