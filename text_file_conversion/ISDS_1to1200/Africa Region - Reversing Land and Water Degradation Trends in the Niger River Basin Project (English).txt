A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The Project development objective is to provide the nine riparians, through strengthened capacity and better 
understanding of the Basin’s land and water resources, an opportunity to define a transboundary framework 
for the sustainable development of the Niger Basin. The Bank implemented components aim to strengthen 
Niger Basin Authority’s (NBA) regional management capacity, improve data management capacity, and 
formalize an inclusive decision-making processes for basin-level transboundary environmental planning to 
reverse land and water degradation in the Basin.  
 
The Project’s global environmental objectives are to reduce and prevent transboundary water-related 
environmental degradation, prevent land degradation, protect globally significant biodiversity, through 
sustainable and cooperative integrated management of the Basin, while enhancing existing capacity through 
informed decision-making, and ensuring the public’s greater involvement in the Basin’s decision-making 
process.

A.3. Project Description 
 
The GEF Project falls under GEF Operational Program 9, “Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area” 
which has a long term objective to “achieve multiple global environmental benefits through implementation of 
IW projects which utilize integrated land and water management strategies that help achieve changes in 
sectoral policies and activities while promoting sustainable development.” The GEF Project addresses the 
environmental aspects of managing the Niger River Basin and focuses primarily on institutional capacity 
building, data management and stakeholder involvement in tackling land and water degradation. This nine-
country, five-year, single-phase, US$13
1
 million GEF-funded Project will engage stakeholders
2
 at the local, 
national and regional levels to ensure that activities occur at the appropriate levels following the principle of 
subsidiarity. Notably, the Project works extensively with the NBA in order to strengthen its ability to better 
serve the Basin countries, and fulfill NBA’s mandate “to promote cooperation among the member countries 
and to ensure integrated development in all fields.” The six Project components, the total costs, and the 
Implementing Agency (IA) support for the components are summarized below:  
 
\01\02
Component 1: 
 
Institution Building 
(
US$3.50 million, Bank implementation support
): The component 
activities augment existing regional, national institutional capacity to manage and implement concurrent 
regional projects. At the regional level, a Project management and coordination unit (
Unité de gestion et 
de coordination d
e
s programmes, 
PMCU) will be established jointly with the concurrent ADB program to 
optimize human and financial resources.  
\01\02
Component 2: Capacity Building
 (
US$1.62 million, UNDP implementation support
): The component 
activities are designed to reach out to the communities, facilitate consultations, and build capacity on 
issues relating to environmental management at the local, national and regional levels. The capacity 
building activities will synergize with the ADB national- and local-level program activities and link with 
the national and local capacity building efforts of Component 5. The component includes a public 
education and awareness program and focused training. 
\01\02
Component 3: Data Management
 (
US$1.14 million, Bank implementation support
): To complement the 
ongoing work on water and environment data collection that is being done in the Basin’s countries, the 
component will evaluate the status of the Basin’s hydrologic, environmental, and socioeconomic data, and 
identify the institutional modalities needed for data collection, sharing, and dissemination for decision-
makers. The component includes an Environmental Information System framework. 
\01\02
Component 4: Regional Forum
 (
US$0.38 million, UNDP implementation support
):
 
This component will 
facilitate the exchange of lessons and good practices from other regional projects in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
expand on IW:Learn, and strengthen the relationship with existing pan-African and international networks 
of Basin organizations, such as the Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification (UNCCD/Sub-Regional Action Program), the Southern African Development Community 
(SADC) Water Sector Coordination Unit, etc. . With guidance from the two implementing agencies and 
support from the PMCU, the NBA will organize a forum to promote and strengthen these network 
relationships. 
\01\02
Component 5: Demonstration Pilots and Microgrant Program.
 (
US$5.0 million, UNDP implementation 
support
): This component aims to support two paralleling efforts in all nine Basin countries. The first 
assists communities in tackling environmental problems, through the implementation of nine priority 
Demonstration Pilots. This will demonstrate good-practices in managing land and water resources. 
Subsequently, the secondary level of effort draws on the lessons from these Demonstration Pilots within 
the broader Basin, through support for a series of community-based, microgrant-supported interventions. 
This component will be managed by the national Project teams with relevant support from experienced 
organizations based in the field, and lead to immediate action on the ground. 
                                                          
 
1
 World Bank implemented components total US$6.0 million; and UNDP implemented components total 
US$7.0 million. 
2
 Stakeholders will include but not limited to regional, national, NBA counterparts, and national players in 
the appropriate sectors, local communities and institutions. 
Page  4
 
 
\01\02
Component 6: TDA and SAP Preparation
 (
US$ 1.36 million, Bank implementation support
): The 
component activities will finalize the preliminary Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis (TDA) conducted 
during Project preparation in the main stem countries (Benin, Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Nigeria) by 
extending the diagnostic analysis process to the remaining four riparian countries (Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Chad and Côte d’Ivoire). This will provide the basis for preparing the Strategic Action Plan 
(SAP). The SAP will focus on the land and water issues and complement the Shared Vision’s multi-
sectoral Sustainable Development Action Program. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The Project is located in the Niger River Basin, West Africa. The nine countries that share the Basin (Benin, 
Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Chad Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger and Nigeria) are all signatories to the 
Convention that led to the creation of the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) that will be the primary representative 
of the Basin stakeholders in the context of this Project.

Comments:  
 
The Project, generally a capacity building effort, is considered benign given all activities are to be designed to 
have no significant environmental or social impacts. As some of the proposed Microgrant supported 
interventions may potentially have minor short-term environmental impacts, the environmental classification 
is “B”. The environmental assessment/evaluation will be in the form of an Environmental and Social 
Management Framework (ESMF). The ESMF will provide guidance for compliance with environmental and 
social safeguards and tools for good management practices. A public information and education campaign on 
good management practices is included in the Microgrant Program. The NBA prepared the ESMF in 
accordance to national, environmental polices, and the World Bank environmental and social safeguard 
polices. The ESMF was disclosed at the NBA/Executive Secretariat, and through the NBA Focal Points, 
World Bank offices, and UNDP Country Offices and World Bank InfoShop and Public Information Centers 
(PIC).

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The ESMF is consistent with the Safeguard Policies as noted above, to ensure appropriate approval 
conditions and public disclosure. It is understood that the Project will not trigger Dam Safety OP 4.37. The 
Project will not support or trigger the OP for any activities that include pest management (OP 4.09), nor is 
it expected that Project activities would disturb/affect cultural property (OPN 11.03). The Project will not 
involve any hydroelectric, irrigation, flood control, navigation, drainage, water and sewerage, industrial, or 
other similar projects involving the use of an international waterway. OP/BP 7.50, Projects on International 
Waterways, is triggered. However, the nine riparian countries of the Niger river (Benin, Burkina Faso, 
Cameroon, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Nigeria) are beneficiaries to the Project, as the 
project will be implemented in each of those countries. Institutional arrangements have been carried out to 
establish national project team in each riparian country under NBA's overall guidance and coordination for 
the project implementation. Moreover, the recipient of the GEF grant will be the Niger Basin Authority, 
which is common institution of the nine riparian countries of the Niger Basin. Under those circumstances, 
the requirement of notification of other riparians does not apply. The Project will not trigger involuntary 
resettlement (OP4.12) according to the GEF microgrant criteria, nor will it finance activities related to (i) 
land acquisition; and/or (lost of assets and resources). 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
No cumulative impacts are anticipated at this point.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Alternative (e.g. site development plan) will be considered in the design and approval of micro-projects 
under Component 5 and also will be subject to the same environmental and social screening as other 
activities. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
NBA and local consultants prepared the ESMF in accordance with national environmental policies and in 
line with the Bank’s Safeguard Policies noted in Section 11.D 1a. The ESMF was disclosed at the NBA 
Executive secretariat, NBA focal points, World Bank and UNDP Country offices, at the Bank’s Infoshop, 
and Project Information Centers (PIC) prior to appraisal. The ESMF together with the Microgrant 
Operational Manual will be the mechanism for screening and clearing the Microgrant application. If a 
safeguard policy is triggered then the Microgrant Operational Manual will provide the tools for good 
management practices to minimize environmental and social impacts. 
 
Although, NBA has limited institutional capacity, its good quality environmental staff and its over-30 years 
of experience in land and water management as demonstrated in some projects financed by several donors 
such as the JALDA
3
 project, has proven track record in the management of previous environmental 
projects, and thus should have no problem in preparing and implementing the environmental safeguards for 
the projects, including the supervision of the ESMF.  Guidance on the ESMF requirements and the Bank 
social and environmental safeguard policies was provided during appraisal to the NBA and relevant 
stakeholders, as they pertain to the Demonstration Pilots and Microgrant Program, compliance and 
approval conditions, and public disclosure process. As part of Component 2 and 5, support and training on

social impact will continue to reinforce the capacity of NBA and its local partners on environmental and 
social issues.  
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The stakeholders primarily concerned by the project’s activities implementation are: the technical services, 
local NGOs and communities. 
 
Consultations and workshops where held during the Project preparation and execution of PDF-B activities 
to discuss with the NBA and national counterparts the potential environmental and social impacts and to 
outline the importance to incorporate an environmental and social framework in the project design. NBA 
has prepared the ESMF as part of the Microgrant Operational Manual. The Microgrant Operational Manual 
will be disclosed as part of the implementation of Component 5, thus achieving full-scale public 
involvement in project implementation. The Microgrant Program priority actions will indeed be carried out 
at the local and community level, directly involving the above mentioned stakeholders. These will be 
informed and mobilized through a series of stakeholder workshops in each site, on the good management 
practices and minimizing social and environmental impacts which might otherwise lead to resettlement, 
land acquisition and reduction of natural and financial resources, whereas the Local Coordination and 
Consultation Committees will be permanently located in the micro-project localities where they can be 
accessed by interested community beneficiaries. Component 2 of the project specifically addresses 
participation, involvement and public awareness.  
 
In terms of public disclosure process, a) the ISDS was reviewed with NBA during the pre-appraisal mission 
(May, 2003), and appraisal mission (January, 2004); b) the ESMF was prepared by the NBA and local 
stakeholders and was disclosed prior to appraisal at the InfoShop, World Bank offices, UNDP offices, NBA 
headquarters, and with the NBA Focal Point in each country; and c) the updated ESMF will be disclosed to 
the InfoShop, PICs, World Bank offices, UNDP offices, the NBA and country Focal Points, prior to  
Negotiations (March, 2004).
