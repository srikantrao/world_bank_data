B.  Project Objectives  
 
The project will support the recovery efforts of the government of Grenada through the financing 
of critical important and rehabilitation activities in key social sectors.  Financing is provided on 
an emergency basis to avoid the usual time lag between the end of the relief period and 
reconstruction.  Due to the catastrophic losses in the education and health sectors, and their core 
importance to Grenadian society, the focus of this project will be to rehabilitate infrastructure in 
these areas.  Specific objectives include: 
 
(1) 
Support the Government’s overall reconstruction program through the financing of 
critical import; 
(2) 
Restore school infrastructure to an operational level and ensure a prompt return of 
children to schools; 
(3) Support to the rehabilitation of healthcare infrastructure to ensure adequate delivery of 
health services throughout the island.

C.  Project Description  
 
This project will consist of four components including:  
 
(I) 
Financing of critical imports; 
(II) 
Assistance to the recovery of the education sector; 
(III) 
Assistance to the recovery of the health sector; 
(IV) 
Support to Project Management and Supervision. 
 
I. 
Financing of critical imports (US$ 2 million)
.
This component will finance the 
import of low sulfur diesel fuel necessary for electricity generation and 
transportation needed to maintain economic activity and to the Government’s 
overall reconstruction effort.  The inclusion of this sole import is based on an 
assessment of Grenada’s monthly import bill and review of satisfactory 
procurement practices. 
 
II. 
Rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools (US$ 5.0 million)
.
One of the most 
urgent reconstruction priorities of the government is the rebuilding of damaged or 
destroyed schools.  Only 2 of the 75 primary and secondary schools on the island 
are currently in an operational condition.  Reconstruction will be implemented in 
two phases; an initial rehabilitation phase to make facilities operationally 
functional where student will be able to attend school on a shift system; and full 
reconstruction phase to complete repairs and bring affected schools in line with 
appropriate standards.  This component will finance the technical assistance for 
the design and supervision of the reconstruction, the actual rehabilitation works, 
as well as the purchase of school supplies when these have been destroyed or 
damaged. 
 
III. 
Restoration of St. George’s Hospital and regional health facilities (US$ 2.5 
million)
.
The principal hospital on the island suffered roof damage resulting in  
the loss of its laboratory facility.  As this facility is essential to the island health 
care system it must be restored as soon as possible.  In the vicinity of Grenville, 
on the eastern side of the island, Princess Alice Hospital has been virtually 
destroyed.  Other health care facilities around the island have been damaged and 
are in need of repairs.  This component will finance the technical assistance 
necessary to develop a strategy for addressing rehabilitation works, the physical 
rehabilitation of health infrastructure and the purchase of medical supplies and 
equipment when these have been damaged by the Hurricane. 
 
IV. 
Support to Project Management and Supervision (US$ 0.2 million)
.
While the project 
will be implemented by the same PCU currently implementing the ERDMP, ERP, 
HIV/AIDS and OECS Education projects, additional resources will be needed to face 
the current emergency and increased workload in processing and supervising contracts.  
This component will finance limited office equipment and technical assistance to 
support implementation during the first year of the project.

D.  Project location  
 
The project will be carried out nationwide with an emphasis on the region most affected by 
Hurricane Ivan, which includes the re
gion south of a line drawn from Grenville to St. George’s. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The project will be classified as Category B.  No adverse environmental or social issues have 
been identified.  However, it is judged prudent to keep some environmental oversight in view of 
the potential impacts of the rehabilitation or reconstruction of community infrastructure.  
Because of the emergency nature of this project, it is proposed that, pursuant to OP 8.50, the 
project be relieved from OP 4.01 requirements, with adequate justifications included in the loan 
document.  Appropriate EA will be conducted in the first six months of the project for all 
components and investments that require one.
