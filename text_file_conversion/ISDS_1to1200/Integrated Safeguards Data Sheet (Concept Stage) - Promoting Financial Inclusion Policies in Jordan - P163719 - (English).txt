3. PROJECT LOCATION AND SALIENT PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS RELEVANT TO THE SAFEGUARD ANALYSIS (IF
   KNOWN)
The project is limited to conducting analysis, providing training and capacity building and different TA
activities. The project will not involve any civil works that would cause any impacts on the environment.
Therefore, the World Bank Operational Policy 4.01 on Environmental Assessment does not apply. If project
activities change, the Bank may reassess the application of OP 4.01 and require further environmental
assessment. From the social perspective, significant positive impacts are expected as the TA is designed to
strengthen social inclusion of women and disadvantaged groups. At present, no land acquisition will be
needed and OP 4.12 will not be triggered, however, if in the future the financing would eventually lead to
components that may entail land acquisition, a terms of reference for the preparation of a resettlement
instrument might be required.
