                           The main objective of this project is to support the creation of capacity in Mozambique's Supreme
                           Audit Institutions (the Mozambican Tribunal Administrativo or TA) to provide its audit staff with
                           internationally-accepted continuous professional auditing education, training and certification.
                           C. Project Description
                           Mozambique suffers from a severe lack of internationally qualified accountants. All the corporate
                           entities in Mozambique, including investments with foreign participation, are affected by a serious
                           shortage of qualified accountants and trained accounting technicians. Estimates are that there are less
                           than 15 fully qualified Mozambican accountants, all of which are in the private sector. Most of the
                           corporate financial statements in the country are therefore prepared by accounting technicians whose
                           level of skill and training is variable. At one extreme, a limited number of accounting technicians
                           have completed training, which has not prepared them nearly at the level of a fully qualified
                           accountant; and at another extreme, many technicians have no formal training. Most of the financial
                           statement audits in the country are primarily carried out by representatives of the 6 international
                           networks. The lack of senior-level local staff within those networks is of concern particularly as
                           regulators lack any capacity to monitor the quality of financial reporting.

                           TA intends to pursue an education and training program which is initially not as stringent in terms of

                           requirements as international qualifications, but which will progressively prepare the auditors for
                           international qualification certifications. There are significant constraints to obtaining internationally
                           recognized certification such Certified Public Accountant/Chartered Account or their equivalent
                           given (i) inadequate college/university education of auditors to enable a direct entry to a certification
                           program, (ii) costs involved and unavailability of study materials (iii) availability of qualified
                           institutions to provide to such training and accreditation. Therefore, it is important to design and
                           implement training programs which are though aligned with the internationally recognized
                           certifications, but which are initially less stringent in terms of costs, eligibility, understandability,
                           language and Continuing Professional Development (CPD) requirements. Such a program will
                           provide the TA auditors with the necessary tools to become ready for international level
                           certifications.
