A.2. Project Objectives 
 
Within the context of the country’s longer-term interests in disaster hazard mitigation, the project 
development objective is to: (a) minimize the exposure of humans, livestock, and riverine flora and fauna 
to radionuclides associated with abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste rock dumps in the Mailuu-
Suu area; (b) improve the effectiveness of emergency management and response by national and sub-
national authorities and local communities to disaster situations; and (iii) reduce the loss of life and 
property in key landslide areas of the country. 
 
These objectives will be accomplished through key mitigation measures designed to: (i) isolate and 
protect abandoned uranium mine tailings and waste dumps from disturbance by natural processes such as 
landslides, floods, and from leaching and dispersal processes associated with ground- and surface-water 
drainage; (ii) create a disaster management and response system that can be administered effectively by 
national and sub-national authorities, and local communities; and (iii) develop a system to detect and 
warn against active landslide movements in key hazard areas. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project will provide grant assistance under two major components, with a third smaller component 
providing project management support. 
 
Component 1 – Uranium Mining Wastes Isolation and Protection (UMWIP) (US $7.61 million).  The 
component will finance interventions to isolate and protect abandoned uranium mining wastes and rocks 
in the Mailuu-Suu area.  This will be done through a number of activities that have been clearly defined 
and can be implemented with limited remaining preparatory and design work.  In parallel, investigations 
and designs will take place to determine larger mitigation measures of some of the most dangerous 
tailings and/or landslides.         
 
The five early activities, with an estimated aggregate cost (inclusive of price and physical contingencies) 
of US $3.4 million for investigations, designs and construction works, include: (i) Tectonic Landslide 
Unloading (US $0.7 million); (ii) Tailings and Waste Dumps Inspection and Rehabilitation (US $1.24 
million); (iii) Koi
-
Tash Landslide 
–
Diversion of Surface Water Runoff (US $0.25 million); (iv) 
Page  2
Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning Systems (US $0.49 million); and (v) Riverbank Strengthening 
along Aylyampa Sai and Mailuu-Suu Rivers (US $0.69 million).   
 
In parallel to the above, a detailed feasibility study will consider options for either stabilizing tailing No. 
3
in-situ and minimizing the potential impact of the Tectonic landslide or moving tailing No. 3 to a new 
s
ecure disposal location, using modern hazardous waste technologies.  In this case the study will include 
site selection and a full environmental impact assessment.  The cost estimate for either of these options is 
around US $3 million, which is the amount that has been reserved under available project funds for the 
implementation of the preferred option. 
 
In addition, the same study will recommend measures to either stabilize the Koi-Tash landslide, or reduce 
the risk of a natural dam from this landslide blocking the Mailuu-Suu River valley using a flank bypass 
of the river.  Remaining project funds will be used for priority works on Koi-Tash.  About US $0.5 
million has been allocated to implement priority activities.  Studies to design additional long-term 
remedial options for the Mailuu-Suu tailings (e.g. tunneling of the Mailuu-Suu River or putting in safe 
location other tailings) are also planned.  Government could use the results of the studies to attract 
additional financing from donors. 
 
Component 2 
–
Disaster Preparedness and Monitoring (DPM) (US $3.38 million).  The component will 
include: 
 
(i) Capacity Building.  A program of capacity building will be implemented to strengthen the ability of 
the Ministry of Ecology and Emergencies (MEE), administrations at various levels, and local 
communities to fulfill better their duties and functions related to disaster monitoring and management, 
create better awareness, and be better prepared and responsive in case of disasters  (US $2.44 million); 
(ii) Landslide and Seismic Monitoring and Warning Systems.  About 20 large landslides that could cause 
major disasters in nearby villages in case of unloading have been identified.  They will be equipped with 
real-time monitoring and warning systems.  Seismic measurement and forecasting equipment, earthquake 
detectors and a mobile seismic assessment station will be provided, in order to improve the monitoring 
and assessment of potentially damaging seismic events (US $0.42 million); and
 
(iii) Monitoring System in Mailuu-Suu.  A comprehensive monitoring system covering climatic, seismic, 
hydrological, geo-chemical, and environmental parameters in Mailuu-Suu will be developed and 
implemented to support and complement Component 1 interventions, determine the baseline situation, 
and measure project outcomes and long-term impacts (US $0.51 million).
 
Component 3 – Project Management (PM) (US $0.94 million).  This component will provide funding for 
the staffing and operation of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), so that project implementation can be 
carried out in a timely and effective manner.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
The project will concentrate on Southern rural mountainous areas of the Kyrgyz Republic, including the 
Mailuu-Suu uranium ore mining and milling area in Jalal-Abad Oblast, where poorly maintained tailing 
impoundments pollute the environment and landslide activities threaten the stability of tailings.  
 
Mailuu-Suu town is located at 41.13 degrees north latitude and 72.51 degrees east longitude, about 60 km 
north-west of Jalal-Abad and about 25 km from the border with Uzbekistan. The town has approximately 
25,000 inhabitants and is located in proximity to 23 uranium tailing impoundments and 13 mine waste rock 
deposits.  Smaller settlements are located in the valleys of the Mailuu-Suu, Kara-Agach and Aylyampa Sai 
Rivers.  In most cases the tailings and waste rock dumps lie upstream of the communities, sometimes close 
to populated areas.  In fact, in the settlement of Kara-Agach, waste rock dumps are located in the center of 
the settlement. 
 
Hazardous substances from the tailings can migrate to local groundwater, be released downstream along the 
Page  3
Mailuu-Suu River or be dispersed downwind by the prevailing wind (dust and radon gas). Accordingly, the 
Project area for environmental examination purposes is defined in general terms as the area adjacent to the 
proposed intervention sites and the immediate area downstream of  the Mailuu-Suu valley. 
 
Other project sites are were unstable landslides threaten large villages.

An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP) were prepared 
during project preparation, financed by the EU-funded Joint Environmental Program.  The EIA report 
describes the necessary environmental management procedures and technical prerequisites for maintaining 
good environmental practice regarding the proposed interventions at the project sites.   
The EMP establishes a frameworks for the identification and implementation of environmental protection, 
mitigation, and monitoring and institutional strengthening measures to be taken during project 
implementation to avoid or eliminate negative environmental and social impacts.       
IDA received the final drafts of the EIA and EMP reports on February 19, 2004.  The EIA was reviewed 
and cleared by Rita Klees (Sr. Environmental Specialist) and Joseph Goldberg (Sector Manager) on March 
16, 2004.  The EIA and EMP reports have been translated in Russian and are publicly available in MEE.  
IDA was informed in a letter from the Minister of MEE of March 30, 2004 that the EIA report has been 
approved and can be submitted to the Bank’s InfoShop, which was done on April 6, 2004. 
Section II 
–
Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The majority of areas subject to the proposed interventions are currently degraded, either by current and 
historical anthropogenic activity, e.g. industrial waste, mine tailings, waste rock dumps, deforestation, 
and over-grazing, or by natural processes, e.g. landslides, mudslides, and large-scale slumping.  In 
particular, the Mailuu-Suu area is characterized by natural risks from landslides, severe soil erosion from 
deforestation and overgrazing, industrial dereliction, radiological contamination, chronic health 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
problems, and socio-economic decline.  MEE has classified the Mailuu-Suu area as a hazard zone of 
environmental pollution.   
 
The project is expected to result in significant environmental and community benefits, including: (i) 
reduction in risk of landslides and failure of tailings impoundments; (ii) strengthening of tailing dams to 
p
revent river erosion and radionuclides from entering the river system; (iii) associated benefits such as 
reduction in exposure to radionuclides (water, foodstuffs, direct radiation from tailings); (iv) improved 
road infrastructure within the Mailuu-
Suu valley, as required to fulfill the project’s objective; and (v) 
improved public awareness of the radiological hazards and measures the local community should take to 
reduce the uranium related health risks.  The project will seek to provide temporary job opportunities for 
the local population.  It will also provide a mechanism for community consultation and improved 
dissemination of information to the public.   
 
The project is not expected to result in any significant and/or irreversible environmental or negative 
socio-economic consequences.  Ensuring that the contractors follow good management practice will 
minimize potential negative impacts during construction such as soil erosion, discharge of sediment and 
waste to the river, and community disturbance from dust, noise and traffic diversion.  Socio-economic 
issues during construction such as temporary loss of pasture for grazing livestock, road access, and public 
safety will be addressed during final design of the interventions.  Measures are proposed to ensure that 
tailings areas are rehabilitated in sequence, after which they are returned to the local community for safe 
grazing. 
 
The project addresses tailings dams safety, therefore OP 4.37 - Safety of Dams applies.  The preparation 
team included the necessary expertise (including geo-technical, risk management, hydrology, and seismic) 
to review the tailing dams.  Included in the preparation team was a member of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to strengthen expertise with regard to broader risk management associated with the 
hazardous nature of the retained tailings.  A core group of this preparation team may form the basis for the 
constitution of a Panel of Experts, not just for dam safety issues, but more broadly for issues related to 
major decisions on tailings and landslides.  The composition of the Panel will thus depend on the selection 
of the major activities. 
 
The project triggers OP 7.50 as the Mailuu-Suu river is a transboundary river that flows into the Naryn and 
Syr Darya rivers, all international waterways as defined by Paragraph 1(a) of OP 7.50.  Potential changes in 
water flow or deterioration in water quality during the construction works will be mitigated through 
implementation of the EMP.  Project interventions will not materially affect the quality or quantity of water 
flows to downstream riparian states.  During the past few years there have been a number of meetings on 
the Mailuu-Suu tailings issues with participation from politicians and specialists from the riparian 
countries.  As good practice, a notification letter was sent in February 2004 to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and 
Kazakhstan to inform these riparian states about the proposed interventions.  Government is interested to 
continue this information sharing during project implementation.     
The project does not anticipate relocation and restricted use, except for some temporary situations.  For this 
purpose a Policy Framework was prepared to establish a participatory mechanism by which members of 
potentially affected communities take part in: (a) the design of project activities and identification of the 
related restrictions of access that will be appropriate for achieving the objectives of the project, (b) the 
determination of necessary measures to help mitigate the adverse impacts associated with such restrictions, 
and (c) the implementation and monitoring of relevant project activities. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
None. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The “do nothing” approach was considered and rejected.  The uranium tailings that are present in 
Page  5
Mailuu-Suu contain materials that are radioactive and chemically toxic, containing relatively high levels 
of uranium decay products, including hazardous substances such as thorium, uranium, radium, selenium 
and lead, which have the potential to cause serious long-term pollution and health hazards.  Although 
some of the tailings sites currently present only a low-level threat, a serious danger arises if their contents 
are disturbed and widely dispersed into the environment.  Sudden dispersion of pollution from some of 
t
he tailings could make the Mailuu-Suu River water unfit to drink and use for irrigation purposes.  
Without action, there is a high risk that uranium tailings could be displaced into the river within the next 
few years by earthquake, landslide, or flood events, with resulting major contamination concerns in and 
around Mailuu-
Suu, and downstream in neighboring Uzbekistan.  The “do nothing” alternative is not a 
viable option for the area’s problems. 
 
Due to the complex nature of the problems in the Mailuu-Suu region, including the interaction of man-
made and natural hazards (i.e. uranium mine tailings and landslides/floods), a range of alternatives were 
considered for implementation within the project.  Sufficient resources are not available to solve all the 
potential risks.  However, rather than waiting with a project until all the possible activities have been 
fully prepared and sufficient funds have been made available from various interested donors, it was 
decided to start the assistance as soon as possible.  The main thrust of the project is therefore separated 
into short-term actions that can be implemented quickly and more long-term solutions that require further 
feasibility investigation to confirm optimum utilization of available resources under the project and to 
prepare documentation to attract additional donor funds.  Despite the fact that not all issues are likely to 
be solved with available funds, at the completion of the works proposed within this project the high 
likelihood risks will have been significantly reduced and the institutional capacity to deal with disaster 
management will have improved.   
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The country has relatively strong environmental legislation and mechanisms, which include environmental 
impact assessment and environmental permit procedures for most civil works activities.  The EMP, 
approved by the Kyrgyz authorities is considered part of overall project implementation and will be 
annexed to the Project Implementation Plan.  The Development Grant Agreement has a covenant requiring 
execution of the EMP by the Borrower, which has been fully budgeted.  Oversight of the implementation of 
the EMP will be the responsibility of the Borrower.  The PIU will act on its behalf and will have an 
environmental specialist for the duration of the project.  Implementation of several mitigation measures 
(e.g. covering pollution prevention, protection of natural resources practice, and worker and public safety) 
will be passed on to contractors who will be required to follow guidelines for environmentally sound 
construction practices.  These requirements will be included in bidding documents and meeting them will 
be a contractual requirement of the works, to be supervised by construction supervision consultants under 
oversight of the PIU construction supervisor and environmental specialist.  Monitoring of environmental 
and social indicators will allow the PIU to determine the direct and indirect environmental and social 
impacts of project activities and, where necessary, take appropriate actions or make corrections to project 
activities in order to prevent or lessen any adverse impacts detected.  The PIU will report on EMP 
implementation in its regular project reporting to government and IDA, and supervision missions will 
evaluate progress in its implementation.   
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The primary target group of the project are people living near major landslide and other disaster hazard 
areas in the country, and the people of Mailuu-Suu who are threatened by tailings and landslides.    
 
Two consultation hearings took place during project preparation, one in Mailuu-Suu and another in 
Bishkek, organized jointly by MEE and the environmental and socio-economic preparation teams.   
Approximately 300 persons attended the Mailuu-Suu public hearing, including few members from the 
Uzbek province of Andijan in the Ferghana valley.  About 60 people attended the one in Bishkek. 
 
Page  6
The project will set up locally based project coordinating committees with an over-representation of rural 
interests, something merited in light of evidence from the social assessment of wide discrepancies in 
interests and outlooks of urban and rural residents.  During the project the current once per year public 
meetings held in Mailuu-Suu between local authorities and the population will be increased in frequency to 
once every two months, with additional meetings possible in response to special issues arising in particular 
c
ommunities.  Minutes of such meetings will be recorded.  Response to specific issues raised will be 
tracked and followed up on until they are satisfactorily resolved.  Local officials and project managers will 
be trained in participatory techniques.
