A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project’s main objectives are to: (a) improve the capacity for increased agricultural 
yields through support to high priority rehabilitation of drainage and irrigation 
infrastructure; (b) reduce the risk of damage from flooding to land, crops, property, 
infrastructure as well as reducing risk of life loss from flooding in project areas; and (c) 
improve water resources management and strengthen the associated water resource 
management institutions and policies. 
 
The above objectives are in accordance with the recommendations of current policy 
studies, as agreed by MAFWM, notably those of the Policy Advisory Unit under the EU 
funded European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR).  Key performance indicators would 
be: (a) area benefited from reduced water logging and improved drainage; (b) area 
protected against flooding; (c) reduced number of population under flooding risk; (d) area 
benefited from minor irrigation development; (e) increase in crop production and rural 
income resulting from improved drainage, irrigation and flood control; (f) number of 
water users associations and drainage boards 
established; and 
(g)
finalized legal and 
Page  2
regulatory aspects of water resources management. 
 
The project would enhance the security of the agricultural sector and improve the growth 
base of that sector.  It will also contribute to the objective of increasing employment and 
income generation by enhancing regional development through creation of improved and 
secure conditions for investments and economic activities, particularly in the areas 
affected by floods and drainage problems.  It will also partially contribute to the 
promotion of fiscal discipline by being instrumental in reducing the burden of funding 
operations and maintenance by the Government budget.  It will also contribute to the 
objective of promoting more private sector participation in water management by 
introducing the participatory irrigation management principle in the project areas. 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The project size is about US$32.7 million consisting of a US$25.0 million credit, a 
US$6.6 million borrower contribution and a US$1.1 million contribution from project 
beneficiaries. The project has a five year implementation period. The land benefiting 
from improved drainage is about 350,000 ha, with 250,000 inhabitants benefiting from 
improved flood protection. The returns to the economy, from increased agricultural 
productivity, increased incomes and associated fiscal benefits, and reduced losses from 
flooding, would be substantial.
 
The project would include the following four 
components: 
 
Component 1.  Rehabilitation and Improvement of Drainage and Flood Control 
Infrastructure (US$20.4 million):  
Rehabilitation and improvement works would 
include: (a) rehabilitation of drainage facilities, including pumps and maintenance 
equipment; and (b) rehabilitation of flood control defenses to give a 1 in 100 year flood 
protection for agricultural and minor settlements, and a 1 in 1000 year protection for 
large settlements and industry. 
 
Component 2.  Minor Irrigation Development Program (US$5.2 million):
 This 
program will support the establishment of about 20 minor irrigation schemes (each 
scheme is less than 300 ha net, with a total area of about 4000 ha) in the hilly regions of 
Central Serbia.  Selection of areas for the schemes will be based on set of criteria, 
including farmers’ willingness to establish and participate in Water Users Associations 
(WUAs).  Beneficiaries of the minor irrigation schemes are expected to contribute, in-
kind or cash, 20 percent towards the costs of construction and O&M equipment.  
 
Component 3.  Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building (US$5.7 million):
 
This component will aim to strengthen the institutional capacity of water sector 
institutions.  It will strengthen DoW capacity in its regulatory and strategic functions, 
particularly in the irrigation and drainage sub-sector, and at field testing participatory 
irrigation and drainage management principles (including Water Users Associations and 
Water Boards).  The component will also include provision of various equipment and 
studies for other public institutions that have been deemed to be crucial, independently 
from the institutional option to be sought by the Government in the medium-long term.   
 
Page  3
Component 4.  Project Management and Monitoring (US$ 1.4 million):
 
The project will provide 
support to the Government for: (a) overall project management, including support to a Project 
Implementation Unit (PIU) within DoW and technical assistance in such areas as detailed design, contract 
administration and construction supervision, procurement and financial management, and participatory 
water management institutions; (b) monitoring and evaluation of project impacts; (c) development of 
e
nvironmental management plans for rehabilitation and construction activities carried out under the project; 
and (d) annual financial audits of project accounts. 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
Although the project has a country-wide coverage, all of the drainage and flood control 
works (about 80% of the planned investments) will be concentrated in the northern 
Vojvodina region, and the remaining activities for the minor irrigation development 
program will be concentrated in the central and southern regions.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the project.  Specific EAs will be 
prepared for the proposed flood and drainage schemes, while a framework EA has been 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
prepared for the irrigation schemes.  Public consultations, to review and discuss the EA, 
were held on February 21 and 22.  The final EA and record of public consultation have 
been delivered to the World Bank and posted on its Infoshop.  
 
The Bank safeguards policy on Projects on International Waterways (OP 7.50) has been 
triggered because the project areas involve the Danube River Basin, an international 
waterway.     The Bank has determined that the policy does not apply to the drainage and 
flood control works, because they deal only with existing drainage and flood control 
schemes (no new schemes will be constructed).  However, project activities related to the 
minor irrigation component are considered relevant, because they have the potential to 
impact water flows into the Danube River.  It is anticipated that the estimated abstraction 
for the minor irrigation program would be built up over about 5 years commencing in 
2006.  The net water quantity abstracted would be about five million cubic meters per 
year, which constitutes a negligible percentage (about 0.01%) of the flow of the Danube 
River and a very small percentage of the storage volume of the Iron Gate reservoirs on 
the Danube River.   
 
In accordance with the policy, Serbia is required to notify the other riparian countries 
about the project and its components prior to Board approval.   However, the MAFWM 
advised the Bank that it would like the Bank to carry out the notification.  Accordingly, 
the Bank has deiced to carry out the notification through the International Commission 
for Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR) to facilitate the riparian notification process 
required.   
 
A
rapid assessment for the social component of the project was carried out as part of 
project preparation.  The proposed project is expected to directly and indirectly benefit 
farmers within the project study areas.  Reliable irrigation water will substantially 
increase agricultural output and will help some farmers shift from subsistence farming to 
competitive commercial agriculture.   The rehabilitation of drainage and flood control 
measures will reduce risk for farmers and enhance agricultural output.  A major social 
objective of the proposed project is to further promote participation and decentralization 
in the irrigation and drainage sectors.  In particular, the project will support formation of 
WUAs and drainage/water boards.   In this regard, Component 3, Institutional 
Strengthening and Capacity Building will help strengthen institutional capacity of the 
water sector.  It will help pilot innovative and participatory approaches to water 
management by establishing WUAs and Water Boards, especially in the areas developing 
minor irrigation schemes.   
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
Not applicable. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
Not applicable. 
Page  5
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The implementing agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and its 
subordinate Departments and Directorates are supported by long established technical institutes and the 
universities. These agencies at present suffer from diminished professional staff due to migration, and 
equipment and facilities also require modernization and rehabilitation.  Also, there is a need to reorganize 
the sector and introduce a more participatory and integrated approach to water management. 
 
In spite of these shortcomings, there is still a viable professional specialist cadre in Serbia to sustain the 
reorganization and reinstatement of agriculture given stability and funding provision.  However, these 
institutions need to be familiarized and trained on the Bank’s Safeguard Policies. 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Key stakeholders include the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, 
its Directorate of Water and Public Water Companies, farmers using irrigation and 
drainage schemes, and communities living in flood-prone areas.  Many of these 
stakeholders have been involved in discussions about project design with the consultants 
and World Bank staff members preparing the project.  In addition, a formal public 
consultation process will be carried out at part of the Environmental Assessment that is 
currently being prepared for the project.
