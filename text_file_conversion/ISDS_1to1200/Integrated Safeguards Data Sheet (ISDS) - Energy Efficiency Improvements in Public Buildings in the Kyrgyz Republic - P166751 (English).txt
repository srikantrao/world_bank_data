                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed activity aims to pilot innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in selected public
                           buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic.

                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed project will be financed through a US$2.66 million recipient-executed grant provided by the
                           Government of Switzerland and channeled through ESMAP, a multi-donor Trust Fund (TF). The RETF is
                           directly linked to the HSIP by providing co-financing towards Component 3, which aims to demonstrate the
                           benefits of EE improvements in public buildings. Due to a timing lag between the HSIP and the proposed
                           RETF, the latter was not submitted as joint co-financing (but its scope was described as part of the HSIP).

                           The proposed RETF involves three Components: (1) piloting of innovative EE and renewable energy (RE)
                           technologies in selected public buildings; (2) capacity building and technical assistance support; and (3) grant
                           implementation support.

                           COMPONENT 1: Piloting of innovative EE and RE technologies (estimated US$1,522,000 RETF financing).
                           This component will provide investment grants to pilot innovative EE and RE technologies in a number of
                           buildings that will be retrofitted as part of Component 3 of the HSIP.

                           Eligible technologies. Innovative technologies piloted under Component 1 are aimed at complementing
                           standard EE and seismic measures supported under the HSIP, demonstrate viable alternatives to traditional
                           electric heating in public buildings and enhance the combined electricity savings impact. Eligibility criteria for
                           innovative technologies are proposed to include the following: (i) internationally proven and well-tested
                           technologies for buildings; (ii) additional energy savings impact compared to the standard technical EE

                           solution supported under the HSIP and/or enhanced reliability of energy supply; (iii) replication potential as
                           assessed through the RE potential; and (iv) sufficient market capacity to supply, install and operate the
                           technologies. On the basis of these criteria and the draft findings of a market assessment on innovative
                           EE/RE technologies, including walk-through energy audits in 10 public buildings, eligible technologies are
                           expected to include (non-exhaustive list): solar photovoltaic (PV) rooftop (with or without power storage
                           battery); sanitary hot water air source heat pump; large air-to-water heat pump for space heating (through
                           ventilation system or central heating network); and LED lighting with controls (movement, daylight, time).
                           Stand-alone RE units (e.g. small hydro, wind, PV) are not eligible under the RETF.

                           Selection of buildings for innovation grants. The innovative technologies would be piloted in a subset of
                           public buildings selected under the HSIP and implemented alongside comprehensive EE and seismic
                           measures supported under the HSIP. The innovation grants will be provided in three annual rounds (in line
                           with the buildings selection and implementation process under HSIP). Prioritization criteria for the selection
                           of buildings where innovation grants will be provided will be based on the results of the detailed energy
                           audits and be made based on the following criteria: (i) technical feasibility, applicability and viability for the
                           building context; (ii) impact on electricity savings; (iii) mitigating impact on power cuts (buildings
                           experiencing frequent power cuts would be prioritized); and (iv) increase in deployment of innovative
                           technologies under the HSIP.

                           Implementation readiness. The first set of buildings to be retrofitted under the HSIP (involving four schools,
                           two kindergartens and two health sector buildings) has been selected and preliminary walk-through energy
                           and seismic audits were conducted for all buildings to confirm eligibility of the buildings as per HSIP criteria
                           and identify potential innovative EE and RE measures. In six out of eight buildings, innovative EE/RE
                           measures have been identified that meet above mentioned criteria for the innovation grants, including: heat
                           pumps for space heating and/or sanitary hot water; lighting control systems; and PV emergency back-up
                           units with power storage battery. Investment costs for these measures are estimated at US$580,000,
                           equaling around 28 percent of the total investment costs. Detailed energy audits and seismic assessments

                           preparation and implementation of EE and RE investments. Specifically, this would include:

                                 ï‚· Capacity building for the identification, preparation and implementation of innovative EE and RE
                                   technologies, including training and targeted technical assistance aimed at increasing the capacity and
                                   knowledge of local key stakeholders on innovative EE and RE technologies. The target audience will
                                   include local service providers (e.g. energy audit companies, design firms, local suppliers) as well as
                                   public stakeholders (e.g. ARIS, State Committee for Industry, Energy and Mining; State Agency for

                                   buildings retrofitted under the HSIP and the proposed RETF; specifically, this will include energy
                                   audits and seismic assessments for at least seven buildings selected under the HSIP, detailed designs
                                   and technical specifications as well as technical supervision of implemented EE and RE measures.

                           COMPONENT 3: Grant Implementation Support (estimated US$ 165,000 RETF financing). This component
                           will provide Grant implementation support to ARIS, including: (i) PIU staff/ consultants (full-time technical
                           expert throughout the project and a temporary procurement specialist until effectiveness of the HSIP); (ii)
                           Grant-related operating costs; and (iii) annual audits of the Project accounts.

                          The specific locations of the RETF activities to be carried out under Component 1 will overlap with the
                          buildings selected for the HSIP (i.e., no separate selection for the RETF). It is anticipated however that only a
                          smaller subset of HSIP buildings will be appropriate for innovative measures under the RETF.

                          Over the last years ARIS has been acting as PIU in different World Bank projects and could build up significant
                          institutional capacity for the Bank's Safeguard Policies. In addition, a part-time safeguards specialist will be
                          hired under the HSIP to ensure compliance with the ESMF and development of site-specific ESMPs. There is
