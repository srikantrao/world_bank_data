                         The proposed project components are as indicated below:

                         Component 1: Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance CREMA Contracts (Total costs including
                         supervision of works and contingencies US$77 million, of which Bank financing US$77 million). To
                         reduce transport costs in targeted Departments, this component will support: (i) the carrying out of
                         two (2) Performance Based Contracts (PBC) of rehabilitation and maintenance works, under the
                         CREMA modality, on approximately three hundred and twenty (320) Km of identified sections of
                         the Borrower➢❨ s national paved roads (along Routes 1 and 3); and (ii) the supervision of works
                         under said CREMA Contracts. This component will contribute to the evolution and further expansion
                         of the country➢❨ s experience with PBC supported under the previous project.

                         Component 2: Road Safety (Total costs US$12 million, of which Bank financing US$12 million). To
                         improve road safety along selected paved road sections, this component includes two
                         subcomponents: (i) Sub-component 2.1. The financing of road safety interventions (including, inter
                         alia, the installation of side guardrails, the carrying out of signaling works, the improvement of
                         identified roundabouts and the construction of shoulders and pedestrian walkways), under the terms
                         of the two (2) CREMA Contracts referred to under Component 1, targeting the most vulnerable users
                         near urban areas along the identified sections of the Borrower➢❨ s national paved roads.
                         Interventions are prioritized as a result of a road safety audit carried out during project preparation:
                         (ii) Sub-component 2.2. An additional pilot sub-component will support road safety measures (other
                         than those under the CREMA Contracts) identified and prioritized by eligible municipalities, within
                         project targeted departments, out of a catalogue of pre-defined possible interventions in urban and
                         inter-urban roads, as described in the Project➢❨ s Operations Manual (OM). Municipalities willing
                         to benefit from this sub-component would need to meet certain eligibility criteria, also specified in
                         the OM, which have been designed in coordination with the recently created ANTSV. The eligibility
                         criteria will include public consultations to ensure that the voices of women, girls and boys are taken

                         into consideration in the selection of priority road safety interventions. To avoid complex
                         institutional arrangements, once a municipality is found eligible, MOPC would implement the agreed
                         interventions. The overarching aim is to bring the issue of road safety to the forefront of the political
                         agendas of national and municipal governments to reduce the rate and severity of road traffic crashes.

                         Component 3: Road Asset Planning and Management (Total costs US$3.75 million, of which Bank
                         financing US$3.75 million): To improve national planning and road asset management capacity, this
                         component will support the consolidation of MOPC➢❨ s strategic road management methodologies
                         and systems, building on the efforts from the Road Maintenance Project (P082026) to strengthen
                         client➢❨ s monitoring and evaluation capacity by: (i) completing the road network inventory; (ii)
                         expanding, operating and maintaining the traffic counting system; and (iii) operationalizing the road
                         asset management system.

                         Component 4: Project Management and Implementation Support (Total costs US$7 million, of which
                         Bank financing US$7 million): To ensure the quality and timely attainment of project objectives, this
                         component will provide assistance to MOPC in implementing the project, through financing, inter
                         alia: (i) costs related to project management functions of the Project Executing Unit (UEP),
                         including monitoring and evaluation activities as well as additional support, if deemed necessary; (ii)
                         project annual audits; (iii) the implementation of the project➢❨ s citizen engagement web-based

                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                              Project institutional responsibilities on environmental and social management, including citizen
                              engagement, are aligned to institutional arrangements and implementation agreements within the
                              MOPC, which establishes MOPC as the executing agency through the Roads Department (DV),
                              the UPGP as the main interlocutor with the Bank and functional units responsible for technical
                              endeavors and outcomes.

                         including environmental - as necessary, and maintaining the due recording and filing of the E&S
                         documentation of all works (sub - projects) to be funded by the project. Environmental and social
                         plans include environmental and social programs and standards as well as provisions on
                         communications and management of citizens? feedback and claims that will be implemented by
                         contractor supervised by supervision consultancy firms.

                         implementation of the current project and the capacity assessment carried out during this project's
                         preparation, and include: (i) discontinuity of project's environmental and social management
                         responsibility due to many changes in MOPC's former environmental unit; (ii) lack of intra-
                         ministry coordination and collaboration in environmental and social issues; (iii) underqualified
                         environment and social staffing in the PIU; and (iv) differences among Bank's environmental and
                         social safeguards standards and the MOPC's systems, particularly those related to resettlement and
                         indigenous peoples, which affected smooth internal supervision and external compliance.

                         The DGSA, which has been restructured and strengthened with the incorporation of environmental
                         and social specialists in recent years, including some with experience in Bank's safeguard
                         policies, has conducted the assessment and preparation of environmental and social management
                         plans and programs for works on Routes 1 and 3-8. Similarly, DGSA has prepared an
                         Environmental and Social Management Framework, which will be part of the project?s Operations
                         Manual. All these instruments have been developed on the basis of the World Bank's safeguard
                         policies (OP 4.01, 4.11, 4.10 and 4.12) principles and procedures and national law.

                         In addition, an Environmental and Social Institutional Support Program has been prepared for the

                         reference per activity - which progress will be monitored through specific indicators foreseen in
                         the Project?s Results Framework and Monitoring, comprising:

                         a)      Adequacy of the number and expertise of skilled staffing for the DGSA, by hiring at least
                         three environmental, social and communication professionals in;

                         Environmental Specifications (ETAGs) and MOPC?s Social Manual. Improved standards will
                         include i.e. environment: hazardous waste and non-hazardous, air, water, soil pollution, safety and
                         contingency response; and social: social dimensions into environmental assessment and plans,
                         including - besides indigenous peoples and resettlement ? citizen engagement, gender,
                         consultation; and

                         Prior review. All environmental and social activities, including terms of reference, assessments
                         and plans and programs will be prior reviewed by the Bank team.

                         Environment and Social records and filing system: Detailed records, reflecting the Project?s
                         environmental and social management per works/services will be filed and maintained by the
                         DGSA. These records would be maintained for at least two years after the Project?s closing date.
                         The records would include terms of reference, assessments, plans, programs, claims management,
                         and any public notice or information related to safeguard documents.

                         Project Grievance redress mechanism. The project foresees a grievance redress system comprising
                         claims entry/reception, analysis, monitoring of analysis, resolution and return to the claimer. This
                         system, which is detailed in the ESMF of the project and all plans for the RN 1 and RN 3-8 to be
                         financed by the project, is based on these three principles: (i) availability for beneficiaries and
                         stakeholders considering and respecting their socio-cultural characteristics and needs; (ii) known
                         procedures and timeline of claim analysis and resolution; and (iii) affordability of their resolution
                         for the claimers.

                         Claims can be addressed by three instances. The first instance is within the MOPC (National Law
                         19,549 on Administrative Procedures, Art. 7). When agreement is not possible, external instances
                         to MOPC such as mediation, Ombudsman and judiciary system will apply. Claims brought before
                         the judiciary apply the existing legal system of the country.

                         This system will be supported by the web-based feedback-grievance redress mechanism, one

                         module of the project?s citizen engagement system VEA (Ventana de Acceso a la InformaciÃ³n).

                         All advertising of Project grievance redress system, will include information on the WB's
                         Grievance Redress Service (GRS).
                         Citizen engagement

                         Citizen engagement mechanisms will be under the Directorate of Transparency and Citizen
                         Participation (DTPC)'s overall responsibility. The DTPC will be responsible for the
                         implementation and supervision of the web-based feedback-grievance redress mechanism, one of
                         the three web-based tools of the project's citizen engagement system VEA (Ventana de Acceso a la
                         InformaciÃ³n) that will be web-based system. DTPC will also oversee implementation of the other
                         two citizen engagement tools (i) the interactive map of works, and (ii) the financial, physical,
                         environmental and social monitoring tool, though will coordinate with the Directorate of
                         Communications, DGSA and other functional units of MOPC in charge of the project's activities
                         that will feed the tools.

                         The VEA web-based feedback-grievance redress mechanism is based on the principles and
                         procedures of the project's grievance redress mechanism, and will be ready to integrate to external
                         systems with similar or complementary objectives of improving public transparency and citizen
                         engagement such as the Unified Portal of Public Information (PUIP) of Paraguay. The VEA will

                                                                    Page 9 of 12
                           be a web-based system that will feature several integrated modules to manage electronically
                           citizen?s feedback/claims, capturing them from different starting points (table entry of the MOPC,
                           site work, web, phone, social networks and mobile devices), recording them in a central database,
Public Disclosure Copy




                           and automatically distributing them to different units of MOPC for addressing them and returning
                           to the citizen in standardized timelines.

                           Detailed terms of reference of the three web-based tools of the project?s citizen engagement
                           system VEA (Ventana de Acceso a la InformaciÃ³n) will be included in the Project's Operations
                           Manual of the project. These TORs include technologies needs and flows of coordination and
                           accountability of these tools among the functional units of MOPC. Progress of these tools will be
                           monitored through specific indicators that are foreseen in the project's Monitoring and Results
                           Framework.

                           The DTPC, which has recently been restructured, becoming a Directorate reporting directly to the
                           Minister, will be strengthened by hiring a specialist in communication and citizen engagement to
                           support the development and implementation of the system.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                           Key stakeholders of this project include: (i) beneficiaries of the project [road users, including
                           households and communities in project catchment areas, soybean and livestock producers, freight
                           and passenger transport companies, equally targeted both men and women; indigenous peoples: at
                           least 36 communities (among them 14 villages)]; (ii) Local Governments; and (iii) people that are
                           occupying the ROW that will need to be moved (RAP for Roads 1 and 3-8)

                           All environment and social documents, except the Advanced RAP dated 3 April, 2016, were
                           consulted within a detailed consultation plan that was previously approved by the Bank team. This
                           plan included at least two rounds in situ consultations with these key stakeholders of the project.
                           IPPP consultations were culturally adequate and respectful to indigenous communities including

                           use of language and their arrangements for the meetings among others. A summary of the
                           feedback received per plan is available in the plans.

                           RAP dated 3 April, 2016 jointly with the RPF will be submitted for consultation to potential
                           affected people as soon it is approved by the Bank before appraisal of the project and will continue
                           between project approval and effectiveness.
