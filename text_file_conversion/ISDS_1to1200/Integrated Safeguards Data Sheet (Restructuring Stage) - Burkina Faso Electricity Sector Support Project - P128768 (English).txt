                         analysis (if known)
                         The power plant under component 1 will be constructed in existing power generating facility on land
                         owned by the national electricity company (SONABEL) in the city of Fada NGourma. The site is
                         located in town, surrounded by residential and administrative settlements, and totally fenced. Apart
                         from some trees on the Fada NGourma site, no other natural feature is remarkable in the project
                         location. A new activity to increase generation capacity by over 30 MW is being added. This
                         includes support for spare parts and rehabilitation of existing units that are currently offline in
                         Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.

                         II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
                             A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project.
                              Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                               The project is classified category B, as its environmental and social impacts are moderate and
                              site-specific. Three Bank safeguard policies triggered: OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment;
                              OP4.11 on Physical Cultural Resources; and OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement.

                              The environmental analysis has concluded that the overall environmental and social impact of the
                              project is positive, though there will be some adverse impacts during the construction and eventual
                              operation of the infrastructure. These negative but manageable impacts are: loss of trees on the
                              power station sites and vegetation on the right-off-way of the grid lines; dust-induced air pollution

                              in the project sites and vicinities during the construction, including risks of temporary increase in
                              allergies; involuntary destruction of cultural assets (uncovered wealth, sacred woods, sacred site,
                              etc.) in exploiting quarries and material pits; socio-economic losses and damages in case of
                              explosion and fire during the exploitation; indirect pollution of the receiving environments by the
                              operation phase wastes (solid and used oil) if not properly handled; occupational health, security
                              and safety for the staff. Potential social impacts include loss of land, assets and/or resources. No
                              large and irreversible adverse impact during the project cycle was identified.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                                The mishandling of used oil and hazardous solid wastes resulting from the functioning of the
                              power stations may induce diffuse pollution of the surrounding environment, especially if the
                              wastes were disposed in areas close to water sources or in uncontrolled discharges accessible to
                              children and other vulnerable people.
                            3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                              impacts.
                                n/a
                            4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                              assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.

                          legislation. The following environmental and social safeguard instruments have been disclosed in-
                          country and at the InfoShop prior to appraisal: (i) the Environmental and Social Management

                          Framework (ESMF) for the mitigation of the risks associated to the expansion of electricity
                          infrastructures in the 40 communities to be selected during the implementation phase; (ii) the
                          Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the Ouahigouya power station (as part of
                          a project restructuring to be undertaken in 2016, this power plant will no longer be pursued); (iii)
                          the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the Fada NÃ¢➂❨➂ Gourma power
                          station; and
                          (iv) the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the management of the compensation/
                          resettlement issues that may arise during the expansion of the power grid in the 40 communities.

                          The implementation mechanism is approved through the above-mentioned document and consists
                          in a set of technical, institutional and capacity building measures. For the power generator in
                          component 1, the construction phase measures are incorporated in the bidding documents, carried
                          out by the enterprises and monitored during the execution of the civil works by the PCU in
                          collaboration with the National EIA agency (BUNEE). In the case of component 2, as soon as
                          identified, all subprojects will be processed through the screening procedure set forth in the ESMF
                          and environmental and social measures, including the preparation of a RAP, identified and duly
                          applied.

                          The Borrower's institutional capacity in managing environmental and social safeguard measures at
                          appropriate international standards is weak and needs to be strengthened. This conclusion came
                          out of the assessment of the two Bank-funded energy projects currently under completion. A
                          safeguard expert has being recruited and appointed within the PCU of the PASE. Further, capacity
                          building will be provided to: (i) ensure that the Department of Quality, Safety and Environment
                          (DQSE) of SONABEL is effective and fully functional with adequate structural resources; and (ii)
                          the PCU staff are able to handle the integration of environmental measures in the work plans, and

                          monitor environment related issues in energy activities. A budget of US$3.4 million is earmarked
                          to support the implementation of the safeguards measures and recommendations.

                          As of end-July 2016, actions included in the ESMF were not yet initiated. This is mainly due to
                          the fact that such measures are linked to construction and maintenance of the power plants, which
                          has not yet reached the stage of works.

                           Regarding Component 2 related to the increase electricity access in target areas, 16 ESIAs out of
                           40 were conducted and validated by the BUNEE. They are now under implementation.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
                             The local communities in rural areas, households of Fada N➢❨ Gourma, small size entrepreneurs
                           and private sector, local authorities are interested parties of the project.
                           Representatives of these groups were consulted in a series of consultations during the preparation
                           of the safeguard instruments from October 2012 to February 2013. The draft reports of the power
                           plant ESIAs were also extensively shared with the stakeholders in February 2013. In general,
                           specific consultations were organized in the localities of Bobo Dioulasso, Fada N➢❨ Gourma,
