                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The overall development objective is to enhance the capacity of statistical agencies of Latin American and Caribbean
                           countries/territories for the production of Purchasing Power Parities estimates.

                           Implementation of International Comparison Program (ICP) activities in the Latin America and the Caribbean region will
                           work towards this objective and will also respond to the United Nations Statistical Commission’s call for countries to
                           integrate ICP activities within their regular statistical work programs to ensure a permanent and sustainable ICP.


                           C. Project Description
                           To achieve the proposed objectives, the project includes the below-described components and activities.

                           Regional prices and national accounts training workshops: This component involves conducting regional
                           training workshops that cover the following topics: (i) designing and conducting ICP price surveys and
                           estimating PPPs; (ii) compiling GDP expenditures; (iii) establishing synergies between ICP processes and
                           ongoing CPI survey activities.

                           Technical assistance missions to countries/territories: This component will include technical assistance
                           missions to help build the capacity of beneficiary countries/territories in price statistics and national
                           accounts.

                           Contributing to global ICP methodology, standards and guidelines, and ensuring their application in Latin
                           America and the Caribbean: This component aims at ensuring that UN-ECLAC contributes to the formulation
                           of global ICP methodology, standards and guidelines, which would be applied uniformly across all regions
                           including Latin America and the Caribbean. This will be ensured through the participation of UN-ECLAC in ICP

                           governance, coordination and technical meetings, where global ICP methodology, standards and guidelines
                           are presented and regional practices are shared and discussed.

                           Preparation for workshops and technical missions: This component involves the preparation of knowledge
                           and training material that will be used to facilitate and deploy regional training workshops and technical
                           assistance missions.

                           Provision of grants to lower-capacity countries/territories for survey and data processing activities: Small
                           grants will be provided to lower-capacity countries/territories to partially fund the cost of ICP surveys, ICP
                           data processing and other related activities.

                          analysis (if known)
                          Project activities include no physical intervention. Meetings and workshops with clients and relevant
                          agencies will typically be held at hotels and government offices in the capital cities of the
                          countries/territories that hold regional workshops, international meetings or country/territory visits.



                          E. Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                          The implementing agency, UN-ECLAC, applies an evaluation policy focused on examining the results chain,
                          processes, contextual relevance, impact, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of the expected and
                          achieved accomplishments from the organization’s interventions and contributions.
