B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The development objective of the proposed program is to transform existing relief-oriented safety net programs to a 
system of safety nets which not only sustain lives but enhances growth and the achievement of the MDGs by 
preventing irreversible losses and by providing incentives to the most vulnerable households to engage in productive 
behavior.  The transfers provided through the Safety Net will help to protect the asset base of households, build and 
maintain public infrastructure (e.g. rural roads) and community assets (e.g. watershed management), encourage 
investment in human capital (e.g. improved child survival via immunization), enable small-holder farmers to take on 
economic activities with higher-risk but higher-return (e.g. adoption of higher yielding seeds requiring costly 
inputs), and spur growth of rural markets and production.  
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
During the identification mission (February 2004) of the joint Government-donor Safety Nets Working Group, 
significant progress was made in clarifying the framework for the safety net component of the broader Food Security 
Program.  The mission agreed on the coverage (target group) as consisting of the approximately 5 million people 
who are chronically food insecure living in 214 food insecure woredas; the accountability and coordination 
mechanisms necesssary to ensure program effectiveness; preparation timeline and basic readiness features for safety 
net implementation.  Furthermore, the different agencies have agreed to work within a common safety net 
framework, and discussed ways to harmonize the various resourcing—food and cash, government and non-
government—channels.
 
On the Bank
 
side, an IDA SIL is proposed as the appropriate financing instrument, with a 
program lifetime of 3 years and a potential Credit amount of $100-150 million.  The components of  the Safety Net 
to be financed include; 
 
o
Labor-intensive public works program, 
 which  will provide wages (cash or food or voucher) to 
households whose adults participate in a labor-intensive works program.  The Government envisions this 
component to be a key element of its productive Safety Net.  To be effective, and sustainable in terms of 
costs, the program must rely either on self-or community targeting. To self-target, knowledge of local 
wages for unskilled labor is crucial. The Government is launching a short and quick survey to collect local 
market wages for unskilled workers.  It is also proposed to defer part of the wage payment via vouchers in 
Page  2
 
 
order to smooth the incongruence between the time of greatest need and the best time for public works 
activities.  The experience of using vouchers under other operations in Ethiopia will be evaluated.  The 
activities under this component are expected to be those identified as a priority within the woreda 
development plan, with a high degree of labor intensity (minimum to be defined) and also be situated 
within a “reasonable” distance of the target community.  The works activity can be implemented directly by 
the woreda authority or sub-contracted out to competent local contractors  NGOs who would report to the 
woreda authority.  A small grant will be provided to the woreda for administrative costs associated with the 
program
.
 
o
Conditional transfers for child health and education.
  This component will finance a transfer (cash or 
food) to food insecure households in exchange for household investments in long-term human capital 
development of their children. For health, it is proposed that households receive a transfer on condition that 
pre-school aged children follow through with a full cycle of health interventions (e.g. DPT-3 vaccination, 
Vitamin A supplements, de-worming, etc.). On education the program will provide transfers to food 
insecure households with primary school aged children on condition that the children continue to attend 
primary school to a grade agreed upon during program design.  For both programs, the health extension 
workers/school personnel will be asked to certify that the family or the child has met the condition, before 
the food security office at the woreda level provides the transfer in accordance with publicly known benefit 
levels.  A small grant will be provided to the health extension agency and the school to defray the 
additional recurrent costs that they may bear as a result of participating in the delivery.
 
o
Unconditional transfers:
  This component will focus on groups that have no assets and are easy to 
identify—elderly poor, terminally ill, orphans, etc. It is expected that it will be a small component of the 
overall program. For such households, pure transfers would be needed.  
 
o
Monitoring and Evaluation.
  The Government has prepared a Concept Paper for the M&E of the full Food 
Security Program (of which the Safety Net is a part), and has asked its donor partners to participate and 
support strengthening such a system. A key goal is to promote household “exit” of the program based on 
clear principles.  This component will finance technical assistance to develop competence and managerial 
capacity of the Food Security Office and desks to ensure that (a) the choice of indicators include 
dimensions related to safety nets effectiveness, targeting, and impact; (b) there is integration of the existing 
large-scale household surveys that are conducted regularly by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA) as 
part of SDPRP monitoring and FSP monitoring and evaluation; and (c) that the data and findings are used 
for both management purposes and program modification (trouble-shooting) as well as feed back to the 
beneficiary communities for their own action.  
o
Technical assistance.
  The proposed component of the operation will finance technical assistance to assist 
the Government to, among other things, (a) design a financing framework for the safety net which is 
sustainable, predictable and  capable of being scaled up during genuine emergencies.  Options to establish a 
counter-cyclical insurance mechanism to deal with periodic shocks will be explored.  (b)  An associated 
important issue is the transition towards lowering the size of imported food aid.  The proposed operation 
will provide technical assistance to put in place mechanisms for using food aid to develop markets, by 
monetizing it at different levels (international, national, regional, and local).  This will help strengthen 
existing markets, facilitate the emergence of markets in areas where they are, currently, weak and non-
existent, and create incentives to the private sector traders to participate. (c) TA will be available to also 
help improve features of the overall safety net such as targeting mechanisms, etc.
