B.  Project Objectives  
 
The proposed repeater project’s main objective would be to continue to serve as a catalyst 
to support export and real sector growth in Turkey
 during the EFIL III implementation 
period (2005-2009) and beyond using the EFIL III reflows. To this end, the project would 
provide medium and long-term working capital and investment finance to Turkish private 
exporting enterprises, at the time when the economy is showing strong signs of rebounding from 
a
recent slump and export performance is on the rise
—thus increasing the demand for longer 
term credit, while the financial sector is still unable to support these trends with very much 
needed longer term funds at a reasonable cost.  
 
The secondary objective of the loan would be further improvement in the ability of the 
Turkish financial sector to provide financial resources to the enterprise sector, through 
further development of intermediation by private financial institutions, including banks 
and leasing companies
.
The project, through inclusion of leasing companies in addition to 
banks as PFIs, would enable the Bank to maintain a dialogue with the leasing sector in Turkey, 
provide an opportunity to gain more insight into the sector, and enable the Bank to support its 
development. The EFIL II experience, among other things, suggests that the dialogue between 
the Bank and the PFIs has a strong impact on establishing important concepts by the PFIs of (i) 
Page  2
environmentally sustainable lending, and (ii) long-term credit risk valuation of the borrowing 
companies. The EFIL III would continue to strengthen these concepts.  
 
C.  Project Description  
The project will provide a Bank Fixed Spread Loan (FSL) of 16-year maturity, including a 
6-year grace period, to TSKB, a private Turkish investment and development bank, 
for 
further on-lending to eligible private financial intermediaries
—banks and leasing companies. 
The financial intermediaries will further on-lend the credit line funds to eligible private Turkish 
exporters of goods and services. The Bank loan will be guaranteed by the Turkish Government 
on behalf of the Republic of Turkey, for which the Government will charge TSKB a guarantee 
fee. EFIL III will replicate the same basic project concept as EFIL II.
 
D.  Project location  
 
Istanbul, Turkey (location of the Borrower - TSKB Bank - and all of the financial intermediaries 
which will implement the Project). The sub-borrowers will be spread around the country.  
 
E. 
Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies  
 
The Borrower, during the course of the proposed Project’s predecessor EFIL II project, has 
developed institutional capacity to determine and monitor environmental risks of individual sub-
projects.

EFIL III is a repeat of EFIL II, it will be do 
everything that EFIL II is currently doing . In terms of sub-projects, since we do not know ex-ante 
what sub-projects may come forward over the next 3-4 years, everything except for the negative 
list would theoretically be eligible for financing . Thus the environmental review procedures in the 
Operations Manual of the EFIL II explain the mechanism on how the sub-projects should be 
categorized by the Borrower, and what should be the applicable review procedures during 
implementation. In terms of sub-projects that have been financed under EFIL II, they either come 
up for prior review or post review, and based on category classification by the borrower/PFI, the 
environmental mitigation measures in place are verified and recorded by the Borrower and PFI. 
These are further verified either by our team through documents or site visits for prior review 
cases if necessary
