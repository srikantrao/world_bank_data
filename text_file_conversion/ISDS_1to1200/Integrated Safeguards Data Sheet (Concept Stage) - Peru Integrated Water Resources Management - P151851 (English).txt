                           The proposed Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen the Borrower's capacity for the
                           management of water resources at the national level and in selected river basins.
                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed Project will have the following components:

                           Component 1: Improving IWRM capacity at the national level (US$26.00 million).

                           This component aims at improving the management of water resources at the national level through
                           the development and operationalization of new methodologies and tools that will address the
                         identified challenges in the following areas: (i) development of information products and analytical
                         tools to support decision making for the management of water resources; (ii) conjunctive
                         management of surface and groundwater in critical valleys; and (iii) management of dam safety.

                         Elements included under this component are:

                         a.      Development of information products to support decision making for the management of
                         water resources

                         Activities under this subcomponent would support the strengthening of the existing National Water
                         Resources Information System to deliver better information products to support water resources
                         management. This will be achieved through improving ANA's hydro-meteorological information
                         network for data acquisition, strengthening water data bases and back-up systems, developing
                         decision-making modelling tools for water resources management, and improving information
                         accessibility to end-users.

                         b.      Evaluation and management of groundwater

                         Activities under this subcomponent would promote the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater
                         in the aquifers of the Ica Valley and Villacuri in the Ica region and of La Yarada in the Tacna region
                         to contribute to the reduction of over-exploitation. This will be achieved mainly through the creation
                         of a stakeholders committee for the management and monitoring of the aquifer; the preparation of
                         participatory aquifer management plans and the implementation of a system for the monitoring and
                         control of groundwater.

                         c.      Dam Safety

                         This subcomponent would strengthen ANA's regulatory framework and technical capacity for the
                         management of dam safety. This will be done through: the definition of an improved institutional
                         framework for dam safety management; the creation of a regulatory framework for dam safety
Public Disclosure Copy




                         management; the development of technical guidelines for dam monitoring, risk assessment and
                         emergency plans formulation; the creation of a dam safety information platform; and the formulation
                         and partial implementation of dam safety management plans for 6 major dams in the Pacific
                         watershed.

                         d.      Economic Incentives

                         This subcomponent would support ANA in the strengthening of economic incentives for increased
                         water use efficiency and reduced pollution into water bodies as established in the Water Resources
                         Law. This will include the revision of the water use and discharge charges; measures to increase its
                         coverage and collection rate; and definition of rules and mechanisms to use part of those revenues to
                         promote the implementation of basin water plans.

                         Component 2: Improving IWRM capacity at the basin level (US$47.00 million).

                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project will support development of governance structures, methodologies and tools to improve
                           water resources management in different regions of Peru. According to the information provided in
                           the section on components above, the following region will be involved: San Martin, Cusco,
                           Apurimac, Ayacucho, Junin, Huancavelica, Ica and Tacna. Some of this regions are exposed to
                           intense deforestation and biodiversity loss such as the Amazon region of San Martin. Coastal regions
                           such as Ica and Tacna are exposed to overexploitation of aquifers. In the case of Andean regions such
                           as Apurimac, Ayacucho, Huancavelica and Cusco they have faced droughts during the El NiÃ±o
                           event and flash floods during the rainy season. Location of the five dams to be assessed is not known
                           yet.
                           E. Borrowers Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           This is the ANA's second World Bank-financed water resources management Project. It is expected
                           that a new PIU within ANA is going to be responsible for implementation of the proposed Project.

                           Some of the current ANA staff members and consultants were part of the former Water Resources
                           Management Modernization Project Implementation Unit (PIU) so they have relevant experience
                           with WB safeguard policies as well social and environmental management issues. At present there is
                           a seasoned environmental specialist at ANA➢❨ s headquarters in Lima. The environmental and
                           social capacity of this PIU will be strengthened with dedicated environmental and social specialists
                           not only in the field but also at the central level in Lima. Capacity building needs on environmental
                           and social management issues will be assessed in depth during Project preparation.

                           The former project was characterized for being a highly participatory process from beginning to end.
                           This experience in social aspects is a legacy the PIU has and will be use for the current project. The
                           PIU will include a social specialist in the central level as well as social specialists for the basins
                           where they could be required.

                           Safeguard Policies               Triggered? Explanation (Optional)
                           Environmental Assessment         Yes            Based on OP 4.01 on Environmental Assessment the
                           OP/BP 4.01                                      Project is categorized as a Category B risk one. This
                                                                           Project will not finance civil work contracts nor
                                                                           detail designs of civil works. Installation of hydro-
                                                                           meteorological stations might include preparation of
                                                                           terrain and related minor civil works as part of
                                                                           contracts for equipment installation. The Project will
                                                                           support the formulation of different types of water
                         plans: (i) plans for the operation and maintenance of
                         major hydraulic infrastructure; (ii) risk management
                         plans in five priority dams; and (iii) participatory

                         aquifer management plans in selected regions (Tacna
                         and Ica). Activities prioritized in those plans, will not
                         be implemented by the Project, however some of
                         them may have potential adverse social and
                         environmental impacts and risks. For this reason, the
                         operational policy on Environment Assessment (OP/
                         BP 4.01) policy is triggered. To ensure conformity
                         with this policy, the methodology/terms of reference
                         for the formulation of those plans will include
                         specific reference to understanding and identifying
                         potential social and environmental risks and impacts.
                         Preparation of these plans will follow rigorous

                                      The IPPF will take into account the former IPPF prepared for the previous project because the
                                      current project will include some of the basins that were supported by the previous project.
                                      However the current project will also include new basins and therefore the borrower has agreed to
                                      prepare a new IPPF.
                                      The IPPF will set the procedures and principles to follow for consulting in the field during
                                      implementation whenever there is presence of Indigenous Peoples in project areas, as required by
                                      OP 4.10. Before appraisal the borrower will consult the IPPF with national indigenous
                                      organizations, both from the Amazon basin as well as from the highlands. The borrower has
                                      expressed his intention to invite to Lima some of the local indigenous leaders from the basins
                                      where the project will be implemented to take part in this national consultation.
