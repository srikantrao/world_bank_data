C. Project Description [from section 3 of PCN]:

     It is proposed tltat tlte MDTF grant will support Myanmar EITI implementation activities
in tlte amount of US $490,000 to run for approximately 8 montlts from May to December
2015. The $490,000 will be both recipient executed (RE) and Bank executed (BE). This is to
accommodate the fact that Myanmar's financial regulations require that grants be documented in
the budget and spending can only legally occur once the budget is approved. The MDTF funds
will be included in the 2015 mid-year budget, with the implication that spending can only occur
following the passage of the mid-year budget, in August 2015. Of the $490,000, $200,000 will
be BE and $290,000 will be RE.

The Project includes the following activities:

   a. Secretariat Operations
   - staffmg, including a senior technical expert, communications officer, and training expert

III. SAFEGUARD PREPARATION PLAN

A. Safeguards considerations will be embedded into all relevant activities to be conducted by
   the National Secretariat, including consultants and other recipients of.MDTF funding.
   Relevant WB Safeguard Policies are referenced in relevant ToRs for all consultants
   undertaking EITI MDTF -related work.

B. The proposed project seeks to facilitate and support Myanmar, an EITI Candidate country,
   implementing the EITI Standard. The overarching goal of the EITI process is to promote
   transparency and accountability in the management of public revenues from extractive
   industries. As a key player in the EITI process, relevant civil society representatives in
   Myanmar, such as Indigenous Peoples communities, Indigenous Peoples organizations, and
   local NGOs, should be afforded, early on, opportunities to actively and fully participate in
   the implementation of the EITI Standard in the country. This requires, in line with relevant
   World Bank Safeguard Policies, that such civil society representatives:.(i) are appropriately
   and fully represented, and have their views taken into account in the MSG; (ii) have access to
   all relevant EITI-related information in a culturally appropriate and accessible form, manner
    and language; and (iii) operate in an enabling environment where they are allowed to be an
    integral part of the EITI-related debate.

C. Target date for the Quality Enhancement Review (QER), at which time the PAD-stage ISDS
   would be prepared: This is not applicable

D. For simple projects that will not require a QER, the target date for preparing the PAD-stage
   ISDS: The project is a recipient executed small-grant and there is no plan for a QER.

E. Time frame for launching and completing the safeguard-related studies that may be needed.
   The specific studies and their timing 1 should be specified in the PAD-stage ISDS:
   This is not applicable
