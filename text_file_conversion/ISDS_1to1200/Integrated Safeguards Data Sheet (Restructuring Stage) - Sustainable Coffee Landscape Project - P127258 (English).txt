    KNOWN)
The project’s area of intervention will be located in three of the country’s provinces, chosen according to the
following criteria: (i) already included within PRODEMA; (ii) high potential for cultivating shade-grown coffee;
(iii) presence of operational coffee washing stations; and (iv) proximity to a national protected area. Based
on these criteria, the three provinces selected are: • Bubanza, bordering Kibira National Park • Bururi, where
the Bururi Forest Nature Reserve is located • Muyinga, bordering t he Ruvubu National park. Muyinga has
also demonstrated having a population receptive to innovations and where the coffee plantations are young.
As the project gathers lessons and experiences, it is expected that the activities could be replicated and
scaled up initially in other PRODEMA and LVEMP areas. After the MTR mission, it was decided to scale up the
project activities to Kayanza province where demonstration plots have been successfully established in
ISABU research center and would be used as platforms for training in shade grown coffee.

 II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT
       The World Bank                                                                                RESTRUCTURING ISDS
       Sustainable Coffee Landscape Project (P127258)




A. SUMMARY OF KEY SAFEGUARD ISSUES

1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any
  potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
  The expected environmental impacts from this project would be overwhelmingly positive, including (i) reduced soil
  erosion and improved water retention from the planned investments in sustainable land management, including
  shade coffee cultivation; (ii) reduced water pollution from project-supported improvements in coffee washing
  practices; and (iii) increased biodiversity conservation from the improved protection and management of the Bururi
  Forest Nature Reserve, along with the expected addition of different species of shade trees to coffee plantations.
  Any potential adverse environmental impacts from this project would be rather minor and linked to (i) small-scale civil
  works that might be built to improve management of the Bururi Reserve and to implement the Indigenous Peoples
  Plan and possibly (ii) changes in agricultural pest management practices in coffee cultivation areas (which, on balance,
  are more likely to be environmentally positive).
  The social impacts of the proposed project are also expected to be largely beneficial, both in providing enhanced land
  and water management practices and in securing sources of incomes, livelihoods, and food security. The economy of
  the project area is predominantly agriculture and livestock farming. The main food crops produced are cereals, root
  crops, vegetables and bananas; coffee is the most important cash crop. The project will contribute to sustaining and
  strengthening coffee and food crop production through sustainable land and water management practices. The
  expected social benefits include enhanced of sources of livelihood, job creation, and strengthening of local community
  ownership of sustainable land management investments.
  The project will include investments in strengthening the management of the existing Bururi Forest Nature Reserve
  and promoting increased ecotourism in the area. Although no physical resettlement of people will take place under
  the project (and none is needed for the Bururi Reserve), the project will support to maintain and improve sustainable
  livelihoods for the people who currently obtain natural resources from the reserve, as described in the Process
  Framework. The project will also provide targeted assistance to a Batwa indigenous community that resides near the
  Bururi Reserve.

2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
  If the project is successfully implemented, the long-term environmental and social impacts of the project are all
  expected to be positive.

3. Describe any potential alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.
  The existing project design is already expected to avoid or minimize any adverse environmental or social impacts.

4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
  capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
  To address environmental and social safeguards, the project would use the following existing safeguards instruments
  prepared for the ongoing Agro-Pastoral Productivity and Markets Development Project (PRODEMA): (i) Environmental
  and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) (Analyse d’Impact Environnemental et Social du Projet, February 2010), which
  includes an Environmental Management Plan (Plan de Gestion Environnementale) and Pest Management Plan (Plan de
  Gestion Integre de Pestes et des Pesticides); (ii) Resettlement Policy Framework (Cadre de Politique de Reistallation
  Involontaire des Populations, December 2009); and (iii) Indigenous Peoples Plan (Plan d’Action pour le Developpement
  des Batwa, December 2009) for the overall project area. These existing safeguards instruments have been updated for
  the project with an explanatory Cover Note, endorsed by the GoB and disclosed for the project as new documents.
     The World Bank                                                                                RESTRUCTURING ISDS
     Sustainable Coffee Landscape Project (P127258)



These safeguards instruments would suitably cover this new project as well as the ongoing PRODEMA because (i) the
new project’s proposed investments in sustainable land management, improved coffee cultivation (under shade) and
processing (washing), and small civil works (such as to enhance ecotourism and protected area management at Bururi
Forest) are a subset of the broader range of agricultural and natural resource management investments which have
already been assessed for PRODEMA; (ii) the 3 provinces (Bubanza, Bururi, and Muyinga) in which the new project
would operate are the same as in PRODEMA (which also covers additional provinces); (iii) the new project would be
implemented by the same lead institution (Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, MINAGRIE) and guided by the same
National Policy Steering Committee; and (iv) the beneficiaries (coffee and other farmers) and other stakeholders under
the new project would be a subset of those under PRODEMA.
In addition to these existing PRODEMA safeguards instruments, two new documents were prepared for the new
project: (i) a Process Framework to address sustainable livelihood issues in the vicinity of the Bururi Forest Nature
Reserve and (ii) an Addendum to the 2009 Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) to cover the Batwa indigenous community
that resides near the Bururi Reserve. In addition, the Pest Management Plan (Plan de Gestion Integre de Pestes et des
Pesticides) imbedded within the PRODEMA ESIA was specifically adapted to the new project and publicly disclosed as a
separate document.

On January 22 2013, the Government of Burundi approved and published the safeguard documents in accessible areas
such as public libraries, the office of the Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, and the decentralized administrative
offices. These documents were also sent by the World Bank to InfoShop (January 25, 2013) and publicly disclosed. The
documents disclosed were:

•    Analyse d’Impact Environnementale et Sociale (Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, ESIA)
•    Plan de Lutte Antiparasitaire (Pest Management Plan, PMP)
•    Cadre de Politique de Réinstallation Involontaire des Populations (Resettlement Policy Framework, RPF)
•    Cadre Fonctionnel de la Gestion durable de la Reserve Naturelle Forestière de Bururi et de l’Ecotourisme (Process
Framework, PF)
•    Plan D’action Additionnel pour Le Developpement des Batwa Résidents Autour de la Réserve Forestière de Bururi
(Indigenous Peoples Plan, IPP)


The Client’s institutional capacity to address safeguards issues is incipient but growing. In 2010, the Ministry of Water,
Environment, Land and Urban Planning (MEEATU) was established. A MEEATU Environmental Unit was created by the
Ministry in 2011; it includes approximately 5 staff (two environmental specialists, one economist, one sociologist and
one lawyer). The Unit will ensure overall monitoring of this project’s safeguards compliance. The Ministry of
Agriculture, which is the project implementing authority, does not have an in-house environmental capacity; like other
line ministries, it relies on MEEATU. Through the MEEATU predecessor, the Client demonstrated its ability to address
safeguards issues by facilitating the preparation of the PRODEMA safeguards instruments.

The implementation of the safeguards instruments for the Sustainable Coffee Landscape will build on the capacity
developed by PRODEMA, which is also the main implementing agency for this project. The project will provide
additional support to the PRODEMA environmental office through environmental and social safeguards consultancy
services.

The National Policy Steering Committee (NPSC) established for PRODEMA will be responsible for coordination of cross-
sectoral dialogue and activities at the national level. Specifically, the NPSC will be responsible for: (i) providing
national-level project operational policy guidance; (ii) approving national project investments; (iii) reviewing and
           The World Bank                                                                             RESTRUCTURING ISDS
           Sustainable Coffee Landscape Project (P127258)



    approving project annual work plans and budgets; and (iv) resolving implementation bottlenecks to achieve the
    project’s objectives (results and outcomes). The NPSC will consist of the Permanent Secretaries from the actively
    involved line ministries, as well as the Ministries responsible for EAC Affairs.

  5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanism for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with
