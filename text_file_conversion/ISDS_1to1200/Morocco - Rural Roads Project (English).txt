A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project has two main development objectives: (i) to significantly increase the rural 
population’s level of road access, especially in the more disadvantaged provinces and (b) to 
enhance the impact of improved rural road accessibility through institutional measures which 
strengthen participatory processes, improve local road management, monitor accessibility and 
facilitate sectoral integration.
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The key components of this project are: 
(a) 
The rehabilitation and construction of about 1000 kilometers of rural roads
 as part of the 
Second National Program for Rural Roads, including small complementary infrastructure 
(such as local markets). The roads contribute to improving rural access and are identified 
through a strong participatory process involving provincial governments and rural 
municipalities. 
(b) 
Institutional Support
:
This component provides consultant services to (i) develop 
monitoring and evaluation
 of the achievement of targets (impact on accessibility) and 
execution of the Provincial Rural Roads Master Plans, 
disseminate
 their progress to facilitate 
sectoral integration and 
strengthen participation 
in their formulation;  (ii) identify 
local 
economic opportunities 
stemming from the enhanced accessibility, (iii) formulate 
recommendations for improving 
local roads management
 in preparation for an eventual 
decentralization of the road system that would lead to a significant increase in the length of 
the roads classified as communal; and (iv) strengthen the highway agency’s capabilities for 
social and environmental assessments

Comments: 
Potential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation are 
restricted in magnitude and severity.  Roads to be funded by the project do not have major 
irreversible environmental impacts; on the contrary all roads would contribute to positive 
environmental and social impacts especially in terms of providing access to agricultural areas, 
and to social infrastructures and services.  Most roads to be executed under the proposed project 
are on existing right of ways and there will not be significant changes in road characteristics such 
as width or alignment.  Therefore, the project will not entail resettlement of population, only 
minor land expropriation or voluntary donation would be required and excavation works will be 
limited.  Furthermore, the project will not fund any road that would require deforestation, or 
would adversely affect natural habitats, biodiversity, and cultural heritage sites.  Although no 
cultural property issues were identified during project preparation and site visits, chance find 
procedures will be included in the EIA, in accordance with OPN 11.03
.
Negative impacts are 
mainly related to construction activities and are limited to the civil works sites.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
Potential adverse environmental impacts during both construction and operation are restricted in 
magnitude and severity.  Roads to be funded by the project do not have major irreversible 
environmental impacts; on the contrary, all roads would contribute to positive environmental and 
social impacts, especially in terms of providing access to agricultural areas, and to social 
infrastructures and services.  Furthermore, the project will not fund any road that would require 
deforestation, or would adversely affect natural habitats, biodiversity, and cultural heritage sites.  
Although no cultural property issues were identified during project preparation and site visits, 
chance find procedures will be included in the EIA, in accordance with OPN 11.03. Negative 
impacts are mainly related to construction activities and are limited to the civil works sites. 
 
Most roads to be executed under the proposed project are on existing right of ways and there will 
not be significant changes in road characteristics such as width or alignment.  Therefore, the 
project will not entail resettlement of population, only minor land expropriation or voluntary 
donation would be required and excavation works will be limited.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
No negative long term or indirect  impacts are anticipated. 
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
Not relevant. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The implementing agency, the Directorate of Roads at the Ministry of Equipment and Transport 
has experience with Bank roads projects and is currently completing the National Program of 
Rural Roads-1. The proposed project constitutes a second phase.  DRCR has an environmental 
unit, whose mandate would be broadened to cover social issues, including social safeguards.  
Morocco also has a well established legislative framework for handling expropriation and the 
DRCR has a unit within the Department des Affaires Domaniales which is highly capable in 
handling expropriation. This department prepared the Resettlement Policy Framework which 
identifies the criteria by which expropriations would be conducted,  whether it be by the 
Directorate or the communes. In addition, the project will also permit land donation by the 
community for the construction of roads. The Environment and Social unit will ensure that 
donation of land is done on a purely voluntary basis without any coercion. To strengthen the 
capacity of this unit, an environmental engineer, a social scientist and a technician with relevant 
experience in addressing social and environmental safeguards issues in roads projects will be 
recruited.   An additional environmental specialist will be hired to provide technical assistance to 
the environmental engineer at DRCR, and to assist in evaluating projects requiring the 
preparation of an EA report.  Training workshops will also be implemented to strengthen 
environmental expertise within the implementing and executing agencies.  An environmental and 
social specialist will evaluate these aspects of the project during mid term review and assess the 
extent to which the DRCR’s capacities have been strengthened.

D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders are the inhabitants of the rural areas where roads will be built, elected 
representatives at the commune and provincial level, the Directorate of Roads at the central level 
and the provincial offices of the directorate of roads. Consultations on the safeguards instruments 
are planned with elected representatives at the communal and provincial levels. Moreover, the 
project’s training program includes training for elected officials on environmental management 
and expropriation issues.
