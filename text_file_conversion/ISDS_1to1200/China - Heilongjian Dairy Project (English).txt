A.2. Project Objectives: 
The first objective of the project would be to increase the income of existing and new 
dairy households in selected areas of Heilongjiang province. Progress towards the 
achievement of this objective would be measured by monitoring increases in the 
productivity of the dairy farmers’ cattle and adoption of the system (DHI) to improve the 
genetic potential and management of the Heilongjiang dairy herd.  
 
The second objective would be to demonstrate innovative technologies to reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase carbon sequestration.  This would 
contribute to the global objective of improving the sustainability and impact of livestock 
production on the local and global environments.  Progress towards the attainment of this 
outcome would be measured by monitoring the manner with which animal manure and 
crop residues are stored and treated and the area of improved permanent pastures ( carbon 
sequestration). 
A.3. Project Description
:
Page  2
The proposed project would have four components: (i) dairy production, (ii) breed 
improvement, (iii) climate change mitigation and (iv) project management, monitoring 
and evaluation. 
(i) Component 1: Dairy production development (Estimated cost: US$143.9 million).
 
The purpose of this component is to increase smallholder dairy production in the project 
area through investments in improved on-farm dairy production and management, the 
construction of milking stations, dairy parks, dairy demonstration farms and by building 
the capacity of provincial and local institutions to provide training to dairy farmers and to 
facilitate the development of dairy farmers associations. The component will target over 
10,000 existing small and medium size farmers willing and financially able to increase 
their herd, as well as (generally poorer) new households interested in engaging in dairy 
production. This component has six sub-components:  
Household dairy farms (US$ 53.8 million) 
Milking and collection stations (US$ 3.6 million) 
Dairy parks (US$ 64.7 million) 
Demonstration farms (US$ 18.0 million) 
Farmer associations (US$ 0.3 million) 
Training and technology transfer (US$ 3.5 million) 
 
(ii) Component 2: Breed improvement (Estimated cost: US$ 7.3 million). 
The aim of 
this component is to improve the genetic base of the Heilongjiang dairy stock, the 
efficiency of milk production and milk quality.  This would be achieved by establishing a 
comprehensive Dairy Herd Improvement Program (DHIP), including the recording of 
milk and livestock management data, bull breeding and progeny testing. By the end of the 
proposed project, it is anticipated that the Heilongjiang DHIP would cover about 150,000 
dairy cows.  
(iii) Component 3: Climate change mitigation (Estimated cost: US$ 9.1 million).  
The 
aim of this component is to demonstrate and pilot innovative technologies to increase 
carbon sequestration and mitigate/reduce greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the 
expansion of livestock production in Heilongjiang. This would include innovative 
technologies in (i) pasture improvement for the purpose of increasing fodder production, 
carbon sequestration and combating desertification; (ii) treatment of crop residues to 
improve their quality and usage in animal feeding, decrease methane emissions and 
reduce on-field burning of residues; (iii) treatment of animal manure to reduce methane 
emissions and convert it into a salable fertilizer; and (iv) assessing climate change 
experimental technologies through the implementation of research programs.  
(iv) 
Component 4: Project management, monitoring and evaluation (Estimated cost: 
US$ 0.9 million).
 The proposed Project will be managed by the existing World Bank 
provincial project management office (PPMO) within the Heilongjiang Development and 
Reform Commission (HDRC) and PMOs established at county level. The PPMO would 
be responsible for all aspects of project administration, including program management, 
procurement, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation. The PPMO would 
receive policy guidance from a Project Leading Group (PLG), and from a Technical 
Working Group as regards technical issues and coo
rdination. The Project would also help 
Page  3
build the capacity of the Heilongjiang Environment Protection Bureau (HEPB) to 
monitor project environmental impacts.   
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis:  
The scope of the proposed HDP includes a project area that covers 120,000 sq. km with a 
total population of 20 million people that are supported by 2.67 million ha of cultivated 
land. The Project would encompass about 32 counties that extend from the eastern zone 
city of Qiqihar, north to Heihe and through to the central zone centered on Harbin city to 
the western zone areas around the cities of Jiamusi and Mudanjiang. The project has been 
designed to emphasize the proportional inclusion of different social groups for balanced 
social growth, including the poor, women, and minorities (Ref. Section D-4 of the PAD).  
While the Project counties/villages are known, the specific location of project sites for the 
demonstration farms, dairy parks and milking stations will be determined progressively 
during project implementation.  Each of the demonstration farms, dairy parks and milking 
stations would be the subject of an EIA that would be reviewed, approved and monitored  
by the Heilongjiang EPA, which is receiving some capacity support under the Project.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The HDP is classified as an environmental Category B and a safeguards policy S
2
project in accordance with World Bank environmental assessment procedures. A draft 
environmental impact assessment has been prepared. The document includes a 
description of the project, a description of possible activities that the project might 
finance, potential environmental issues for each type of activity the project could finance, 
*
By supporting the proposed project, the Bank does not intend to prejudice the final determination of the parties' 
claims on the disputed areas
 
Page  4
a
description of the guidelines the PPMO and HEPB would follow in evaluating the 
impacts of each sub-project, a description of the World Bank and PRC safeguards and 
EIA systems, and sample forms to be used in environmental monitoring.  The document 
has been reviewed and cleared by the project environment specialist.  The EIA report has 
been translated into Chinese and made available locally disclosed.  The report has also 
been discussed with the staff of Heilongjiang Environmental Protection Bureau, whose 
recommendations have been incorporated in the manual.  The EIA report has been sent to 
the Bank’s info-shop for disclosure to the public.  
 
The project would not finance any major infrastructure, and sub-projects are unlikely 
to involve the acquisition of land through eminent domain. Environmental regulations 
prohibit the construction of Dairy Parks close to water courses and drainage systems and 
proposals to either spread effluent on under-fertilized pastureland or compost it to 
produce bio-fertilizers significantly reduce any environmental threat. The project will not 
finance activities that would significantly convert or degrade any protected areas, known 
natural habitats, or established or proposed critical natural habitats as defined under the 
policy.  
 
The project area includes four or five minority groups in relatively significant 
numbers.  None would be specifically disadvantaged by the Project, which has 
proactively included minority villages in the Project.   The PPMO, in consultation with 
provincial archeological authorities, ascertained that project activities would not 
adversely affect sites having archeological, historical, religious or unique cultural values.  
Nevertheless, an appropriate clause would be included in all construction contracts 
regarding the procedures to be followed in the event of chance finds of culturally 
significant sites. 
 
The project would not directly finance purchases of agro-chemicals, medicines or 
vaccines, although, farmers are able, of course, to purchase them in the market or through 
farmer groups. The use and storage of antibiotics in the project area is managed by the 
veterinary service and dairy factories test systematically for the presence of antibiotics in 
milk. The risk of animal disease is offset by an extensive local disease management 
program and movement control on all farm animals, which have a unique animal health 
identity number. Training would be provided for farmers under the project in appropriate 
application techniques and timing for fertilizers, pesticides and medicaments, as well as 
handling of residues. This would be expected to contribute to reducing the negative 
impact of increased input use. 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
It is hoped that project activities would have an impact on alleviating poverty of 
project beneficiaries in the selected areas/counties where project activities would be 
implemented.  This would have the long term impact of improving the livelihood of 
project beneficiaries and improve economic growth in the project area.   Since all the 
demonstration farms, dairy parks and milking stations will have specific means (manure 
pits or composters, effluent treatment, etc.)  to reduce pollution/GHG and increase carbon 
sequestration, no significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated. 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the Borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Page  5
Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). 
The PPMO hired a resettlement specialist to 
investigate land acquisition issues for the project. His report confirmed the PPMO’s 
affirmation that the project will not involve any significant involuntary land or productive 
assets acquisition. However, in the event that small land parcels are affected by project 
acquisition or rental, a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the various project sub-
components (see Annex 10 [C] of the PAD) will be implemented and the following 
guiding principles regarding land acquisition or rental by project components have been 
agreed upon:   
i. 
All efforts will be made to avoid or minimize the taking of farmland for project 
use. 
ii.  If land is rented for project use, all efforts will be made to avoid renting of 
farmland. 
iii. If the use or rent of farmland or productive assets is unavoidable, then the PPMO 
will proceed to compensate for losses according to the guidance of both the World 
Bank’s OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement and relevant Chinese laws and 
regulations, including the People’s Republic of China’s Land Management Law 
and applicable provincial regulations. 
 
Cultural Property (OP 4.11).
 Although unlikely, some civil construction works might 
conceivably affect cultural property sites. The PPMO, in collaboration with the 
Provincial Cultural Relics Bureau, thus:  
i. 
Confirmed that there are no sites in the project area (milking stations, dairy parks 
or
demonstration farms) that are under the protection of cultural relics protection 
units above the county level nor does any project sub-component site affect any 
historical and cultural sites recognized by any local relics bureaus.  
ii. Explicitly pledged that if any culturally or historically significant finds are 
encountered during project implementation China’s laws on protection of cultural 
relics and the World Bank’s OP 4.11 will be invoked, leading to the immediate 
cessation of work, followed by an initial survey of the site, its later excavation, 
and comprehensive protection of the site.  
iii. Agreed that all project civil works construction contracts will include a provision 
stating that if cultural relics are found work will immediately cease and a report to 
the local cultural relics bureau will be made for the purpose of relics preservation. 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20). 
Indigenous Peoples (Koreans, Manchus, Mongols, and 
Daur, among others) live in the project areas, overall comprising about 5% of the 
project’s potentially affected people. A minority nationalities expert was engaged by the 
PPMO to explore the likely indigenous dimensions of the project. This report indicated 
that: a) no special cultural tailoring of the project was necessary to ensure that minority 
nationalities participate fully and appropriately in the project, b) no negative effects were 
foreseen affecting any minority nationality, and c) the province’s most numerous 
minorities were adequately included in the project with the sole exception of the Daur 
nationality. To rectify this omission, the project added two Daur villages to host project 
sub-components. With this inclusion, no Indigenous Peoples Development Plan was 
deemed necessary or useful.   
Page  6
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
The key stakeholders of the project are: (i) its potential beneficiary households and public 
institutions; (ii) private sector enterprises and investors in the demo farms, dairy parks 
and milking stations; and (iii) village and county governments.  The Borrower conducted 
an initial consultation with village and county governments to gage their interest in 
participating in the project and in taking the necessary measures to protect the 
environment.  A second consultation took place during project preparation.  A New 
Zealand team visited eight villages and interviewed about 300 randomly selected 
villagers.  The purpose of the survey was to establish baseline data about rural HHs and 
to provide indicators and measurements to evaluate the impact of the Project.  During 
pre-
appraisal the Borrower’s staff and the Bank TT visited other project sites and 
conducted focus groups/interviews on two occasions to verify the interest of stakeholders 
in the project and inform them of its activities.  Prior to appraisal the Borrower hired two 
local consultants to further verify the applicability of resettlement, indigenous groups and 
cultural safeguards.  The results of these consultations is explained in Section D-
4
above.  
On December 20, 2004, the Borrower also translated the EIA and the RPF reports and 
made them available to the public in public display boards in project counties in 
Heilongjiang province and on the internet at www.hljdpc.gov.cn..
