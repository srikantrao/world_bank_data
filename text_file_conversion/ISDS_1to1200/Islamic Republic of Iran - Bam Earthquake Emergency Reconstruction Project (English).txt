A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safe
guard 
analysis
:
The project is located in and around the ancient city of Bam in the Province of Kerman. Kerman 
province  is  the second largest  province, located in the  southeastern  part  of  Iran  with a  total 
population of about 2 million.  The District of 
Bam is located 183 kilometers east of Kerman and 
is known for its ancient Arg
-e-
Bam (Bam citadel) and its production of dates.  The dates and 
citrus  fruit  industry  accounted  for  about  60  percent  of  income  in  Bam  and  the  surrounding 
villages.  The city's hi
storic mud
-
brick citadel drew constant number of tourists (in 2003, 110,000 
Iranian and 10,000 foreign visitors).  Recently a modern automotive assembly plant called Arg
-
Jadid Complex has drawn overseas investments such as Volkswagen and Daewoo companies. 
The population of Bam District (covering Bam city and surrounding 900 villages) was close to 
200,000 in 2000 while the city of Bam had a population of 92,000 before the earthquake.

Section II 
–
 Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management 
D. Summary of Key Safeg
uard 
Issues
. 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated wi
th the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Cultural Property (OPN. 11.03) and OD/BP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) will be potentially 
triggered.
Cultural Property (OPN. 11.03)
The 
Project does not finance works related to the cultural heritage sites in Bam.  However, during 
the infrastructure works, cautions should be full taken by the Bam Reconstruction Office (BRO) 
and the implementation agencies to ensure protection of the cultur
al heritage sites in case of 
chance
-
finds.  The Borrower prepared the Social and Environment Screening and Assessment 
Framework  (SESAF)  during  appraisal.    The  SESAF  includes  guidelines  on  chance
-
finds 
procedures to be reinforced in all civil works.  The pr
oject will liaise closely with the appropriate 
organizations  such  as  United  Nations  Educational,  Cultural  and  Scientific  Organization 
(UNESCO) specialized in restoration of the cultural and architectural heritage. 
Involuntary Resettlement (OD/BP 4.12) 
T
he  Project  finances  provision  of  equipment  and  construction  materials  for  housing  and 
commercial  buildings,  but  not  directly  in  the  construction  works.    Therefore,  the  chance  of 
triggering  OP/BP  4.12  is  minimum.    However  given  the  large
-
scale  housing  recon
structions 
expected during the project period, possible triggering OP/BP 4.12 should not be totally ruled out.  
As  a  proactive  measure,  the  above
-
mentioned  SESAF  has  included  guidelines  to  ensure 
application of OP/BP 4.12.  
The Government of Iran (GOI) h
as agreed to consult the Bank when relocations involve more 
than 25 families, and has agreed to implement the principles of full compensation and livelihood 
restoration for any secondarily displaced persons. GOI will review relocations on a case
-
by
-
case 
ba
sis  and  will  provide  information  to  the  Bank  about  any  secondary  displacement  that  has 
occurred  to  date.  GOI  will  review  additional  cases  as  they  arise  and  ascertain  that  agreed 
procedures for resettlement and rehabilitation are being followed. Based on th
e agreed principles 
provided in the SESAF, a land acquisition data sheet will be prepared and agreed with the Bank 
during the first six months of implementation. For road widening purposes, small tracts of private 
land may need to be acquired
If  land  acqu
isition  is  necessary  GOI  will  inform  the  Bank  and  prepare  an  appropriate 
Resettlement  Action  Plan  (RAP)  to  ensure  from  the  Government  that  the  principles  of  full 
compensation and livelihood restoration for affected persons will be applied.  If private land
 is 
needed for relocation/reconstruction land will be purchased on the principle of willing seller
-
willing buyer. Decisions about land acquisition will be taken only after full consultation with the 
affected people and full disclosure of information and en
titlements. The owners and occupants of 
the  acquired  land  would  be  eligible  for  support  based  on  the  Bank’s  policy  on  Involuntary 
Resettlement. GOI would work with agencies experienced in working with local populations to 
ensure proper consultation, compen
sation and relocation assistance to the displaced persons.  
In 
addition to providing details of procedures for dealing with land acquisition and entitlement, the 
SESAF outlines provisions for the development of an effective grievance redressing mechanism.

A Monitoring Advisory Services Consultant (MASC) to be financed under the Component E of 
the Project will support the BRO and the implementation agencies to ensure screening and 
monitoring tasks to be carried out throughout the project duration.
D.2 
Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area.
Given that the damage covers the entire city of Bam and the surrounding villages, the project 
involves  multi
-
sector  reconstruction  investmen
ts.    While  the  Government  acknowledges  the 
principle of owner reconstruction and rehabilitation in situ, the construction of roads to meet 
current  planning  standards  may  trigger  resettlement  and  land  expropriation.  The  presence  of 
cultural heritage sites w
ithin the project area also calls for considerable diligence and requires 
close multi
-
sectoral coordination.  The project is designed to re
-
establish the basic necessities of 
life in terms of housing and public services. This is likely to lead to very loca
lized effects largely 
limited to the construction phase.  Reconstruction investments identified for the IBRD financing 
involve damage repairs and will involve neither major expansion of space nor involve invasion to 
green areas.  However given the large
-
sc
ale housing reconstruction that is expected during the 
project period, possible triggering OP/BP 4.12 is not totally ruled out.  As a proactive measure, 
the Social and Environmental Screening and Assessment Framework (SESAF) was prepared and 
has included g
uidelines to ensure application of OP/BP 4.12.  In addition, to ensure maximum 
cooperation between the citizens and the reconstruction agencies in these efforts, arrangements 
for  effective  citizen  participation  will  be  made  based  on  the  principles  describe
d  in  the 
Communication Strategy documents.
Long
-
term impacts are expected to be positive with application of seismic
-
resistant construction 
standards  and  better  service  delivery  capacity  developed.    Through  its  support  for  capacity 
building for service wo
rkers in and around the project, it is anticipated that existing institutions of 
local government will be strengthened.
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives 
(if relevant)
There has been no explicit treatment of alternatives in terms of overall r
econstruction.  Final 
version of the Masterplan for Bam approved by the Government in April 2004 incorporated the 
principle  of  minimum  road  widening  and  displacement  of  the  population.    Decisions  about 
minimizing resettlement in the light of proposals will
 be based on informed decision
-
making by 
all affected stakeholders.
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower 
to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
Social and Environmen
tal Screening and Assessment Framework (SESAF) document has been 
prepared during appraisal.
The  Bam  Reconstruction  Office  will  assign  a  team  of  social  and  environmental  officers  to 
coordinate  activities regarding  social  and  environmental  safeguards  as  wel
l as  to  develop  an 
effective means to ensure communication with and the participation of affected persons and civil 
society organizations for the preparation and implementation of EMPs, RAPs and for capacity 
building activities. In addition, Sr. Legal Offi
cer will be recruited in the BRO to provide the 
Page  6
6
population with preliminary legal advisory support on issues that may affect them during the 
implementation  (e.g.  potential  land  expropriation,  compensation).    As  mentioned  earlier,  a 
Monitoring Advisory Serv
ices Consultant will be financed to assist the BRO in establishing and 
operating  a  project  performance  monitoring  system,  including  monitoring  of  safeguard 
compliance.  
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The  key  stakeholders  are  the  population  directly  affected  by  the  Bam  earthquake  and  the 
authorities involved in the reconstruction program both at national and local levels
. Civil society 
organizations active in reconstruction efforts are likely to be secondary stakeholders along with 
locally elected and government officials.  The overall policymaking body has been established by 
the Government of Iran through “Bam Guidance 
and Policy Task Force (Inter
-
Ministerial Task 
Force). 
The participation of earthquake affected communities (especially the most vulnerable groups and 
women)  and  the  involvement  of  local  Non
-
Governmental  Organizations  (NGOs)  has  been 
incorporated  into  a 
C
ommunication  Strategy  to  be  implemented  by  BRO.  The  strategy  was 
prepared  during  appraisal  and  will  be  finalized  during  the  first  six  months  of  project 
implementation. It will serve as a policy framework for implementation agencies on 
flows of 
information 
and consultation processes among different levels (project implementation agencies, 
local governments
, 
community leaders, NGOs, women, youth, the disabled, and children).
