B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The development objective of the Dam Safety Project I, which is “to protect the population and 
the socio-economic infrastructure down-stream of dams facing the highest risk of failure” is also 
the PDO for this repeater project, Irrigation Dam Safety Project II but on a much more extended 
geographic scale. The project will also contribute to enhance the sustainability of economic 
activities which are dependent on a reliable supply of water. Proceeds of the Project will be used 
exclusively to assist in financing interventions aimed at significantly lowering the safety risk of 
those dams. These interventions are deemed necessary on the basis of the findings of technical 
investigations undertaken under the previous project, which called for urgent action to prevent 
many of the  investigated dams from entering into an emergency state in the near future. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The proposed Project will be made of three components: (i) Rehabilitation of dams; (ii) Dam 
Safety Strengthening; and (iii) Project management. 
 
In summary the activities proposed for inclusion under project financing aims at: 
Page  2
 
 
• 
upgrading the safety status of 48 dams; 
• 
providing control measurement devices at 56 dam sites; 
• 
preparing the Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP) for the Yerevan lake dam; 
• 
providing minimal requirement of O&M equipment for 55 dams; 
• 
providing the minimal needed telecom. equipment for implementing all EPPs; 
• 
improving the access to 16 dam sites; 
• 
providing training on dam safety issues to operators of 60 dams; 
• 
providing training and support on dam regulatory issues to the Dam Maintenance 
branch of the Water Supply Agency. 
 
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Republic of Armenia, countrywide. 
 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
Borrower’s adequate institutional capacity for managing safeguard issues has been demonstrated 
throughout implementation of Dam Safety Project I.  In addition, the implementing agency is 
also responsible for implementation of Irrigation Development Project.  PIU has a full time 
environmental specialist responsible for safeguard issues. No major issues in relation to 
safeguard policies were noticed during implementation of DSP I.

Environmental Assessment
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.01) 
 
About US$3.9 million will be allocated for implementing emergency and priority 
measures in 48 dam sites. This means an average expenditure for each dam of 
about USD80,000, showing the limited nature of the  interventions , (mainly 
improvement of  spillways and irrigation outlets). As in the previous DSP I, the  
principal environmental issue faced by the project  is the management and 
disposal of excavated materials. Such management and disposal in IDSP II will be 
much less than in the previous project since no works on dam body is foreseen 
and in only one case (Kechut dam) will a temporary building and a borrow pitbe 
included. Nevertheless, Environmental Management Plan for IDSP I is being 
revised and updated,  and all works contracts envisaged under the project will 
conform to the requirements under this plan. Necessary permits from the Ministry 
of Nature Protection (MNP) and as needed from the local/regional authorities for 
all transport, disposal, and dumping operations will be part of the contracts. 
Restoration to quasi-original conditions of landscape after completion of 
construction and rehabilitation works and minimization of air pollution emissions 
during the works will be also part of the contracts. The Water Supply Agency and 
Page  3
 
 
the PIU will be responsible for supervising that the EMP is properly and timely 
implemented.

Safety of Dams
 (
OP
/
BP
 4.37) 
 
The primary goal of the project is to improve the safety of dams, conforming to 
almost all safety aspects identified by OP4.37.  Provisions for complying with OP 
4.37 included in DSP I will be continued in DSP II. Beside evident benefits in 
terms of safety for people and infrastructure,  the project will contribute to the 
reduction of  erosion of dam sites (included under rehabilitation contracts), 
thereby lengthening the life of the investments and   reducing risks from erosion-
induced failures. The project will also, through provision of safety and 
telecommunication equipment, further  implement Emergency Preparedness Plans 
completed under DSP I. The project will also, through provision of  O&M 
equipment and improvement of the regulatory framework, improve the 
sustainability of the dam system. Financial sustainability of the system remain 
part of a larger effort of institutional reform  for the Water Supply Agency  
(including the creation of Water Users Associations) supported  under the World 
Bank’s Irrigation Development Project.

7.50) 
 
In general terms the project, dealing with infrastructures that store water that in 
some cases ultimately flow into international rivers as Arax, triggers such OP.  As 
with DSP I, an exception to the notification requirements for riparian countries is 
warranted. One of those exceptions takes place when the project concerns “any 
ongoing schemes, projects involving additions or alterations that require 
rehabilitation, construction, or other changes that in the judgment of the Bank: (i) 
will not adversely change the quality or quantity of water flows to the other 
riparians; and (ii) will not be adversely affected by the other riparians' possible 
water use”. Again this exception applies only to “minor additions or alterations to 
the ongoing scheme” and does not cover “works and activities that would exceed

the original scheme, change its nature, or so alter or expand its scope and extent 
as to make it appear a new or different scheme”.  The Irrigation Dam Safety 
Project II fits fully such description as it predecessors DSP I that, for the same 
reason, was waived from the requirement of communications to riparian states.
