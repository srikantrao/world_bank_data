                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The proposed RETF will support the Government of Kenya (GOK) to develop and pilot models of integrated NCD care at
                           community and primary care levels in selected counties that can inform the national scale up. More specifically, the
                           RETF will support the design, execution, and systematic monitoring of a pilot program for screening, early detection
                           and treatment of selected NCDs at community and primary care levels complemented by cost effective referral
                           linkages. The RETF will lead to the production of a case study, documenting the main features of the model of care,
                           and lessons learned to inform interventions that are scalable and sustainable.

                           C. Project Description
                           The proposed NCD pilot project focuses on prevention that is one of the main priorities in Kenya. Early screening,
                           detection and basic treatment will: (i) avert high levels of morbidity and mortality; (ii) pre-empt an escalation of health
                           care costs associated with delayed health care seeking behavior; and (iii) lay the foundation for a comprehensive
                           approach to chronic care management (i.e. patients need to be aware and know their status to seek care). Ultimately,
                           catching people early will save lives, improve the quality of life, and avoid the impoverishing effects associated with

                           high out-of-pocket spending due to catastrophic illnesses.

                           The pilot project will generate a model of care that will inform the roll out of the national strategy and that may be
                           replicated by other county governments. The pilot builds on ongoing experience with a Chronic Care Model
                           supported by AMPATH [1] in several counties in Western Kenya. Insights and lessons from the proposed NCD pilot are
                           expected to inform policy development while simultaneously expanding coverage. The model (focused on
                           hypertension and diabetes) has been introduced in limited geographic areas with promising initial results, as discussed
                           below. The proposed pilot offers an opportunity to introduce the model to additional sub-counties to test its
                           robustness in different settings; to include additional NCDs (cervical and breast cancer); and to systematically estimate
                           the costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies.

                           The pilot will focus on NCD services at the community and primary health care levels while strengthening the
                           referral system across different levels of care in two pilot counties. It will document what it takes to make this work
                           in terms of strategies, systems, and resources. The process of scale up would involve initial meetings with county
                           leadership led by the county health management teams to forge partnerships and sensitize them to this program. This
                           would be followed by adaption of the program to the local situations. The curricula will be used to train trainers who
                           will also be mentors during the roll out process. The training will be cascaded to primary health care workers and the
                           same model of hypertension and diabetes prevention and control will be rolled out at all project sites while cervical
                           and breast cancer screening is rolled out at selected sites. The tools, strategies, experiences and lessons from this pilot
                           will be shared widely with other county officials to assist in the scale up to other parts of the country. The NCD pilot
                           project will be separately supported by the Bank through a BETF (P163853) which aims to share and disseminate
                           experiences and lessons from implementation at the national and global level. The description of the activities to be
                           supported under the RETF is provided below.

                           Design, Piloting and Evaluating Models of Care for Screening and Treatment of Select NCDs. Two pilot projects would
                           be conducted in two counties (i.e. Busia, Trans-Nzoia) in Western Kenya with support of AMPATH. Pilot 1 would
                           include the expansion of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) and the testing of the Expanded Chronic Care Model (ECCM) in
                           select sub-counties in Trans-Nzoia. Pilot 2 would include the expansion of the Chronic Care Model in sub-counties in
                           Busia. Counties were selected based on the following criteria: (i) commitment and support of county governments;(ii)
                           high poverty rates; and/or (iii) disease burden. Busia county with a population of roughly 954,000 inhabitants has a
                           poverty rate of over 64 percent and a life expectancy of only 47 years. Based on community screenings done over the
                           past two years in select counties the prevalence of elevated blood pressure is 22 percent and diabetes is 1.5 percent.

                           Trans-Nzoia county has a population of nearly 957,000, a poverty rate of over 50 percent, and is predominantly
                           agricultural. Based on community screenings the prevalence of elevated blood pressure and diabetes is 27 and 2
                           percent, respectively.

                           The main focus of the pilots would be on establishing/expanding basic NCD services at the community and primary
                           health care levels using the Chronic Care Model. This would include raising awareness, early screening, diagnosis,
                           linkage to a health facility for initial treatment of basic, cost effective interventions with referral to specialized
                           facilities. In addition, a number of the sub-counties will benefit from the Expanded Chronic Care Model that includes
                           community empowerment activities and enrollment of beneficiaries in the NHIF, as these aspects are critical to
                           sustainability. An important aspect of the pilot will be to sensitize communities in participating counties on the
                           importance of health insurance, the NHIF benefit package, payment rates and payment options and how to access
                           services. Sensitization will be conducted jointly with the NHIF during the community meetings and NCD screening
                           exercises, and will also include registration of beneficiaries. To increase retention rates, AMPATH will collaborate with
                           the NHIF to monitor registration of beneficiaries and send monthly reminders through mobile phones to remind

                           registered beneficiaries of their monthly payments. The interventions to be supported are expected to generate
                           lessons on what is feasible; what impediments arise; what remedial actions are taken; how much it cost; and what is
                           the scale up strategy. The pilots would be evaluated to draw lessons for potential scale up to other counties in Kenya.
                           In addition to an impact evaluation (before and after study) a small qualitative process evaluation would be conducted
                           to document the implementation process (i.e. What worked? What did not and why?). All necessary ethical clearances
                           would be obtained prior to launching the pilots.

                           The implementation of the pilot NCD project will generate important lessons in terms of how services should be
                           organized, delivered, and financed. The project will provide an opportunity to identify health system barriers to care
                           and develop feasible approaches and apply cost effective interventions with a focus on primary care. The pilot will: (i)
                           determine knowledge, attitudes and practices of patients and providers; (ii) establish the effectiveness of alternative
                           community education and screening strategies and different linkage and referral strategies; (iii) demonstrate the
                           feasibility and scalability of the chronic care model for select NCDs; and (iv) ascertain the costs of these interventions
                           and evaluate the cost effectiveness of the screening, linkage, referral and care strategies. The experience and lessons
                           generated will be of broader interest to other county governments in Kenya struggling with similar challenges as well
                           as to other low and middle-income countries participating in the broader industry-supported initiative (Accelerated
                           Access) supporting this critical work.[2] The pilot NCD project will focus on health system barriers that impede access
                           to chronic care: (i) shortages of personnel; retention and motivation of personnel; (ii) cost of drugs, stock outs, and
                           inadequate availability of diagnostics; and (iii) weak referral system. While AMPATHâ€™s experience with chronic care has
                           generated important early lessons in some counties, it is important to test the replicability and robustness of the
                           model in different settings. Based on discussions with key stakeholders in Kenya a series questions have been
                           identified, and will form the basis for the operational research agenda to be supported under the project. This current
                           preliminary list of questions to be explored is as follows:
