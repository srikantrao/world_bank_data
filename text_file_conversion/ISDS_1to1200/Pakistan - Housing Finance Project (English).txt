B.  Project Objectives [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
Overall, the project intends to implement a comprehensive program to help revitalize the primary 
housing finance market through increased private sector participation.  On completion, more  
middle income families should be able to purchase land or housing conveniently, efficiently and 
transparently using affordable financial products provided by private financial institutions. In 
turn, this should further invigorate the economy through increased investment in the housing 
sector and related industries. 
 
 
C.  Project Description [from section 4 of PCN] 
 
The final details of each project component will be determined in consultation with the State 
Bank of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Housing and other government institutions 
during the course of the project identification mission planned for the first quarter of 2004. In 
addressing the current housing finance constraints, the project will consider the following:  
 
i. 
Legislation and regulations:
 Legal and regulatory uncertainties undermine existing land 
administration systems. Although mandatory, property registration is often neglected because 
procedures are costly and lengthy. Consequently, record-keeping is incomplete and unreliable, 
and multiple sales of the same property with related ownership disputes are commonplace.

ii. 
Institutions and administrative procedures
: The number of institutions and registration 
procedures required to execute property transactions remains high. Multiple institutions and 
procedural differences between, and within states, create market distortions and inefficiencies in 
the property development market. The distortions result in improper registrations and a culture 
favoring informal property transactions - an obstacle to effective liens and asset securitization.  
  
iii. 
Land information systems:
 
Better ways to collect and disseminate data are required to 
improve efficiency and minimize fraud and financial abuse. Computerized information and 
registration systems, property and ownership databases, effective title regularization processes 
and cadastral surveying, and an effective land information system can increase transparency and 
creditor rights enforcement.  
 
v.  
Housing development industry
: The property development industry suffers from low 
public confidence. A history of scams, financial weaknesses, and the absence of clear, uniform 
and fair business practices have tarnished its credibility. Financial institutions are  reluctant to 
provide construction finance, and individuals are reluctant to apply for mortgages.  
 
vi.  
Financial sector
: The supply of housing finance in Pakistan remains severely limited. 
The impact of past directed housing credit through nationalized commercial banks has been 
minimal because their portfolio quota was used mostly by their own staff. Recently, commercial 
banks have been experimenting with new housing finance products for the last two years as part 
of a broader strategy of consumer finance based on cross-lending products targeted to higher 
income groups, especially car loans and credits cards. However, the maturity on these products is 
still inadequate due to long term funding constraints, weak mortgage collateral and limited 
assessable creditworthy demand.   
 
D.  Project location (if known) 
 
Although the project will be designed as a national product, it is envisaged that it will be 
implemented in a phased manner starting with pilot reforms in selected major cities around the 
country.  The specific cities, and the sequencing of those cities will be determined during the 
course of a project identification mission planned for the first quarter of 2004. 
 
E.  Borrower’s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies [from PCN] 
 
The Project Team has examined the type, likely locations and scale of the proposed project as 
well as the nature and magnitude of its potential impacts. It has determined that no Safeguard 
policies will be applicable.
