A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project aims to empower indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities and 
organizations so that they are increasingly able to manage the development process 
according to their needs and perspectives in an intercultural framework. 
  
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
A. 
Strengthening Social Organizations ($2.3 million) 
This component  would strengthen indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian membership 
organizations with the following technical assistance (TA) and training activities:  (i) 
Management capacity building; (ii) strategic and local participatory development 
planning; (iii) legal, management, and technical training; and (iv) equity in gender and 
generations.  In addition, it will provide TA to local governments in order to help them 
improve their targeting and participatory practices. Intercultural relations, gender and 
other equity issues will be incorporated systematically in all these programs. 
 
B. 
Knowledge and Culture for Development ($2.8 million) 
This component will help target groups improve their human capital as well as their 
knowledge base and cultural assets, thus contributing to increased incomes. It will 
include the following activities: (i) A scholarship program for higher education and (ii) 
training and technical assistance for culture-based initiatives, among others, in tourism 
and handicrafts. 
 
C. 
Natural Resources ($2.7 million) 
This component will help the target population improve management of natural 
resources through increased access and control of land, water and other natural resources 
vital for their livelihood. To achieve these results, it will support the following TA 
activities:

program in community natural resource management for the improved handling of soils, 
water and reforested areas. 
 
D. 
Rural Investments ($28.0 million) 
This component will finance demand-driven, small-scale subprojects by eligible 
communities for: (i) pre-investment studies; (ii) social investments  (iii) community 
productive investments; (iv) community micro-enterprises; (v) TA for production and 
marketing; (vi) environmental and natural resources management; and (vii) 
cajas 
solidarias.
 Beneficiaries of this component must be residents of the 
parroquias
 included 
in the Operational Manual (OM), but non-target people living in the project areas may 
partially benefit from project investments. Financing of subprojects would be on a grant 
basis matched by varying amounts of community labor or cofinancing sources. 
 
E. 
Institutional Strengthening of CODENPE and CODAE ($9.3 million) 
This component will increase the Government’s capacity to formulate intercultural 
policies and programs taking into consideration the concerns of indigenous and Afro-
Eucadorian peoples.  It would provide specialized technical support to CODENPE and 
CODAE for the implementation of their public role. The component will aim to increase 
public participation in policy-making, improve transparency and accountability, and 
increase the share of the Government’s budget targeted at these communities and 
peoples.  The Component comprises three programs to be implemented in both 
government institutions: (i) Public Policies and Development Management; (ii) Legal 
Development in Selected Areas; and (iii) Institutional Development and  Intercultural 
Communication.
  
As a complementary part of this component,  the project will also include support 
for a Project Implementation Unit, including a central coordinating office and up to seven 
regional implementing units.  
 
 
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:   
 
This project will serve indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities, on a demand-
driven basis, throughout the coastal, Sierra, and Amazonian regions of Ecuador.  Much of 
the land owned or controlled by these communities still contains native forests and other 
natural habitats, some of which might qualify as critical natural habitats under the Bank’s 
Natural Habitats Policy.  However, the (i) eligible categories of project investments and 
(ii) environmental review process for all subprojects are intended to avoid any significant 
damage to critical or other natural habitats.

Section II – Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. 
 
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
Environmental Assessment (OP 4.01):  
The Borrower has prepared a free-standing 
Environmental Assessment (EA) report, 
P
olitica y Procedimientos de Gestion Ambiental:  
CODENPE-CODAE-PRODEPINE
 (March 2004).  EA preparation took into account (i) 
the findings of an independent environmental audit of the PRODEPINE I project 
(
Informe de Verificacion y Evaluacion Ambiental de los Subproyectos,
OIKOS, January 
2001); (ii) the technical recommendations of World Bank staff; and (iii) extensive prior 
consultations with indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities and their representative 
organizations, along with other stakeholders.   
 
 The EA report also serves as this project's Environmental Manual, and will be 
fully incorporated within the PRODEPINE II Operational Manual prior to Loan 
Effectiveness.  The Environmental Manual indicates the environmental requirements for 
all relevant project activities, particularly in Components 3 (Natural Resources) and 4 
(Rural Investments).  It specifies the criteria and procedures for environmental 
management (including screening and follow-up mitigation and supervision, as needed) 
of all PRODEPINE II subprojects.  It incorporates the environmental lessons learned 
from PRODEPINE I, such as prohibiting support under PRODEPINE II for forestation of 
paramo areas with pines or other non-native trees.  
                                                          
 
 
Page  5
 
 
 
PRODEPINE II subprojects will be relatively small (most less than $30,000 and 
none over $125,000), and largely benign or positive from an environmental standpoint.  
At least 10 percent of Rural Investment subprojects are expected to be primarily 
environmental in their focus; many Natural Resources subprojects will also emphasize 
environmental improvements. 
     
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04) and Forests (OP 4.36):
  The PRODEPINE II 
Environmental Manual specifies that the project will not support activities that could 
result in significant natural habitat loss or degradation, including (i) deforestation or other 
clearing of natural habitats (including mangroves and paramos); (ii) new road 
construction; (iii) road improvements within natural forests; (iv) dams which would flood 
areas of forest or cultural property; (v) use of risky (potentially invasive) non-native 
species; or (vi) activities adversely affecting protected areas.  On the contrary, many 
subprojects should lead to the improved protection and management of forests and other 
natural habitats on indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian community lands.  The proposed 
mangrove restoration subprojects would work exclusively with native species.  
PRODEPINE II (unlike PRODEPINE I) will not support pine or other non-native tree 
plantations in highland paramo ecosystems, thereby avoiding adverse biodiversity 
impacts and ensuring compliance with both OP 4.04 and 4.36. 
   
PRODEPINE II would support titling and related activities to regularize the status 
of communal indigenous lands that are under the jurisdiction of the National Agrarian 
Development Institute (INDA) or the Ministry of Environment (MAE), the latter as either 
Forest Patrimony 
(Patrimonio Forestal)
 or Protection Forests 
(Bosques Protectores)
.  
The project would also support the granting of long-term concessions of coastal 
mangrove lands by MAE to Afro-Ecuadorian communities for sustainable management, 
in accordance with management plans requiring MAE approval.  However, PRODEPINE 
II would not support the titling or concessioning of lands within the National Protected 
Areas System (SNAP, including National Parks, Ecological Reserves, Wildlife Refuges, 
and Biological Reserves), which cannot be titled under current Ecuadorian law.  The 
project's activities to improve land tenure security for indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities are expected to be largely positive from an environmental standpoint, 
because (i) indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian populations traditionally tend to conserve 
much more forest on their lands than most other rural Ecuadorians; (ii) all land titles and 
concessions will be for relatively large, contiguous blocks at the community level--these 
are much more amenable to forest-based land uses than smaller land parcels titled to 
individuals; (iii) secure tenure gives community members a strong incentive to patrol 
their land and prevent invasions by outsiders; (iv) indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
community members are often the only 
de facto
 forest guards in remote areas with little 
governmental field presence; (v) secure tenure removes possible incentives to clear 
forested land simply to show possession and use; (vi) secure tenure enables indigenous 
and Afro-Ecuadorian communities to insist upon more favorable terms (including from 
an environmental standpoint) from oil and gas, timber, oil palm plantation, or other 
commercial interests; (vii) the issuance of titles and concessions is contingent upon the 
p

p
aration of land mana
g
ement 
p
lans, which are re
q
uired to show that the 
Page  6
 
 
intended land uses will be environmentally sustainable (and will maintain most existing 
forest cover); (viii) PRODEPINE II will provide increased (relative to PRODEPINE I) 
technical assistance to communities to improve the quality of these mangement plans, 
including from an environmental standpoint; and (ix) other projects (including the GEF 
Conservation of Biodiversity in Pastaza Mid-Sized Project and the USAID-supported 
CAIMAN program) also rely upon the titling of large blocks of indigenous community 
lands as an explicit strategy to promote long-term forest conservation and sustainable use.  
 
Pest Management (OP 4.09):
  No procurement of pesticides or pesticide application of 
equipment is planned under PRODEPINE II.  However, some subprojects (such as small-
scale irrigation) might indirectly induce relatively small increases in pesticide use.  The 
Environmental Manual (Section 3 and Table 1) specifies the compounds which cannot be 
financed or otherwise supported under the project, including all those in the World Health 
Organization's Class IA and IB and those classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants.  
Where relevant, subprojects will include technical assistance and training in the proper 
use, handling, storage, and disposal of agrochemicals, as well as in the principles and 
techniques of integrated pest management.  Due to the expected small scale of any 
pesticide use under the project, a free-standing Pest Management Plan is not required. 
 
Cultural Property (OPN 11.03):
  In general, the indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities requesting any PRODEPINE II subprojects are quite knowledgeable about 
the archaeological, historical, sacred, or other culturally significant sites or objects on 
their lands.  Nonetheless, road rehabilitation, small irrigation canals, or other small civil 
works under the Natural Resources or Rural Investments components could conceivably 
uncover new items of cultural significance.  The Environmental Manual (Section 7) 
outlines standard environmental rules for all civil works contractors to follow.  These 
rules specify the need for chance finds procedures in each civil works contract, to ensure 
that contractors and construction workers will understand the actions they need to take in 
case they uncover objects of possible cultural significance. 
 
Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20).
  In accordance with the Indigenous Peoples Policy, the 
entire project is classified as an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan.
 
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the 
project area. 
 
No adverse long-term impacts, direct or indirect, are expected to result from the project.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
The project alternative chosen is not expected to be problematic from an environmental 
or social standpoint. 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment of 
borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The Bank has reviewed the institutional capacity of PRODEPINE (including CODENPE 
and CODAE
)

otherwise ensure that good environmental practices will be followed throughout the 
project.  The existing environmental management capacity within PRODEPINE is 
adequate; however, it will be important for the project to maintain a sufficient number 
and quality of natural resources specialists in the National and Regional Offices.  The EA 
report was prepared primarily by these natural resources management specialists, who 
will be responsible for the environmental review and follow-up environmental 
management (including mitigation, enhancement, and supervision) of relevant 
PRODEPINE II subprojects.  The project includes funds for training within each 
component; this will include environmental training when requested by project staff, 
service providers, or beneficiary communities.  Project monitoring will include 
environmental audits of subprojects of all types.
 
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on 
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian peoples are the main project stakeholders.  They have 
participated in project design through national and regional workshops with their 
representative organizations.  They will continue to be actively involved in project 
implementation, as well as monitoring and evaluation.  This project uses a community-
driven development approach, in which national-level decisions are made by the Boards 
of CODENPE and CODAE, where the main membership organizations are represented.  
At lower levels, decisions are made by the communities themselves, who then delegate 
implementation to indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian executing agencies.  
 
Prior to appraisal, the EA report was sent to the Bank's InfoShop; the report is also 
available for public review in PRODEPINE's National Office in Quito, as well as each of 
seven PRODEPINE Regional Offices throughout Ecuador.
