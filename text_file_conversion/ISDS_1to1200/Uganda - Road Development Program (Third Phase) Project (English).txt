I.A.2. Project Objectives (From PDS):

The development objective of the Road Development Program, Phase 3 Project (the Project) is to
improve access to rural areas and economically productive areas and to progressively continue to
build up sustainable road sector planning, design and program management capability including
road safety management. The Project comprises: (i) upgrading and strengthening of three high
priority    national     roads,  i.e.   Kampala-Gayaza-Wobulenzi;             Soroti-Dokolo-Lira;       and
Busega-Mityana; (ii) detailed design of the upgrading of about 300 km of District Roads
reclassified to the National Road Standard; (iii) consultancies for feasibility studies of upgrading
to bitumen standard about 600 km of priority national roads (iv) rehabilitation/regravelling of the
Atiak-Moyo road; (v) construction of a proposed Road Authority headquarters building; (vi)
Institutional support to the establishment of the Road Authority, and (vii) the provision of
external auditing services. These Project objectives complement the objectives of the Phase 1 and
2 projects in meeting the overall objectives of the Program.

I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social
characteristics of the area and population likely to be affected, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or
critical natural habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
Soroti- Lira road comprises 114.2 km of gravel road and 11.4 km of bitumen surface road between towns
Soroti and Lira in the North East part of the country. The road represents the remaining link of the transport
corridor between the capital Kampala and the North East. The main activities in the project area of influence
are arable and pastoral agriculture and fishing. The project area is one of the most important cotton producing
area of the country. The road was rehabilitated under the previously financed Northern Uganda Rehabilitation
Project ( NURP) and now the intention is to complete surfacing of the remaining parts of the road to bitumen
standard.
Kampala- Gayaza- Zirobwe- Wobulenzi road, 67 km long, is situated in the central part of the country, linking
the capital with the agriculture rich producing are a of Buganda. The hinterland of the road constitutes an
important part of the lakeshore banana-coffee network, a mainstay of Uganda agriculture. The fertility of the
soil is high and suited for the production of other high value crops. The project will upgrade the existing road
to bitumen standard, enabling cheaper movement of people and goods.
Atiak-Moyo road is situated in the North West of the country close to the border with Sudan. It represents the
main route for refugee movement and at present is in state of disrepair. The upgrading of the road will
comprise of regravelling , reshaping and fixing of drainage of the road. The hinterland of the road is known for
cotton production and the soils are also suitable for the production of simsim, tobacco and various food crops.
The road also has a regional significance, connecting Moyo to the Sudan border.
Busega-Mityana road is the main transport link from the capital to the east of the country. it represents a road
with very high rate of traffic accidents and at present is at state of disrepair. The design of the road is
underway and the EIA and SIA reports will be out shortly. The findings of the reports will be disclosed as
soon as the Bank reviews them.This road was added to the project very recently.It was initially to be financed
by DANIDA, but after their pull out from the sector, at the specific request of GOU, the Bank has agreed to
finance it.



B. Check Environmental Classification: B (Partial Assessment)

Comments: All roads included in the credit are existing roads, some of them already rehabilitated, but in order
to save the maintenance cost and improve the travelling time, they will be upgraded to bitumen standard. All
roads have been subjected to the EIA, SIA and RAPs have been prepared, except for the Busega-Mityana road
which was recently added to the project and for which designs are ongoing.

Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.

The key safeguard issues and impacts include: environmental impacts such as stripping of soil,
loss of vegetation due to the creation of borrow pits; soil erosion on road cuts and fills and on
stripped borrow areas; silting of roadside ditches and subsequent sedimentation downstream; soil
and water pollution due to spillage of toxic and hazardous materials; noise, dust and air pollution
created by construction activity impact on human settlement through land take and relocation of
property and business; negative impacts on human social welfare through accidents and the spread
of HIV/AIDS related and other diseases; potential impact on flora and fauna in areas passing
through wetlands, forests, national parks and wilderness.

None of these impacts is however expected to be large scale, significant and irreversible. Most
impacts are localized in relation to the places where construction works are carried out. They are
also limited in time by the length of the construction contracts. All this supposes however that:
firstly effective environmental management plans (EMPs) are put into place to mitigate the
adverse impacts; secondly any project related social displacement is handled through resettlement
plans; thirdly that appropriate support will be drawn as needed from national plans and institutions
in relevant areas such as HIV/AIDS, road safety and environmental standards.


II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.


None are anticipated if EMPs are properly implemented.


II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

None are anticipated.


II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)

Not applicable


II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
Mitigation measures associated with the impacts are addressed in the environmental and social
management plans. The institutional, financial, and contractual arrangements have been articulated
in these plans. In particular, the implementation of an environmental liaison unit within the
MOWHC, the appointment of an environmental specialist in RAFU and the establishment of a
working relationship with relevant parties will contribute to the overall environmental and social
management of the program. Resettlement plans have been drawn up for three of the four roads
in line with the provisions of OP/BP 4.12. Plans for the remaining road Busega-Mityana will be
assessed according to the same criteria and IDA funding will not be released until the finalization
of an accpetable resettlement plan.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
Key stakeholders including NEMA, UWA, RAFU, MOWHC, concerned groups, NGOs and local
communities participated through public consultations, field visits and surveys for the project. In addition, the
Road Safety Study results have been publicly discussed at various seminars including government (traffic
police and hospitals), provate stakeholders and NGOs. Busega- Mityana road which was recently added to the
project, for which designs are ongoing and will be disclosed as one of the conditions of effectiveness.
