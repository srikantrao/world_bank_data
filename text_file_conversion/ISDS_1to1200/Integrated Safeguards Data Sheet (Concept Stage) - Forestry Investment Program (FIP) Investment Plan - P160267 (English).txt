                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The PDO is to develop an investment plan for Zambia's National REDD+ Strategy while also
                           meeting the objectives of the Forestry Investment Program (FIP).
                           C. Project Description
                           The grant would finance the development of a National REDD+ Strategy Investment Plan (IP) for
                           the country. The IP process is Government-owned, led through the ICCS, but will include other
                           ministries and stakeholders as necessary.

                           The grant's objective would be accomplished through analysis of key development plans, policies,
                           strategies, and existing or planned investment operations; identifying financing opportunities for
                           climate action/engagement; providing capacity building to key stakeholders; and through broad
                           consultation with key stakeholders and partners. The IP will lay out a roadmap for Zambia to
                           combine and leverage global climate finance opportunities to support a long term sequence of
                           transformational climate investments, comprising possible additional future FIP and Green Climate
                           Fund (GCF) funds, and other multi- or bi-lateral funds as well as private sector financing.

                           The preparation of a REDD+ investment plan builds on an existing country-led REDD+ planning
                           process which was supported by UN-REDD financing. In other FIP-supported countries, the IP grant
                           has been used to prepare a FIP-specific IP but in this instance the Government of Zambia requested
                           the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and the UN agencies to work together and support the
                           government to develop a general investment plan for the implementation of the REDD+ National
                           Strategy.

                           analysis (if known)
                           The project would take place at a national scale. No safeguard analyses will be carried out. The
                           project funds would only be used to support fine-tuning and consultations of existing national REDD
                           + safeguard instruments.
                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The ICCS does have a full-time safeguards staff person who will lead any work financed by the grant
                           on REDD+ national safeguard approaches and instruments.
