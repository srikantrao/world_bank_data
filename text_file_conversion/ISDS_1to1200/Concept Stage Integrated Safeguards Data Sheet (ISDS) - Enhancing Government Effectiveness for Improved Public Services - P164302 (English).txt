     The project development objective is to improve core government functions for service delivery in priority sectors.


  C. Program Description

 1.        The project development objective is to improve core government functions for service delivery in priority
 sectors. This IPF will provide technical assistance (TA) support for selected parts of the Economic Governance for Service
 Delivery Program (EGSDP) of the government which is also being supported by a PforR. On the one hand, it will include
 three of the EGSDP horizontal reforms: Performance Budgeting; Public Procurement; and Information for Decision Making
 (statistics). On the other hand, it will cover three of the four EGSDP sectors: General (Primary and Secondary) Education,
 Transport Infrastructure, and Financial Sector. The logic of the operation is to combine the horizontal reform across the
 government with addressing bottlenecks related to the specific reform areas in the targeted sectors.
 2.        The five axes of the EGSDP are:
 •     Axis 1: Strengthened performance based, budgeting, procurement and information for decision making.
 •     Axis 2: Improved Management of General Education Resources
 •     Axis 3: Strengthened Financing and Delivery of Essential Health Services
 •     Axis 4: Improved Management and Maintenance of the Road Network
 •     Axis 5: Increased Access to Financial Services

 3.     The proposed IPF will provide TA support related to four of the five axes: (i) Strengthening performance-based
 budgeting and procurement; (ii) improved Management of General Education Resources; (iii) Improved Management of
 the Road Network; and (iv) Increased Access to Financial Services.

 Axis One: Strengthened performance-based budgeting, procurement and information for decision making
 4.      This axis supports horizontal reforms across the government: (i) Performance based budgeting: Improving
 strategic allocation of resource and budget execution through establishing program and multi-annual budgeting; setting
 up of performance indicators; and devolution of commitment authority to line ministries; (ii) Procurement: Leveraging E-
 procurement and contract management for value for money; and (iii) Information: Enhancing the Quality of Core
 Economic and Welfare Statistics for Decision-making and improve data dissemination and use. This project TA will support
 two of these areas, performance budgeting and procurement as summarized below.

        Enhancing Government Effectiveness for Improved Public Services (P164302)


 5.      The proposed project will provide TA to support government implementation of Performance-Based Budgeting.
 Supporting EGSDP objectives, the operation will focus on (i) developing a methodological framework to support key line
 ministries in shifting from inputs to outcomes and putting in place a new performance evaluation system.(ii) implementing
 program budgets, (iii) setting up a comprehensive performance monitoring framework to properly assess the results of
 the public policies and program budgets that will be financing (objectives, key performance indicators, annual projects of
 performances, annual reports on performances) and (iv) strengthening the implementation of a Result Monitoring
 Framework with available M&E information and results/causal chains underlying the Government’s program.
 6.       The project will also support the government to implement a whole of government e-procurement system. The
 system will be expanded over time to all 40 ministries and relevant contracting authorities of government and will facilitate
 the online review of procurement packages from application through the award to contracts. This will enable
 procurement packages to be review electronically and is expected to reduce the approval delays and improve the
 transparency and responsiveness of the review system. The TA support include the beta testing of the ongoing of the
 readiness of the overall system that has been designed by the relevant public procurement bodies, to expedite an effective
 roll out of the system to all 40 ministries.


 Axis Two: Improved Management of funds allocated for primary and secondary schools
 7.       This axis addresses key bottlenecks in an equitable and timely allocation and deployment of funds budgeted
 for primary and secondary to schools. It will focus on two important results: (i) Improving the availability of textbooks;
 and (ii) Enhanced monitoring of utilization of private school finance.
 8.      The proposed TA would support the Ministry of National Education, Technical Education, and Vocational
 Training (MENET-FP) to undertake an audit of the entire textbook supply chain from planning and procurement, to
 production to final delivery to understand the key bottlenecks and dysfunctions in the system, and support the
 implementation of remedial activities and systems with a view to ensuring that at by the end of the project, at least 80%
 of students have necessary textbooks by the beginning of the school year.


 Axis Four: Improved Management and Maintenance of the Road Network
 9.     This axis aims to strengthen the management of the implementation for roads infrastructure across road
 network. This will be achieved by putting in place a transparent and monitorable performance monitoring tool for the
 implementation of works contracts. This should ultimately help to reduce transportation costs for citizens as a well
 maintained and can facilitate easy access for citizens.
 10.     The project will support the government to will put in place a mechanism to evaluate performance to improve
 the planning and contract management of works and maintenance contracts at all stages of contract management during
 implementation road infrastructure. The proposed performance management tool will be available online and will
 monitorable and searchable. It will also include the classifications of works contracts based on their past performance.


 Axis Five: Increased Access to Financial Services
 11.     This axis focusses on three areas of intervention, specifically to: (i) Strengthen financial infrastructure to promote
 financial inclusion and SMEs; (ii) Expand digitization of payments to service providers and tax payers; and (iii) Facilitate
 consumer knowledge of and access to financial services. The proposed TA would support to first and third of these
 interventions.

 12.      This TA will support the strengthening of Côte d’Ivoire’s financial infrastructure (e.g., credit information
 reporting, secured transactions and insolvency) as are these are important for enabling access to credit and accelerating
 economic development. The project will support: (i) the development and equipment of a national credit collateral
 registry; (ii) the digitalization and integration of the RCCM records with the Tribunal de Commerce (TCA) to facilitate
 insolvency resolution; and (iii) the creation of a platform to make credit data available for loan decisions.
 13.      The TA will also support the operationalization of the Financial Services Observatory (l’Observatoire de la
 Qualité des Services Financiers) which has been established by the government. This will include ensuring it has adequate
 capacity to: i) promote the transparency and comparability of financial services and products; ii) manage consumers’
 complaints and provide a mediation mechanism; and iii) promote financial education. Its jurisdiction will extend over
 banks, microfinance institutions, e-money issuers, and insurance companies. It will manage a comparator of key selected
 retail financial services and products to promote transparency and comparability. It will function also as financial
 ombudsman to solve disputes between financial services providers and consumers.
