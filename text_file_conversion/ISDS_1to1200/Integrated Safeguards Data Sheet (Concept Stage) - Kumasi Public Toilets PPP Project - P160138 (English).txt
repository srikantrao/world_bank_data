                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The project development objective is to increase access to clean, convenient and safe public toilets
                           for the population of Kumasi.
                           C. Project Description
                           The project will have two components:

                           Component 1: OBA subsidy to support construction and rehabilitation of public toilets by private
                           operators (US$ 3 million). This component will subsidize the cost of converting 70 public toilet
                           facilities to water closet technology (by means of demolishing the old facilities and building the new
                           ones) and rehabilitation of existing 38 public toilet facilities that use water closet system but require
                           renovation to meet the service standards.

                           Under this component, KMA will contract private operators to convert (demolish old facilities and
                           construct new ones) 70 public toilets to water closets and rehabilitate existing 38 water closets in
                           various parts of Kumasi. The client feels this is a reasonable number of toilets to pilot the PPP
                           arrangement. Based on the pre-feasibility study, it is assumed that the project will be implemented
                           under a BOOT arrangement. KMA will compile site packages (lots) of toilet facilities in urban and
                           residential areas. The facilities in each lot will range from poor residential areas to more affluent
                           urban areas with various levels of customer traffic to ensure fair distribution of lots that combine
                           sites with both high and low revenue potential. The high revenue sites are expected to compensate
                           the low revenue sites through some degree of cross-subsidization, but as overall coverage is needed,

                           operators will not be allowed to bid for individual sites. Bidders will submit business plan proposals
                           for one or several contracts which will include estimates of project cost and the level of subsidy
                           required to build and operate the facilities under the BOOT arrangement. The final selection of
                           private operators will be made by KMA, and is likely to be based on an assessment of value for
                           money, such as lowest bid as calculated by project cost multiplied by percentage subsidy required.
                           The bids will also be assessed for technical feasibility, commercial viability, operator?s experience of
                           similar projects, ability to raise required capital, etc. The technical assistance for structuring and
                           evaluating the PPP process will be provided by IDA-supported PPP Project. The screening criteria
                           and project implementation support arrangements will be finalized during project preparation.

                           Component 2: Independent Verification (US$ 200,000). This component will support the
                           establishment of baseline and targets for private operators applying for OBA grants. The IVA will
                           assist in the setting of output targets; conduct output verification according to the technical standards
                           specified by KMA, including verifying billing and revenue collection at facilities under operation;
                           prepare output verification reports recommending subsidy payments to operators meeting targets;
                           and analyze socio-economic indicators before and after subproject investments.
                           Under this component, KMA will procure the IVA to verify that the outputs under the project meet
                           the technical standards. The Output Verification Reports (OVRs) prepared by the IVA will represent
                           the basis for disbursement. The OVRs will include information on public toilets design and
                           construction, operation and maintenance that will allow KMA to ensure that the private operators
                           meet the minimum technical specifications and quality service standards.
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                           analysis (if known)
                           The project location is a very urban environment- Kumasi- which is one of the largest towns in
                           Ghana, after Accra. In this setting, there are no forests and unlikely to be any natural habitats.

                           E. Borrowerâ€™s Institutional Capacity for Safeguard Policies
                           The borrower's capacity to implement safeguards remains low and although EPA exists at the
                           regional levels and certainly in Kumasi, they normally do not participate directly in projects due to
                           their work-load and mandate. The PIU for the project will therefore recruit an environment and
                           social specialist whose terms of reference would be to i) ensure that any environmental and social
                           clauses and specifications are put in the bidding documents for contractors; ii) ensure that the EMPs
                           and RAPs are completed (and in some cases implemented) prior to appraisal. iii) provide capacity
                           building/training to the contractors to ensure they are well aware of the safeguards requirements of
                           the project and have the relevant expertise to monitor safeguards during all phases of the
                           construction; iv) supervise the work of the contractors with enough regularity to ensure that any
                           negative impacts are mitigated appropriately and in a timely fashion; v) Monitor and report on all
                           environmental and social issues to the Bank and the Ministry in a timely manner to ensure that the
                           appropriate mitigation measures are put in place as quickly as possible.
