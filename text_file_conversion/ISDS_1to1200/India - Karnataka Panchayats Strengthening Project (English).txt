A.2. Project Objectives 
 
The project’s development objective is to improve the capacity of rural governments to manage 
public resources for the benefit of the rural poor. This would be accomplished through a two 
pronged approach:  
 
(i) 
Capacity building at the level of the state, the gram panchayats, and constituents 
 
·
At the state
level, increase the capacity to manage the process of decentralization and 
monitor local governments.   
·
At the gram panchayat
level, improve the process of planning, budgeting and 
expenditure management, information systems, and participatory and consultative 
decision making. 
·
At the community
level, support public education and capacity building to build 
awareness and confidence at the community level and capacity to effectively 
participate in planning and budgeting. 
 
(ii) 
Untied grants to Gram Panchayats 
 
A.3. Project Description 
 
The proposed instrument is a programmatic loan in the form of a Sector Investment Credit (SIC) 
through which IDA would pool funds with the state government. The SIC would finance a time, 
expenditure and geographical slice of the GoK’s program.  IDA would rely on GoKs own rules 
and procedures to implement the program including for financial management, reporting and 
auditing.  Special provisions on environmental safeguards would be introduced until an 
Environmental Framework for Panchayats is put in place as one of the outputs of the proposed 
operation. 
 
Page  2
The project components would be: 
 
(A) Untied grants to Gram Panchayats
.
The project would finance block grants to Gram 
Panchayats.  The To be eligible for the grants GPs would have to put in place the new 
Financial Management and Accounting System prepared by the state, implement the new 
planning guidelines, and hold regular Gram Sabha meetings with open participation.  All 
the Gram Panchayats would be eligible for the block grants.  These would be disbursed 
according to a formula taking into account area (a proxy for costs of service provision) of 
the Gram Panchayat, population (a proxy for needs), proportion of scheduled caste and 
scheduled tribe population (a proxy for poverty), and own revenue effort  
 
(B) Information Systems for Constituents.  
This component would increase the ability of 
rural people to voice their demands on local governments and elicit responses from them, 
in particular for the poorest and excluded people such as women, scheduled castes and 
scheduled tribes.  Karnataka has a large number of community organizations such as 
women self help groups, watershed associations, drinking water committees, and others.  
The component would build on this strength by providing further support to such groups 
or by assisting new groups to be formed.  Specifically it would include: 
 
·
Mobile units to train and inform constituents on roles and responsibilities of GPs;  
·
Information on service delivery performance at the village level; and 
·
Capacity building of organizations of the poor (SHGs, CBOs, NGOs) to enable them 
to participate in the new 
Panchayat 
planning process, voice their demands from 
government, and access services and programs, including GoI anti-poverty programs.  
(C) Building the capacity of 
Panchayats
.
This component would increase the capacity of all 
three levels of Panchayats in managing resources, collecting revenues and delivering 
services.  In total about 5500 local governments and 100,000 elected representatives 
would benefit.  Specifically it would include:  
 
·
Creation of GP resource cells at the Taluk level  
The resource cells would be staffed 
with at least three experts: chartered accountant, junior engineer, and social 
mobilization.  Where not yet in place, these would be recruited from government or 
outsourced.  Their role would be to assist GPs on demand, namely on participatory 
planning and budgeting as per new state guidelines, financial management, and 
technical aspects of infrastructure projects.  These cells would also assist GPs in 
implementing GoI centrally sponsored anti-poverty schemes, state anti-poverty and 
vulnerable group schemes, and with the management of the environmental 
framework for GPs.  
·
Service delivery monitoring system.  
This activity would support the Planning Unit of 
District Panchayats in administering an annual survey of service delivery standards at 
the GP level.  The survey would be done by the GP under guidance and supervision 
from the District and would monitor service delivery issues and outcomes including 
health profile of the population, HIV incidence, student and teacher attendance, 
drinking water and sanitation coverage, and others.   
·
Training programs for Panchayats  through the State Institute of Rural Development. 
These activities would consist of distance and face-to-face learning for Panchayat 
members and staff, MLAs and line agency functionaries at the Panchayat level.  
Topics to be covered would include duties and responsibilities of Panchayats, legal 
matters, financial management, planning, consultative decision
-
making, education, 
Page  3
health, HIV, environment, watershed management, water and sanitation, and others.  
 
·
Computerized financial management system for GPs.
 These activities would help 
implement many of the recommendations of the State Public Financial 
Accountability Assessment (SFAA), namely by putting in place a new financial 
management system (accounting, reporting, auditing) for GPs; this would also 
include computerization of all GPs and development of relevant software, and IT 
training.   
·
Environmental framework for Panchayats.
 
This activity would consist of the design 
and implementation of an environmental framework for the three tiers of rural local 
governments, environmental audits, and district environment profiles to support 
district planning.  
 
(D) Building the capacity of the state
.
This activity would put in place systems at the state 
level to enable it to oversee, facilitate and manage the Panchayat system.  Specifically it 
would include:   
 
·
Decentralization Analysis Cell (DAC). 
A
cell would be created in the Finance 
Department to release funds to GPs, monitor fiscal flows, own revenues and service 
delivery, carry out policy analysis including design of formulas for transfers, advise 
the state on fiscal matters pertaining to 
Panchayats
 and; support State Finance 
Commissions when these are operating.   
·
Panchayat monitoring system at state level
.
This activity would put in place a 
comprehensive system for collecting and compiling 
Panchayat 
fiscal and service 
delivery data.   
·
Policy support
.
Special studies and technical assistance on matters such as own 
revenues, expenditure assignments, service delivery, etc. 
·
Strengthening of the State Institute for Rural Development
.
This activity would 
finance equipment for the ANSSIRD campus in Mysore and the creation of 
ANSSIRD training centers at the 
taluk 
level equipped with audio-visuals;
 
·
Restructuring of line agencies.  
This component would provide technical assistance 
to state line agencies for their institutional restructuring towards new roles in a 
decentralized service delivery framework. 
 
Potential risks and mitigation:  
 
The main risk is political opposition to changing transfers and consolidating schemes towards a 
more equalizing, transparent and monitorable system.  This risk is mitigated by targeting reforms 
first towards GP grants that are given equally to each GP rather than towards schemes that serve 
primarily political interests.  A second risk is quick turnaround of local government and state staff 
that would limit the impacts of capacity building programs.  This risk would me mitigated by 
obtaining up front agreements from state and local governments regarding staff permanence.  The 
third is a risk of misappropriation and misuse of public funds.  The project would address this 
weakness head-on by giving priority to improving financial management and transparency of 
local governments.  The project could threaten the interests of line agencies, local contractors or 
even local politicians due to a decline in their roles and increased accountability and transparency 
and some opposition from these stakeholders might be expected. 
 
The State of Karnataka has been one of the front runners on decentralization and is currently 
implementing successful capacity building programs for local governments.  It has also shown 
success in promoting women self
-
help groups.  In India Karnataka is also known 
for the higher 
Page  4
than average capacity f its public administration.   
 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis: 
 
Social safeguards 
 
Indigenous Peoples
The project will be active in areas which feature population groups that exhibit characteristics laid 
out in OD 4.20 to identify Indigenous Peoples and hence this policy is triggered. Although these 
populations would be the main beneficiaries of this project being resident in Karnataka’s poorer 
Panchayat districts, a brief section of the PAD would be devoted to addressing some of the 
specific development issues of these populations, which is a requirement of OD 4.20. This section 
would contain a brief development plan to further enhance the participation of such populations 
in the project.  
 
The populations which would qualify under OD 4.20 would include all Scheduled Tribes as well 
as other groups who fulfill the OD criteria for Indigenous Peoples. Some of these may belong to 
the Scheduled Castes, Other Backward Classes and the Backward Castes. It will also include 
other vulnerable groups who may not fall into any of these Government categories but fulfill the 
criteria of Indigenous Peoples as per OD 4.20.  
 
The main objectives and the principles of OD 4.20 would be achieved in 4 important ways, 3 of 
which have been built into the design of the project (a – c). 
 
(a) The building of financial capacity is across the entire State and will cover all Panchayats, 
including those with populations who qualify as indigenous peoples (IPs). This will enable IPs to 
acquire the financial capacities that were previously the domain of populations that would not 
qualify as IPs.  
 
(b) The main tenets of OD 4.20 will be disseminated as part of the capacity building/ training of 
rural government staff across Karnataka in order that the project would be better able to address 
specific indigenous peoples issues. The project will ensure that the inclusion and participation of 
IPs is upheld at all stages of the project.  
 
(c) The untied grant component of the project will ensure preference of IPs, by virtue of their 
specific vulnerabilities, to participate in the small sub-projects in its decision-making, 
implementation and sharing of benefits.  
 
(d) The Government of Karnataka’s commitment to improving the STs of the State by the passing 
the Panchayat Act in the Legislative Assembly and by implementing special programs targeted at 
the SCs and STs (the Department of Social Welfare) will help further the objectives of the Bank’s 
OD 4.20.  
 
Land contribution 
Many villages may not have sufficient Panchayat-owned lands to carry out sub-projects. Small 
plots of private land may be required for certain small infrastructure sub-projects such as check 
dams, culverts, bore wells, pump houses and drains. These lands may be acquired through 
voluntary donations or purchase, provided they are legally available, litigation free and under the 
legal guidelines of the State of Karnataka. 
Page  5
Social inclusion
The untied grant component of the project will support multiple small investments / sub-projects 
and it is expected that these small investments will ensure the participation and support of 
women, the elderly and the physically challenged by setting aside sums that would be accessed by 
these vulnerable groups. These sub-projects shall further not exclude individuals on the basis of 
caste, tribe, ethnicity, language, religion, marital status or political affiliation.  
 
Forced labor
Children (persons under the age of 14) and bonded workers may not be employed in these sub-
projects. Rather the investments will strive to improve the infrastructural conditions for the 
education of children and adults wherever possible. The District and local Panchayats would be 
responsible for monitoring forced labor in sub-projects.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and 
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
The project is not expected to have any adverse safeguards related impacts. The size of sub-
projects on infrastructure are very small and will be implemented in areas which feature very 
poor and vulnerable groups. All arising impacts are expected to be beneficial to these groups.  
 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in 
the project area. 
 
The project is expected, over the long term, to have an overall positive development impact by 
making the Local Governments efficient in their financial work such as record keeping, 
accounting, etc. Moreover, the process of capacity building will extend to building environment 
and social awareness among the local governments. This knowledge can be expected to be 
disseminated by them among local village populations leading to better environment and social 
management.  
 
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an assessment 
of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
The borrower has shown progress in building overall environment and social safeguards capacity, 
among others, in the Second Karnataka Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project particularly in 
environment assessment and in developing the Indigenous Peoples Development Plan. This 
project will take these capacities forward by integrating these capacities and knowledge among 
local government officials.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
The key stakeholders are the local government officials (elected representatives and government 
appointed officials), the people resident in the Panchayat villages, and the Government of 
Karnataka (particularly the Rural Development and Social Welfare Departments). The project 
will disclose the safeguard policies as part of the capacity building component of the project by 
including them in the content of the training courses that local government officials will 
undertake. The local government officials will be expected to disclose the safeguard policies to 
their constituents prior to disbursing grants for infrastructure development. It is further expected 
that the implementation of these policies in sub-projects would be regularly monitored by the 
District and Local Panchayat Officials.
