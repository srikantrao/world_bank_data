                           The Project's Development Objective (PDO) is to increase access to basic urban infrastructure and
                           services and to mitigate key risk factors of crime and violence in selected communities.
                            3. Project Description
                           The proposed Project aims to support increased access to basic infrastructure and social services that
                           will contribute to improvements in quality of life, and to reduction of risk factors for crime and

                         violence in precarious urban areas within the municipalities that comprise the Mancomunidad Gran
                         Ciudad del Sur (MGCS). The MGCS includes the municipalities of Mixco, AmatitlÃ¡n, Villa Nueva,
                         San Miguel Petapa, Santa Catarina Pinula, and Villa Canales. The Project envisages investing both in

                         'hard' infrastructure upgrades and 'soft' activities that would reduce risk factors to crime and violence,
                         as well as improve quality of services accessible to citizens. The total amount of the Project will be
                         US$45 million, to be implemented over a 6 year period.

                         To achieve the PDO, the Project outlines eligibility criteria to identify the neighborhoods to be
                         targeted by the Project; such criteria includes economic and social indicators, among others. The
                         Project will be implemented in two phases. An inception phase will focus on implementing a pilot
                         sub-project in each municipality and carrying out a comprehensive data gathering exercise that will
                         enhance the ability of the Fondo Social de Solidaridad (FSS) to carry out the Project, in coordination
                         with the MGCS and Ministerio de GobernaciÃ³n (MINGOB). The second or main implementation
                         phase will carry out the additional sub-projects through a demand-driven approach with significant
                         community participation. Eligible neighborhoods will prepare proposals for financing on the basis of
                         community-driven diagnosis to identify infrastructure needs and priorities as well as the main drivers
                         of vulnerability. Proposals to be financed will be selected competitively and further developed with
                         the FSS, MGCS and the relevant municipality to ensure consistency with municipal and regional
                         development plans. The agreed neighborhood proposals - or neighborhood plans - which will
                         include a combination of infrastructure works and social interventions for Project financing will be
                         the main unit of analysis for costing and for safeguards assessment. The list of infrastructure works
                         in each neighborhood plan will be packaged to be procured under one contract to simplify
                         implementation, which should occur with community supervision and monitoring. Social and
                         capacity building interventions would be provided in coordination with the infrastructure works and
                         other agencies and/or ministries.

                         The Project will finance three components:

                         Component 1 : Integrated Package of Small-Scale Urban Infrastructure and Crime & Violence
Public Disclosure Copy




                         Prevention Interventions (US$36 million): This component will finance integrated packages of
                         small-scale infrastructure and crime & violence prevention activities for selected communities.

                         Component 2 : Technical Assistance for Capacity Building (US$4.39 million): This component will
                         finance technical assistance to strengthen institutional capacity of the municipalities, MGCS and the
                         National Government.

                         Component 3 : Support for Project Operations, including Monitoring & Evaluation (US$4.5 million):
                         This component will support program management.
                          4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
                         analysis (if known)
                         The sub-projects will be located in the 6 Municipalities of the MGCS, but the exact locations will not
                         be known at the time of the approval. The Project design includes eligibility criteria for
                         neighborhood participation, and proposals to be financed under Component 1 will be selected during
                         implementation. However, because the Project will focus on rehabilitating infrastructure in poor
                         urban areas, the communities targeted by the Project will likely be characterized by the informal
                         occupation of public land and encroachment of private structures on the right of way of infrastructure
                         subject to rehabilitation. Similarly there are risks of potential environmental and social impacts
                         related to location of targeted neighborhoods in areas that can be prone to natural disasters

                            1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify
Public Disclosure Copy




                              and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
                              The sub-projects to be supported under this Project will have a small physical footprint and no
                              significant environmental negative impacts are anticipated. However, the zones of intervention are
                              characterized by densely populated informal settlements, with potentially structures occupying the
                              right of way to be used for linear infrastructure. It is also possible that the some sub-projects (e.g.
                              community centers) may require the purchase or donation of land. Similarly, although the zones of
                              intervention are highly urbanized, there is one indigenous community that has been incorporated
                              into the urban space of the municipality of Mixco, where traditional authorities continue to
                              operate. Given the small scale of these impacts, and the demand driven nature of the project, no
                              large scale, significant or irreversible impacts are anticipated. The appropriate prevention,
                              mitigation and/or compensation measures will nevertheless be put in place through the specific
                              Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) or related instruments developed as part of the ESMF
                              implementation, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs), and Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs) at the
                              level of sub-projects as needed.
                            2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities
                              in the project area:
                              Given the small physical footprint of the sub-projects and activities to be financed, and the
                              demand driven approach taken by the Project, there are no significant indirect or long term
                              negative impacts anticipated.

                         3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
                           impacts.
                           Project alternatives will be considered during the evaluation of sub-projects at implementation

                         4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
                           assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
                           The implementing agency FSS has prepared an ESMF, including environmental management
                           guidelines, resettlement policy guidelines, and participatory planning guidelines, which will also
                           serve as indigenous peoples planning guidelines where necessary (these last guidelines specify
                           adaptations to the planning process in the case of indigenous peoples groups). Overall, the
                           capacity of the FSS to implement these guidelines is limited, and it will be necessary to hire a
                           dedicated Social Specialist and an Environmental Specialist to ensure effective environmental and
                           social management during implementation. During Project preparation, the FSS has been
                           supported by environmental and social specialists from the municipalities that are part of the
                           MGCS. Training and capacity building workshops will be organized as part of Component 3 of the
                           Project to ensure the MGCS' understanding of the application of the safeguards instruments. At the
                           municipal level, implementation capacity is mixed, with the larger municipalities - Villa Nueva
                           and Mixco - having a large environment and community development team, and a well-developed
                           network of community participation councils (known as COCODES). However, some of the
                           smaller municipalities will not have access to sufficient staff, so the Environment and Social
                           Specialists of the FSS will provide additional guidance and support to these municipalities as
                           needed during implementation.
                           One issue that municipalities will face is financing constraints to pay for compensation for
                           expropriation and associated resettlement costs. Therefore, it will be necessary to use funds from
                           the Project to cover these costs. This has been incorporated into the Project design.
                         5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure
                           on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

                           Key stakeholders include the MGCS, its six member municipalities, the beneficiary community
                           organizations, as well as the MARN as the environmental authority. Current mechanisms for
                           consultation include Municipal Development Councils (COMUDES) which include
                           representatives of community and civil society organizations, as well as Community Development
                           Councils (COCODES). Safeguards instruments were disclosed in a multi-stakeholder workshop at
                           the local level. During the consultation workshop, participants asked questions about the process
                           of eligibility and selection of communities and sub-projects, as well as the timing of
                           implementation. No comments/questions that required changes in the ESMF and its Guidelines
                           were made. Participants included representatives of COCODES from the six member
                           Municipalities.
