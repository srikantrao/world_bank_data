                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The overall project development objective of the proposed project is to ensure the successful implementation and
                           completion of the ICP activities in the Western Asia region, and to further institute the ICP as a permanent element in
                           the regional and national statistical programs, as per the UNSC recommendation. Furthermore, the project aims at
                           enhancing statistical capacity of NSOs of countries in the Western Asia region, especially in economic statistics. These
                           steps will, in turn, advance the statistical foundation for measuring sustainable development and supporting evidence-
                           based policymaking.

                           C. Project Description
                           To achieve the proposed objectives, the project includes components and activities described below.

                           synergies between ICP processes and ongoing CPI survey activities; (iv) compiling HCPIs; and (v) promoting
                           the uses of PPPs and sub-national indices.

                           Technical assistance missions for the production of sub-national PPPs

                           This component will include technical assistance missions for the computation of sub-national PPPs.

                           Interim progress reports will be prepared on a semi-annual basis, highlighting the progress made in the
                           different activities conducted during the course of the project.

                           A final report (publication) for PPP results

                           At the end of the activity cycle and after endorsement of the final results, a report illustrating the results of
                           the corresponding ICP cycle in Western Asia will be published.
