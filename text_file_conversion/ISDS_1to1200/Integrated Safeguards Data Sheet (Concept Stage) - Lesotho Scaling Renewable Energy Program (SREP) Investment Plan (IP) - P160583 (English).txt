                           The proposed development objective is to support the Government of Lesotho to prepare a renewable
                           energy investment plan for consideration by the SREP for funding.
                           C. Project Description

                           consideration by the SREP for funding. The plan should be comprehensive, clear and effective in
                           demonstrating how SREP resources and other donor and private sector financing would be used in
                           Lesotho to overcome current obstacles to the wider penetration of renewable energy.
                           The project will include two phases. Phase I will assess the potential and costs of applicable
                           renewable energy technologies, prioritize potential interventions and facilitate discussions of these
                           results with stakeholders. Based on the outcomes of Phase I, Phase II will develop the draft
                           investment plan in for the prioritized renewable energy investments that can be undertaken.
