I.A.2.  Project Objectives (From PDS):
The project is the second of three proposed operations requested by
 the Government to support implementation 
of the Government’s 2003
-
2006 Hard Coal Sector Reform Program. The 2003
-
2006 Program, which follows on 
from the previous 1998
-
2002 Hard Coal Sector Reform Program, will continue the process of restructuring the 
Pol
ish hard coal sector so that the sector becomes profitable and is privatized,  environmental performance is 
improved and the negative social impacts of  restructuring are mitigated.
The Hard Coal Mine Closure Loan will directly support physical mine closu
re and reclamation expenditures 
and is a companion project to the US$200 million Poland Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan, which will 
provide support for workers leaving the industry and which is expected for Board presentation in 3QFY2004. 
I.A.3. Projec
t Description (From PDS):
It is expected that the project will help finance about 54% of the mine liquidation and post liquidation activities 
(including land reclamation and dewatering) of the Mine Restructuring Company (SRK) and its Subsidiary 
Bytom SRK 
(BSRK) as part of the Government’s 2003 
–
 2006 Hard Coal Sector Reform Program.  This would 
involve a minimum of three new mine closures over and above previous closures. 
The main features of the 2003
-
2006 Program are as follows:
Page  2
o
Restructuring of the se
ctor by consolidating the 5 weakest coal holding companies into one company 
(Kompanie Weglowa, or Polish Coal Company) with financial and physical restructuring to support 
efficiency improvements and then privatization by the end of the Program
o
Termination
 of  about 7.8
-
14million tpy of production and decommissioning and rehabilitation of 
associated mine sites 
o
Employment restructuring to reduce employment by about 19,500
-
25,500 workers from 2003 to 2006
o
Financial restructuring of coal industry public debt
o
Initiation of privatization of the coal industry by the end of the Program (December 31, 2006) 
I.A.4. Project Location: (Geographic location, information about the key environmental and social characteristics 
of the area and population likely to be affec
ted, and proximity to any protected areas, or sites or critical natural 
habitats, or any other culturally or socially sensitive areas.)
The Project is located in the Silesia region of Southern Poland. Silesia is highly industrialized with coal fired 
power
 generation, steel and other industry in the region. Total population of the region is about 2 million, the 
majority of whom live in urban, suburban and semi
-
rural settings. The region does not have any unusual or 
unique environmental features.  The coal m
ines are not located near to any protected areas or sites, critical 
natural habitats, or other culturally or socially sensitive areas.   There are 3 coal holding companies in the region 
(operating 37 mines) plus 3 independent mines (for a total of 40 opera
ting mines).  Total industry employment is 
currently about 140,000 people. Over 100,000 workers have left the coal sector in the last 4 years. 
B. Check Environmental Classification: 
B (Partial Assessment)
Comments:
The proposed environmental classifica
tion for project is Category B (Partial Assessment).  This category is 
proposed on the basis that the main environmental risks associated with the project are: (i) possible failure to 
decommission the mines or parts of mines in an environmentally acceptabl
e manner; and (ii) possible failure to 
deal with subsidence issues in a satisfactory and timely manner.  These risks are considered to be well known, 
modest and manageable as discussed below. 
Restructuring of the Hard Coal Sector commenced in 1998 and was
 supported by two Bank loans, the two 
tranche  Hard Coal SECAL 1 (approved June 1999 and closed October 2000) for $300 million and the single 
tranche Hard Coal SECAL 2 (approved August 2001 and closed December 2001) for $100 million.  Both 
projects receive
d an environmental classification of B. 
A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (SEA) was prepared under SECAL 1 which included mine specific 
environmental action plans for each operating mine. SECAL 2 included a commitment by the Government to 
undertake thre
e additional environmental studies in support of the SEA relating to (i) subsidence;  (ii) saline 
water discharge;  and (iii) compliance with environmental requirements.
SECALs 1 and 2 supported implementation of  the 1998 
–
 2002 Hard Coal Reform Program w
hich involved 
expenditures by the government and the mining companies for closing mines and reducing production, 
mitigating past environmental impacts and improving present environmental performance.  
While the 1998
-
2002 Program as approved by the Governm
ent largely involved mine closures and social 
mitigation, improving coal industry environmental performance was a key objective under both of the Bank 
projects. Specifically, these projects included conditions requiring that a Sector Environmental Assessme
nt 
(SEA) was undertaken and actions were implemented to improve environmental performance. 
The main environmental impacts identified in the SEA were from: saline water discharge into the local river 
system; surface disposal of waste from the mines; coal w
ashing plants; and ground subsidence in certain areas 
from underground mining and methane release from some mines.  
Page  3
Based on the findings of the SEA,  Environmental Action Plans were prepared for each operating mine and were 
included in the company operat
ing plans.  During the period of the two SECALs the main environmental 
improvements were that salt content of waste water from the mines was reduced by about 30% and surface 
disposal of solid wastes was reduced  by about 25%.
The physical closure and recla
mation work under the new project is a continuation of the work started under 
SECALs 1 and 2 and the Bank is familiar with the risks involved. 
The main environmental risks for the project 
relate to (a) possible failure to decommission and rehabilitate the 
mine sites properly;  and (b) failure to address 
the subsidence issue in a satisfactory manner, especially in the case of mines which operate under urban areas.  
These risks, which are the same as under SECALs 1 and 2  are considered fully manageable.   
W
ith regard to mitigating the first risk, in accordance with the procedures for an environmental B category 
project, an environmental management plan has been prepared and reviewed by the Bank for the first two mines 
that will be closed by SRK under the pro
ject (namely Katowice Kleofas and Bytom II).  In addition, an 
Environmental Framework has been prepared that will govern the closure of other whole mines and the 
completion of mines already under closure by SRK and BSRK. The closure of additional whole min
es will be 
carried out  by the Mine Restructuring Company (SRK) which was responsible for mine closure under SECAL1 
and SECAL2 and has a demonstrated, reliable capability in this regard.  With regard to mitigation of the second 
risk, the observed impacts o
f subsidence in the region are relatively modest, generally being limited to minor 
damage, such as cracks in walls of apartment buildings that are subsequently repaired by the coal company 
responsible for the damage.  The government will provide assurance 
that subsidence activities of SRK and 
BSRK will be funded in line wit their 2004
-
2006 plans and an annual progress report will be prepared. 
The project will also include continued implementation of environmental improvements at operating mines and 
will s
upport actions to improve coal industry environmental performance in accordance with the findings of the 
three studies initiated under SECAL2 . The Reform Program specifies that all the mines/mining companies will 
be under privatization by the time that th
e Program is completed in 2006.  This creates a potential longer term 
risk that private owners may not operate in an environmentally responsible manner.  Under the first two 
SECALs, it was determined that Government has good capabilities to monitor the env
ironmental performance of 
mining companies and enforce environmental regulations with the exception that the coal mining companies 
(which are all presently state
-
owned and cash
-
starved) have only been paying part of their environmental fees 
and fines. Whil
e privatization is much more a matter for the third proposed project (which will support 
completion of the Program),  under this project the Government will be asked to appoint privatization advisors 
for the largest company (Kompania Weglowa, KW). Privatiz
ation advisors for the two other large companies 
(KWH and JSW) will be appointed as part of the previously approved HCSM operation.

 Key Safe
guard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available, 
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.
II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associat
ed with the proposed project. Identify and describe 
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
Following is an assessment of the applicability of the Bank’s safeguard policies

 
Environmental Assessment 
–
 the project supports phy
sical mine closure activity and this safeguard policy is 
applicable 

 
Natural Habitats 
-
The hard coal industry is located in Silesia, a relatively well developed, industrialized and 
urbanized region of Poland and the project does not impact natural habit
ats.

 
Forestry 
-
the project does not impact forestry so this safeguard policy is not applicable 

 
Pest Management 
–
 this is a coal mining restructuring project and there are no pest management issues, 
so 
this safeguard policy is not applicable

 
Cultura
l Property 
-
there are no cultural property issues so this safeguard policy is not applicable

 
Indigenous Peoples 
-
there are no indigenous peoples involved so this safeguard policy is not applicable 

 
Involuntary Resettlement 
-
Mines are being closed no
t opened so there are no resettlement issues.(either 
involuntary or voluntary) so this safeguard policy is not applicable

 
Safety of Dams 
-
 t
he coal mining involved is underground and there are no waste rock or tailings dams so 
this 
safeguard policy is n
ot applicable

 
Projects in International Waterways 
–
there are no international waterways involved so this safeguard policy 
is not applicable

 
Projects in Disputed Areas 
-
the project is not in a disputed area so this safeguard policy is not applicable
With regard to the applicability of the Environmental Assessment Safeguard Policy, as discussed in the 
previous section, the main environmental issues for the project relates to sound mine decommissioning and 
mine site reclamation.  This involves sealing u
nderground mine workings, demolishing surface plants and 
removing reusable equipment; rehabilitating mine sites and waste disposal areas, and ensuring that no future 
subsidence will occur and that any present subsidence had been properly mitigated. Because
 all mines are 
underground mines, mine sites and ancillary facilities and infrastructure such as waste dumps are quite small 
and impacts are localized. 
The environmental issues at the mines or parts of mines to be closed can be identified because under t
he first 
two SECALs Environmental Action Plans (EAPs) have been prepared for each of the mines to be closed, as 
well as for the mines that remain in operation.     Mine closures were undertaken properly under SECALs 1 and 
2 and there are no new issues or c
ircumstances to be dealt with.  Implementation of the environmental action 
plans started under SECAL1 and was continued under SECAL2.  The project will support continued 
implementation of these Environmental Action Plans.  
The project has no large scale,
 significant or irreversible major negative environmental impacts.  To the 
contrary the project will support clean up of past environmental liabilities through the environmentally 
responsible decommissioning and rehabilitation of closed mine sites.  The pr
oject will also include continued 
implementation of environmental improvements at operating mines.  
Page  5
To the extent that there is a major risk, it relates to social issues.   There is a significant change for the new 
2003
-
2006 Program (which this project s
upports) compared to the previous 1998
-
2002 program (which 
SECALs 1 and 2 supported) in that the additional proposed mine closures and redundancies must take place at a 
time when the national and regional unemployment rates are now about 20% compared with 
about 6% when the 
program started in 1998. 
This risk is well recognized by both the Government in preparing the Program and the Bank team and are being 
addressed under the companion HCSM loan that was approved on March 30, 2004.  Approval of the HCSM 
loa
n would be a precondition for approval of the HCMC loan.  Both the Program and the HCSM project each 
place a very strong focus on designing and implementing social mitigation actions to support workers who are 
being made redundant in the present difficult 
labor market situation. In addition, structural reforms to help 
realize increased economic growth and higher employment are at the heart of the recommended economic 
measures and proposed Bank activities in the recently approved November 2002 Country Assist
ance Strategy.
II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or due 
to multiple project component. 
Not applicable.
II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future act
ivities in the project area.
Decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines in the project area are expected to lead to improvements in the 
natural environment. Future land use is uncertain but could include new business and light industrial 
development and 
any land use planning activity would require due attention to environmental aspects. The 
Government of Poland is fully cognizant of these aspects.  
II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
There are considere
d to be no alternatives to closing excess coal mine capacity. Keeping excess capacity open 
would involve large operating subsidies which the Government is not prepared to pay and which the Bank would 
strongly discourage.
II.D.3. Describe arrangement for 
the borrower to address safeguard issues
The borrower has addressed safeguard issues and taken actions to minimize and mitigate potentially adverse 
impacts, not only of the project, but also of the overall industry through environmental management plans 
d
eveloped under SECALs 1 and 2, as described above. The borrower will continue to adhere to these 
commitments under the current project. Three environmental studies that began under SECAL2 have since been 
completed and will influence the overall program. 
II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard 
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.
The major stakeholders under the projects include national Government, mining compan
ies, trade unions, 
employees and their families, and local and regional Governments.  The potentially affected people are (i) 
mineworkers who will be made redundant and their families; and (ii) communities impacted by subsidence.
Page  6
NGOs, local government of
ficials and community representatives have been informed of the Bank's activities 
through various informal meetings and consultations throughout the Banks support of the restructuring program 
(in SECALs 1 and 2). The Bank conducted a detailed survey of sta
keholders and a workshop with all key 
stakeholders to discuss the results of SECAL 2. The surveys and workshop results are shown in the ICR.  
Environmental improvement were noted as one of the successes of the project.  Consultation with stakeholders 
is on
going. A meeting with local NGOs was held in Katowice in January 2003 and a half day consultation 
workshop was held in Katowice in May 2003.  Further consultations will be held throughout project.
The ICR for SECAL2 is a public document and other material
s will be prepared and released in accordance 
with the Bank's disclosure policy
