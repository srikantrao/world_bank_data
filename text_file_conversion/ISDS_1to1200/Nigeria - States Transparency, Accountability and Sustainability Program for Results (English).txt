2. Project Objectives:
The Program development objective (PDO) is to strengthen the fiscal transparency, accountability
and sustainability in Nigerian states participating in the Program.

3. Project Description:
The Program will support the full and sustained implementation of a strategic subset of reforms
from the Government of Nigeria programs of the Fiscal Sustainability Plan (FSP) and the Open
Government Partnership (OGP) that are implemented at the state-level. The selected reforms are
considered the most critical and impactful for contributing to the achievement of the development
objectives of the Program. The selected reforms form the basis of the eligibility criteria, the
disbursement linked indicators (DLIs) and disbursement-linked results (DLRs) of the Program for
Results.

4. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard analysis:
The Program and its technical assistance component (TA) are open, ex-ante, to all 36 states in
Nigeria, as the FSP and OGP set of reforms are relevant to all States, as fiscal management and
performance are weak across the board, and all States still face considerable fiscal pressures.

II. Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and
describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts:
In terms of environmental risks, the activities planned under the proposed Technical Assistance
(TA) component of the Program do not include any physical interventions, such as construction,
rehabilitation or renovation works. Hence, these activities are environmentally benign and will not
cause any negative environmental effects, any loss or conversion of natural habitats, any changes
in land or resource use, or any environmental pollution. Therefore, the TA poses no risk to the
environment because of planned project activities.
The social management assessment carried out during the Program preparation shows that the TA
operates within an adequate legal and regulatory framework which is well suited to address
potential social issues that may arise from implementation of planned activities (although none are
being envisaged at the time of the assessment). Given that the capacity and incentives to address
potential social issues vary across the departments that will be involved in the implementation of
Program, such gaps will be addressed through various trainings, as earmarked in the PAP.
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long-term impacts due to anticipated future activities in
the project area:
The TA could potentially bring about positive, indirect environmental benefits through improved
governance and related capacity, i.e. greater transparency or results-based management. Further,
it is expected to emphasize citizen engagement as an overarching strategy for Government’s core
and complementary programs. Openness of budget process entails citizens’ inputs from public
consultations are reflected in the pre-budget statements. Citizen engagement increases local
ownership, enables greater information sharing and transparency, and should be the basis of
beneficiary engagement and trust building. However, citizen engagement needs to be supported
by institutional capacity and a vision. The project would require dedicated staff to oversee the
social mobilization process and incorporate social concerns in all operational and M&E processes
and manuals.
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse
impacts:
No significant safeguards risks are expected to arise from this operation. Instead, the Program will
seek to enhance public accountability and transparency of the fiscal sector. The TA, expenditure
framework boundary and the supported Program boundary have no impact on capital spending,
since recurrent costs of State Governments will constitute the core of expenditures to be financed.
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described:

5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on
safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people:
