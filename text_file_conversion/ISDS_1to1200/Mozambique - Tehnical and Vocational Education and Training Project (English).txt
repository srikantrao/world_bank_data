B.  Project Objectives [from section 2 of PCN] 
 
The development objective of the APL is creation of a sustainable TVET system capable of 
providing TVET graduates with employable skills and responsive to the needs of the economy. 
This will be achieved by system integration and institutional development, introduction of new 
financing mechanisms that promote fiscal sustainability and efficiency, improvements in quality 
and expansion of access and equity. Success will be measured by increased employability and 
incomes of TVET graduates, decreased scarcity of appropriately qualified workers and 
productivity gains in targeted sectors/sub-sectors of the economy. 
 
During the first five years (Phase I) the project will result in increased availability of TVET  
graduates with relevant skills in selected pilot sectors
C.  Project Description [from section 3 of PCN] 
 
The project will support the GoM in designing, institutionalizing and, on a pilot basis, 
implementing the envisaged TVET system reform. Major elements of this reform will include 
stakeholder and employers involvement in the planning, implementation and delivery of training 
(pre-employment and on-the-job),  re-shaping TVET from a supply- into a demand-driven 
Page  2
system, development of an occupational standard (outcome-) based TVET system, strengthening 
private investment in training, increasing efficiency and effectiveness of training through quality 
improvements, better coordination and targeting of training programs, and the development of a 
sustainable financing framework that will target both publicly and privately provided TVET 
programs. The proposed IDA Credit will fund parts of the Integrated TVET Reform Program 
currently under preparation. Expected components and sub-component are:  
 
A: Establishment of an appropriate institutional and financial framework.
Sub-components 
include (A1) Establishment of a National Training Council (governing board) and National 
Training Authority (implementation agency); (A2) Establishment of a sustainable TVET 
financing framework and (A3) Set-up of an appropriate labor market observatory. Successful 
implementation of this sub-component, in particular the set-up of the governance and financial 
systems, is key to the success of the entire project and overall APL. Regarding sub-component 
A3, it needs to be considered that labor market observatories are proven difficult to implement in 
Africa, and that simple, adjustable and decentralized tools (institution based) need to be defined.  
 
B: Establishment of a standard-based TVET system
,
with the sub-components (B1) Development 
of occupational standards; (B2) Curriculum development; and (B3) Development of a standard-
based assessment and certification system. 
 
C: Improvement of quality of TVET,
comprising the sub-components (C1) Teachers/instructors 
training and other necessary human resource development at training provider level (including 
HIV/AIDS prevention and work place/mitigation programs); (C2) Provision of appropriate 
learning materials; (C3) Improvement of physical infrastructure and provision of equipment; 
(C4) Development of an accreditation system for training providers; and (C5) Establishment of 
career guidance and student services.  
 
Activities under Components B and C will be undertaken in one or more selected pilot economic 
sector(s) to be defined prior to the fielding of the preparation mission. Agreed criteria for the 
sector selection include growth and development potential of the sector (including gender equity 
concerns and poverty reduction potential), proven skills shortage, sector organization and 
demonstrated interest to participate in the pilots, and a diversified training provider spectrum.  
 
D: Increase access and equity
:
It is envisaged that the IDA Credit will facilitate the establishment 
of a Skills Development Fund, accessible on a competitive basis to public and non-public 
training providers, to (partly) fund new, demand-responsive and innovative training initiatives 
according to specified criteria and priorities. In order to assist with the definition of criteria, 
GoM and stakeholders have agreed to analyze and possibly redefine the current landscape of 
TVET demand and supply, to identify investment priorities of the public sector and to define 
more clearly the specific roles of different public and private TVET sub-sectors in the TVET 
system. First r
esults of this ‘landscaping’ exercise, to be spearheaded by the recently established 
Technical Working Committee for the TVET reform, are expected to be available prior to the 
preparation mission.  
 
The Integrated TVET Reform Program, which will be supported through the IDA Credit, has a 
long-term horizon. To ensure sustainability substantial institution building, system development 
Page  3
and human resource development is required that cannot be finalized within a period of five 
years. During the first years of implementation, the Reform Program is expected to concentrate 
on institution building and pilot activities, which will be scaled up gradually. Against this 
background, an Adjustable Program Lending (APL) with a 15 years perspective appears to be the 
appropriate funding instrument, divided into three phases of five years each. Suitable and 
measurable triggers to enter from one into the next phase will be identified during the 
preparation mission. The estimated IDA disbursement for the first phase of about US$20m 
represents an estimated ___ of the total resource envelope of the Integrated TVET Reform 
Program.  
 
The Technical Working Committee (TWC), to be formed on the basis of the 
Memorando de 
Entendimento
 of July 2004, will have the responsibility of coordinating and supervising project 
preparation activities.  The TWC will be responsible for assembling multi-discipline Joint 
Technical Teams (JTTs) to develop the technical and operational details of the Program. The will 
also carry out the functions of a National Training Council on a temporary basis until the 
appropriate institutional arrangements are established. In order to ensure continuity between the 
TWC functions and the National Training Council, to be established at a later stage, the TWC 
membership selection criteria will take this into consideration.  The TWC will be assisted by a 
full-time Secretariat to be funded under the PHRD Grant Fund.
