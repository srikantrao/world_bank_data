A.2. Program and Project Objectives 
The proposed program consists of a two phase APL, to be implemented over seven years 
(mid-2005-mid-2012). Phase I of the program
(mid 2005-mid 2008) supports the program 
overall objective by implementing priority investments required within 3 years to: (a) 
maintain and increase electricity supply and reliability of the services needed by the 
economy and the population; and (b) reduce the generation and the 
transmission/distribution costs; and (c) support GOS actions to improve competitiveness 
in the petroleum sector. It also supports long term objectives of improving the energy 
sector performance by assisting Senegal in: (a) contracting out a private sector strategic 
partner for SENELEC, (b) building capacity in the key energy institutions; and by (c) 
preparing the next phase of investments in the electricity and petroleum sub-sectors to be 
made by private and public sector entities. 
 
Phase II the program
(mid 2008-mid 2012) will continue supporting the required increase 
in cost-effective and reliable generation capacity and the development of the transmission 
and distribution facilities. It will focus particularly on increasing access to electricity 
services in the urban and peri-urban areas of Senegal. 
 
The proposed project (IDA Credit and PRG) covers an initial part of the first phase of the 
program
.
Its development objectives are to: (a) maintain and increase the electricity 
supply and the reliability of the services; (b) reduce the costs of the electricity services; 
and (c) enhance the performance of key energy sector institutions. 
A.3. Project Description 
Project Components 
 
The proposed project comprises two main parts: Part A
focuses on priority activities that 
will allow SENELEC commission new generation facilities through an Independent 
Power Procurer (IPP to be sited at Kounoune, just outside Dakar), rehabilitate critical 
sections of the transmission and distribution system, and reduce costs. It also supports 
GOS and SENELEC in preparing the next phase of investment in the electricity sector. 
Excluding contingencies, the proposed IDA contribution for this Part A is estimated to be 
US$[10.8 million] through a Credit, and  $[10   ] million through a PRG . IFC also 
participates in the financing of the generation component at Kounoune. Part B
:
would 
provide financial resources to support GOS efforts to strengthen the institutions, select a 
strategic partner for SENELEC, and for communication and monitoring and evaluation  
of project implementation. Excluding contingencies, IDA contribution for this Part B is 
estimated to be US$[1 ] million through an IDA Credit. 
A.4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis: 
 
The IPP power plant will be located at Kounoune, 23 kms west of Dakar on a 3 hectares 
site currently owned by the Republic of Senegal and to be sold to the project sponsors.  
The site is near three small villages with a total population of about 8,000 persons. An 
Environmental Impact Assessment of the generating plant and a Resettlement Policy 
Framework (RPF) was prepared by consultants hired by SENELEC in January 2004 and 
posted in the Bank’s Infoshop on February 25, 2004. The construction of the power plant 
may require the resettlement of about five houses and of a school. SENELEC has 
Page  3
indicated that it will finance any resettlement and carry it out prior to the beginning of the 
construction. The project sponsors have hired consultants to ascertain the extent of the 
resettlement. Other rehabilitation investments included in the project are located in the 
Dakar region and should not lead to resettlement; they will be however assessed using the 
Environmental Impact Assessment and Social  Management Framework and the RPF 
framework posted to the Infoshop in February 2004.  
 
The petroleum seismic survey extends over the northern part of Senegal from the Gambian border to the 
Senegal river at the Mauritania border. It will consist of approximately 2000 km of 2D seismic recording; 
there will be no resettlement. The Environmental Impact Assessment relative to this activity was released 
to the Public in March 2001.

Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management  
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues
.
D.1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. 
Identify and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts. 
 
New thermal plant at Kounoune.
The Kounoune I IPP heavy fuel oil diesel plant of 67.5 
MW will comply with the guidelines in the Pollution Prevention and Abatement 
Handbook with regard to air emissions, noise and others. The design and the bid technical 
specifications for the new power plant for air, liquid, and solid emissions, noise levels, 
and the type of material used, will meet World Bank environmental guidelines. 
Internationally acceptable waste management practices will apply, as in all World Bank 
financed projects, especially with regard to fuel management. The same is applicable for 
internationally acceptable safety and occupational health standards. A 5 km pipeline 
transporting the heavy fuel oil required by the power generating units will use an existing 
right-of-way for an existing pipeline. The only issues with regard to this pipeline is that 
two houses with gardens are build on this right-of-way, which is a safety issue. This 
needs to be assessed and adequate measures implemented, including assistance with 
relocation. 
 
The utility investment program will implement sound environmental management 
practices with respect to  SENELEC's existing power plants at Cap des Biches and Bel 
Air in compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies and Guidelines. These will 
include the following actions: (a) training of the power plant personnel particularly 
regarding fire risks and security; (b) updating the evacuation plan; (c) preparing a 
coordinated plan with other resources available in Dakar (such as in the Municipality and 
the army); (d)  measuring the quality of processed water released; (e) measuring the air 
emissions and level of particulate matters around the power plant; and (f) improving 
“retention” for the storage of diesel oil and for other hydrocarbon products and residues. 
 
The investment program carries only minor negative environmental impacts with most 
environmental impacts being positive. Two mechanisms have been put in place to 
monitor and evaluate the electricity sector environmental impacts. Regarding the existing 
power plants at Cap des Biches and at Bel Air, an emission monitoring system will be put 
in place to measure air emissions, air quality around the power plant, and the quality of 
water released. With respect to the new power plant at Kounoune supported by the 
project: (a) the IPP Sponsors will maintain files and reports documenting the results of 
the periodic monitoring activities, problems, and actions implemented, the relevant 
personnel and their qualifications, and the analyses of the emissions and discharges. 
These documents will be accessible to the Authorities; and (b) SENELEC will set up a 
Consultation Liaison Group with the population living in the vicinity of the power plant 
to report on the work plan and progress during the construction period, and inform them 
of issues that may arise and consult them on the appropriate mitigation actions. 
 
Seismic Survey.
With respect to the seismic survey to be coordinated by PETROSEN, an 
Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) 
Page  5
were prepared in 2000, approved by the Borrower, which authorized its release for 
circulation in March 2001. A number of protected areas are located within the seismic 
acquisition area, including a Bird Sanctuary and a Biosphere Reserve. Seven classified 
forests and hunting areas are located within the seismic acquisition area.. 
D.2 Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future 
activities in the project area. 
 
The power plant site is near three small villages with a total population of about 8,000 
persons. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) was prepared by SENELEC and its 
consultant in February 2004 and posted in the Bank’s Infoshop on February 25, 2004. A 
school may also be impacted as well as some houses. It is not known at this stage whether 
the construction of the power plant will require any resettlement of population and of the 
school. If resettlement is required a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) will be prepared 
based on the already disclosed RPF. The RAP will be approved by the Bank before 
disclosure and implementation. SENELEC has indicated that it will finance any 
resettlement and carry it out prior to commercial commissioning of the Kounoune I 
power plant.  
D.3. Describe the treatment of alternatives (if relevant) 
N/A 
 
D.4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
 
An EIA has been completed in February 2004 for the Kounoune I IPP power plant. Since 
the detailed engineering is not available neither for the new power plant nor for the 
rehabilitation of existing power facilities, a detailed Environmental Policy Framework 
and Resettlement Policy Framework has been prepared, as well as a Public Consultation 
Plan; plant and specific issues are currently assessed by the Kounoune I IPP sponsors and 
their consultant. There are no new transmission lines needed, because existing 
transmission lines pass already through the selected area: thus no further resettlement 
and/or compensation. From an environmental point of view this is not a sensitive area.  
 
D.5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and 
disclosure on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
 
Consultations were held by SENELEC and their environmental consultant (ERM) in 
December 2003 with the stakeholders living closely to the proposed Kounoune I 
generating plant. The Consultation Plan and the conclusions are included in the EIA for 
the plant and has been disclosed in the Bank’s Infoshops, in the Ministry of Environment, 
and in SENELEC.
