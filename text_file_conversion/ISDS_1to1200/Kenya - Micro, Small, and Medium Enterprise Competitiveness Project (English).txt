A.2. Project Objectives 
The project will facilitate the growth and creation of MSMEs through increased delivery of 
financial and non-financial services to meet the demand of MSMEs, generate employable skills in 
selected sectors, and reduce critical investment climate barriers that constrain MSME growth.   
 
A.3. Project Description 
The project supports the Government program to increase the competitiveness of MSMEs.   The 
project addresses the needs of MSMEs with mutually reinforcing components – access to finance, 
strengthening enterprise skills and market linkages, and improving the investment climate. 
  
Component One – Access to Finance 
Subcomponent A:  Financial Sector Deepening (IDA US$4.5 mm
) 
This component is aimed at deepening and expanding the reach of financial services that are 
available to MSMEs.    This will be achieved through the provision of performance based grants 
to assist eligible institutions to build capacity within banks and other financial institutions to 
promote the provision of financial services to the MSME sector.   This component will support 
the following: 
 
a. 
Moving Upmarket
:  Capacity building in existing microfinance institutions (MFIs) currently 
engaged primarily in group lending activities -- development and implementation of a 
technical skills transfer program will be designed primarily to introduce new systems and 
lending methodologies to well performing MFIs to enable them to add individual lending 
products that will facilitate the graduation of successful group-based clients.  The technical 
assistance to be provided will include, but not be limited to provision of staff training, 
design of manuals and operational procedures, provision of software and hardware and MIS.  
b. 
Regional Outreach
:  Capacity building in existing MFIs and NGOs currently engaged in 
lending to the MSME sector but with a regional/provincial focus – technical assistance and 
additional capacity building to leverage their ability to expand lending operations and 
outreach. 
 
c. 
Downscaling at commercial banks
:  Capacity building in commercial financial institutions - 
development and implementation of a technical skills transfer program for selected 
commercial financial institutions that are interested in new s
y
stems and lendin
g
 
Page  3
 
 
methodologies for the MSME market segments.  The technical assistance will be provided, 
on a cost-shared basis to commercial banks that provide strong evidence of a management 
commitment to extend further into the MSME credit market. 
 
Subcomponent B – SME Risk Capital Fund (IDA US$5 mm; IFC/other private investment US$13 
mm) 
 
A huge gap remains between the small portion of the informal economy served by MFIs and the 
narrow portion of the formal economy served by commercial banks and licensed non-bank 
financial institutions.  Despite over 15 years of financial liberalization and reforms in most 
African countries, this gap remains as large as ever – and constitutes a significant barrier to 
achieving the private-led growth strategies which African countries are now endorsing.  Support 
for developing the “missing middle” in financial markets is now critical to enable MSMEs – 
which constitute the bulk of the private sector in most African countries – to fulfill the dual sets 
of expectations being placed upon them:  to accelerate growth through productive investment and 
penetration of export markets;  and to create employment and income opportunities for poverty 
reduction.  
 
Risk capital funding for SMEs in the developing world has suffered from obstacles related to 
limited high-growth potential for equity investors and high costs of processing financing for 
relatively small investment amounts.  In order to introduce a new and much-demanded risk 
capital instrument (mix of debt and equity) tailored for SMEs, IFC and Business Partners Limited 
are forming a joint venture, provisionally called Business Partners International, to manage three 
pilot funds in Kenya, Ghana, and Madagascar.  This pilot approach is an adaptation of a 
methodology which has worked in South Africa and addresses the obstacles above by: (i) 
structuring and pricing investments as self-liquidating instruments that will not necessarily 
require collateral and will not require a major sale to exit; (ii) using low cost and efficient 
processes to assess, structure and monitor investments; and (iii) providing coordinated and highly 
focused technical assistance that must demonstrate an acceptable financial return and a solid 
commercial basis.  The size of the fund is expected to be US$15.0 million with a US$3.0 million 
technical assistance facility.  It is envisaged that IFC, pending IFC Board approval in Spring 
2004, will invest (with other private investors) in the corpus of the fund.  In this subcomponent, 
IDA would fund the technical assistance facility (US$3 mm), as well as partly support the 
development of the fund management team in its initial phases (US$2 mm).
   
 
Component Two – Strengthening Enterprise Skills and Market Linkages 
 
This component integrates a set of complementary and mutually reinforcing activities to support a 
wide range of enterprise needs.  It includes subsector specific business development services 
(BDS), tools for business schools to better train managers, activities to catalyze innovation and 
entrepreneurship, and restructuring of the national levy scheme to ensure sustainability of all 
firm-level training beyond donor financing. 
 
Subcomponent A – Pilot Value Chain Based Integrated BDS Program (IDA US$ 4 mm) 
The objective of this sub-component is to strengthen competitiveness, enhance access to BDS, 
and strengthen linkages (both between firms and from MSMEs to markets).  The core of the 
subcomponent would be a matching grant fund mechanism (administered by a matching grant 
fund manager) which would provide partial financing for eligible training and other business 
support services.  The matching grant fund would be used solely for the purpose of procuring 
‘knowledge-based’ services directed toward improving the competitiveness and performance of 
the various players in each of a number of sub-sectors selected on criteria related both to growth 
potential and to a coherent sub-sector strategy.   Specifically, funds from the matching grant 
could be a
pp
lied towards the 
p
urchase of technical assistance to train su
pp
liers or, at the factor
y
 
Page  4
 
 
level, to procure process specific technical assistance to improve the quality, cost and delivery of 
products.  Access to the Fund would be based on the submission and approval of a value chain 
based business plan.   Business plans would be drafted jointly by representative companies and/or 
industry associations/networks that define their membership  along the entire value chain for each 
sector.  For example, in the case of the cotton-to-apparel supply chain, companies or 
representatives from member-based organizations in the cotton, ginning, spinning/weaving, 
knitting, and apparel would be expected to work together to formulate a joint business plan that 
addresses a number of key sub-sector issues, as well as to develop a comprehensive chain 
strategy.   
 
Subcomponent B – Restructuring of the Industrial Training Levy Scheme (IDA US$0.4 mm)
 
The key objective of this sub-component is to enhance the level and quality of technical training 
and skills development in order to increase labor productivity and competitiveness of the key 
economic sectors.   Kenya has a long-established Industrial Training Levy scheme
 
under which 
employers pay a training levy to a dedicated industrial training fund, but which has so far not 
functioned very effectively or strategically.  The central fund provides matching grants to finance 
training for staff members of participating firms through reimbursement of total or partial 
expenses for approved training programs. Firms that contribute a mandatory levy to the fund (in 
principle, those with more than five workers) have an incentive to train their workers, offsetting 
the tendency to under-invest in training due to labor mobility.  The expectation is that increased 
training of employees at all levels will lead to higher levels of skills and productivity in the labor 
force. This sub-component will consist of three elements: (i) re-engineering of the existing 
industrial training levy scheme based on clearly defined strategic objectives (consistent with the 
national skills strategy) which will be privately managed with a transparent and efficient 
mechanism for approvals and claims (ii) conducting a skills needs inventory to identify priority 
sectors and skills development requirements to be targeted by the levy scheme, and (iii) designing 
new legislation and institutional arrangements to regulate and monitor the industrial training levy 
scheme based on international best practice and including identification of staffing and resource 
requirements for an IT-based administration system.  This sub-component will also assess the 
feasibility of merging the existing Industrial Training Levy and Catering and Tourism 
Development Levy under one umbrella scheme. 
 
Subcomponent C  – Global Business School Network: Improving opportunities and training for 
Entrepreneurs and MSMEs (IDA US$2.0 million) 
 
The Global Business School Network (GBSN) initiative is designed to strengthen the institutional 
capacity of business schools in developing and transition countries through a non-profit entity 
called Global Business School Network Center. The GBSN Center brings together top global 
business schools with business schools in the emerging markets and creates, for the first time, a 
multilateral approach to managerial capacity building. In Kenya, GBSN Center will be piloting its 
activities with US International University, and will extend its activities to two other business 
schools (i.e., University of Nairobi and one other).   The activities to be implemented at the 
management schools in Kenya are twofold.  First, the development of locally relevant cases and 
their integration into the curriculum so as to have more effective training available for 
entrepreneurs and the owners of MSMEs.  Second creating a business plan competition (which 
will likely be based at a local business school) built upon models of business plan 
competitions/entrepreneur mentoring and social venture funds that encourage innovative business 
models.  There will be two “windows” of activity – the first window would be the annual 
business plan competition.  The process of the competition would provide potential entrepreneurs 
with screening, training, and mentoring throughout; Under the second window, an innovation 
fund will operate as a “social venture fund” that promotes new and innovative approaches to 
b
usiness services for small and medium sized enter
p
rises.  Ideas can be 
g
enerated from both non-
Page  5
 
 
profit and for-profit organizations.  It will be modeled on Development Marketplace and used to 
expose innovative approaches to nurturing growth of the private sector. 
 
Component Three – Improving the Investment Climate 
This component will contribute to the overall improvement of the business environment in 
Kenya.  Specifically, it will reduce cost of compliance with business regulations for formal sector 
and create incentives for informal MSMEs to graduate to higher levels of formality, to facilitate 
their access to resources for growth.  This component will assist the Government in simplifying 
the taxation regime and reducing the cost of business registration through a one-stop shop with 
improved procedures for business inspections and licensing.
 
 
 
Subcomponent A – Reducing the Cost of Business Registration through Pilot One-stop Shop (IDA 
US$2 mm)
  
 
This subcomponent will address the issue of complex and cumbersome start-up and operating 
costs regarding registration and inspections.  This project proposes to assist in streamlining the 
business start up process initiated by the single business permit program by combining the 
following steps into one – registration of business name from the Attorney General, receiving a 
Kenya Revenue Authority PIN, and receiving the local authorities’ permits and licenses 
(including the single business permit).  A one-stop shop approach will be piloted at a few 
municipal offices (Nairobi and 2-3 other pilot sites).  This process will test the approach of 
simplifying the burden of becoming formalized and obtaining all the necessary documentation for 
legal business operations.  This subcomponent will also strive to introduce, enforce, and 
communicate clear procedures for inspections and accountability for inspecting agencies at the 
local level, and thus reduce the unpredictability and high business costs of inspections. 
 
Subcomponent B – Simplified Flat Tax for Microenterprises (IDA US$1 mm)
 
Existing tax and accounting requirements in Kenya are the same for small businesses and for 
larger ones. Small businesses have neither appropriate in-house skills to follow these 
requirements nor resources to our-source this work. A simplified flat tax regime, which proved to 
be quite a successful vehicle for the SME growth in the ECA countries, would be one of the 
incentives for unregistered businesses to move to the formal sector of economy.  This component 
will finance a consultant to  the right approach for such a regime – eligibility criteria, appropriate 
rates, collection and administration mechanisms.  The project will also train Kenya Revenue 
Authority officials and an information campaign for targeted businesses.
