B.  Project Objectives 
[from section 2 of PCN]
The overall development objectives of the LVEMP 
--
 carried out under a Joint Project 
Agreement, dated September 10, 1996, covering Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda 
--
 are to: 
(a)
maximize the sustainable benefits to riparian communities form using resources 
withi
n the basin to generate food, employment and income, supply safe water, and 
sustain a disease
-
free environment; and 
(b)
conserve biodiversity and genetic resources for the benefit of the riparian 
countries in particular and the global community in general.
Th
e project is the first phase of a longer term program whose aims are as outlined above.  The 
objectives of the first phase are to provide the necessary information to improve management of 
the lake ecosystem, establish mechanisms for cooperative management
 by the three countries, 
identify and demonstrate practical, self
-
sustaining remedies, while simultaneously building 
capacity for ecosystem management.

C.  Project Description 
[from section 3 of PCN]
The activities supported by this Supplemental Finance 
will be continuation of specific pilot
-
level 
activities in the Lake and its catchment and baseline data collection.  The largest cost items to be 
funded by the Supplemental would include:
Fisheries Research: 
Rapid assessment of satellite lakes, monitoring 
and mapping of main lake, 
information dissemination, publishing of two regional books on fisheries and biodiversity, and 
updating fisheries data base;
Fisheries Management:
 Reducing illegal fishing practices, 
disseminate aquaculture technology 
to farmers, 
data processing and analysis of lake
-
wide frame survey, reducing post
-
harvest losses, 
harmonize fish inspection, quality assurance and certification among Partner countries, and 
operationalize the Fisheries Development Fund;
Water Hyacinth Control:
 Continu
ed rearing and release of weevils, preparing a joint plan with 
Kenya and Uganda for technical assistance to Rwanda and Burundi (with the expectation that a 
reduction of hyacinth infestations in the upstream countries would reduce the inflow of the weed 
via
 the Kagera river), research on weevil performance in rivers, continued information 
dissemination;
Water Quality and Ecosystem Management:
 Translate research findings into management 
actions, continue water quality monitoring;
Wetlands Management:
 Continue
 with the rehabilitation of degraded wetlands, support socio
-
economic conservation activities, disseminate research findings, develop management plans;
Intergrated Soil and Water Conservation:
 Update data base on agrochemicals, train extension 
staff, disse
minate information, continue on
-
farm demonstration of various effective technologies, 
conduct farmer study tours, support women’s groups to adopt more efficient wood burning 
stoves;
Catchment Afforestation:
 Complete activities in and around Magana village 
forest, manage two 
additional forest reserves, raise and plant an additional 1,000,000 trees in central and 
community
-
based nurseries, train farmers to develop local seed sources;
Support to Riparian Universities:
  Procurement of textbooks, chemicals and o
ffice supplies; 
training incl. field trips, rehabilitation of aquatic science laboratory and establishment of field 
station in Mwanza;
Micro projects:
 Completion of four projects, making full use of created assets in some 
underutilized ones, build local ca
pacity, and orient existing micro projects toward conservation 
of Lake Victoria (through tree planting, soil conservation, and energy saving stoves);
Community Participation:
 Publish strategy, create further awareness and capacity; and
Page  3
National/Regional Se
cretariat:
 Organize or participate in Project Implementation Committee 
Meetings, attend regional workshops, harmonize regional work, legislation, etc., support 
Regional Policy Steering Committee meetings, develop data bases, disseminate information, 
assist
 all components with procurement.
D.  Project location (if known)
The Project is located in the Tanzanian part of Lake Victoria and its watershed.

Overall, the project 
is intended and designed to have beneficial environmental 
effects.  However, adverse effects are possible from some activities (e.g. from 
certain methods of water hyacinth and pollution control) and an environmental 
management strategy is considered pruden
