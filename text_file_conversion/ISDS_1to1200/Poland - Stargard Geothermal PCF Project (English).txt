2. Project Objectives 
The reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide through displacement of coal-fired heat with 
heat produced from renewable geothermal energy for the District Heating System of the City 
of Stargard Szczecinski. 
 
3. Project Description 
The Project has established a geothermal base-load heating plant with an installed capacity of 
about 8 MWt, to be expanded to 14 MWt during 2005, opposite the site of the coal fired heat 
plant of the District Heating Company PEC Stargard.  The Project includes two new wells 
(production and re-injection well) drilled near the existing district heat plant to a depth of 
about 2,700 meters (“Below-ground plant”) and the above-ground connections to the existing 
district heating system.  “Above-ground plant” components include a new building which 
houses heat exchangers, electrical equipment and installations, process equipment and 
controls and the piping connection to the existing district heating network of Stargard.  Total 
project investment costs amount to US$11.7 million. Geothermal heat is used to displace 
some of the heat previously provided by Stargard’s existing coal-fired boilers.
 
The Project 
was financed, and is operated and managed by GEOTERMIA Stargard sp. zoo. (GP). 
 
4. Project Location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard 
analysis 
Stargard Szczeci
ski (Stargard), the third largest city in the new West Pomeranian 
Wojewodship, and capital of the new Powiat of Stargard, with a population of almost 75 
thousand people, is located 36 km from Szczecin and about 180 km from Berlin. Stargard 
Page  2
and Szczecin together form the agricultural and industrial centres of Western Pomerania and 
are important rail and road communication nodes. Primary economic activity in these cities 
includes food, clothing, electric machinery, construction and tourism industries. 
Unemployment has risen to about 22% in recent years. Heat sales from the district heating 
company are about 67% to housing cooperatives, 25% to institutional buildings and the 
remainder to individual houses.

II.  Key Safeguard Policy Issues and Their Management 
A. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues 
1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify 
and describe any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts: 
The main risks ex ante for environmental damage and impacts were as follows: 
·
Risk of damaging soil and road surfaces during construction works; 
·
Risk of intrusion of geothermal water into the surface or deeper layers of the ground 
during well drilling; 
·
Risk of contamination of ground water during well drilling; 
·
Risk of damaging impact on the surface of the liquid waste generated by the process 
of washing out the cuttings during drilling; 
·
Risk of de-stabilization of geological formations caused by well drilling; 
·
Risk of causing damage to environmentally sensitive areas on the ground; 
These risks were minimized through appropriate mitigation measures as per EMP of 2002, 
prepared in close cooperation between the Geotermia Stargard Staff and a visiting World 
Bank team, and updated in June 2004. 
Construction is now complete (except for the surface re-injection pump) and the system has 
started operations on March 29, 2005. 
There are several identified environmental impacts during the operation phase: 
·
Impact on the Ina river of geothermal water discharged from the reservoir;  
·
Potential impact on the ground water of geothermal water stored in the reservoir as a 
result of unexpected leakage; 
Page  3
·
Noise generated in the surface plant around the DH pumps. 
These impacts are minimized through agreed measures as follows:  
·
Discharged brines will be diluted with cleaned municipal sewage waters; 
·
Ground water contamination to be monitored to allow timely counter measures; 
·
Noise abatement below 70 dB will be sufficient in the industrial area location.  
·
The updated EMP (June 2005) reflects additional requirements for operations of the plant 
(discharge permit limits the amount of geothermal brine to no more than 172 m³/d, and 
obligates GS to dilute brine with cleaned sewage from municipality treatment plan). 
 
2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities 
in the project area: 
N.A. 
 
3. Describe any project alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize 
adverse impacts. 
Project is the best Alternative from environmental point of view. Otherwise continuation of 
full heat production from existing coal-fired heating plant with concomitant higher air 
pollution (global and local).   
 
4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an 
assessment of borrower capacity to plan and implement the measures described. 
Construction is complete (except for the installation of the surface re-injection pump), and 
followed earlier EMP. For operations, agreed mitigation measures are as follows: 
·
Discharged brines will be diluted with cleaned municipal sewage waters coming from 
the nearby municipal sewage treatment plant; 
·
Ground water contamination to be monitored to allow timely counter measures; 
·
Noise abatement below 70 dB will be adequate in the industrial area location.  
For public consultations see section below. 
 
5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure 
on safeguard policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people. 
Regarding public consultation, representatives of appropriate groups of people have been 
invited to participate in both administration procedures: for the “construction permit” and the 
“water permits” (see section above). Especially those few local residents (the Project is 
located in an industrial area) potentially affected by the project in any significant way have 
been invited. There was no interest, however, therefore a public meeting was not held. While 
the construction phase is now completed, consultations at this stage of the Project are deemed 
unnecessary. However, for better familiarization with the Project and its significant benefits, 
local residents and appropriate local authorities will be invited prior to the construction of a 
planned “Geothermal Business Development and Dissemination Center”. The President of 
Geotermia Stargard has designated in early  2005 a qualified employee who is responsible for 
day-to-day collection of environmental data. The employee is trained in the environmental 
requirements of the Plant operations in conformity with Polish Environmental Law.
