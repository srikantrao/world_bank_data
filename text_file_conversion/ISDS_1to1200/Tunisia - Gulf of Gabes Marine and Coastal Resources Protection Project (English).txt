Section II - Key Safeguard Issues and Their Management
D. Summary of Key Safeguard Issues. Please fill in all relevant questions. If information is not available,
describe steps to be taken to obtain necessary data.

II.D.1a. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the proposed project. Identify and describe
any potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.


 This project is composed of mainly of studies, technical assistance activities and purchasing of small
 equipment items. A few small scale physical structures will be constructed to assist in the biodiversity
 protection at the three priority sites chosen for implementation of the management plans. The proposed
 physical structures consist of: (i) a visitor reception building for the Gulf of Bou Ghrara area, (ii)
 observation platforms for the Kneiss Islands area, and (iii) anti-trawling structures and/or artificial reef
 structures at the perimeter of the sea grass pilot area to be located near the Kerkennah Islands.
 Environmental mitigation measures will be incorporated into choice for the final site locations and final
 designs for these physical structures. In addition complementary mitigation measures structures will be
 detailed during the preparation of the biodiversity management plans for each pilot area to ensure minimal
 environmental impacts.

II.D.1b. Describe any potential cumulative impacts due to application of more than one safeguard policy or
due to multiple project component.

     Although the direct impacts of project activities are minimal, the key external threats and impacts to
    biodiversity have also been carefully taken into account in the design of the project. In particular, the
    impacts of industrial and urban water effluents on biodiversity have been reviewed during the site
    selection process for the 6 pilot areas for which biodiversity management plans will be prepared.
    Based on the existing information, the indirect impacts to the 6 biodiversity sites from degraded water
    quality generally in the Gulf of Gabès (due primarily to industrial and urban effluents) is also
    considered to be minimal. The proposed biodiversity pilot sites are over 30-40 km distance from a
    major effluent source at the phospho-gypsum plant at Gabès.

    Furthermore during the project implementation, the phospho-gypsum plant at Gabès is scheduled for a
    full renovation of its production process that will eliminate industrial liquid effluents into the Gulf of
    Gabès. Secondly two major urban wastewater plants are becoming operational on Djerba Island which
    will greatly reduce the existing urban effluent impacts in the Gulf of Bou Ghrara. The project also
    includes mitigation measures in Component 2 that will monitor that water quality threats to biodiversity
    so that indicators are identified and mid- and long-term trends in water quality impacts are established.


II.D.1c Describe any potential long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.

The biodiversity protection measures to be developed for management plans may have the potential for long
term restrictions of access to the pilot areas. As this issue may arise during Project implementation, the
management plans are developed through participatory mechanisms. Any potential restrictions of access
will be resolved through use of the Policy Framework that has been prepared by the Government in
accordance with the Bank's Operational Policy (OP) 4.12.

II.D.2. In light of 1, describe the proposed treatment of alternatives (if required)
n/a

II.D.3. Describe arrangement for the borrower to address safeguard issues
 OP 4.01:     The Government has prepared an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), which has been
 disclosed to the public in Tunisia and at the Bank InfoShop in Washington D.C.

 OP 4.12:     The Government has prepared a Process Framework, which has been disclosed to the public
 in Tunisia and at the Bank InfoShop in Washington D.C. The Process Framework addresses the potential
 restriction of access to resources, although the potential affect on livelihoods has not been determined, and
 will not be ascertained once the management plans are prepared during implementation.

 OPN 11.03:      At present, no issues have been identified. During implementation, "chance find"
 procedures will be carried out, and project staff as well as Bank supervision missions will ensure that
 there is compliance with this policy during preparation of the management plans.

II.D.4. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanisms for consultation and disclosure on safeguard
policies, with an emphasis on potentially affected people.

The initial studies identified as key stakeholders those whose sources of income are from tourism, fisheries

(i.e.traditional as well as commercial fishing), artisanal industries, and other local industries. Participation
is seen as one of the essential building blocks to ensure the protection of degraded biodiversity resources,
and balance the interests of long-term biodiversity conservation with other investments in the national
interest. Initial steps towards the formulation of a participatory strategy are based on two key concepts: (a)
that the stakeholders must understand the Project objectives and social development outcomes and in order
to take an active part in the decision-making process, and; (b) that their ideas, approaches and solutions
must be taken seriously and incorporated into the design of the Project, and in particular into the design of
managment plans.

While there are institutional and technical measures proposed by the Project, these must be validated and
tailored to the specific social realities of each of the pilot sites jointly with the stakeholders. With this
approach, no management plans or other measures will be implemented without the appropriate
consultation and participation of the key stakeholders. The target populations will participate to: (i) act as
sources of up to date information on the local conditions (fishing, production, etc.) which will also serve as
an initial mechanism of raising awareness about threats to biodiversity; (ii) react to proposals for
management in order to learn what measures the population is willing to enact towards a responsible and
sustainable management of the biodiversity resources; (iii) jointly formulate the final agreed mechanisms
necessary to ensure protection of ecosystem biodiversity. Included in the participation will be measures to
address possible temporary restriction to resources used by the population for their livelihood so that the
future benefits (gains) made will be measurable in economic terms and beneficial to the population.

E. Safeguards Classification (select in SAP). Category is determined by the highest impact in any policy. Or
on basis of cumulative impacts from multiple safeguards. Whenever an individual safeguard policy is
triggered the provisions of that policy apply.

[ ] S1. ­ Significant, cumulative and/or irreversible impacts; or significant technical and institutional risks in
           management of one or more safeguard areas
[X] S2. ­ One or more safeguard policies are triggered, but effects are limited in their impact and are
           technically and institutionally manageable
[ ] S3. ­ No safeguard issues
[ ] SF. ­ Financial intermediary projects, social development funds, community driven development or similar
           projects which require a safeguard framework or programmatic approach to address safeguard
           issues.
