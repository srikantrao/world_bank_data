                           B. Project Development Objective(s)
                           The objective of this component is to improve citizen and government access to county data through
                           open county portal and to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of progress in service delivery and
                           the progress in achieving the twin targets of poverty reduction and shared prosperity, at the county
                           level.
                           C. Project Description
                           The constitution of Kenya 2010 has devolved power and resources to 47 counties. The counties
                           started to operate in July 2013 with the allocation of budgets for the fiscal year 2013/14. Data are
                           now needed on economic activity in each county to ensure that the devolution process supports
                           economic growth. This project aims to (i) estimate the equivalent of GDP by county, which will
                           provide a picture of the economic structure and relative size of the economy in each county (ii) to
                           estimate the economic growth rates for the counties (iii) Measure the impact of devolution on service
                           delivery using data from counties over the period 2010-2015 (iv) measure impacts of devolution at
                           the household and individual level
                           D. Project location and salient physical characteristics relevant to the safeguard
