    Current Project Development Objective
    The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to support sustainable land management practices and increase communities’
    monetary and non-monetary benefits in targeted Project areas which are mainly in erosion prone rural upland areas.

    This PDO is to be achieved through the support of alternative livelihoods and provision of environmental services and
    through sustainable utilization of wood andpasture products in the long term. The Project will particularly focus on
    enhancing the financial, economic, and institutional sustainability of land use and natural resources management, and will
    help build capacities of Albania farmers, community organizations and government institutions to efficiently use EU
    funding.

II. KEY SAFEGUARD POLICY ISSUES AND THEIR MANAGEMENT

 A.     SUMMARY OF KEY SAFEGUARD ISSUES


 1. Describe any safeguard issues and impacts associated with the Restructured project. Identify and describe any
      potential large scale, significant and/or irreversible impacts.
      As expected, the ESP did not have any negative environmental impacts, but rather it helped reverse land and
      watershed degradation through both physical interventions for forest and pasture regeneration and the
      empowerment of rural population and of local and central institutions. The project supported sustainable land use
      practices that help reduce degradation in upland areas, reduce risks to downstream lands and infrastructure, improve
      sustainability of dams and reservoirs, while improving water quality and improve agricultural lands. As the project
            The World Bank                                                                                RESTRUCTURING ISDS
            ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES PROJECT ()



       activities impact directly the livelihoods of the local rural communities, there remains the potential for possible
       localized indirect and cumulative impacts of interventions through the grants and any other potential impacts on local
       economies and society. The relatively small negative environmental impacts from construction works were readily
       mitigated.
       All grants were screened using an environmental and social checklist, and all physical activities, such as construction
       of a check dam or a watering point were subject to an EMP for construction works. During site visits no non-
       compliance was noted. The PIU is staffed with an environmental specialist and the original project has an
       Environmental Management Framework document that remains applicable for the restructuring as well.



     2. Describe any potential indirect and/or long term impacts due to anticipated future activities in the project area.
       The overall project helps establish better local management of natural resources and promotes sustainable use of
       these resources. Carbon sequestration activities and payments for environmental services also help promote positive
       environmental impacts in the project area and the country overall.


     3. Describe any potential alternatives (if relevant) considered to help avoid or minimize adverse impacts.

       There are no project alternatives considered in order to minimize adverse impacts.


     4. Describe measures taken by the borrower to address safeguard policy issues. Provide an assessment of borrower
       capacity to plan and implement the measures described.
       The overall project management is carried out by the Ministry of Environment. ARDA administers the grants scheme
       and the screening is carried out by a safeguard specialist. . In addition, the grant program is strictly guided by the
       Grant Operational Manual, where the detailed environmental screening procedure is laid out, in accordance with the
       one developed within the EMF.


     5. Identify the key stakeholders and describe the mechanism for consultation and disclosure on safeguard policies, with
       an emphasis on potentially affected people.
       The project involves a number of institutions and works with a number of levels in country, in particular with the local
       communities. The consultant that has developed the EA and EMF has identified a large group of potential stakeholders
       that included representatives of the institutions, academia, local communities and non-governmental organizations
       that have been included in the two sets of public consultations workshops (on July 31, 2013 and September 26, 2013).
       All works and consultations during project implementation were carried out at the level of the local community.
